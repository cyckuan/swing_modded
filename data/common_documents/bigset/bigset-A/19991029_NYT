DALY MUST RUN TEAM WITH HEAD, NOT HEART
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Until just recently, it might have been a movie
script Robert Daly greenlighted for production at Warner Bros.: A
boy from Brooklyn grows up to make his mark _ not to mention a
personal fortune amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars _ in
the entertainment industry.
</P>
<P>
   In the good times and the better, one true love sustains him. At
62, he finally surrenders himself to it, agreeing to run a Dodgers
team that has fallen on hard times.
</P>
<P>
   Today, of course, everybody recognizes it as the story of Daly's
life.
</P>
<P>
   Daly is such a dyed-in-the-wool Dodger, you could be forgiven
for wondering if his name wasn't plucked out of a barrel in some
promotional drawing of season-ticket holders to pick a person to
run the Dodgers for a year.
</P>
<P>
   You have to admit, the dialogue was kind of corny when Daly
addressed the L.A. media Thursday after being formally introduced
as vice chairman and CEO of the Dodgers. Imagine, a man who for
years steered the movie, TV and music industries being named the
captain of a badly listing luxury liner and cheerfully chirping,
``This is the happiest day of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   The hope here is Thursday wasn't as good as it gets for Daly.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike in the entertainment world he left behind on Oct. 1,
there can be no forcing a formulaic happy ending in sports. Rupert
Murdoch's minions tried to do just that and failed miserably.
</P>
<P>
   It's curious: To live and play in L.A. these days is to show all
the patience of a driver stuck in Friday night traffic. Who has
time when the end of the century is drawing near? In the name of a
quick fix, the Lakers threw money at Phil Jackson, the Dodgers
threw money at Kevin Brown and the Kings threw money at Staples
Center.
</P>
<P>
   And now, Daly is throwing money ($30 million) at the Dodgers
because, well, he really cares. Hey, we wish him well. If nothing
else, it's a welcome plot twist, after the corporate coldness of
the Fox Group, to see the Dodgers delivered into the hands of a
true-blue fan.
</P>
<P>
   We can see why the Dodger faithful might feel much the same
giddiness about Daly running the Dodgers as they once did when the
baseball was placed in Sandy Koufax's hands or the bat in Mike
Piazza's.
</P>
<P>
   There's reason to be optimistic he'll get the job done. To be
smug, even.
</P>
<P>
   As co-chairman at Warner Bros., Daly built a reputation for
massaging stars' egos without getting his hands messy. If he could
appease the Kevin Costners of the reel world, Kevin Brown and his
ilk ought to pose scant problems.
</P>
<P>
   Daly will be a good fit for the Dodgers inasmuch as he will be
happy to leave the spotlight for certain other front-office types
who clearly crave it.
</P>
<P>
   With his business and baseball background, he'll add some
substance to an organization that has lived off ostentation for
years.
</P>
<P>
   When Daly says he's looking forward to working with general
manager Kevin Malone and Tommy Lasorda and maybe even recently
deposed president Bob Graziano, we don't doubt him. He is not
territorial about power.
</P>
<P>
   As Daly noted, ``I've always run a company thinking of it as a
team.''
</P>
<P>
   His partnership at Warner Bros. with Terry Semel was, by all
accounts, better than most marriages. Their collaboration was a key
to the studio's success, with Daly providing blueprints and Semel,
the brick and mortar.
</P>
<P>
   Daly's heart might be in the right place _ Lasorda and Graziano,
after all, are dear friends. But there's such a thing as being too
close to a situation.
</P>
<P>
   At CBS and then at Warner Bros., Daly succeeded by following his
head, not his heart. He ought not forget that.
</P>
<P>
   To turn any passionate interest into your industry is to risk
being swayed by emotion and sentimentality. This is not a
fantasy-league team Daly has taken charge of, but a business. He's
going to have to be careful to separate the fan from the
businessman, a task best left to the heartless.
</P>
<P>
   Or have you not noticed how George Steinbrenner continues to
succeed in New York long after Peter O'Malley bowed out in L.A.?
O'Malley's only mistake was remaining the familial and faithful
owner until the bitter end of the Dodgers' postseason run of
success.
</P>
<P>
   Daly's loyalty to his friends is admirable. But he should
remember this: As the Dodgers' president, Graziano was an
accountant masquerading as a visionary.
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda, too, isn't always what he appears to be. The man Daly
said personifies the Dodgers is the same man who spent 90 minutes
hanging out in the visiting manager's office before a game in
September between the Mets and Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   If he's going to let Lasorda pontificate about how every Dodger
needs to play for the name on the front of his jersey instead of
the name on the back, Daly first ought to gently remind Lasorda
that he, too, is being counted on to represent the club and not
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Daly gushed Thursday about how he's a big fan of Malone and of
manager Davey Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   He's now their boss, first and foremost. We trust he won't
forget it. &QL;

OFFICIALS SENTENCED IN MEDICARE KICKBACK CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN T. DAUNER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OLATHE, Kan. _ Two Johnson County physicians and a former
Baptist Medical Center executive got substantial prison terms and
fines Thursday in a kickback case involving millions of dollars in
Medicare funds.
</P>
<P>
   Robert LaHue, 58, owner of a medical practice that served about
7,000 patients in 200 Kansas and Missouri nursing homes, was
sentenced to five years and 10 months in prison. He also was fined
$75,000 and ordered to pay $142,040 in restitution to the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald LaHue, 52, a former Leawood city councilman, was
sentenced to three years and one month in prison. Ronald LaHue, who
worked in his brother's medical practice, was fined $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Anderson, 59, former Baptist president and chief executive
officer, was sentenced to four years and three months in prison and
fined $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald LaHue and Anderson escaped restitution because the
medical centers that benefited from arrangements with them _
Baptist in Kansas City and Bethany Medical Center in Kansas City,
Kan. _ had earlier paid $17.5 million and $1.2 million respectively
to settle civil bribery lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Robert LaHue was ordered to pay restitution for other hospital
deals in which Ronald LaHue and Anderson were not involved. Those
hospitals were not in the Kansas City area.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys said they would appeal the convictions and the
sentences. U.S. District Judge John W. Lungstrum allowed the
defendants to remain free during their appeals.
</P>
<P>
   In April, a federal jury in Kansas City, Kan., convicted the
three men on charges of conspiracy and of soliciting, paying and
receiving bribes between 1984 and 1995. The jury concluded that the
hospitals paid the men, illegally, in exchange for referring
Medicare patients from the LaHues' nursing home practice to Baptist
and other hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   At trial, the defense claimed the fees were legitimate payments
for services.
</P>
<P>
   In seeking lighter sentences, if not probation, the defendants
told the judge they had acted with the intent to secure better
treatment for the underserved, frail elderly and did not
intentionally violate the law against paying for patient referrals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am extremely proud of my contribution to geriatric
medicine,'' Ronald LaHue told Lungstrum.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives and friends of the defendants packed the courtroom
Thursday, and many of the supporters hoped for lighter sentences.
Their hopes were dashed when Lungstrum told Anderson, the first
defendant to face him, that he would not depart from sentencing
guidelines. After that, many wept.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI Medicare fraud investigation began five years ago and
led to the indictment of Anderson, the LaHues, two other Baptist
executives and two health-care lawyers who represented Baptist.
</P>
<P>
   Lungstrum acquitted the two lawyers, Mark R. Thompson and Ruth
Lehr, at the end of the government's trial evidence. The jury later
acquitted one of the hospital executives, Ronald Keel.
</P>
<P>
   In July, the judge overturned the jury's conviction of Dennis
McClatchey, former chief operating officer at Baptist. The
government has appealed the acquittal of McClatchey, who is now
senior vice president of corporate relations with Health Midwest,
Baptist's owner.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys said they were surprised at the severity of
the sentences, which hinged mainly on the value of the bribes that
Baptist and other hospitals paid for patient referrals.
</P>
<P>
   Lungstrum calculated the value of the bribes that Anderson
authorized Baptist to pay the LaHues at $800,000 to $1.5 million.
The judge calculated the overall value of bribes the LaHues
received, from all hospitals involved, at $2.5 million to $5
million.
</P>
<P>
   The defense had banked heavily on persuading Lungstrum to depart
downward from the federal sentencing guidelines and asked the judge
to place the defendants on probation with orders to perform
community service.
</P>
<P>
   James R. Wyrsch, representing Anderson, argued that the clinic
program set up with the LaHues at Baptist filled a void by offering
superior care to nursing home patients at less cost to Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   The defense attorneys also contended that the arrangements did
not stifle competition and that no patients were denied the choice
of hospitals or harmed in any way.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Tanya Treadway countered that even
assuming the program was as good and beneficial as the defendants
claimed, ``this is not a case where the end justified the means. A
bribe is a bribe is a bribe.''

EDITORIAL: NEW YORK'S YANKEES 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Oct. 29:
</P>
<P>
   New York had been a city of five boroughs for only three years
when in 1901 two businessmen bought a baseball team called the
Baltimore Orioles, moved it and renamed it the New York
Highlanders. In 1913 that team became the Yankees. If it is hard to
imagine a 20th-century history of the city without the Yankees, it
is even harder to imagine a history of the Yankees without a
consolidated city to play in. Since 1901 the franchise, as
Highlanders or Yankees, has played ball in Manhattan, Brooklyn,
Queens and the Bronx. But the team has never played for any one of
those boroughs. Then and now, it plays for all of them, and for
Staten Island and the suburbs too.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball teams are not elected by their fans, and any analogy
between a team's history and that of the city it plays in is bound
to be just that, analogy. But over time the Yankees have managed to
represent nearly every faction of the men, women and children who
have been crowding into the Stadium since it opened in 1923, no
matter how plain or elegant, how native or newly arrived they may
be. There have been powerhouse teams, and teams that could barely
scrape together wins, teams _ like the present one _ of striking
composure and teams that were bent on self-destruction.
</P>
<P>
   When all is said and done, it is impossible to think of another
franchise, in any sport, like this one, with its 25 World Series
victories. That is a nice round figure, one that neatly puts a
number on the pleasure and pride this team has brought the city.
There is nothing, not even money, that says a great city must have
a great team. Money helps, but nearly every player who comes to the
Yankees knows that something larger is at work. That something is
Greater New York.
</P>
<P>
   It would be worth counting all the pitches that have been thrown
by Yankees pitchers this past century, all the balls and strikes
and hits and runs delivered over the years by Yankee batters. But
most of all it would be worth naming all the men who have played in
pinstripes since pinstripes were first worn in 1915. It is often
said that baseball is a game in love with statistics. Statistics
may give the measure of the game, and of the men who play it, but
they do not resonate. Names do. They carry with them all the flavor
of the past, the very scent of youth itself. This city bears the
names of all those Yankees in its memory, and if there were ever a
time to say them all, all over again, it is now.

GOP, DEMOCRATIC LEADERS AGREE TO TONE DOWN U.S. SENATE RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE KRASKE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. _ The heads of Missouri's two major
political parties came to a rare agreement Thursday:
</P>
<P>
   It's time for the torrid U.S. Senate race to cool off.
</P>
<P>
   The chairmen of the state's two major parties called for a
cease-fire, after a week in which Republican Sen. John Ashcroft was
branded a racist and photographs of Democratic Gov. Mel Carnahan in
blackface appeared in state newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft and Carnahan, in the meantime, were scheduled to hook
up via telephone at 10:30 a.m. today. The purpose: to find a way to
elevate the race's tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully we can come to an agreement somewhere that's best
for everybody,'' said GOP spokesman Darryl Duwe. ``I don't want
another year of this, that's for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the new push toward civility, the race's hard edge was
still evident Thursday. Neither side was willing to allow the other
to gain an edge as the more peace-loving.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan's campaign, for instance, let it be known that the
governor initiated the one-on-one conversation with Ashcroft by
placing two calls to the senator Thursday morning. The Democrats
pointed out that Ashcroft took neither call, but he opted for the
10:30 a.m. appointment today.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft's campaign suggested that by publicizing the calls,
Carnahan's move had ``the air of a political stunt.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to speak, you don't...release the fact you've
placed a telephone call,'' Ashcroft spokesman Steve Hilton said.
</P>
<P>
   Countered Carnahan spokesman Roy Temple: ``It seems unusual that
a conversation that could be brief...would require 26 hours to
prepare for.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the news that the leaders of both parties had exchanged
letters expressing a desire for more positive campaigning was seen
as a hopeful sign, especially after one of the most blistering
weeks of campaign rhetoric in recent Missouri history.
</P>
<P>
   The incident that sparked the most recent round of political
tit-for-tat was the Senate's Oct. 5 defeat of Missouri Supreme
Court Justice Ronnie White for a seat on the federal bench. White
is the first African-American to sit on the Missouri Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft and his fellow GOP senator from Missouri, Kit Bond, led
the fight. They suggested that White was soft on crime and did not
vigorously enforce the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   White's party-line defeat sparked racially tinged remarks on the
Senate floor. Black groups in Kansas City and St. Louis vowed to
take out their anger on Ashcroft in next year's Senate election.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, two Democratic members of Congress, William Clay of
St. Louis and Maxine Waters of California, blasted Ashcroft and
Bond as ``racists.'' On Sunday, a newspaper photograph of Carnahan
performing in blackface at a 1960 minstrel show surfaced. A 1961
picture of Carnahan in blackface popped up Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   All this came after other high-profile controversies had already
rocked what has become a hyper-accelerated race. In January,
Republicans erupted after Carnahan decided to commute the death
penalty of a convicted killer at Pope John Paul II's request.
</P>
<P>
   Then in September, the two sides clashed after the General
Assembly, in a rare move, overrode Carnahan's veto of a
partial-birth abortion ban.
</P>
<P>
   In her letter, Missouri GOP chairwoman Ann Wagner noted that
``hurtful politics can hurt real people.''
</P>
<P>
   Addressing her Democratic counterpart, Joe Carmichael, Wagner
said, ``I'm confident you agree with me that hurtful politics _
like playing the race card and impugning the integrity of good
people without evidence _ do nothing to elevate the debate.''
</P>
<P>
   She then expressed a desire to move on and ``create a positive
political climate in Missouri _ one filled with a vigorous and
honest debate about the issues people care about.''
</P>
<P>
   In his letter, Carmichael said it was time to move the Senate
race ``out of the gutter where it currently resides.'' Missourians,
he said, ``are entitled to a higher level of civility and
decency.''
</P>
<P>
   He proposed six steps the campaigns could take to ensure a
cleaner discourse. Among them: ask the League of Women Voters to
watch over the race and issue judgments on attacks that stray from
a campaign of ``ideas and facts''; demand that the candidates
themselves _ not party representatives _ make accusations; and
issue a joint statement urging that independent groups that can buy
their own television advertising stay away.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides said they are willing to sit down and negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign pacts are not unprecedented. The 1996 Massachusetts
Senate race also featured a sitting governor, Republican William
Weld, challenging a sitting senator, Democrat John Kerry. The two
agreed to a $6.9 million spending cap before the race, and each
participated in several highly acclaimed debates.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement later broke down amid charges that one or the
other violated the spending lid. But some observers said the pact
still boosted the debates' general course.  &LR; tag1:To reach Steve

FFA TOASTS `NEW BEGINNING' AT LOUISVILLE CONVENTION OPENING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By OSCAR AVILA  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Leaders of the National FFA Organization on
Thursday opened the first convention outside Kansas City in 71
years with a spirited call to enjoy the group's ``new beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 17,000 shrieking blue-coated students packed Freedom
Hall, showcasing the arena that helped this Ohio River city wrest
the convention away in a bitter battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a part of history today,'' said FFA president Lisa
Ahrens of Osage, Iowa. ``Maybe someday you will tell your children
or grandchildren that you were part of this historic event.''
</P>
<P>
   FFA leaders moved the convention to Louisville citing the
inability of Bartle Hall and Municipal Auditorium to handle the
group's growth.
</P>
<P>
   The FFA, formerly the Future Farmers of America, is expecting a
record turnout of more than 50,000 students, advisers and staffers.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City leaders saw the move as a civic wakeup call while
Louisville hailed the switch as its biggest convention coup ever.
</P>
<P>
   But both sides agreed that Louisville boasted top-notch meeting
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   As students have trickled into Louisville this week, they have
found a convention site far different than Kansas City's urban
compound.
</P>
<P>
   The Kentucky Fair and Exposition Center contains more than
19,000 parking spaces in a self-contained campus. Students have the
green space to throw footballs and eat picnic lunches beside flower
gardens.
</P>
<P>
   Food carts lined a landscaped circle drive, peddling pizza, pork
chops, ice cream, catfish sandwiches and other dishes.
</P>
<P>
   Freedom Hall, which is connected to the Exposition Center, is
about twice the size of Kansas City's Municipal Auditorium. The
complex contains about 1 million square feet, allowing nearly all
the events to take place under one roof.
</P>
<P>
   Students agreed that the facilities were spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Vernon Schweer of Randolph, Kan., and his students
would have to watch the opening session on closed-circuit
television because Municipal Auditorium was too small.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're sad they were forced to move it, but at least we feel a
little more involved here,'' he said. ``This is quite a setup.''
</P>
<P>
   Some students instinctively arrived for the morning sessions
early so they could save seats for classmates.
</P>
<P>
   No need. Freedom Hall was large enough to handle all the
students in two sessions, with even a few empty seats scattered
throughout.
</P>
<P>
   Convention organizers didn't have exact counts, but Missouri and
Kansas appeared well-represented with chapters from all over both
states.
</P>
<P>
   Before the convention, nearly every chapter planned to attend,
although some were forced to pare the size of the delegations.
</P>
<P>
   At the career show, the Kansas association's booth drew plenty
of curious visitors. Planners created a ``Wizard of Oz'' motif
complete with mannequins of Dorothy, the Scarecrow and the Tin Man.
</P>
<P>
   The Agribusiness Careers and Leadership Academy in Kansas City,
formerly East High School, also made an impression with its Ag
Career Bus.
</P>
<P>
   The bus is painted like a cow _ white with black spots. The
inside is filled with animal models, a tarantula and scientific
experiments.
</P>
<P>
   Those who attended the opening sessions heard actor Danny Glover
deliver a keynote speech that recalled his family's agricultural
roots.
</P>
<P>
   Glover, star of ``The Color Purple'' and the ``Lethal Weapon''
series, said he visited his grandparents' farm in Mississippi as a
teen-ager. He said he'd never forget their commitment to farming
the land.
</P>
<P>
   Glover and his siblings often joined them in the fields, picking
cotton, gathering watermelons and feeding the hogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That experience gave me something that I will never forget in
my life,'' Glover said as flash bulbs popped in the arena. ``The
reason I'm in front of you today is because of some of those values
I learned there.''
</P>
<P>
   The convention continues today with a speech by former
presidential candidate Elizabeth Dole, an awards pageant and a
concert.
</P>
<P>
   After the opening sessions, FFA students said they were still
getting used to a convention without barbecue, steaks and the
American Royal.
</P>
<P>
   With the convention only a day old, groups still were getting
lost and quizzing colleagues about restaurant tips.
</P>
<P>
   And while Louisville's convention center is spacious, some
students blamed it for their feeling of isolation. The center is
about 10 minutes south of downtown with few nearby amenities.
</P>
<P>
   The downtown streets were largely free of the herds of
blue-coated students so familiar to Kansas City. The largest
downtown crowd on Thursday afternoon appeared to be underneath an
oversized bat at the Louisville Slugger Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds also gathered on Thursday at Churchill Downs, touring
the home of the Kentucky Derby, viewing the horseshoe-shaped
winners circle and posing for pictures beside a statue of
Aristides, the first Derby winner.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the first convention day featured the usual buzz of FFA
students, capped by the traditional indoor laser show.
</P>
<P>
   Several students said they were a bit uncertain and disoriented
but still thrilled to experience a new start in Louisville.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today is a great way to kick off the week,'' said Justin
Tedford of Fort Lupton, Colo. ``We've got a lot of people inspired
and the energy level is amazing. Being in a new place makes it that
much more exciting.''

CONSUMPTION-BASED TAX PROPOSAL SHOWS PROMISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tax reform may not be a hot-button issue going into the election
season, but that doesn't mean dedicated reformers aren't out there
pitching.
</P>
<P>
   With Uncle Sam's tax take at historically high levels, it's too
bad there aren't more groups such as Americans for Fair Taxation,
which is beating the drum these days for a consumption-based
concept it calls the FairTax.
</P>
<P>
   There have been several tax-reform initiatives floated under the
broad ``fair tax'' rubric in recent years, but what distinguished
the Americans for Fair Taxation brochure sent along by a valued
contributor was the lineup of economists lending their names and
reputations to the organization's research efforts.
</P>
<P>
   They included, among others, Steve Moore of Cato Institute, Bill
Beach of the Heritage Foundation, Dale Jorgenson of Harvard, Larry
Kotlikoff of Boston University and Joseph Kahn of Stanford. This is
impressive company, to say the least.
</P>
<P>
   This particular ``fair tax,'' which the group says has been
introduced in Congress, calls for a 23 percent sales tax on the
domestic purchase of new goods and services. This may sound rather
steep, but its advocates say it's fashioned in a way that makes it
a better deal than the current tax structure.
</P>
<P>
   It would replace the federal income tax; Social Security and
Medicare payroll taxes; corporate and self-employment taxes; and
estate, gift and capital gains taxes. Moreover, the proposal's
architects have included provisions to ensure it won't be levied on
necessities such as food and medicine and to prevent it from
creating the heaviest relative burden for low-income consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The real grabber is a proposed constitutional amendment that
would make income taxation illegal. This is the key to any effort
to move from an income-based tax system to one based on consumption
taxes. Without constitutional protection, it would be only a matter
of time until Washington proclaimed the sales tax inadequate and
reinstituted income taxes to enhance revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Since the income tax system has become impossibly complex, the
appeal of the national sales tax option has grown accordingly.
Equally appealing is how scrapping the income tax system would end
the political practice of using tax code legislation as a lever to
raise campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of complexity and abuse potential, the sales tax is a
breath of fresh air compared with the existing income tax miasma.
The FairTax would be collected by retailers, who would get a fee
for their efforts. Individuals would never again have to worry
about fiddling with federal income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Also, individuals could control to some degree the amount of
taxes they pay. The less you consume, the less in taxes you pay.
</P>
<P>
   Last but not least, there is the privacy angle. Without the
comprehensive records kept by the Internal Revenue Service on all
taxpayers, Americans would be able to enjoy much more privacy than
is currently the case.
</P>
<P>
   All pluses considered, it becomes all the more amazing that tax
reform of this sort has lost so much of its political punch lately.
</P>
<P>
   If you're interested in more FairTax background, the Web site
www.fairtax.org is a humdinger.

`B' FILMMAKER ROGER CORMAN TAPS OUR UNCONSCIOUS DESIRE TO BE SCARED
OUT OF OUR
 SKIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service
 clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
Watching Roger Corman's horror and science-fiction films, the bulk
of which can charitably be described as ``cheesy,'' one may get the
idea that making them was a cinch.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just tape some aluminum foil over a Frisbee, toss it, film it,
then cut to a shot of a woman with heaving, overflowing cleavage
screaming, and you've got a scary flying-saucer scene, right?
</P>
<P>
   Wrong. Well, sort of. All that may be true, but there was always
method to Corman's movie madness. He may be king of the B movie,
but Corman _ educated at Stanford and Oxford _ has always brought a
keen intelligence to his delightfully schlocky work.
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it, the guy knows horror, as anyone who has seen The
Pit and the Pendulum or The Tomb of Ligeia can tell you. It's not
the only genre he's worked in, but it may be his favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep coming back to horror and science fiction,'' Corman
said this month. ``There's probably something in my unconscious _
I'd say there's undoubtedly something in my un conscious _ that
brings me back to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Corman believes there's something in all of our
unconscious minds that makes us love getting the pants (or blouse,
in the case of Corman's movies) scared off us.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling is that . . . it goes back to early childhood,''
Corman said of horror. ``The small kid says to his mother, `There
are monsters under the bed.' And she says, `There's no monsters
under the bed.' But he knows there are.
</P>
<P>
   ``And when he gets a little bit older, he realizes in his
conscious mind that he was wrong, there are no monsters under the
bed. But his unconscious mind retains those early-childhood fears.
I think the task of the film maker or a writer or anyone else
working in the horror genre is to break through the defenses of the
conscious mind and strike directly at the fears of the
unconscious.''
</P>
<P>
   Pretty erudite stuff for the guy who once supposedly told Martin
Scor sese, ``Remember, Marty, you must have some nudity at least
every 15 pages (of a script).'' But whatever works, Corman's
willing to try.
</P>
<P>
   Corman is hosting American Movie Classics' Monsterfest, a
marathon of monster movies that will run through Halloween weekend.
In ad dition, he produced and stars in a 35-part horror-comedy
serial called The Phantom Eye. (A full-length version will be shown
at 9 p.m. Oct. 31.)
</P>
<P>
   Corman plays Roger Gorman, the head of AMC's horror-film vault.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since their headquarters is in New York, I've got these
not-too-bright (New York University) film-school interns working
for me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The story finds him sending the interns into the vault to fetch
horror films. As they open doors, they actually enter horror
movies. If the monster in the movie kills them, they die for real.
And if they can't find the missing film by midnight, they'll be
trapped in the films forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``To show they're not too bright, I send them back in for the
next monster film,'' Corman said, ``and they go back.''
</P>
<P>
   Ha. Interns.
</P>
<P>
   Corman made his directing debut in 1954 with The Monster From
the Ocean Floor. Since then, he's di rected more than 50 films and
produced hundreds more, almost all of which turned a profit. Some
of the best known include The Pit and the Pendulum, It Conquered
the World and Little Shop of Horrors (the original).
</P>
<P>
   But mostly, Corman is famous for a couple of things _ making the
most of small budgets and launching the careers of some of the
biggest names in the industry, including Jack Nich olson, Francis
Ford Coppola, Jim Cameron, Ron Howard and Scor sese.
</P>
<P>
   What's his secret for finding talent?
</P>
<P>
   ``One, every one of them is intel ligent _ I have never met a
suc cessful writer, producer or director who was successful over a
period of time who wasn't intelligent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The second thing is they all are capable and willing and eager
to work hard. Low-budget filmmaking is very hard. You have to work
long, difficult hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``The third thing is where it's more of a guess, or I'd say an
informed guess. They're intelligent, they're hard-working, and they
have that spark of creativity. That's the most difficult to
guess.''
</P>
<P>
   He's guessed right an awful lot.
</P>
<P>
   As for his legendary stretching of a dollar _ watch his series
of Edgar Allen Poe movies with Vincent Price from the '60s if you
want proof that he could whip up genuine scares on a small budget _
Corman said that the lack of money can make him more inventive.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can solve your problem just by throwing money at it, or
you can solve the problem creatively,'' he said. ``In solving it
creatively, there is more creative satisfaction.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a secret still valid today, as a certain
cult-hit-gone-wild proves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did it one way with the Poe pictures,'' he said. ``They did
it a different way with The Blair Witch Project. I think each film
benefited.''
</P>
<P>
   Corman also has a wicked sense for seizing upon what's popular
at the moment. Shortly after Jaws became a phenomenon, he made
Piranha (written by a young writer named John Sayles). When
Jurassic Park hit big, he came out with Carnosaur.
</P>
<P>
   He's currently filming The Doorway in Ireland. Four New England
col lege students (Ireland doubles as New England, only it's
cheaper) are offered free room and board for a year if they will
live in an old house outside town and restore it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They take the job,'' Corman said, ``and needless to say, many
things happen in that house.''
</P>
<P>
   Scary things, no doubt. All the better for our collective mental
health.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is a catharsis,'' Corman said of the chills that
horror movies give us. ``It is, to a certain extent, a cheap
session with a psychiatrist. The psychiatrist is trying to help you
remove the irrational fears of your unconscious mind, and he may or
may not succeed. But a well-made horror film, for $5 instead of
$100 or $200 or whatever the price is for a psychiatrist, will
accomplish the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might not help,'' he said, laughing, ``but who knows? It
may.''
</P>
<P>
   The guy is without question (in his own way) a cinematic genius.
So if a couple of viewings or The Wasp Woman or Attack of the Crab
Monsters make you feel better, who can argue? &QL;

ENGINEER CAUSED FATAL CRASH, REPORT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. CRONKLETON  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOPEKA, Kan. _ An engineer who probably fell asleep caused a
fatal collision between two Union Pacific trains near Topeka in
July 1997, federal investigators have determined.
</P>
<P>
   Officials also blamed the conductor, who left the engineer alone
for 20 minutes before the crash, and the railroad for not having an
effective fatigue-awareness program.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Davis, a Union Pacific spokesman, said Thursday that the
railroad brought in consultants and completely revamped its program
after the accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, that was a tragic time,'' he said. ``We had three
fatal accidents in a three-month period.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven persons died in those accidents in Devine, Texas; near
Topeka; and in Fort Worth, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Those accidents, Davis said, came in a year when the railroad's
overall safety record had improved.
</P>
<P>
   In safety recommendations released this month, the National
Transportation Safety Board determined that the engineer probably
fell asleep after his train entered a long siding to let the other
pass.
</P>
<P>
   The two trains, carrying small amounts of hazardous materials,
collided at 2:15 a.m. July 2, 1997, a few miles north of Rossville,
Kan., about 15 miles northwest of Topeka.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities evacuated about 1,000 residents of Rossville.
</P>
<P>
   The engineer of one of the trains, Michael E. Brown, 46, of
Lenexa, was killed in the crash. Brown, according to the report, is
the one believed to have fallen asleep.
</P>
<P>
   His conductor, Everett L. Starling of Topeka, received minor
injuries. The two crew members on the other train were not hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Brown's widow nor Starling could be reached for comment
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Brown had been awake continuously for 18 hours at the time of
the accident. The safety board determined that the continuous hours
without sleep together with the time of his work shift probably
affected his behavior.
</P>
<P>
   According to the safety board's report:
</P>
<P>
   Brown awoke about 8 a.m. July 1, 1997, and did not nap before
reporting for work at 8:30 p.m. This was his first day back after a
17-day vacation, during which he went to sleep each evening between
9 p.m. and midnight and awoke each morning between 5 a.m. and 7
a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, the safety board concluded, was not prepared to stay
awake all night because he had firmly established a regular
sleep-awake pattern.
</P>
<P>
   Brown was the engineer for a westbound train from Kansas City to
North Platte, Neb., with 85 cars, according to the railroad.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty minutes before the accident, the conductor left the
locomotive's cab. About nine minutes before the collision, Brown's
train entered the long siding.
</P>
<P>
   The other train, eastbound with 42 cars and on its way from
Seattle to Memphis, Tenn., approached at about 70 mph, the
authorized speed, according to the railroad.
</P>
<P>
   When Brown did not dim his train's headlight, the other train's
crew responded by flashing its headlight and trying to contact him
by radio.
</P>
<P>
   Brown ``did not respond at all to repeated radio calls and did
not respond timely to the flashing headlight beam,'' the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He possibly awoke upon hearing the eastbound train's horn
sounding and dimmed his train lights in reaction to meeting an
oncoming train, but was either not sufficiently alert or too
startled or disoriented to realize that he needed to apply the
brakes.''
</P>
<P>
   When Brown's train edged back onto the main line, its lead
locomotive hit the Seattle train six cars back of the engine.
</P>
<P>
   The safety board also found fault with Starling's extended
absence from the cab, saying Starling did not properly perform his
duties and provide the necessary safety oversight.
</P>
<P>
   ``His interaction with the engineer may have provided the
necessary stimulus to keep him awake,'' the report said. ``At the
very least, an alert conductor probably would have detected that
the engineer was suffering from fatigue and could either have
awakened him or taken actions to stop the train.''
</P>
<P>
   The safety board also found that while the railroad has a
fatigue-awareness program, some crew members and family had not
heard of it. The board said this indicates that the program was not
effective.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, the Union Pacific spokesman, said the railroad's revamped
program now complies with the recommendation that the railroad
update its fatigue-awareness program, including documenting which
employees have received the training and annual reviews of the
program.
</P>
<P>
   The safety board also recommended that freight trains be
equipped with devices that use satellites and technology to
automatically or remotely stop a locomotive to prevent accidents, a
system called positive train separation.
</P>
<P>
   On trains without these devices, the safety board recommended
that the railroad install devices that sound alarms periodically
and require the engineer to perform some action to keep the train
moving.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said the railroad has researched and tested the use of
positive train separation systems but has found the technology
needs more development. He said older locomotives do not have
alerters.

YMCA OPENS 92-YEAR-OLD TIME CAPSULE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATT STEARNS  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ An old Bible. A 1907 city directory. A passel
of yellowing, dusty papers. Three Kansas City newspapers, dated
March 16, 1906.
</P>
<P>
   And one seriously funky smell.
</P>
<P>
   Those were the main features of a time capsule opened by YMCA
officials Thursday night at the group's Annual Heritage Club
Dinner, held at the Kansas City Club.
</P>
<P>
   The grimy copper box was found in the cornerstone of the YMCA
building at 10th and Oak streets on Aug. 28 as the building was
being demolished.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just glad something was in there,'' said Gene Dooley,
president and CEO of the YMCA of Greater Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   The items found in the box provided a glimpse into life at the
YMCA and in Kansas City in October 1907, when the capsule was
buried.
</P>
<P>
   Articles on the front pages of the newspapers in the capsule _
the Kansas City Times, the Kansas City Journal and the Kansas City
Post _ included reports on the Russian revolution (``a renewed
outbreak is...imminent''), Oklahoma's impending statehood and a
train wreck in Colorado that killed 50 persons.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the newspapers also reported that the YMCA had raised
$277,119 to finance the building's construction.
</P>
<P>
   Items from the capsule will be publicly displayed after they are
examined by archivists from the University of Missouri-Kansas City,
Dooley said.
</P>
<P>
   But the capsule's opening actually deepened a civic mystery _
the whereabouts of a time capsule planted in 1887 in the
cornerstone of the YMCA building at Ninth and Locust streets.
According to news reports of the time, President Grover Cleveland
officiated at a ceremony where a time capsule was embedded in the
building's cornerstone.
</P>
<P>
   That building was demolished a few years ago _ and no time
capsule was recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Memo to future time-capsule buriers: Include air freshener,
guys; 92 years of must can build up quite a strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure I'll be able to sit at my table,'' laughed
Barbara Pendleton, the group's chairwoman, as she helped remove
items from the capsule before dinner began.

EDITORIAL: THE GORE-BRADLEY DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Oct. 29:
</P>
<P>
   Substance . . .
</P>
<P>
   One main substantive difference emerged from the debate on
Wednesday between Al Gore and Bill Bradley: the question of how
much money the government will have and how to spend it.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, saying the presidency is about ``big solutions to big
problems,'' proposes spending about $75 billion a year on new
health and anti-poverty programs. The money, he says, will come
from the $1 trillion surplus that Congress expects over the next 10
years from federal programs other than Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, proposing smaller initiatives, blasted Bradley's ideas as
excessively costly, certain to exceed the surplus and destined to
``shred the social safety net.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither candidate admitted there may be no $1 trillion surplus
outside of Social Security. That estimate assumes that Congress
will live under existing budget caps and cut most federal programs
by 20 percent or more. Voters deserve to hear what existing
programs the candidates would squeeze out to make room for their
new ideas. On this score, Gore has the easier task because his
programs cost less.
</P>
<P>
   When voters realize the modest size of the surplus outside
Social Security, the candidates will face a probing question.
Sitting in government coffers will be almost $2 trillion in surplus
revenues from Social Security. Both candidates say they will not
spend any of the Social Security revenue on any other federal
program.
</P>
<P>
   But as the campaign progresses, Bradley will have to offer more
details about paying for his ``big ideas,'' and Gore will have to
explain why the public investments he proposed as a candidate in
1992 made more sense then than now.
</P>
<P>
   . . . and Style
</P>
<P>
   As candidates as different as Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton
have demonstrated, communication is an essential part of
campaigning and of governing. From a theatrical standpoint, the
first meeting between Al Gore and Bill Bradley offered a striking
showcase for two candidates who have obviously been working on
their performance skills.
</P>
<P>
   Both seemed to know that in these early matches, winning or
losing is less important than avoiding a crash landing. Gore
probably faced the greater danger on Wednesday night. What if he
had come off stiffer and more humorless than was expected? In fact,
Gore won points with his sometimes self-conscious attempts to be
funny and casual. His plea for a chance to get his hands on the
presidency seemed to flow from some heretofore unrevealed well of
feeling. Even his opening rush to denounce President Clinton's
behavior, while tactically predictable, also had the feel of a
spontaneous venting of long-suppressed frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, a former insurgent faced with showing he can breathe at
the highest altitudes of political competition, displayed some new
skills as well. The ease of his body language may have been based
on muscle memory from the basketball court. But his well-crafted
answers on race, gay rights and leadership were strikingly
different from the droning set speeches of his senatorial years.
</P>
<P>
   The television camera, of course, likes cool rather than hot
performances, and that could spell problems for Gore in the future.
Bradley, for his part, may run into a time limit on his thematic,
detail-free answers. Either way, we think Mayor Edward Rendell of
Philadelphia, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee,
summarized this first debate correctly in saying that it mainly
showed that his party had fielded two formidable political
performers.

FANS QUICK TO LASH OUT AT NBC'S JIM GRAY, WHO WAS JUST DOING HIS
JOB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service
 clients)  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
The biggest mistake NBC reporter Jim Gray made when he interviewed
Pete Rose at the World Series was assuming that a sentimental
public, overwrought with dewy emotion at the ``return'' of Rose to
the scene of a Major League event, cared about the facts.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Few did.
</P>
<P>
   For acting the way a reporter should act _ unswayed by the
profound display of fan affection for Rose before the Oct. 24 game
in Atlanta _ Gray has been browbeaten to the point that he almost
sheepishly apologized for his questioning before Game 3 on Oct. 26.
</P>
<P>
   After 10 years of banishment from baseball, Rose still has
refused to admit that he bet on Major League Baseball games, a
virtually indisput able fact that is evident even to Rose's most
die-hard supporters. Why not take the opportunity to admit it and
perhaps clear the way for his return to the game he loves?
</P>
<P>
   Rose didn't even have to accept the opportunity to come clean.
Having just stepped off the field following a delirious standing
ovation from At lanta fans, he could have asked to discuss it later
in a more appropriate venue.
</P>
<P>
   But, instead, Rose insisted on con tinuing to challenge the
obvious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to admit to some thing that didn't happen,`` he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Like so many other modern athletes, Rose smirks at both the rule
of law and the rules of his game because he knows the rule of fan
adoration trumps all.
</P>
<P>
   Why won't Rose come clean? Be cause Rose knows his rabid support
ers among both fans and players don't care that he brought shame
upon his game. He knows he can throw the facts back into Gray's
face, and his fans will love him all the more for it.
</P>
<P>
   To his everlasting credit, baseball Commissioner Bud Selig
refused to be swayed by the Gray interview controversy. He
reiterated on Oct. 26 that Rose's chance of being rein stated
remains, as before, nil.
</P>
<P>
   If American baseball fans want to idolize a scofflaw who lies to
them, that's their business.
</P>
<P>
   As for Gray, he asked tough ques tions under tough
circumstances. That's his business.
</P>
<P>
   He did his job well. &QL;

GOP HOPEFULS GANG UP ON BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service

 By KRIS MAYES  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
HANOVER, N.H. _ Republican presidential candidates squared off on
Oct. 28 in what was for the most part a civilized debate that
turned tense at the mention of the candidate who wasn't there _
Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Steve Forbes, Gary Bauer, John McCain, Alan Keyes and Orrin
Hatch took questions at a town hall debate, but without the man who
leads the pack by a wide margin.
</P>
<P>
   It was Forbes who drew blood first against Bush, blasting him
for failing to show up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like you, I share thefrustration that Governor Bush is not
here tonight,'' Forbes said. ``He didn't come to debate last week
because he had a fund-raiser. A couple of weeks ago, his plane got
delayed, and he had a choice between going to a fund-raiser and a
school for under privileged kids. He chose the fund-raiser.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush told a television reporter on Oct. 28 that he skipped the
debate because ``I love my wife'' and he wanted to be at her side
when she received an award at Southern Meth odist University.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family is important to me, and I think the people of New
Hampshire will recognize that,'' Bush said in an interview on
WMUR-TV, which was co-sponsoring the debate with CNN.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Laura, was with him.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the debate, McCain made a surprising reference to his
reputation for having a short fuse, saying he intends to put his
anger to use as president.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say that perhaps John Mc Cain gets angry,'' McCain
said. ``My friends, I get angry when we spend $350 million on a
carrier the Navy doesn't want or need . . . And meanwhile, my dear
friends, we have 12,000 enlisted families _ brave young men and
women _ on food stamps.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a disgrace. That's an out rage. I'm going to fix it as
president of the United States, and I promise those men and women
in the military that's my first priority.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the candidates amiably presented their views
on issues ranging from abortion to gun control, revealing few major
fissures between the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The debate's lightest moment came when McCain was hit with a
ques tion about medical marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is an excellent question, which I would prefer to duck,''
McCain said, adding, however, that he op poses the use of marijuana
for medicinal purposes.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who took every chance he got to drill home his position
on reforming the campaign-finance sys tem, also broke with
conservatives in the party by suggesting that there is room for
divergent views on abor tion, the issue that has riven the GOP in
recent elections. &QL; 
Abortion position &QL; 
During a press conference after the debate, McCain said he thought
he was the candidate who could unite the two branches of the party
on abortion.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he believed he could ``bridge'' pro-life and
pro-choice people.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, who was challenged by Gary Bauer about whether his
flat-tax proposals would disproportionately benefit corporations,
defended his plan, evidenced by the fact that most of the GOP
contenders now support some variation of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I ran four years ago, virtu ally every Republican
denounced the idea of a flat tax,'' Forbes said. ``So education
works. Some are slower than others, but they are coming along.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was Forbes' offensive against Bush that provided the
fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued just minutes before the debate, Forbes
lashed out at Bush for being a big-spending Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``George W. Bush should have been here tonight to answer the
tough questions from the people,'' Forbes stated. ``No more
ducking. It's time for him to defend his big-govern ment record.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing Texas newspapers, Forbes accused Bush of being a
spendthrift governor, sponsoring programs that caused spending to
rise by 36 per cent.
</P>
<P>
   After the town hall, Bauer also hammered Bush for not attending.
</P>
<P>
   ``How are we going to deal with a lack of voter participation if
we're going to have a lack of candidate participation,'' Bauer said
during remarks to reporters. ``I certainly hope that he shows up
next time.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Duprey, chairman of the New Hampshire Republican Party, de
fended Bush's absence, saying he has assured party officials that
he will be present at future events.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it were to continue, there is no question that it would
hurt his candidacy, and I think they know that,'' Duprey said. ``He
respects the process.'' &QL; 
`Fair game' &QL; 
Still, Duprey conceded that Bush's absenteeism is ``fair game'' for
Bush's competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were one of the challengers, I think it would be entirely
fair to point out that I cared enough to show up.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain began the day with cam paign events in Nashua, New Hamp
shire, while his aides gathered with reporters to unveil his first
television ad, scheduled to begin airing in the Granite State Oct.
29.
</P>
<P>
   The ad is heavily laced with images of McCain from his days as a
prisoner of war in Vietnam, then his homecoming, and finally as a
senator dealing with armed services issues.
</P>
<P>
   `He was a young Navy pilot who volunteered for duty in Vietnam .
. . and was shot down over Hanoi,'' states an announcer in the ad.
`Lt. Commander John McCain . . . dragged off by an angry mob . . .
When found to be the son and grandson of admirals . . . was offered
early release. He refused.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad then goes on to refer to McCain as the candidate with
`more experience and more courage than anyone.' '' &QL; 
`Ready to Lead' &QL; 
When asked whether the ad, titled ``Ready to Lead,'' was an attempt
to juxtapose McCain's war credentials against Bush's lack of combat
experi ence _ Bush served in the Air National Guard _ the ad's
producer demurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to draw that conclu sion . . .'' said Greg
Stevens, whose firm, Stevens Reed Curcio, produced the spots for
about $30,000. He declined to say how much the McCain campaign
spent overall to air them.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the campaign, McCain officials had said they would not
seek to exploit the candidate's POW status. But according to
Stevens, not enough voters are aware of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe people haven't really seen his story in as
compelling a way as this,'' Stevens said, adding that McCain
``hates this stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He would like it if we never referred to any of this,''
Stevens said. &QL;

NCAA, COACHES STRUGGLE TO MAKE WEB PLAYBOOK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (begin ital)This is the latest in a series about sports media
and the Internet:(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   This time of year, there's enough college football information
circulating on the Internet to choke a Trojan horse.
</P>
<P>
   From the minutiae of message boards to the extensive,
overzealous fan-created sites, the enthusiasm that the game
naturally generates definitely spills over into cyberspace. But
it's a medium that, while loosely regulated, can have an equally
rattling effect on the game.
</P>
<P>
   When Oregon coach Mike Belotti was told that Michigan State
backers scoured the Net and supplied the team with all his plays
before their Sept. 2 opener _ the Ducks lost 27-20 _ he didn't know
what to think. True or not, it has made coaches rethink their
methods and approaches. Many now struggle with decisions about
keeping practices open or closed, issuing game credentials to
reporters from Internet sites and appeasing recruits who might get
misinformed about a school based on a quickly circulated rumor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't been burned this season,'' said USC's Paul Hackett,
who has paid close attention to this issue since his return to the
college ranks. ``I think maybe we're getting used to it, that it's
a fact of life, and now we're trying to make it work in our
favor.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett's predecessor, John Robinson, was once stunned to find
out that after a practice at which players were timed in the
40-yard dash, the results were already up on someone's Web site
within hours. USC sports information director Tim Tessalone recalls
a time when a local TV station received a tip that Robinson was
about to resign after a midweek practice. After spending hours
investigating, Tessalone called the station back and told them the
story wasn't true.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the way, where did you get that tip?'' Tessalone asked.
</P>
<P>
   Off the Internet, he was told.
</P>
<P>
   While once Hackett might have been more combative with Internet
forces, he is more apt to soon do what Texas' Mack Brown and Texas
A&AMP;M's R.J. Slocum had decided to do _ put up their own Web sites,
so their own words go out without any interference.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like a coaches show on the Internet,'' said
Hackett.
</P>
<P>
   USC and UCLA each have areas on the university Web sites for
athletic-department news, but more Net users are apt to find the
Trojans (usctrojans.com) and Bruins (uclabruins.com) information on
their official athletic Web sites maintained by a company called
FansOnly.com. Each school controls the information that goes on to
that site _ mostly with game-related summaries, player features and
releases that are sent out to newspaper, TV and radio outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Another company called Rivals.com has recently launched, not
only as a rival to FansOnly but as a portal more to the
fan-generated online publications that take fact-gathering to a
next step _ particularly with recruiting information. And that's
where things can get tricky.
</P>
<P>
   NCAA rules allow coaches to talk to recruits only once a week
until Dec. 1, after which it's unlimited. In the meantime, however,
reporters who run these Web publications _ as well as mainstream
reporters _ can talk to high school athletes as much as they want.
Because of the Internet access, information from those reporter
circulates quickly and furiously. Within minutes, a fan site can
produce information about which schools the athlete has narrowed
his choices, when he has scheduled visits, when he'll take his SAT
or ACT exams and how his GPA is doing at high school.
</P>
<P>
   All of which seems like a little more info than the average
college football fan needs or should know. But for the college
coaches, it's become a unique end run to information _ an end run
that the NCAA has yet to address with any strict guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we find out eventually that the information (posted on the
sites) is generally accurate,'' said Hackett.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA has general guidelines about the use of computers and
Internet in the recruiting process under the membership-services
section of its own Web site (www.ncaa.org), but ``There isn't much
in the bylaws that address the Net at this point,'' said NCAA
spokesperson Jane Jankowski. ``It's a concern and something we
continue to look at, but a lot has happened since this began and
it's difficult to establish rules as it changes.''
</P>
<P>
   (The only Internet-related bylaw amendment currently proposed is
an attempt to make university Web-site information available to
recruits who cannot afford a computer or Internet access.)
</P>
<P>
   Because he understands the credibility factor of information
published by fan pages, Rivals.com CEO J.C. Heckman Jr. said he has
a six-person team that weeds out the publications that are
eventually included on his site.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're not credible, we don't sign them; that's where we
draw the line,'' said Heckman, who used to publish a tabloid fan
paper called Sports Washington that covered Northwest college
football before his career plummeted and he started the
Seattle-based Net site that relaunched in August with more than 425
unofficial team-sports-site links and could increase to 1,000 as it
adds more pro sports teams.
</P>
<P>
   Heckman's insistence on credibility might come as a result of a
hard lesson he learned during a process that led to the University
of Washington going on probation and coach Don James resigning in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   He was then James' son-in-law, married to his daughter Jeni, as
he reported on the team for his publication. Eventually, he was
also accused of recruiting misconduct because of his relationship
with athletes who eventually went to Washington. The Pac-10
recommended to the school that he be prevented from contact with
the program until 1996, by which time his magazine became buried in
debt when advertisers pulled out and he was later divorced from
Jeni.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling is that the reader of the information needs to
decide what's relevant,'' said Heckman. ``If the content is
original and compelling and the reader finds it interesting, that's
journalism.''
</P>
<P>
   And that, Heckman says, is what will continue to keep Internet
sites dedicated to this niche in business.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a different kind of journalism _ quick hits, smaller
stories, more information in aggregate,'' said Heckman. ``Content
portals like ours will give readers the exact information they're
looking for in a professional way. It's definitely the
communication vehicle for things in common.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WHAT SMOKES
</P>
<P>
   KTLA Channel 5's decision to replace Ross Porter on its 50
Dodgers telecasts next season could be overturned, in part because
of the team's announced change in ownership operation Thursday. A
source confided earlier this week that the switch from Porter to
Rick Monday for next season was done, but Dodgers spokesman Brent
Shyer contends that the team will have the last call on who does TV
games with
</P>
<P>
   Vin Scully and that no official decision has been made for the
2000 season. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In one abbreviated shape or form, there's a great chance
</P>
<P>
   Dick Enberg will return on Angels radio play-by-play as a
highlight of their 40th-anniversary season in 2000. Team vice
president Bob Wagner said there are several options _ home games,
Sunday games, etc. _ to bring back the man whose broadcasting
career with the team went from 1968 to '78. ``He's been
mentioned,'' said Wagner of Enberg, ``and nothing has happened yet,
but we're on a fast track to get this settled no later than
mid-November.'' There is no reason to suspect that Enberg, a San
Diego-area resident whose NBC contract expires at the end of the
year, won't re-sign with the network and work at Wimbledon in late
June and early July plus the 2000 Summer Games in Sydney,
Australia. Enberg told the Los Angeles Times last week that he'd
like to finish his broadcasting career with the Angels, and there
is an opening on the radio side because the team has not renewed
the contract of Brian Barnhart . &QL; 
WHAT CHOKES
</P>
<P>
   We feel equally embarrassed for Eric Karros ' involvement in
Fred Roggin 's postgame abortion of a game show during the World
Series. Karros couldn't scoop out that bad throw no matter how big
a glove he was wearing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NBC's decision that Jim Gray matters. After commissioner
</P>
<P>
   Bud Selig patched up the Yankees-won't-talk-to-Gray riff earlier
Wednesday by pulling NBC Sports chief Dick Ebersol
</P>
<P>
   and Yankees owner George Steinbrenner together to settle it, NBC
sent Gray into the locker room to make the World Series trophy
presentation Wednesday night _ a duty that in the past belonged to
Hannah Storm . So, of course, the players were much more apt to
talk to him then. And he looked like he was in charge again. But
since Joe Torre and Chuck Knoblauch broke the silence and allowed
Gray in their presence during Wednesday's Game 4 pregame show, the
point had already been made clear _ the boycott was over. NBC
shoving Gray into the postgame celebration was just another
grandstand act, making it appear as if it was asserting itself to
cover the Series the way it wanted to. It also lulled the viewing
audience who missed the pregame show to stay tuned in case there
were more Chad Curtis -like dissing to be done. Which, no doubt,
the network would have enjoyed. The first two games of the Yankees
sweep were outrated by the second two; usually it's the opposite.
The four-game series (16.0/26) is also the second-lowest rating
ever. But the public's interest in the Gray- Pete Rose
interrogation Sunday night can be measured in a record 167,000
votes cast on an ESPN.com poll that asked about last Sunday's
Gray-Rose incident (almost half agreed that interview was out of
bounds). In a follow-up poll, 69 percent of 113,000 voters thought
the Yankees were justfied in boycotting Gray.

CAL-BREDS' IMAGE COULD USE A BOOST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA, Calif. _ The best California-bred thoroughbreds won't
be running in the California Cup on Saturday at Santa Anita.
Three-year-old General Challenge and 6-year-old Budroyale will skip
the $250,000 Cal Cup Classic to face international competition in
the $4 million Breeders' Cup Classic next week.
</P>
<P>
   Change the horses' names from year to year, and the sentences
above could be written almost every fall since the Cal Cup was
created a decade ago. Except for the three times when Best Pal ran
in the Cal Cup Classic, the stars generally haven't been able to
fit the state-breds showcase into their schedules.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wish they were here, but we understand, and we certainly
wish them luck back there,'' California Thoroughbred Breeders
Association John Barr said of the two horses and their Breeders'
Cup hopes a week from Saturday at Gulfstream Park in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   California breeders had better understand, if hey know what's
good for their business.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how competitive and festive the 10-race, $1.275
million Cal Cup program proves to be, it can't do as much to
improve the image of Cal-bred horses as a single Breeders' Cup
victory by one of the state's native sons or daughters could do.
</P>
<P>
   That none of them has been able to do it in 15 runnings of the
Breeders' Cup races is an increasing embarrassment to the
California breeding industry, which has produced winners in almost
every other major setting.
</P>
<P>
   In 41 Breeders' Cup starts, Cal-breds have had some commendable
near-misses. Bertrando looked like a winner in the 1991 Juvenile at
Churchill Downs before Arazi blew past. He led again in the '93
Classic at Santa Anita only to be shocked by 133-1 Arcangues.
Career Collection ran second to Countess Diana in the '97 Juvenile
Fillies at Hollywood Park. Soviet Problem missed by a head against
Cherokee Run in the '94 Sprint at Churchill. Nine others Cal-breds
finished third or fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there would be no 0-fer to write about if Fran's
Valentine and Pat Valenzuela hadn't been disqualified for knocking
Pirate's Glow off stride while finishing in front at 74-1 in the
first Juvenile Fillies in '84 at Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact is that Kentucky (59 wins), Florida (17), Maryland
and Pennsylvania (3) and Illinois, New Jersey and Oklahoma (1) all
lead California.
</P>
<P>
   The reason, of course, is that the stallions with the most
promising bloodlines are routinely sent to Kentucky _ or out of the
country _ before California. Consider this: Of Breeders' Cup
winners currently at stud, only one stands in California, and
that's '89 Mile winner Steinlen. At a low fee of $1,000 per foal,
he has yet to sire a Breeders' Cup starter. Even Turkey ('86 Turf
winner Manila) and India ('85 Juvenile winner Tasso) have one
Breeders' Cup winner at stud.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recognition for California and the quality of our product is
getting better all the time,'' Barr said. ``We've got some
wonderful sires here who are producing stakes winners routinely.
We've got sires here costing $40-50-60,000, which was unheard of a
few years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The recognition will increase if one of the six Cal-breds among
the 128 horses in the ``pre-entries'' announced Wednesday breaks
through and wins.
</P>
<P>
   General Challenge, the Santa Anita Derby winner whose Pacific
Classic victory made him the first 3-year-old to beat older horses
this season, is an obvious contender in the Classic. Former
claiming horse Budroyale, who upset General Challenge in the
Goodwood Handicap, will be a popular throw-in for trifecta bettors.
</P>
<P>
   Three Cal-breds are pre-entered in the $1 million Sprint: Big
Jag, winner of 12 of 22 lifetime; Enjoy the Moment, a front-runner
who's 9 for 14; and eastern-raced Richter Scale, winner of the
recent Sprint prep at Keeneland.
</P>
<P>
   A son of Bertrando named Hugh Hefner will be a long shot in the
$1 million Juvenile after winning his two starts against Cal-breds
and finishing a distant fourth behind Dixie Union in his only try
in an open race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate we've lost a couple of the best
California-breds to the Breeders' Cup, but hopefully they'll go
back there and bring home the bacon,'' said jockey Kent Desormeaux.
</P>
<P>
   Laffit's a granddad: Jockey Laffit Pincay, 30 wins from Bill
Shoemaker's career record of 8,833, became a grandfather Thursday.
His daughter Lisa gave birth to a girl, Madeleyn Hannah Bernstein,
at Arcadia's Methodist Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Pincay, 52, left the hospital to ride Hailtheliquidator to third
place in Thursday's third race at Santa Anita. Then he returned to
the hospital in time for the 3:19 p.m. birth.
</P>
<P>
   Series is set: The National Thoroughbred Racing Association
announced the schedule for the second NTRA Champions on Fox series
for older horses in 2000. There are some changes.
</P>
<P>
   Del Mar's Pacific Classic, the series' climactic race in '99,
isn't on the new schedule. An NTRA spokesman said the television
network wanted the series to end before the football season. The
Aug. 6 Whitney Handicap at Saratoga will be the finale next year.
</P>
<P>
   The five races to be shown on the Fox network include the March
4 Santa Anita Handicap and July 9 Hollywood Gold Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Among 14 off-network races are Santa Anita's Strub Stakes and
San Antonio Handicap, and Hollywood's Californian.
</P>
<P>
   A horse can earn $5 million for sweeping the five network
races. &QL;

NO HEROES IN GRAY-ROSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Conspiracy alert!
</P>
<P>
   As if the Pete Rose-Jim Gray interview snit wasn't tasty enough,
there is evidence to support Rose's claim that he was ambushed by
NBC in the pregame show before Game 2 of the World Series, and that
Gray wasn't the lone gunman.
</P>
<P>
   For those who have been on Mars for the last week, here's a
review: Rose made his first appearance at an official baseball
event Sunday as part of the fan-elected All-Century team. He
received an ovation that was longer and louder than that for any
honoree.
</P>
<P>
   After the ceremony, Rose was interviewed live by NBC reporter
Jim Gray. The aggressive Gray immediately went for the jugular,
asking Pete if he was ready, in the wake of his ovation, to ``make
contrition,'' to admit that he gambled on baseball. As he has done
now for 10 years, Rose denied gambling on baseball. Gray kept
prodding that issue, and the interview became more and more
contentious, to the point where Rose was asking Gray why he was
pushing so hard.
</P>
<P>
   According to industry sources, the theme of the Rose interview
was discussed at length during NBC production meetings that
included NBC Sports President Dick Ebersol and took place days
before Sunday's Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   Those sources say it was decided to pursue the Rose ``gambling
apology'' issue very hard. NBC officials weren't exactly hiding
their intentions, either. Days before the World Series started,
Gray boasted to USA Today TV sports columnist Rudy Martzke
``there's a lot of interesting things to talk to Pete about.''
</P>
<P>
   After the interview, Rose said he knew the gambling issue would
come up on the NBC interview, but that he had no idea it would be
the primary focus of a more than two-minute interview.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Hall of Fame third baseman Mike Schmidt told the
Philadelphia Daily News that Gray had asked Schmidt for his
assistance in getting Rose for an interview, and that Gray had said
``I guarantee this interview will help put Pete in the Hall of
Fame.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray denies that conversation ever took place. NBC officials say
Rose had agreed to the interview well in advance, and that Gray's
questions were consistent with questions asked of Rose during a
press conference he held hours before the All-Century ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   In the history of interviews, this one will go down as one of
the most memorable. Gray had every right to pursue the question,
but browbeating Rose on an issue he's denied forever was excessive.
So was Gray's tone.
</P>
<P>
   And if ever there was a right time for the usually inane ``how
do you feel?'' question, this was it. Rose's smile on the podium
was magnificent, and that was the storyline to follow. People at
home probably most wanted to know how Rose felt to be in baseball's
sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   When you look at the interview a second or third time, you
realize Gray wasn't asking a question as much as offering a
supposition, that it was time for Rose to come clean. In an
interview earlier this week, Gray said he felt he was offering Rose
an opportunity as if it was his to offer.
</P>
<P>
   It also underscores two growing evils in TV: One is the tendency
for interviewers to insinuate themselves into the story, to become
part of the news. That was clearly the case here: NBC and Gray had
an agenda. Did Gray or NBC really think Rose was going to offer an
apology during an extended sound bite, mere minutes after an
hour-long press conference in which he stuck to his story?
</P>
<P>
   Two is the ramifications of advertisers in situations like this.
Gray said he had no regrets, yet he offered one a few days later,
reportedly at the demand of MasterCard, a World Series sponsor and
the sponsor of the All-Century team. If Gray and NBC felt they were
in the right, then they should have stuck to their point of view
and not caved to advertiser pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Truly, if anyone should have been interviewed, it should have
been baseball commissioner Bud Selig. Considering Selig agreed to
let Rose participate in this event, and the crowd reaction, Selig
should have been asked if this tangible public opinion held any
sway with his ban on Rose.
</P>
<P>
   And typical for a story like this, there has been inevitable
backlashes across the landscape.
</P>
<P>
   For every story saying Gray didn't show Rose much respect, there
were other newspaper columnists, talk show hosts and TV anchors
saying Rose doesn't deserve any respect. And for every putdown of
Gray, there's an occasional comment that Gray's a hero for asking
the tough questions.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry. If there's a hero in this story, he's hiding.
</P>
<P>
   AND NOW THE NEWS There's an interesting counterpoint to the
Rose-Gray issue. HBO airs its newest sports documentary, ``Howard
Cosell: Telling It Like It Is,'' Monday at 10 p.m., a detailed look
at Cosell's life, ranging from his relationship with Muhammad Ali
and willingness to broaden sports beyond the field to the
bitterness that marked his final days in the business. Cosell is
widely considered the most important broadcast sports journalist of
his generation, and his work certainly had all of journalism's
meat. But even his boss at ABC Sports, Roone Arledge, says during
the documentary that Cosell was more of a columnist than a
journalist, that his work was peppered with opinion and
perspective. Compared to what now passes for broadcast journalism,
Cosell should be deified.

DALY IN CHARGE NOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After the two most chaotic seasons in the history
of Los Angeles Dodgers baseball, the men at Fox who bought the team
from Peter O'Malley and caused much of that chaos have put the
franchise in the hands of a close friend of ... Peter O'Malley.
</P>
<P>
   Is this a Hollywood-type development or what? Wouldn't this plot
point fit on Fox's brash, snarky ``Action'' sitcom?
</P>
<P>
   In truth, Thursday's announcement that former Warner Bros. CEO
Bob Daly is the new Dodgers' Chairman, CEO and minority owner
amounts to a mea culpa, an admission by the Fox Group that the way
it ran the franchise the last two years wasn't successful, and that
the old way perhaps wasn't such a bad idea after all.
</P>
<P>
   Since Fox purchased the team from O'Malley in March of 1998, the
Dodgers have been the most dysfunctional L.A. family since the
Menendezes. At last count, more than a half-dozen different people
have taken a whack at running the franchise in some fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Fox COO Chase Carey traded catcher Mike Piazza. G.M. Fred Claire
released Hideo Nomo. Team President Bob Graziano fired Bill Russell
and Claire. A friend of Fox execs talked them into naming Tommy
Lasorda interim G.M. Lasorda made a couple of trades before Kevin
Malone was named permanent G.M. Carey and Chernin named Davey
Johnson manager after Malone whiffed on Felipe Alou, and new Fox
exec Rick Welts fired Graziano last month.
</P>
<P>
   Besides becoming a laughingstock for all those reasons and more,
there was also strong sentiment floating around baseball that the
organization wasn't a place you wanted to work or play for. Those
attracted to the old Dodgers said the thrill was gone, and the
mercenaries in the crowd couldn't be sure who was in charge.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the Dodgers were in danger of becoming the
Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   Not everything that happened was Fox's fault, but that's where
the blame usually went.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't love it,'' said Peter Chernin, the Fox Group CEO, of
the criticism. ``I don't think there were that many changes (under
Fox). I find it amusing that some people thought (we) were choosing
what music was being played at the stadium and what caps were being
worn. It's a little naive to think those were Fox decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any transition is difficult, especially when you have the
visibility of a company like (Fox). But honestly, the team wasn't
winning, and in that sense it's hard to argue with any of the
criticism. We (Fox) have to accept that responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox has learned to accept more than just that. It has also
learned that baseball is not a money-making business, and that
those teams that dare to seek a profit can't overlook the value of
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Chernin said the sale of 10 percent of the team to Daly
shouldn't be considered a retreat by Fox on baseball in any regard.
But he admits Fox's view is different than it was two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the greatest business we're in,'' said Chernin.
``It's not profitable, and we do have the desire to make it
profitable. But more importantly, this is the city in which we
live, the city in which every person at Fox works, and people want
to have a winning team and be a part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   That shouldn't have been a news bulletin to Chernin or anyone.
The Dodgers have been drawing three million fans a season in spite
of an 11-year drought. But maybe one has to live it to understand
it.
</P>
<P>
   Daly says he does. He grew up in Brooklyn and was angry when
Walter O'Malley moved the Dodgers to Los Angeles, but he grew up
and got over it. He became a fan again when he moved here in 1977,
and has been a close friend now of O'Malley, Tommy Lasorda and Vin
Scully now for more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Chernin described Daly as someone ``who knows how to manage a
touchy-feely operation like a sports team.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As a fan on the outside, I knew it would be very hard for
anybody to take over a team that had been run by a single owner
with all the tradition for all those years,'' Daly said. ``Whoever
came in would be measured against that family. Fox made some
mistakes, but they didn't make all the mistakes people said they
did.
</P>
<P>
   ``They care about the Dodgers. The fact they had the courage to
turn over the management of the team to me shows they care. I hope
I justify their confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   He couldn't do worse. Daly is not a baseball man, but he is an
organization man. For the last 20 years, Daly and Terry Semel
successful ran Warner Bros. its film and TV divisions, among
others, that earned $6 billion in revenues in 1998 with the same
kind of attention to personal detail and family values that was the
hallmark of O'Malley's Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   The fact he is putting his own money into the team
(approximately $30 million for a 10 percent share) is a
considerable influence. It's easy to talk about tradition. Daly is
backing his beliefs with cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart is involved,'' he said, ``and so is my wallet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just came from a company (Warner) that is very happy with
its involvement in baseball (the Atlanta Braves). In 1990, the
Braves had the worst record in baseball, but the people there put
together an organization that the people at Warner are very proud
of. I shared that sense of pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may not be happy this morning, but until this week, the
debate was whether the Yankees or Braves were the team of the
decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope we're sitting here seven or eight years from now
debating whether the Dodgers or someone else is the team of the
decade.''
</P>
<P>
   An admirable goal. For the moment, I'll settle for the same
person making all of the decisions for one full season.

SELIG GETTING PRESSURE ON ROSE STANCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Despite what the baseball commissioner Bud Selig has
said publicly about Pete Rose that nothing has changed and that he
will continue to keep Rose on the ineligibility list there are
forces working behind the scene to alter Selig's hard-line stance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, Bud is quite aware of Rose's tremendous popularity
with the fans,'' said one high-placed baseball official. ``You hear
the ovation Rose got in Atlanta, and that grabs your attention. We
realize what stakes are involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Selig is reluctant to reinstate Rose because that would mean
overturning the edict of one of his predecessors, the late Bart
Giamatti, who banned Rose from baseball 10 years ago because of his
gambling activities.
</P>
<P>
   But Selig is being urged to do so by some of his top advisors
because of the wide-spread public relations goodwill that would
accrue to baseball if he took such an action.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Selig and the game's establishment are perceived
as the unwavering, unforgiving heavies in the Rose saga, and Rose
has become the sympathetic figure even though he did allegedly
violate the baseball's anti-gambling rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'd like to see Bud do is near the end of the year clean
the slate with Rose, and issue some sort of amnesty,'' said the
high-placed official. ``Whether Bud does it remains to be seen.
But, believe me, he's aware of the whole situation, and its
ramifications.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   Well, there is hope for New York Yankee haters.
</P>
<P>
   They're growing older, and a few important performers might not
be returning next season.
</P>
<P>
   David Cone, 36, Paul O'Neill, 36, and Joe Girardi, 34, Darryl
Strawberry, 37, Luis Sojo, 33, are all free agents. Chili Davis,
39, will earn $4.6 million next year if the Yankees pick up his
option, which they might not choose to do.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Clemens is 37. Tino Martinez and Scott Brosius are 33.
Orlando (El Duque) Hernandez is either 30, as he claims, or 34, as
his estranged wife insists.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are aging, and they showed a few chips and dings the
past summer when they wound up winning 16 fewer regular season
games than they did a season ago when they rolled up 114 victories.
</P>
<P>
   Still, three of their top players, Derek Jeter, 25, Mariano
Rivera, 29, and Bernie Williams, 31, are in their primes and the
team's owner, George Steinbrenner, has said he will do what it
takes to sustain the Yankee dynasty, meaning he probably will
re-sign Cone and O'Neill and bring in at least one high-priced free
agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we still have a few world championships left in us,''
said Jeter, who has celebrated three during his four seasons with
the Yankees. ...
</P>
<P>
   I know devotees of Ken Griffey Jr., Nomar Garciaparra and Alex
Rodriguez will be outraged, but I don't think there is a better
player in baseball than Derek Jeter, who can run, field, hit and do
whatever it takes to win baseball games in a soothing, graceful,
elegant style.
</P>
<P>
   First, the Yankees had Ruth, then Gehrig, then DiMaggio, then
Mantle, then Jackson and now the magical pinstripe baton has been
passed to Jeter, a legitimate superstar. ...
</P>
<P>
   On second thought, it isn't so outrageous, after all, that Joe
Torre is being anointed as a future Hall of Famer by the New York
writers. Considering Joe Torre did collect 2,342 hits during his
17-year major league career and considering he now has managed
three World Series championship teams Hall of Fame managers Tom
Lasorda managed two and Earl Weaver one Torre does deserve serious
future consideration.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed like it was only a short while ago that Torre's name
was included among those venerable managerial retreads the John
McNamaras, the Don Zimmers, the Roger Craigs, ad nauseam after
being fired by the Atlanta Braves, New York Mets and St. Louis
Cardinals. Funny what a cast of talented players can do for a
manager's reputation. ...
</P>
<P>
   Proof that Ted Turner doesn't have the faintest idea about
baseball is that he keeps Bobby Cox propped up as the Braves'
manager. I've never seen a manager make more bonehead decisions
than Cox has this decade during these World Series.
</P>
<P>
   It's long been the feeling here that Cox's gross miscalculations
have cost the Braves at least one, if not two world titles. His
poor judgment benching three regulars, Walt Weiss, Bret Boone and
Eddie Perez, in Game 2 and allowing Tom Glavine to pitch too long
in Game 3 didn't cost the Braves the World Series this time, but it
certainly made matters easier for the Yankees. ...
</P>
<P>
   I've never seen a better baseball team than these Yankees. They
don't have a weakness, and what impresses me most about them is the
self-assured, stoic manner in which they carry themselves. ...
</P>
<P>
   Mariano Rivera deservedly won the MVP award, but Derek Jeter
played efficiently in every inning of the World Series and there
wouldn't have been an outcry had he wound up with it. ...
</P>
<P>
   Jim Gray made his best career move during the World Series. No
one ever paid serious attention to this mediocre sportscaster for
NBC until he got into his brouhaha with Pete Rose. ...
</P>
<P>
   I had no problem with Gray asking Rose the tough question about
his gambling past. But it quickly became obvious that Gray had
taken a self-promotion posture calculated to draw attention to
himself when he continued to besiege Rose. Such excess was
inappropriate considering the circumstances Rose was being honored
at Turner Field as a Team of the Century member but Gray achieved
his goal.
</P>
<P>
   Now everyone knows who Jim Gray is. ...
</P>
<P>
   Sign of the Times Dept.: Before Game 4 of the World Series
began, the veteran baseball writer for the Denver Rocky Mountain
News, Tracy Ringolsby, whiled away the time playing solitaire on
his computer in the pressbox. ...
</P>
<P>
   New York is an intriguing place to visit with all its mighty
skyscrapers and its clanging subways and its many museums and its
frantic hustle and bustle, but I'll take Long Beach any day with
its tranquil ambience and matchless weather. ...
</P>
<P>
   The Braves should do to Bobby Cox what the Cleveland Indians did
to Mike Hargrove.
</P>
<P>
   Chipper Jones didn't live up to his MVP expectations in this
series and the Braves' cleanup hitter, Brian Jordan, turned out to
be a bust. . .
</P>
<P>
   I keep hearing that the Braves will wind up with either Ken
Griffey Jr., or Alex Rodriguez. ...
</P>
<P>
   You have to be an important eater to finish the pastrami
sandwich at Carnegie's Deli on 7th Ave. ...
</P>
<P>
   Bob Graziano returning as the Dodgers' president? I didn't
realize that April Fool's Day came on October28.

EISNER DELAYS ANGELS' GM HIRE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ While the people at Fox have decided to diminish their
involvement with the day-to-day operations of the Dodgers, those at
the Walt Disney Co. have taken the opposite approach with the
Angels.
</P>
<P>
   The process of hiring a new general manager has become a mess,
with Disney's corporate side getting involved. Some might say a
better word is ``interfering,'' but no one involved with Anaheim
Sports Inc. or the Angels will say so, considering who from the
corporate side is involved.
</P>
<P>
   Disney chairman and CEO Michael Eisner, according to sources,
has become extremely active in the GM search. He's delaying the
process.
</P>
<P>
   With the World Series complete, managerial candidates like Don
Baylor (hitting coach for the Braves) and Chris Chambliss (hitting
coach for the Yankees) might not be available by the time the
Angels have someone sitting in former GM Bill Bavasi's old office.
</P>
<P>
   Just why is Eisner involved, and seemingly so suddenly?
</P>
<P>
   Sources say Angels president Tony Tavares decided last week that
Montreal Expos executive Bill Stoneman would be the new GM.
Stoneman interviewed twice, and only a third and final interview,
one that would include Eisner, stood in the way of an offer.
</P>
<P>
   But Eisner, according to sources, was miffed that he was
portrayed in newspaper stories as a ``figurehead'' and someone who
had little input in the decision other than his rubber-stamp
approval.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Eisner did not approve Stoneman and recalled the
other candidates for repeat interviews. Stoneman is still in the
running, but Bob Watson, Jim Duquette and Omar Minaya were called
back and met with Disney officials, including Eisner, in Burbank
earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels also added a fifth candidate to the mix. Dan Evans,
an assistant GM with the Chicago White Sox, is scheduled to be
interviewed today.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to Disney's corporate office in Burbank and Tavares'
office in Anaheim were deferred to Angels spokesman Tim Mead, who
said he didn't anticipate more interviews after today's with Evans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It remains this organization's intent to have closure as soon
as possible,'' Mead said, ``so we can deal with other pending
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Those other issues, besides that of hiring a manager, include
the re-signing of pitcher Chuck Finley. The Angels have exclusive
negotiating rights until Nov. 12, when any team would be eligible
to talk to the club's all-time winningest pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Mead said it was highly unlikely the Angels would hire a manager
before hiring a general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Former Angels manager Terry Collins, who resigned Sept. 3, is
reportedly talking with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays about becoming the
club's third-base coach.

CLIPPERS WAIVE TWO GUARDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Clippers, who edited the book on downsizing,
reduced their roster to the league-mandated dozen Thursday by
waiving guards Charles Smith and Scott Brooks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always tough to make those decisions,'' Clippers coach
Chris Ford said. ``Unfortunately for Scott and Charles, they were
two guys on the outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``They both worked hard and made this a good training camp.''
</P>
<P>
   And Smith will make $779,960 for this season, the last of a
three-year, guaranteed contract he commanded as the Miami Heat's
selection with the 26th pick in the 1997 NBA draft. Smith and Ike
Austin were acquired by the Clippers the following season in the
deal that made Brent Barry an ex-Clipper.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, a 6-foot-4 off-guard from the University of New Mexico,
averaged 3.6 points in 57 games over his two NBA seasons. He was
given limited duty in the Clippers' seven exhibition games.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks, a 5-11 free-agent point guard, was not drafted after
finishing his UC Irvine career in 1987. He averaged 4.9 points in
680 games over 10 seasons. His NBA odyssey included stops in
Philadelphia, Minnesota, Houston, New York, Dallas and Cleveland.
Brooks collected an NBA championship ring with the Rockets in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   He was invited to Camp Clipper in the recently exorcised,
post-lockout season, but his bid to make the team ended when he
suffered a knee injury in an exhibition game vs. the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   This season, he was in a neck-and-neck race with free-agent
Charles Jones to stick as the Clippers' third point guard.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who led the nation in scoring two consecutive seasons at
Long Island University, averaged 3.7 points in 29 games last season
with the Chicago Bulls. For now, he's a Clipper.
</P>
<P>
   Another free agent who survived the purge is 6-8 forward Anthony
Avent.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one should feel like it's a permanent situation,'' said
Ford, who said the league's waiver wire could have an impact on the
Clippers roster. ``If there's someone out there I think can make us
better, I'll be talking to Elgin (Baylor, the team's vice president
of basketball operations).''
</P>
<P>
   Low emphasis: The Clippers (4-3 in exhibition play) spent most
of Thursday's scrimmage time emphasizing greater offensive activity
in the low post. ``The burden's on them,'' Ford said of his inside
players. ``They've got to work for the ball. You have to fight for
everything in this league.''

LAKERS WAIVE BENJAMIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Now that coach Phil Jackson has the dominant big man
he's always coveted, he plans to use him _ a lot. The Lakers cut
their only true backup center Thursday and that might mean
40-minute games for Shaquille O'Neal, Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Enigmatic veteran Benoit Benjamin figured to be O'Neal's primary
backup, but he was waived after the morning shootaround. Forward
John Salley, out of basketball the last three years, is now the
second-string center until Travis Knight returns from a sprained
ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed some people that have speed reaction to the ball,
recovery of the basketball, rebounding and so forth.... Benoit
didn't give us what we were looking for in that direction,''
Jackson said prior to the Lakers' exhibition game against the Utah
Jazz at the Pond.
</P>
<P>
   But Benjamin was also the only Laker, aside from O'Neal, with
any bulk. The Lakers remain woefully thin at both power forward and
center, and Jackson hopes the front office can acquire a player who
can play both spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we need some big bodies, some big players,'' Jackson
said. ``The big thing is that we need people who can react and get
the ball back for us. That's really the critical part; it's not
size or the height or anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   As for O'Neal, ``I think he should be looking at 40 minutes a
night,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal has only averaged anything near that since 1993-94.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, apparently upset by Benjamin's departure, wore a hat
with the words ``Why Big Ben?'' and scrawled ``Big Ben'' on the
heel of his left shoe. He wouldn't elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers also waived forward Stephen Howard, reducing the
roster to 15.
</P>
<P>
   Spider's return: Salley looked like a long shot when he signed
with the Lakers, but he's now backed up his assertion that he
belongs here by effectively beating out Benjamin. He said he's not
surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. I came here for one reason, to be on the squad, back up
big fella,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Salley played limited minutes in the exhibition season, so his
stats have been modest. But he's performed well enough and has the
triangle-offense experience and veteran savvy the Lakers need.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't record charges (taken), they don't record attempted
blocked shots, they don't record boxing a guy out, they don't
record bothering a guy to the point where he's frustrated,'' Salley
said. ``They don't record positive influence when you step in the
game. Now watch those things when I step in the game and then tell
me if I'm doing what I'm supposed to do stat-wise.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson on Jordan: Jackson acknowledged that he spoke with
Michael Jordan over Labor Day weekend and inquired whether he might
have any itch to play basketball again.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he said no,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   But Jordan might appear at a Lakers practice to provide some
on-court advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he'd be on the floor at some time messing around,''
Jackson said.

KINGS PLAY KEY ROLE IN EXPANDED TV SCHEDULE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The NHL is expanding on television and the Kings
are a big part of the package.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN is broadcasting 13 Kings games this season, including
Thursday night's game with the Pittsburgh Penguins at Staples
Center on ESPN2. That figure is up from five games last season.
</P>
<P>
   There are several reasons for the jump. As part of the league's
new five-year, $600 million contract with ABC/ESPN, 26 games in
Western time zones have been added to the schedule as the second
half of NHL doubleheaders.
</P>
<P>
   The added exposure also will help in merchandising, which is a
big revenue generator in most cities. It is not as important here
because of the five-year commitment on the Kings' luxury suites.
</P>
<P>
   The league also is excited about televising games at the new
arena after years of logistical problems at the Forum. The press
box there was too low and provided poor camera angles. But Brian
Engblom, the former Kings player who did color commentary on radio
for the club from 1990-94 and worked Thursday's game for ESPN2,
said it helps the team is better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now this is just my opinion, but in the past the Kings were in
the lower echelon of teams and didn't draw a lot of interest,'' he
said. ``When the season starts, TV always shows games in the East
because that's where the ratings are. L.A. is a big market and I
know they wanted them in the mix. They are much improved this year
and I'm sure that is part of the reason for the rise.''
</P>
<P>
   Frequent flyers: There has been much chance for sightseeing on
the Penguins' four-day, three-game trip to California. They had a
five-hour flight from Pittsburgh to LAX on Tuesday, then bused to
Anaheim for Wednesday's game with the Mighty Ducks, which ended
with an overtime loss. After the game, they bused back to Los
Angeles for Thursday's game with the Kings. This morning, they fly
to San Jose for Saturday's game with the Sharks. They will return
to Pittsburgh immediately after the game.
</P>
<P>
   Quick whistles: The Penguins got a scare late in the first
period when goaltender Jean-Sebastien Aubin was forced to leave the
game with a strained left groin. He was injured making a save on a
shot by Glen Murray.
</P>
<P>
   Aubin, who stopped 35 of 37 shots Wednesday night against the
Mighty Ducks threw out his left leg to stop Murray's shot and did a
painful split. He remained in the game but had to leave after
several saves on the Kings' next trip down the ice. Aubin, who
stopped all 17 Kings shots in the first period, was replaced by Tom
Skudra. The Penguins other goalie, veteran Tom Barrasso injured his
knee Oct. 7 and is on injured reserve.

MAYBE IT'S SOWARD'S HANDS, NOT HAMSTRING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If you read between the lines, USC wide receiver
R. Jay Soward's dropped touchdown pass against Stanford might have
set him back more than his strained left hamstring on the eve of
Saturday's game against California.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a sampling of what Trojans coach Paul Hackett said this
week regarding dropped passes, which pretty much refers to Soward
among USC's receivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot drop the ball and be a big-time player.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people just don't drop the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The great ones just don't drop them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Balls dropped when no one's around are just inexcusable.''
</P>
<P>
   Soward will not start because his hamstring is not 100 percent,
but he will play. Instead, freshman Marcell Allmond will start at
flanker. But it might be interesting to see how many chances Soward
gets against California on Saturday, especially if the game is
close.
</P>
<P>
   As for split end: USC's other receiver, Windrell Hayes, doesn't
have any problems dropping the ball, but he had his own issues last
weekend, specifically the play-calling.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes caught four passes for 53 yards and one touchdown in the
first two drives against Stanford, but then went 25 pass attempts
without a reception. Only two of those passes went in his
direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we're just impatient. Maybe marching down the field
isn't good enough for us right now,'' Hayes said. ``It's like we
want it all and we want it now. I'm not upstairs looking down on
the field; maybe they see something the players don't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you why we don't throw over the middle or with
more short passes.''
</P>
<P>
   Kicking battle: After both David Newbury and David Bell missed
field goals against Stanford, Hackett said he would continue to
keep Newbury as the starter, with Bell in reserve.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to go with Newbury,'' Hackett said. ``If he isn't
(doing well), we won't hesitate to go with Bell. We've been too
erratic.''
</P>
<P>
   Mailo doubtful: With offensive lineman Faasea Mailo (bruised
shin) doubtful, freshman Chad Pierson is slated to move into
Mailo's fullback position in goal-line situations.
</P>
<P>
   Long memory: Cornerback Kris Richard said USC's back-to-back
blown 21-point leads won't make him forget that the Trojans also
blew a 21-point lead to Cal last year at the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   ``We remember how they embarrassed us,'' Richard said. ``After
the game, they were running all over the field. Taunting us. I'm
taking that into this game.''
</P>
<P>
   No practice: USC will not have a walk-through today at
California. Hackett held a one-hour practice Thursday, because he
said he wanted to keep the Trojans' legs fresh.
</P>
<P>
   Morton honored: Tailback Chad Morton has been named one of 15
National College Scholar-Athletes by the National Football
Foundation and College Hall of Fame. Morton will receive an $18,000
postgraduate scholarship.

UCLA DEFENSE WILL BE TESTED AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Saturday at the Rose Bowl, a defense that
specializes in allowing big plays meets an offense that specializes
in making them. And no, the scale does not tip in UCLA's favor.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins yielded nine plays of at least 19 yards to Oregon
State last weekend. Next they face an Arizona attack that makes
more big plays than little plays. Last week against Oregon, the
Wildcats scored on plays of 32, 33, 60, 65 and 80 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way to stop it is just to execute the defense and be as
sound as you can be,'' Bruins coach Bob Toledo said. ``It's all
matchups, me against you, you against me, and the one that plays
the best wins.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona has the best collection of playmakers in the Pac-10.
Quarterbacks Ortege Jenkins and Keith Smith are the second- and
third-leading passers, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Tailback Trung Canidate is No.2 in the league in rushing (121
yards per game) and has gained 500 yards in the last three games.
</P>
<P>
   Receiver Dennis Northcutt is first in the conference in
receptions, second in yards and first in punt returns.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have the most explosive offense we've faced,'' Toledo
said. ``They give Northcutt two reverses a game, and he scores a
touchdown. It looks like a New York Life commercial, with guys
missing and him taking it to the (end zone).''
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!Injury update:!off! Tailback DeShaun Foster (sprained
ankle) and receiver Danny Farmer (strained groin) have been
upgraded to probable but probably won't play more than 10-15 snaps.
</P>
<P>
   Tight end Bryan Fletcher suffered a sprained ankle Wednesday and
won't play. Freshman Mike Seidman takes his place on the depth
chart.
</P>
<P>
   Also, reserve center Tony Ippolito is out with a sprained knee.
Guard Matt Phelan becomes the No.2 center.
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!Just for kicks:!off! If field goals decide the game, then
UCLA has a significant advantage. Freshman Chris Griffith has made
10 of 13 this season _ a 77-percent conversion rate that's second
in the Pac-10.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Arizona kicker Mark McDonald, from Loyola High, is
the most despised man in Tucson after missing a 45-yard, game-tying
field goal against Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald has made 1 of 10 field-goal attempts this season _ yes,
1 of 10 _ and missed four extra points.
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!Review of the Week:!off! UCLA defensive end Pete Holland,
a history major and six-time member of the director's honor roll,
has agreed to review a book each week for the Daily News. This
week: ``One L.'' by Scott Turow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Millions of readers already know Turow as a master of the law
and suspense. `One L.' provides insight into Turow's metamorphosis
from lecturer to lawyer by chronicling his first year (1L) at
Harvard Law School.
</P>
<P>
   ``He conveys, in brutal and pride-swallowing honesty, his
personal struggles and thoughts on Harvard's faculty and
curriculum. Even more revealing is the book's narrow focus, which
speaks of the tedium of student life at Harvard Law. `One L.' now
serves as a guide (and warning) to prospective law students and
it's a fluid and engrossing read.''
</P>
<P>
   Rating: 3{ sacks (out of a possible four).

PANEL URGES FIRMS TO WIDEN SCOPE OF BENEFITS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- A Los Angeles city panel has broadened its own
requirements on benefits for domestic partners to include companies
that do business with the city.
</P>
<P>
   Under a recommendation from the City Council's Personnel
Committee, all firms that do business with the city and offer
benefits to workers and their spouses will be required to make
benefits available to those in partnership relationships.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world has changed and families are now defined in a
variety of ways,'' Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg said at the
Thursday session. ``The reality is there are a lot of family
relationships where people aren't married.''
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Mike Feuer questioned the need to include
opposite-sex couples in the measure since they have the opportunity
to get married.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg said all should be included because many couples choose
not to marry and also because the present law covering city workers
includes both same-sex and opposite-sex couples.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of businesses showed the costs would be about $2,100
per worker per year.
</P>
<P>
   However, it would apply only to those companies offering such
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The measure is modeled after one in effect in San Francisco.

   BROOKLYN-JOHNSON-EXHIBIT While the legal battle continues over
``Sensation,'' the show of work by young British artists at the
Brooklyn Museum of Art that has drawn fire from Mayor Rudolph W.
Giuliani, it is nice to know that the museum continues to go about
its business of mounting exhibitions. The latest, ``Eastman
Johnson: Painting America,'' set in the 19th century, is a
comfortable distance from controversy and a good foil for the
visual ballistics of the ``Sensation'' show. Johnson (1824-1906) is
represented here by 70 paintings and 32 drawings, a mix of corny
stereotype and original observation heavily influenced by
17th-century Dutch genre painting. By Grace Glueck.

   APPLES-CINCINNATI (Cincinnati) _ This old river town, with a
site of uncommon beauty and a populace of uncommon civility, has a
reputation as a stick-in-the-mud all the same. Mark Twain suggested
that he'd like to come here for the apocalypse because it was
always 20 years behind the times. The most celebrated outcropping
of the city's conservatism in recent years was the indictment on
April 7, 1990, of the Contemporary Arts Center and its director on
obscenity charges arising from an exhibition of 175 Robert
Mapplethorpe photographs. Much less attention was paid when a local
jury, largely working-class in makeup, acquitted both defendants
six months later. Which was par for the course. People also tend to
overlook the city's cultural traditions, especially its rich
musical heritage, and its record of innovation in many fields. By
R.W. Apple Jr.

   NY-MEATPACKING-DISTRICT (New York) _ The meatpacking district is

``it'' social scene, with enough new restaurants, chic bars and
smoky clubs to occupy even the flimsiest of attention spans. By
Jesse McKinley.

PACKER BACKERS STILL LIKE MIKE _ WELL, MOST DO

<P>
   GREEN BAY, Wis. _ On the corners of the intersection of Lombardi
Avenue and Holmgren Way are two plain houses, a used car lot and a
cheap motel.
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly Hollywood and Vine.
</P>
<P>
   At the crossroads of Vince Lombardi and Mike Holmgren, however,
is where this town lives _ in the football past.
</P>
<P>
   The coaches who brought Super Bowl championships to this old
mill town have been immortalized by asphalt and street signs. This
is not a bad salute, considering their visages could have adorned
40-foot statues made of cheddar.
</P>
<P>
   But Lombardi and Holmgren are gone from Green Bay's one great
thing.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren went the hard way. He lived.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, he's coming back to haunt. Around Halloween. In
the flesh. Less than a year after he ripped a chunk out of the
self-proclaimed Titletown, USA, abandoning the fabled frozen tundra
for money and glory on the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   At least Lombardi has the good grace to linger only as a ghost.
</P>
<P>
   But here's the spooky part:
</P>
<P>
   Most Packer backers don't hate Holmgren.
</P>
<P>
   Really.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should we? '' said Julia, one of the co-owners of
Anduzzi's, a bright, modern sports bar with a Holmgren Way address
a few blocks from Lambeau Field. ``I don't know anyone who feels we
should change the street name. He did a lot of great things while
he was here.''
</P>
<P>
   A customer at the bar, Jim Schneider, a shipping manager for a
local business, summarized the unexpectedly benign view of
Holmgren's Monday night return to Green Bay as coach of the Seattle
Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the fans don't boo him,'' Schneider said. ``I do hope
the Packers kick his butt.''
</P>
<P>
   stars
</P>
<P>
   (begin bold italic)
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not personal.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Holmgren
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never going to be personal with me.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Packers coach Ray Rhodes
</P>
<P>
   (end bold italic)
</P>
<P>
   The hell you say.
</P>
<P>
   It's personal with most everyone else here. Everything about the
Packers is personal. The one community-owned major league team in
all of North America's corporation-infected pro sports scene cares
deeply about the game Monday night, and everything that comes with
it.
</P>
<P>
   Both coaches have instructed their players to keep at arm's
length any media conversations that turn toward angles of revenge
and betrayal. Packers defensive back LeRoy Butler even said playing
against Holmgren was like playing against his father.
</P>
<P>
   The dishonesty is well-scripted and professionally understood.
But players and coaches aren't the custodians of the heritage. The
fans are, and they are under no obligation to disguise their
passion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a traditional town, and he said he came here intending
to stay,'' said Mark Klevesahl, occupying a corner stool at the
Glory Days Bar and Grill. ``He said he loved this town. He didn't
love this town. He loved the money. We name a street after him, and
he's gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I resent the guy for leaving.''
</P>
<P>
   But Klevesahl was outgunned from two stools over. Eric Gutowski
and Mike Caranehas respected Holmgren for what he did, as well as
his right to move on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not bitter at all,'' Gutowski said. ``If he could be GM
here, he probably would have stayed. But that wasn't going to
happen here with (GM) Ron Wolf. So he had a chance to improve his
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Caranehas said a lot of credit for the Packers renaissance
belongs to players Reggie White and Brett Favre, as well as Wolf,
``but a big percentage of football is coaching, and Holmgren did a
great job here. I hope people cheer him.''
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, that's how opinions went in an informal survey this week
in the streets and bars and stores of Packerland, about 2-1 in
favor of Holmgren.
</P>
<P>
   Dismay lingered over Holmgren's final season, an 11-5 year that
ended with a taut first-round playoff loss at San Francisco.
Holmgren's name had been linked to the Seahawks for more than a
year before his departure, and some suspected he coached with one
foot out the door.
</P>
<P>
   Back at Anduzzi's, Schneider said: ``You can't blame fans for
being resentful over that. It was no big secret that he wanted to
be coach and GM, but the way the Seattle thing got out was bad. He
needed to finish the job here, then go. He was kind of snippy last
year. It seemed as if he had already made his mind up.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you have to remember one thing: This is a football town
that knows how the business works. We know that coaches, just like
players, move on. It's naive to think any other way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really do understand, and I think most of us have more
class than to boo him.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the players, it was plain that Holmgren was harder on them
last season, following two straight Super Bowl appearances. Some
said it was because of the pressure of his potential departure. But
whether it affected the season was difficult to quantify.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it was a distraction,'' offensive tackle Ross
Verba said. ``But it was an issue we had to deal with. We realized
in the back of our heads that maybe he wouldn't be here. I don't
know if it affected our season.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's come and gone. We have a new guy running the
train.''

<P>
   As soon as the NFL schedule was announced in April, almost every
calendar in Wisconsin had Nov. 1 circled. Some of those circles
actually were closer to hearts.
</P>
<P>
   Folks who had personal contact with the big lug really seemed to
care.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Parins is the Packers' corporate security officer, a guy
whose professional concern for Holmgren and the team turned into a
close friendship.
</P>
<P>
   It was Parins, a 30-year vet of the Green Bay police department,
who taught Holmgren to ride a Harley-Davidson. It was Parins who
arranged, during the Packers' regular-season visit to Seattle in
1996, for a Harley dealer in Wenatchee to supply motorcycles so the
two could explore the Cascade foothills the Saturday before the
game.
</P>
<P>
   It was Parins who was given a new Harley by Holmgren upon his
departure, a heavily chromed thank you. And that was after he tried
to get Parins to work the same job in Seattle for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a friend and a great coach,'' said Parins, whose ruddy,
chiseled looks go a little soft when he's asked if he misses his
pal. After a pause and a look away, he says, ``Well, I guess you
can tell ... ''
</P>
<P>
   Parins recalls vividly the Cascades ride. Free of any Packers
insignia, the pair thought they were anonymous until two older
women approached them at a roadside stop with an overview of a
waterfall.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said, `Hey, coach,''' Parins recalled. ```We know you
have a good team, because you just took away our best tackler.'''
</P>
<P>
   That was shortly after the Seahawks traded Eugene Robinson to
Green Bay. The four laughed and talked awhile, the women walking
away charmed.
</P>
<P>
   That's often how it is with Holmgren encounters.
</P>
<P>
   Every June, the local muscular dystrophy association organizes a
charity motorcycle ride (Harleys are made in Milwaukee). Proceeds
tripled once Holmgren became a celebrity rider.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd stop for coffee or a beer in all these little towns, or
mom-and-pop roadside restaurants,'' Parins said. ``We'd have a
great time talking to people. And if you know the kind of people
who ride these Harleys, he could handle anybody in that group.''
</P>
<P>
   Over at the Stadium View bar, another pit stop on Holmgren Way,
a waitress named Kelly had another wheeled encounter with the
coach. She was the beverage-cart hostess at a golf course Holmgren
played occasionally.
</P>
<P>
   When she spotted him at a hotel function she walked up to say
hello when security rushed in to cut her off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike stopped them, told them it was OK. He remembered my name
and said, `Hi,''' Kelly said. ``That's how he is _ the nicest man
in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was real sad to see him go, but I'm very happy for him. I
don't see how anybody can be mad at him. If somebody can't see the
opportunity he was given, they're just being selfish.''

</P>

</P>
<P>
   See how quickly people forget?
</P>
<P>
   If the Packers throttle the Seahawks Monday, somebody here will
start clamoring to name a street Rhodes Road, and the memory of
Holmgren will fade dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, if the Seahawks throttle the Packers, a headline
will suggest the Packers are on ``40 miles of bad Rhodes.'' Fans
will blame the troubles on Holmgren's decision to leave and take
half the coaching staff and front office with him.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, however, the circumstances and consequences of
Holmgren's departure will be lost in a haze of bratwurst smoke.
What will be indelible is the 1997 Super Bowl win and the return to
eminence in the NFL of its most storied franchise.
</P>
<P>
   The man most responsible will be Holmgren, whose pictures now
adorn the walls at Fuzzy's Shenanigans, a run-down bar overlooking
the Fox River that is a repository of all things Packer. Owned by
Fuzzy Thurston, one of the immortals from the 1960s, the bar's
walls for years had nothing but the faded photos and yellowed
clippings of the grand time when most of the customers were kids.
</P>
<P>
   Now included is the fresh color of contemporary photography, of
Holmgren riding shoulders and fans holding up index fingers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess some people feel a little betrayed, but my gosh, even
Lombardi left,'' said Kay the bartender, a lifelong resident who
has worked for Fuzzy for 13 years. ``I know everybody wants to beat
Mike Monday, but resent him? Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Green Bay.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as it is said to be ``Now Time'' in Seattle, it has always
seemed to be ``then time'' in Green Bay. But even here, it hurts
the neck to always look backward instead of ahead.

WHEN STARS LEAVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The team was coming off two unsuccessful seasons. It
had a pair of superstars _ one infielder and one outfielder _ who
were both popular, expensive and in the prime of their careers. It
had a new general manager and fans growing restless for a
championship.
</P>
<P>
   That describes the Mariners right now. It also describes the San
Francisco Giants in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Sabean was six weeks into his new job as Giants general
manager when he traded third baseman Matt Williams, a 10-year
Giant, to the Cleveland Indians for infielders Jeff Kent and Jose
Vizcaino, relief pitchers Julian Tavarez and Joe Roa and $1
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``They hadn't done anything since the 1989 World Series,'' San
Diego Padres general manager Kevin Towers said of the Giants. ``It
wasn't working, and they had all their money tied up in two players
(Williams and Barry Bonds). The minute they traded Williams, all of
a sudden they acquired a few players they needed, and they had
salary flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were calling Brian Sabean the village idiot, but that
took a lot of guts. You can't be afraid to take a chance. The easy
way out is to sign all your guys back, because you know what you're
getting. The tough thing is moving premier guys and taking a
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 Giants won their division after finishing last the
previous two years. But nobody knew that when Sabean, a first-time
GM, shipped out Williams, a four-time All-Star.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was brutal, it was intense, it was personal,'' said Sabean,
recalling the reaction to the deal. ``What kept my sanity was that
I knew we were doing the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Kent has become a star, driving in 350 runs the past three
years. In the division-winning season, Vizcaino was a steady
starting shortstop, Tavarez a top setup man, and the $1 million was
spent on free agent Darryl Hamilton, a center fielder and leadoff
man.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really satisfied a lot of needs on our wish list,'' Sabean
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners' needs are many this off-season. Though the
quandary facing new general manager Pat Gillick will be more
complicated than the one Sabean faced _ ``Those two guys are really
a different animal,'' said Sabean, referring to Ken Griffey Jr. and
Alex Rodriguez _ the basics are the same.
</P>
<P>
   This team and this payroll likely are no longer big enough for
both Griffey and Rodriguez. Even with both playing brilliantly the
past two years, the Mariners have been stuck in third place in the
American League West. If one or both has to go, the club could
improve. There is precedent in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   In the winter of '96, the Indians lost Albert Belle and traded
Kenny Lofton, and won the pennant the next season. The Boston Red
Sox survived the free-agent departures of Roger Clemens and Mo
Vaughn to reach the American League Championship Series this month.
</P>
<P>
   Those teams had depth in talent and payroll to withstand the
losses. The Indians, essentially, replaced Belle and Lofton with
established stars Williams, David Justice and Marquis Grissom. The
Red Sox traded prospects for ace Pedro Martinez, then signed him to
a record contract. Much of their money to position players is tied
up in young shortstop Nomar Garciaparra and versatile free-agent
signee Jose Offerman.
</P>
<P>
   Other superstar moves have brought mixed results. The Oakland
Athletics had no choice but to deal Mark McGwire in 1997, getting
two prospects and a set-up man in return. But one of those
prospects helped them land Kevin Appier, who went 7-5 after his
trade from Kansas City this July.
</P>
<P>
   Some fans of the Los Angeles Dodgers still haven't gotten over
the May 1998 trade of catcher Mike Piazza, who was in a contract
dispute during his free-agent year and was shipped to Florida for
five players. Only one, Gary Sheffield, remains with the Dodgers,
who wound up paying more to free agent ace Kevin Brown than they
ever offered Piazza. Still, Sheffield and Brown were bright spots
in a Dodgers season that soured for other reasons.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, of course, the Mariners never would have had Randy
Johnson if they hadn't dealt homegrown pitching star Mark Langston
to Montreal in 1989. And last July, the team traded Johnson to
Houston for Freddy Garcia and John Halama, who combined for 28
wins, and infielder Carlos Guillen.
</P>
<P>
   Those successes could make the Mariners more amenable to trading
Griffey or Rodriguez, if it came to that.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have to trade Ken or Alex, no one will be more
disappointed than I,'' Mariners president Chuck Armstrong said
earlier this month. ``I'll miss them terribly, and I hope we don't
have to do that. ... (But) you see that life does go on and the
world doesn't stop. I sometimes think maybe we're putting too much
emphasis on these two guys _ but then, they are unique.''
</P>
<P>
   They are ... and they aren't. Several other stars are entering
the last year of their contracts, and there's no certainty they
won't be on the trade market, either. Toronto is worried it could
lose Carlos Delgado and Shawn Green, while Cleveland could move
Manny Ramirez and Texas might shop Juan Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Further complicating matters is Griffey's right to veto any
trade and the fact that Rodriguez will not negotiate with any team
until after 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is, will the player negotiate with you?'' said
Rodriguez's agent, Scott Boras. ``For us, in Alex's situation, how
much would a club give when they know the player's there for one
year?''
</P>
<P>
   Another line of thinking says that given the talents and
marketability of Griffey and Rodriguez, teams will take that risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any question you can get players in
return who would be solid, solid guys to build around going
forward,'' Philadelphia Phillies general manager Ed Wade said.
``But that doesn't make it any easier a task (for Gillick). When
one of your first orders of business is going to be addressing that
situation by either keeping or trading those guys, I don't think
anybody would look upon that as a golden opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if it gets to the stage where they feel the appropriate
move is to try to make deals, then I'm sure the adrenaline will
flow, because I assume there will be a lot of takers and some very
interesting proposals.''
</P>
<P>
   Towers sees a similar scenario.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, it's going to be a tough, tough position for
(Gillick),'' he said. ``But in another way, what a couple of trump
cards to have.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only tough thing is, because of the market value of the
two superstars, there are probably very few clubs that could afford
the type of contracts those guys want. Those are two pretty special
players, and you could probably fill a bunch of holes if you had to
move both.''
</P>
<P>
   Last winter, Towers was criticized for trading Greg Vaughn and
letting Ken Caminiti, Steve Finley and Brown leave as free agents
after the Padres won the NL pennant. But keeping Brown at $15
million per year, he said, would not have allowed the Padres to
stay competitive. And signing Finley and Caminiti to deals lasting
into their late-30s was also risky.
</P>
<P>
   But if they hadn't played out the season with Caminiti and
Finley as potential free agents and traded for Brown, San Diego
never would have made the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't be afraid to be stuck with a situation where you get
nothing but draft picks,'' Sabean said. ``You have to be daring
both ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez and Boras prefer that scenario: build a winner in
Rodriguez's contract year, then try re-signing him after that. The
Mariners want a resolution sooner, and believe a trade package this
winter is preferable to the draft picks they'd receive as
compensation if Rodriguez left as a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   The important thing, it seems, is having a realistic assessment
of a team's potential. On an admittedly much smaller scale, Wade
said, he traded Mickey Morandini and Kevin Stocker, the middle
infield from the Phillies' 1993 pennant winners, to acquire young
outfielders Bobby Abreu and Doug Glanville in 1997. By ackowledging
that '93 was long gone, Wade acquired two players ready to blossom.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tough thing is you get close to your guys,'' Towers said.
``They mean a lot to the city, they're tremendous role models to
kids, and when you have to separate, it's a tough, tough time. But
there's a business side of it, too. Is it worth it to incur
millions in losses with no guarantee of winning? That doesn't make
sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fans may be upset, and I understand that. But the key thing is
if you're able to acquire players back that are good players,
they'll forget. If they succeed, the fans will embrace them.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, even when you've successfully shipped out a star, it
doesn't mean you enjoy it. Just ask Sabean.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope I'm never in a position again where I have to do that,
because it's pretty nerve-wracking,'' he said. ``It's something you
don't want to face.''

BY GREG GITTRICH AND DAVID R. BAKER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The Los Angeles school board stood by its
decision to strip Superintendent Ruben Zacarias of day-to-day
administrative authority and ordered lawyers to negotiate a buyout
of his contract as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before 10 p.m. Thursday, Zacarias and board members
emerged from a tense closed-door session nearly three hours long
and announced the decision taken by a narrow 4-3 majority. The
board also voted to buy out the contracts of chief counsel Richard
Mason and Chief Administrative Officer David Koch at a total cost
of about $400,000.
</P>
<P>
   Zacarias remained hopeful, saying, ``I'm disappointed . . . it's
a take-it-or-leave-it situation. I don't think my relationship with
the board is poisoned. It's up to them to decide how we can work
together.''
</P>
<P>
   But Valley board member Caprice Young said: ``No, he's not going
to be staying. The decision of the board tonight was for him to
go.''
</P>
<P>
   Other members of the majority, board President Genethia Hayes,
Vice President Valerie Field and member Mike Lansing agreed there
was no backing down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I anticipate that the district will be reformed and will be
healthier,'' Hayes said. ``People will see this as an
extraordinarily good move made in the best interest of children.''
</P>
<P>
   Fields added: ``No one is happy about this. This is a serious
time.''
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the board was equally adamant he must go.
</P>
<P>
   Board sources said former Pasadena and New York City schools
chief Ramon C. Cortines, a Pasadena resident, would be named
Tuesday to lead the Los Angeles Unified School District on an
interim basis even if a deal has not been reached with Zacarias.
</P>
<P>
   As Zacarias emerged from the meeting, about 200 supporters gave
him a standing ovation. He motioned them to keep quiet, but they
erupted into the chant, ``recall.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he would challenge in court the appointment of Howard
Miller as chief operating officer with day-to-day control over
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters, including board member Victoria Castro, said efforts
will be made to break up the district.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope this will serve as some kind of wake-up call to the
board members,'' Castro said. ``Another action like this could
definitely lead to the breakup of the district.''
</P>
<P>
   The day of crisis was marked by racially tinged protests from
Latino political leaders and Zacarias supporters as the narrow
board majority insisted it was committed to replacing Zacarias over
his managerial failings and conduct that borders on
insubordination.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the 70-year-old Zacarias defiantly said he would not
accept a buyout _ worth nearly $500,000 for the 20 months left on
his contract plus accrued vacation pay. He would get a $150,000
annual pension.
</P>
<P>
   The dramatic showdown over control of the nation's
second-largest school district came after hundreds of Latinos
protested outside the Los Angeles Unified headquarters and dozens
of Zacarias supporters told the board at a hearing to back down and
leave him in charge.
</P>
<P>
   The confrontation was filled with racial overtones but the board
majority voted 4-3 on a series of motions to strip Zacarias of
direct authority over the district and put Miller, a former board
member and real estate attorney, in charge of all divisions under
Zacarias.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about a district that no one believes is serving the
children well,'' Hayes said in an interview with the Daily News.
``The superintendent is an employee that we are having a management
dispute with. He and his supporters have blown up this management
dispute to involve all of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It pains me that many of his supporters are making this into a
racial thing. There are many ethnicities in this district, and none
of them are being served well. It pains me that the Latino leaders
only talk about the Latino children. My bottom line is this is
about all the children in this district, all the children in this
city.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much poorer are we as a society if we are going to
politicize this and make this a racial issue? . . . This is about
educating all the children. This is about repairing a broken
district.''
</P>
<P>
   State Sens. Richard Polanco, Martha Escutia, and Richard
Alarcon, all Democrats, along with county Supervisor Gloria Molina,
walked the podium with Antonia Hernandez of the Mexican American
Legal Defense and Educational Fund to protest the board's treatment
of Zacarias and the Latino community. The legislators designated
Hernandez to speak for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are concerned about the total disregard to due process in
the vote taken Oct. 12 to strip the superintendent of control of
the district,'' Hernandez said. ``The board's actions were illegal
and ill-conceived.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board has chosen a path that is detrimental to the
short-term and long-term goals of the district. We are concerned
with the lack of respect afforded to the Latino community
throughout this process. We have tried to work with the board. The
board has placed a wedge between groups that should be working
together to tackle the education issues that confront us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Latino leaders demanded that the board rescind its ``illegal
action'' of appointing a chief executive officer, restore Zacarias
to control of the district, return Miller to his previous role as
chief of facilities, and engage in a fair and open evaluation of
the superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   More than 70 percent of the district students are Latino.
</P>
<P>
   (CONTINUED ON NEXT TAKE)
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES: students are Latino.
</P>
<P>
   The superintendent vowed to reject any effort to remove him and
insisted he would not accept Miller in a role giving him
chain-of-command authority.
</P>
<P>
   Before the board met, a defiant and emotional Zacarias told a
news conference at his attorney's office that he would not accept a
buyout.
</P>
<P>
   ``As of this moment, no one, not one board member, has
approached me about that,'' Zacarias said, his eyes red-rimmed.
``There has been talk of me resigning. I will not do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The embattled superintendent said he was not angry at any
individual and that some of the controversy was part of the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like what Harry Truman said,'' Zacarias said. ``If you
can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen. I like the kitchen.''
</P>
<P>
   Zacarias and his attorney, Joseph Coyne, said the board could
not fire Zacarias because his contract requires it to provide him
with specific goals and objectives and evaluate him quarterly
before taking action.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were supposed to do this July 1, and we have a draft
dated Oct. 10, 1999, that still hasn't been given to the
superintendent,'' Coyne said.
</P>
<P>
   Coyne also objected to the proposal to change the title given
Miller from chief executive officer to chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney said state education code specifically names the
superintendent as chief executive of a school district. The
alteration in the title doesn't change the functions.
</P>
<P>
   Zacarias said he could work with Miller, but only if his
authority is returned to him and Miller remains in his more limited
original job as overseeing construction.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a compromise,'' Zacarias said. ``It's not like where
the board is saying it is their way or no way.''
</P>
<P>
   Coyne said he is prepared to go to court almost immediately if
the board takes steps to fire Zacarias improperly.
</P>
<P>
   Zacarias and Coyne also stressed that the issue was not about
race, where the superintendent has received strong support from the
Latino community.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have read where this is about the Westside vs. the
Eastside,'' Zacarias said. ``That is not the case. And I will take
steps to shut up anyone that tries to make this a racial issue. It
is not about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Zacarias also said he has held several meetings with the top
administrators throughout the district to make sure educational
programs are continuing.
</P>
<P>
   Several board members asserted their right to fire Zacarias. The
superintendent serves at the pleasure of the school board and his
$188,000 a year contract contains no language preventing a majority
of members from buying out his contract at any time, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board has the option to terminate the superintendent's
contract, as long as there are four votes. That's it,'' said member
Valerie Fields. ``I hope it doesn't come to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Fields said she hoped that despite the superintendent's defiant
comments, he would reconsider and negotiate a buyout of his
contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have told us we're intransigent, but that's because we
really believe we're right about this,'' said board member Caprice
Young.
</P>
<P>
   The superintendent and the board have been at an impasse for
more than two weeks over the board's decision to appoint Miller as
CEO. The management change stripped the superintendent of
day-to-day control.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute came to a head Tuesday when Zacarias announced he
was going to restructure the public school system without
consulting the board or seeking its approval. His plan included
demoting Miller.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Zacarias' supporters on the board tried to delay a
decision to appoint Miller as CEO. Board member David Tokofsky
argued that the waiting period made sense on such a momentous
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives us an opportunity in which we can de-escalate
tensions, mediate, find alternatives, find unity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Board members Castro and Julie Korenstein supported the motion,
receiving standing ovations from the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than prolong a process they said had already dragged on
long enough, the majority rejected Tokofsky's motion. The crowd
responded by chanting: ``Recall!''
</P>
<P>
   Attempts by Castro, Korenstein and Tokofsky to limit Miller's
oversight to business and facilities also were defeated by 4-3
votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not interested in mediocrity. That's not enough for this
district's children,'' Hayes said earlier. ``If someone could step
up to the microphone and say, Genethia have you thought about this?
and showed me how this district is well managed, that this
district's children were being well served, I'd say I was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Zacarias has not been able to bring his staff under
control,'' she said. ``The staff has not served him well. The
management structure has not served him well. It allows his staff
to report around him. That is a management problem. We tried to fix
that problem by appointing a chief executive officer. He rejected
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``His actions border on insubordination.''
</P>
<P>
   Zacarias has rarely, if ever, enjoyed unconditional support from
the school board. The 33-year Los Angeles Unified veteran was
appointed by a 5-2 vote on May 2, 1997. He took office that July.

BENJAMIN WAIVED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Now that coach Phil Jackson has the dominant big man
he's always coveted, he plans to use him _ a lot. The Lakers cut
their only true backup center Thursday and that might mean
40-minute games for Shaquille O'Neal, Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Enigmatic veteran Benoit Benjamin figured to be O'Neal's primary
backup, but he was waived after the morning shootaround. Forward
John Salley, out of basketball the last three years, is now the
second-string center until Travis Knight returns from a sprained
ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed some people that have speed reaction to the ball,
recovery of the basketball, rebounding and so forth. . . . Benoit
didn't give us what we were looking for in that direction,''
Jackson said before the Lakers' 92-76 exhibition loss the Utah Jazz
at the Pond.
</P>
<P>
   But Benjamin was also the only Laker, aside from O'Neal, with
any bulk. The Lakers remain woefully thin at both power forward and
center, and Jackson hopes the front office can acquire a player who
can play both spots.
</P>
<P>
   As for O'Neal, ``I think he should be looking at 40 minutes a
night,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal hasn't averaged anything near that since 1993-94.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, apparently upset by Benjamin's departure, wore a hat
with the words ``Why Big Ben'' and scrawled ``Big Ben'' on the heel
of his left shoe. He wouldn't elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers also waived forward Stephen Howard, reducing the
roster to 15.
</P>
<P>
   Rough night: The Lakers finished the exhibition season 3-5 after
losing to the Jazz, against whom they open the season Tuesday in
Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal scored 31 points and Derek Fisher had 14, but the Lakers
otherwise struggled. Glen Rice went 0 for 10 from the field and the
bench combined to go 6 for 25.
</P>
<P>
   Spider's return: Salley looked like a long shot when he signed
with the Lakers, but he's now backed up his assertion that he
belongs here by effectively beating out Benjamin. He said he's not
surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. I came here for one reason, to be on the squad, back up
big fella,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Salley played limited minutes in the exhibition season, so his
stats have been modest. But he's performed well enough and has the
triangle-offense experience and veteran savvy the Lakers need.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't record charges (taken), they don't record attempted
blocked shots, they don't record boxing a guy out, they don't
record bothering a guy to the point where he's frustrated,'' Salley
said. ``They don't record positive influence when you step in the
game. Now watch those things when I step in the game and then tell
me if I'm doing what I'm supposed to do stat-wise.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson on Jordan: Jackson acknowledged that he spoke with
Michael Jordan over Labor Day weekend and inquired whether he might
have any itch to play basketball again.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he said no,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   But Jordan might appear at a Laker practice to provide some
on-court advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he'd be on the floor at some time messing around,''
Jackson said.

KINGS STEAL SPOTLIGHT FROM JAGR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the shadow of Jaromir Jagr, the Kings showed
there were plenty of stars left in Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   For most of Thursday night's 5-3 victory over the Pittsburgh
Penguins, the Kings couldn't take their eyes off Jagr, the two-time
scoring champion and reigning MVP who dazzled the crowd of 14,779
that included Wayne Gretzky and Mario Lemieux.
</P>
<P>
   But in a two-minute, 34-second stretch of midway through the
third period, the Kings scored three times and showed why they are
headed to Chicago with three straight victories and tied for the
best record in the Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``We proved that if we stick together, good things will
happen,'' said Ziggy Palffy, whose apparent game-winning goal with
10:16 was later ruled a Luc Robitaille tip-in. ``It doesn't matter
who scores. It matters who wins.''
</P>
<P>
   Jagr appeared to bury the Kings with a goal in the game's
opening minute against Stephane Fiset and a pretty assist less than
three minutes later. And it didn't look any better when they
trailed 2-1 heading into the third period. The Kings had won just
three of their last 33 under those conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jagr is so strong and so good, your head spins, especially
when he scores 42 seconds in,'' said defenseman Sean O'Donnell, who
tied the game at two with 7:21 gone in the second. ``He just blew
right by to score that goal. But we recovered. This is the kind of
game _ against a playoff team _ that we didn't win last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Palffy had three consecutive 40-goal season with the
New York Islanders, his first year with the Kings has so far been
played in more of a support role. Even though Robitaille's tip-in
nullified his fourth goal of the season, Palffy's 13 points put him
among the league leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not seeing the goals, but you are seeing the skill,''
coach Andy Murray said of Palffy. ``He's more well rounded than we
thought, and that's what we need.''
</P>
<P>
   When it wasn't Palffy or Robitaille or captain Rob Blake, who
played a hefty 29 minutes on defense, the Kings second line
provided balance and scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Audette got the Kings back in the game with a goal midway
through the second period. Eleven seconds after Robitaille's
game-winner, Glen Murray beat Pittsburgh goalie Peter Skudra. Bryan
Smolinski made it a sweep for the second line with an empty-net
goal in the final seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I look at that line, they made the difference on this
(3-1-1) homestand,'' Murray said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Jagr's goal in the first minute, it might have been the
one he didn't score early in the second period that was the true
measure of his greatness. When he raced with the puck to the left
of Fiset, he took three Kings defenders with him.
</P>
<P>
   Jagr simply slid the puck to a wide open John Slaney and that
was that.
</P>
<P>
   It made the Kings wonder if this was the same team that lost in
overtime the night before to the Anaheim Mighty Ducks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He certainly didn't play that way the night before,'' said
Murray, who watched the game at the Pond with his coaching staff.
``With the new building and all the excitement he really turned it
on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe he wants to play here?''
</P>
<P>
   Murray was kidding. Sort of.
</P>
<P>
   The coach had been frustrated when the Kings outshot Pittsburgh
17-6 in the first period yet trailed 1-0.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell said the turning point was Audette's goal, which cut
the Penguins lead to 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   On the play, Smolinski dug the puck out of the corner and passed
in front to defenseman Garry Galley, who slipped it to Audette on
Skudra's right side. Audette's first shot was stopped, but the puck
came back to him and he fired it over Skudra's left shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if they became complacent after leading 2-0, but
there was a big shift in momentum right there,'' said O'Donnell,
who was named the game's first star. ``We turned it on from
there.''

 DRAKE LANDED HERE _ OR WAS IT THERE?  &HT;     By CARL NOLTE 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The oldest mystery on the West Coast sailed out
of the mists of the past this week with two historians claiming
they had discovered the spot where Sir Francis Drake landed and
claimed North America for England.
</P>
<P>
   The two new sites are Campbell Cove, at Bodega Harbor in Sonoma
County, and Whale Cove, near Depoe Bay on the Oregon coast.
</P>
<P>
   Both men _ Brian Kelleher, who has discovered the Bodega Harbor
site, and Bob Ward, who says Drake landed in Oregon _ are sure they
have solved a question that has intrigued historians for
generations.
</P>
<P>
   Kelleher says the little cove just inside the entrance to Bodega
Harbor fits Drake's description exactly. Ward took the same
evidence and said it fits his Oregon cove to a T.
</P>
<P>
   Kelleher will produce an expert in 16th century navigation at
Bodega Harbor at high noon tomorrow to prove he's right.
</P>
<P>
   Ward says his Oregon cove is the first outpost of the British
Empire, and he rests his proof on old documents and a mysterious
English sword, now unfortunately lost.
</P>
<P>
   A third site is Agate Bay, near Bolinas, where earlier this year
a Drake admirer named George Epperson said he not only found the
site of Drake's landing but pieces of wood he was sure were part of
Drake's ship.
</P>
<P>
   Captain Raymond Aker of Palo Alto, head of the Drake Navigator's
Guild, says they are all wrong. As every schoolchild knows, he
says, Sir Francis Drake landed at Drake's Bay near Point Reyes on
the Marin coast.
</P>
<P>
   All one has to do is follow Sir Francis Drake Boulevard through
Marin to get to the spot, where most, but certainly not all,
historians think Drake came ashore.
</P>
<P>
   The new entries bring the grand total of Drake landing sites to
17, including Ano Nuevo Island on the San Mateo coast claimed by
Santa Cruz geologist Gerald Weber in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The Drake case has involved strange discoveries, old maps,
buried treasure and an elaborate hoax that fooled California's most
eminent historian and even the venerable Bancroft Library at the
University of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   The only facts known for sure were that Drake, who was the
foremost English seaman of his time, sailed from England on Dec.
13, 1577, on a secret mission _ to find the legendary Terra
Australis, and to raid the Spanish colonies on the west coast of
South America.
</P>
<P>
   He was a man ``of medium stature, merry, careful,'' the
Spaniards said, ``sharp, ruthless, well-spoken.'' He was a superb
navigator and leader. He attacked Spanish ships and sailed up the
American West Coast, looking for a safe harbor.
</P>
<P>
   He found a foggy bay, halfway around the world from England. He
repaired his ship, built a fort, amazed the natives and nailed a
brass plate to a post claiming the land for Queen Elizabeth. The
Indians, whom he called ``ye country people,'' thought he was a
god. Drake thought the country looked like England and called it
Nova Albion.
</P>
<P>
   Kelleher says Nova Albion is just inside Bodega Head, at a tiny
cove. Here, he says, Drake built his fort, took sightings of the
sun to determine the latitude, and repaired his ship, the Golden
Hinde.
</P>
<P>
   Kelleher says he was intrigued by the story, drove one day a few
years ago to Bodega Bay and by chance noticed some jumbled rocks.
Remains, he says, of Drake's stone fort, still there after 420
years.
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps some other wall, built by the Indians of the region,
or perhaps by the Russians, who first came to Bodega Bay in 1812 or
so.
</P>
<P>
   Ward bases his Oregon case _ outlined in a book called ``Lost
Harbor Found'' _ on documents from the time and a look at the Whale
Cove, which he says matches Drake's description. The flaw in his
reasoning is that Drake put the position of his Nova Albion harbor
at 38 degrees north latitude _ and the Oregon site is at 44
degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Ward says Drake was the father of his own mystery. He thinks
Drake altered his accounts of the voyage to throw the Spanish off
the track.
</P>
<P>
   He also says that an Oregon bootlegger found an ancient sword
that might have belonged to English mariners. It was marked, the
story goes, with a crown and the letters ``ER'' for ``Elizabeth
Regina.'' But he can't produce the sword. It was lost on a family
picnic in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Aker, the Drake Navigator's Guild president, says Ward's theory
is ``a fantasy'' and ``all wet.''
</P>
<P>
   And Kelleher's Bodega Bay site doesn't fit the description given
by Drake closely enough. Aker also doubts Epperson's discovery of
420-year-old wooden planks.
</P>
<P>
   All of these are illusions, Aker thinks. But the best of the
illusions was the supposed Plate of Brass, erected by Drake and
``discovered'' near San Quentin in 1936. It was such a good fake
that it fooled even Herbert Eugene Bolton, UC's premier California
historian.
</P>
<P>
   Pronounced authentic by Columbia University scientists in the
late '30s, it was found to be a piece of modern metal by tests in
1954.

NEW AIR POLLUTION RULES RESTRICT NAIL POLISH REMOVER
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By GLEN MARTIN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
In a move that could help prevent the daily release of tons of
smog-forming emissions, the California Air Resources Board set new
restrictions on nail polish remover and tire sealants.
<P>
   The board's decision is the latest in a series of regulations
dating from 1989 that tighten regulations on consumer products.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Carmichael, the executive director of Los Angeles' Coalition
for Clean Air, said the move was welcome, if ``incremental.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a step in the right direction,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Carmichael said most people are unaware that consumer products
are a major source of air pollution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, anything that gives off a pungent smell _ paint,
solvents, spray propellants _ is contributing emissions to the
air,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's action sets limits on the amount of volatile organic
compounds (VOCs) that can be contained in tire sealants and nail
polish removers.
</P>
<P>
   VOCs contribute significantly to smog, and many consumer
products are rich in them.
</P>
<P>
   ``While emissions from any one of these products are small,
together they contribute significantly to air pollution,'' said
resources board chairman Alan Lloyd.
</P>
<P>
   Under the ruling, cans of tire sealants may have VOC contents of
no more than 20 percent after 2004. Currently, there is no VOC
limit for tire sealant.
</P>
<P>
   The board also ruled that nail polish removers must have no VOCs
after 2004.
</P>
<P>
   The board has now regulated 17 categories of consumer products
for VOC content.
</P>
<P>
   The products include air fresheners, aerosol furniture products,
general purpose cleaners, glass cleaners, spray paints, adhesives,
degreasers and aerosol insecticides.
</P>
<P>
   The VOC content of some products has already been cut
dramatically, said Jerry Martin, a spokesman for the board.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aerosol deodorants were once about 90 percent propellants, and
they (the propellants) had a very high VOC content,'' said Martin.
``Now propellant content for deodorants is under 50 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   When all the restrictions are fully in place, smog emissions in
California will be reduced by 125 to 150 tons per day, said Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several of the products we restricted earlier have gone
through additional evaluation and additional regulation,'' said
Martin. ``We think we're about at the point where we (have phased)
down things as much as we can _ we're getting the best possible air
protection, but the products are still functional.''

 WOOLSEY AFTER ROW  &HT;     By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Lynn Woolsey of Petaluma got a warm welcome at
the White House Thursday after being ejected from a Senate Foreign
Relations Committee hearing by Chairman Jesse Helms on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Woolsey, joined by several other Democratic House women, met
with White House Chief of Staff John Podesta, securing a promise of
President Clinton's help in pushing for ratification of the United
Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of
Discrimination Against Women.
</P>
<P>
   Woolsey said she was invited to the White House by political
adviser Ann Lewis, and she also won a pledge of support from
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. Podesta promised Woolsey
that Clinton would send another letter to the Senate requesting
ratification and would raise the public profile of the treaty,
which is broadly described as an international bill of rights for
women.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question we were recognized yesterday for having an
issue that's important to this nation,'' Woolsey said. ``What we
have to do is address how one man can stand in the way of
democracy, because the women of the House are committed to moving
(the treaty) forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton presented the U.N. treaty to the Senate for ratification
in 1994, but Helms, a North Carolina Republican, has blocked it
ever since, and Woolsey said he has refused to meet with her to
discuss how to move it forward.
</P>
<P>
   Woolsey led a protest with nine other House Democratic women on
Wednesday, walking in on the Senate committee hearing on China's
human rights policy and carrying signs with large copies of the
treaty.
</P>
<P>
   When Woolsey demanded a hearing, Helms said, ``You know, you're
out of order, and I would not be discourteous to you where you
work. Now please be a lady. ... You are not going to be heard.''
</P>
<P>
   The women were escorted from the room by police officers.
</P>
<P>
   A White House spokeswoman said officials called the meeting
Thursday after hearing about the dustup with Helms, who seldom
shies away from battles with the administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to let them know we are supportive of this treaty
and will assist them any way we can,'' said spokeswoman Elizabeth
Newman.
</P>
<P>
   Helms may be softening his resistance to meeting with Woolsey,
which she said he has refused to do for more than two months.
</P>
<P>
   California Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer said she spoke with
Helms Thursday and that he seemed ``extremely receptive'' to
meeting with the House women and Boxer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked him if he would please reconsider,'' Boxer said,
saying the women he ejected from his hearing room ``have very
strong feelings on this. I asked if he would meet with them and
that I would be present. He seemed extremely receptive to that
request.''
</P>
<P>
   Boxer, a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, said she is
working with Helms' staff to schedule a meeting. Boxer also said
she promised to work with Woolsey to plan a strategy session
between House and Senate women ``if we don't have an answer from
Jesse Helms on a meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   Helms' office did not return calls Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The row has won Woolsey some of the widest press coverage of her
four terms in Congress, both nationally and in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   Woolsey said she was cheered at a meeting of House Democrats and
praised by Minority Leader Dick Gephardt.
</P>
<P>
   She also said her office has been ``inundated'' with e-mails and
calls from her Marin and Sonoma district and around the country,
including Helms' home state of North Carolina, praising her action.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-San Francisco, did not attend the White
House soiree. Pelosi's participation in Wednesday's protest had
drawn a rebuke from Helms' office, which accused her of
interrupting an important hearing on human rights in China with ``a
juvenile political stunt.''
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi's office said she did not go to the White House because
she was working on the Labor and Health and Human Services
appropriations bill.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-discrimination treaty was adopted by the United Nations
in 1979 and has been signed by 165 countries, but it was never
ratified by the U.S. Senate, where treaties require a two-thirds
majority.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-article treaty defines discrimination as ``any
distinction, exclusion or restriction made on the basis of sex ...
in the political, economic, social, cultural, civil or any other
field.'' It requires nations to take ``all appropriate measures,
including legislation, to ensure the full development and
advancement of women.''
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Board of Supervisors formally added ``local
implementation'' of the treaty to San Francisco's Administrative
Code on April 13, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But even if Helms, an outspoken U.N. critic, were to relent, the
treaty's chances for passage remain slim, a Senate leadership aide
said.

 BUSH CASTS LONG SHADOW AT GOP DEBATE  &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HANOVER, N.H. _ Five Republican rivals for the White House found
two matters upon which they could agree Thursday night _ the
federal tax code must be destroyed, and their party should rethink
its coronation of George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In a fast-paced town hall meeting that included the entire
Republican field _ minus Bush _ candidates offered conservative,
free-market responses to questions ranging from military spending
and health care to education and gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   The format of the hourlong event permitted each candidate to
speak for less than 10 minutes _ and never for more than 90 seconds
at a time. Closing statements in the nationally televised forum
were limited to 20 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   It was enough time for several candidates to take pointed shots
at the Texas governor, who remains a prohibitive favorite to win
the GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bush declined to participate in the debate, saying he wanted to
be with his wife as she received an award from Southern Methodist
University, her alma mater.
</P>
<P>
   The explanation was widely dismissed by political observers and
ridiculed by his opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps in the future at a forum like this, if we call it a
fund-raiser, he might show up,'' said Steve Forbes derisively,
mocking Bush's record-size campaign treasury.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring the GOP's ``11th commandment'' not to criticize one
another, Forbes aides distributed a 75-page document to reporters
before the debate that accused Bush of raising taxes in Texas and
increasing spending ``faster than Bill Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   While Forbes was the most critical, other candidates also took
their shots at the front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not being here is a big mistake,'' said Sen. Orrin Hatch,
R-Utah, who attributed Bush's absence to his huge advantage in fund
raising and public opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's about money, why don't we just pick Bill Gates and
have him do it?'' Hatch said after the event.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush juggernaut has shown signs of vulnerability in recent
weeks. His high poll numbers have fallen, most noticeably in New
Hampshire, where a 30-point lead earlier this year has dropped to
between 12 to 15 points.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Sen. John McCain, Bush's closest rival, declined to
criticize him directly but said it is important for New Hampshire
voters to ``see us, to talk to us, to hear what we have to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Though New Hampshire has only slightly more registered
Republicans than Santa Clara County, its first-in-the-nation
primary _ scheduled for February 1 _ is a crucial proving ground
for any White House aspirant.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the debate, Bush agreed to a five-minute interview with
WMUR, the Manchester television station that broadcast the debate,
to explain his decision to remain in Texas while the other
candidates met face to face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry I'm not there,'' Bush said. ``I have a lot to say.
But I hope the people understand I love my wife and I want to honor
Laura.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he'll campaign in New Hampshire next week. ``At every
stop I answer questions and lay out my vision for America, and it
seems to me that the people of New Hampshire accept my vision and
want me to be the nominee,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many New Hampshirites said Bush's absence was a problem but one
that could be corrected easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Hampshire voters expect to see the candidates,'' said
James Wright, president of Dartmouth College, which hosted the town
hall meeting.
</P>
<P>
   But Wright said there is plenty of time for Bush to redeem
himself by showing up at future events. Bush has agreed to appear
in a forum December 2 in Manchester.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think voters really care if you miss one (debate) _ as
long as your excuse is good,'' said Steve Duprey, chairman of the
New Hampshire Republican Party. ``If he were to not show up again
and again, it would be a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain repeatedly pushed his plan to reform campaign financing,
even fitting it into a response to a question on medicinal
marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   On the question itself, McCain said he opposes the use of
marijuana for any purpose, saying: ``The moment it enters your
body, it does damage and can become addictive and can be a gateway
drug.''
</P>
<P>
   Each of the candidates said they support eliminating the current
tax code and replacing it with a simple flat tax. Forbes, noting
that he has been advocating such a plan for years, used the
agreement to note: ``It goes to show that education works. Some are
slower than others _ but they all come along.''
</P>
<P>
   Dartmouth music professor Steve Swayne, a recent transplant from
Berkeley, asked if Forbes would permit gays to serve in his
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes said he would hire anyone who is qualified, but added,
``If a person wants a job to make a statement _ they won't get
it.'' The diverging attitudes on gays was made clear before the
debate began as candidates took a few predebate questions from the
audience.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he would not tolerate ``discrimination in the party
of Lincoln,'' while Alan Keyes, a blunt spoken  &LR; radio talk-show
host ,  &LR; and former State Department official, said, ``Homosexuality
is an abomination.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Reagan administration official Gary Bauer said that
``marriage is between a man and a woman, not between two men, two
women or any other combination.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hatch added, ``Gays are human beings, too.''
</P>
<P>
   An unidentified woman interrupted the debate in the first couple
of minutes demanding that military spending be cut in favor of
schools and health care. She was removed by police.

 WRONG GUY GOT HIS GONG RUNG  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ How about if we make a trade:
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco gets four more years of Steve Young, and Willie
Brown goes to the sidelines for an indefinite period of time to
have his head examined.
</P>
<P>
   Or a straight job swap: Steve becomes mayor; Willie becomes
49ers' quarterback. The young fella wants a political career, why
not start here? The old dude's got some shifty moves and he can
really sling the bull _ I mean, ball.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, the fates are sealed. Young's QB days are numbered. And
Willie Brown is your next mayor, easily, after the pesky formality
of a runoff election. All the debating and campaigning and
mudslinging and soul-searching was simply theater.
</P>
<P>
   I realized the global significance of Willie when I was watching
the Miss Universe pageant and one of the contestants, Miss Lower
Antilles, said during the existential philosophy &AMP; swimsuit
competition, ``If I had three wishes, I would wish for world peace,
an end to hunger and Willie Brown as mayor of San Francisco only
without the yucky stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Since it is election time and people become very serious, I
should point out that I was kidding in that last paragraph. Miss
Lower Antilles didn't mention hunger.
</P>
<P>
   Willie is a marvel, a super-intelligent whirlwind, the life of
the party. He should wear a lampshade instead of that Elliot Ness
fedora.
</P>
<P>
   But the yucky stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Like Charlie Walker. Willie's pal and financial backer did hard
prison time for ripping off the city's minority contracting system,
but once Willie became mayor, Charlie eased back into the fold,
even without the paperwork that would have been required of a
normal citizen, let alone a convicted felon.
</P>
<P>
   Why was Brown willing to forgive and forget Walker's past sins,
while his henchmen were digging up even older dirt on mayoral
candidate Clint Reilly?
</P>
<P>
   Even the little stuff will wear you out. Angelo Quaranta,
part-owner of a Russian Hill restaurant, is president of the
Parking &AMP; Traffic Commission, appointed by Brown. Quaranta
encourages customers to park in various illegal zones outside his
restaurant. Yes, I have witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   When an officer ticketed a diner's car that was blocking a fire
hydrant, not only did Quaranta go berserk, so did Willie, berating
the ticket-writer  &UR; and  &LR; the night commander of Central Station.
</P>
<P>
   Abuses and misuses of power.
</P>
<P>
   Grandma Alioto says it best. That's Angela Alioto, who would
have challenged Willie in this race but chose not to abandon her
law practice. Angela _ full name Angela Mia Alioto Veronese _
became a  &UR; nonna  &LR; Tuesday when daughter Angela Mia gave birth to the
breathtakingly  &UR; bellissima  &LR; Chiara Mia Alioto-Lind.
</P>
<P>
   Be sure to pick up the new CD, ``Pavarotti Sings the Names of
the Alioto Girls.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, the very liberal Nonna Alioto says she can't vote for
Tom Ammiano for two reasons. One, Tom announced that he doesn't
plan to win, so why burn a vote? Two, Angela the liberal is a big
gay-rights supporter, and she figures if you're going to vote for
gay rights, that vote has to go to Willie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in Italy watching TV,'' Alioto says, ``and on the news
they showed the ceremony at City Hall where Willie `married' about
100 gay couples. That was gutsy, and he did it with pride. And he
has been on the forefront of gay rights for 32 years, long before
others were willing to stand up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Far be it from me to praise Willie Brown, but you must give
credit where due. He's right on the issues, but he's the head of a
big machine that I despise. If he'd get rid of the machine, stop
giving out contracts, he could be one of the greatest mayors in the
city's history.''
</P>
<P>
   See, there's the sad part. Some day the historians will convene
to select the all-time greatest San Francisco mayor, and Willie
will be outside, muttering, ``I coulda been a contendah.''
</P>
<P>
   Willie coulda been a Steve Young of a mayor _ pure of heart and
motive, free of scandal and suspicion, adored by all.
</P>
<P>
   No question, Brown has done good things. Example: His incredible
hard work, personality and powers of persuasion got a yes vote on
the 49ers stadium/mall. The project was a huge gamble, but the kind
of bold risk a real leader takes, with potential major payoff for
the city. It wasn't Willie's fault that the 49ers' owner decided to
commit a felony and shove the project off the stove.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's hard to say Brown has done a wonderful job with
the homeless, but unless Jesus comes back next week and brings
Mother Teresa and 5,000 shopping carts, that problem is going to be
brushed away by anyone.
</P>
<P>
   But man, there's all that other business.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's just a wild, incredible set of coincidences, but how
many more of Brown's friends/associates/
backers/bankrollers/dicerollers are going to wind up with their
pockets bulging with moolah and city contracts? Jack Davis earns
$330,000 for getting Willie to shop for an hour at a Home Depot.
Maybe the mayor was building a new credenza or gazebo.
</P>
<P>
   A.D. Wyatt Norton, a fringe candidate for mayor, said in a
debate Wednesday night, in reference to city government,
``Sometimes you gotta clean out the refrigerator.''
</P>
<P>
   If Willie would clean out his own fridge, scrape out the mold
and slime, he'd be the Martha Stewart of mayors.
</P>
<P>
   And if cable cars could fly, we wouldn't need Muni.

 &HT;    FOR HOUSE Y2K WATCHER, IT'S TIME TO WAIT AND SEE
 &HT;    Eds: updates 2nd graf to reflect Horn's absence at Y2K hearing.
 &HT;    Moving in (k) commentary and (f) financial categories for
release Sunday, Oct. 31.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the members of Congress who have spent years
trying to determine how much harm the Y2K computer bug will do on
Jan. 1, it's time to sit back and watch what happens. Neither the
House nor Senate plan any more hearings; President Clinton will
have to take it from here.
</P>
<P>
   The president ``needs to go out and talk to the American people
like Franklin Roosevelt did,'' said Rep. Steve Horn, R-Calif.,
chairman of the House subcommittee on technology. Horn, whose panel
last week held the final congressional hearing on Y2K, believes
Clinton ought to be using the less than nine weeks remaining to
urge people to prepare for possible short-term disruptions in
delivery of water, electricity and other basic services.
</P>
<P>
   Horn did much to publicize the Y2K problem by issuing report
cards assessing readiness among government agencies. He plans to
pass out a final set of marks Nov. 22. His grades have ranged from
straight A's for the Social Security Administration to early F's
for the State Department. Because many department heads were
embarrassed by their lousy grades, the report cards helped spur
reforms in many federal agencies.
</P>
<P>
   That government officials needed some cajoling on Y2K was not
surprising to Horn, who initially had a hard time believing the
glitch could cause so much trouble. The software flaw was embedded
in many computers in the 1960s and 1970s when programmers used only
two digits to represent a year. When the date rolls over from '99
to '00 in just weeks, many programs will interpret the new date as
1900, possibly causing computer and chip malfunctions. The glitch
could disrupt power plants, shut down traffic signals and much
more.
</P>
<P>
   When a staff member first told him about the problem in the
early spring of 1996, Horn assumed the story was an April fool's
joke. ``I said, 'You're pulling my leg.' ``
</P>
<P>
   But before long, computer experts persuaded Horn that his
subcommittee should find out whether federal agencies would be
prepared for 2000. Horn discovered that the Social Security
Administration, which calculates payouts based on birth dates, was
hard at work on the problem, but that other agencies were in denial
about Y2K's impact.
</P>
<P>
   Getting the White House to pressure Cabinet secretaries to
address the problem was difficult at first, Horn said, because
Clinton seemed ``blind-sided'' by the technology issue. By early
1998, the administration was moving on Y2K, but ``it wouldn't have
happened if not for Congress'' holding hearings, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Horn refuses to make predictions about what computerized systems
will fail Jan. 1. But he continues to urge Americans to have a
small stockpile of food, water and other necessities, in case they
get stuck in their homes for several days because of power
disruptions, traffic tie-ups or other difficulties. He fears people
will wait until the last days of December, then rush to the store
in a panic. He urges the president to ``talk softly,'' but
persuasively to get people to prepare.
</P>
<P>
   And where will Horn be on Dec. 31? In a bunker with beef jerky
and bottled water?
</P>
<P>
   ``On a plane,'' he said, flying from one coast to the other to
help demonstrate the Y2K-readiness of the air traffic control
system. But how can he and his wife party at midnight on a cramped
airplane? ``We've never celebrated New Year's Eve in 44 years of
marriage,'' he said. ``There'll be no party hats this year
either.''

subcommittee should find out whether federal agencies would be
prepared for 2000. Horn discovered that the Social Security
Administration, which calculates payouts based on birth dates, was
hard at work on the problem, but that other agencies were in denial
about Y2K's impact.
</P>
<P>
   Getting the White House to pressure Cabinet secretaries to
address the problem was difficult at first, Horn said, because
Clinton seemed ``blind-sided'' by the technology issue. By early
1998, the administration was moving on Y2K, but ``it wouldn't have
happened if not for Congress'' holding hearings, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Horn refuses to make predictions about what computerized systems
will fail Jan. 1. But he continues to urge Americans to have a
small stockpile of food, water and other necessities, in case they
get stuck in their homes for several days because of power
disruptions, traffic tie-ups or other difficulties. He fears people
will wait until the last days of December, then rush to the store
in a panic. He urges the president to ``talk softly,'' but
persuasively to get people to prepare.
</P>
<P>
   And where will Horn be on Dec. 31? In a bunker with beef jerky
and bottled water?
</P>
<P>
   ``On a plane,'' he said, flying from one coast to the other to
help demonstrate the Y2K-readiness of the air traffic control
system. But how can he and his wife party at midnight on a cramped
airplane? ``We've never celebrated New Year's Eve in 44 years of
marriage,'' he said. ``There'll be no party hats this year
either.''

<P>
   SYPHILIS _ The idea of a syphilis outbreak among teenagers in
Rockdale County may have shocked many Atlantans, but it came as
little surprise to teens like 15-year-old Katie Monaghan. A high
school sophomore in Forsyth County, Monaghan has spent the past
year and a half as a peer educator for the AIDS service
organization AID Atlanta. She can tell you stories about classmates
who can't remember how many people they've slept with, who can't
get the birth control pill but have unprotected sex anyway, who
don't know what to do about a rash on their genitals. The right
tools exist to help sexually active teens, but most aren't taking
advantage of them. (Kim, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 30.
HEARTATTACKS _ A heart to heart interview with Jim Sackett.
Angioplasty saved the news anchor, but is cardiology's most common

   JIMMYDEAN _ CHAFFIN'S BLUFF, Va. _ Entertainer and sausage baron
Jimmy Dean, who makes his home in a James River mansion just south
of Richmond, became famous with his 1961 song ``Big Bad John.'' Now
he's stirred up a ruckus among some Virginians who claim he's
throwing his sausage money around trying to win a contest for a new

   RELIGION-WITCHES _ Whether cursed or cutesy, the entertainment
value of witchcraft, magic and the occult is tried and true. From
``MacBeth'' to ``The Wizard of Oz'' to ``Bewitched,'' writers and
producers have found audiences for what they stir up in their
studio cauldrons. Yes, part of the motivation is simply to add a
bit of spice _ eye of newt and toe of frog _ to the old worn dating
and family themes of past hit shows and movies. But there's more to
the current trend than that. (White, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

   REL-WINEMAKER _ He's the genial pastor winemaker of Miami
County, but right now, he's standing in the middle of his back
yard, frowning, rain pelting his cap, his thumb and forefinger
stroking his chin. There's no deep, ecclesiastical debate going on
in the mind of this Episcopalian rector. Mel Schlachter is trying
to decide whether to put his newly crushed red wine blend into an
oak barrel or a 60-gallon plastic container. Twice a year,
Schlachter's back yard and basement near downtown Troy turn into
winemaking heaven. (Dayton Daily News). 12. WITH PHOTOS.

   CBS-THEMESONG _ When the theme song plays to kick off Monday's

by an on-screen message that says, ``This music was made in
Dayton.'' The Early Show, hosted by Bryant Gumbel and Jayne
Clayson, will air Monday through Friday from 7 to 9 a.m. ET. The
show's theme _ an upbeat, contemporary tune called Sunrise _ was
composed by Dayton musician Chris Bowman. (Dayton Daily News). 15.

   COSELL-REVIEW _ Review of documentary ``Howard Cosell: Telling
It Like It Is,'' on 8-9 p.m., Monday, HBO. Cosell welcomed
controversy, never ran away from anything. (Thompson, Palm Beach

important new American opera by William Bolcom, based on Arthur
Miller's play, premiered by Chicago Lyric Opera this month. Subject
of a two-month series by the NY Times, ``Bioth of an Opera,'' and
of much speculation on why new American operas appear with great

   SF-MAYORAL (San Francisco) _ The real contest in San Francisco's
mayoral election Tuesday is which of incumbent Willie Brown's three
top challengers will break out of a virtual tie to challenge him in
a runoff, an Examiner/KTVU poll shows. With almost three in 10
voters undecided and the electorate overwhelmingly unhappy with its
choices, the race comes down to the candidates' final four days of

   DEER-HUNTING (Albany, N.Y.) _ Deer have a highly efficient sense

advantage, hunters spend millions of dollars each year on aerosols,
jells and liquids meant to either deceive or appeal to deer. But
one deer hunter expert says those are a waste of time and that
hunters are better off watching what they eat and drink. By DENNIS

what happens when you combine money and smarts. You get the New
York Yankees. Doesn't leave much for the less wealthy or brainy,

OPPRESSIVE SCORE DIMINISHES PERFORMANCE OF `MUSIC OF THE HEART' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   How do you ruin a perfectly sweet, charmingly acted movie about
inner-city kids learning to play the violin?
</P>
<P>
   You saddle it with a gloppy orchestral score, that's how. You
pile on triumphant swells at all available opportunities. And when
the action climaxes with an enchanting performance of Bach's
Concerto for Two Violins that draws a standing ovation at Carnegie
Hall, you pound filmgoers over the head with a superfluity of noisy
movie-music cliches that wipe out all memory of the Bach. Excuse us
for a moment while we state the obvious.
</P>
<P>
   Bach: good. Hackneyed, swooping strings and blowhard winds: bad.
This is a simple axiom, but the filmmakers behind ``Music of the
Heart'' seem to have forgotten it. Or at least Mason Daring seems
to have forgotten it, having provided sharper, much more
interesting scores for numerous John Sayles films. Here he seems
overcome by a desire to out-violin the violins, several dozen of
which are already prominently featured in the story.
</P>
<P>
   Written by Pamela Gray, directed by an uncharacteristically
mild-mannered Wes Craven (``Nightmare on Elm Street,'' both
``Screams'') and starring the always-convincing Meryl Streep,
``Music of the Heart'' is based on the true story of inner-city
music teacher Roberta Guaspari.
</P>
<P>
   It's a new twist on a few familiar tales part ``Rocky,'' part
``Mr. Holland's Opus'' and while none of it surprises, the sum is a
gentle and warmly sympathetic diversion. That is, minus the score.
</P>
<P>
   When we first meet Roberta, her husband has just left her and
she's cast adrift with two small boys, directionless and depressed.
Mom (Cloris Leachman) tells her to get a job. She gets one wrapping
gifts in a small-town department store, where she encounters Brian
(Aidan Quinn, donning dirty hair and leather), a roguish old
schoolmate who hooks her up with Janet, the principal of a gritty
New York City grammar school (Angela Bassett, tough cookie par
excellence).
</P>
<P>
   Overcoming all manner of resistance (lack of money, resentful
colleagues), Roberta starts up a music program using 50 violins she
bought in Greece her adulterous husband is in the Navy and her own
experience as a frustrated concert violinist.
</P>
<P>
   The classroom scenes are by far the film's most engaging,
featuring snappy face-offs between Streep and roomsful of
wisenheimer children. ``I don't wanna learn about no stupid
violins. Violins is for wimps,'' mutters one such pupil, DeSean,
setting himself up for a quickie lesson in art and empowerment.
</P>
<P>
   Which, really, is what it's all about. ``Music of the Heart''
beefs up Roberta's story with scenes involving her romance with
Brian, her struggles with her sons (played by four actors, among
them Kieran Culkin), her tangles with ex-convicts hired to renovate
her house and her budding friendship with Isabel, a hip fellow
teacher (Gloria Estefan). Each and every subplot is competently
acted, but the heart of the film lies elsewhere in Roberta's effort
to illuminate the lives of disadvantaged kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing is Naeem when he plays music, his whole
face lights up. You should see that,'' she says to one angry mom,
who's unimpressed with the ``dead white men's music'' being forced
down her son's throat.
</P>
<P>
   Does some of this condescend? Almost. One might infer from
Craven's movie that African-Americans know nothing about classical
music, or that every urban kid with a boombox needs to be saved
from the likes of Snoop Dogg. As the aforementioned angry mom
protests, ``You white women think you can come up and rescue these
poor inner-city children who didn't ask to be rescued.'' But as
Roberta explains, she's not out to rescue anybody; she just wants
to bring a little beauty, or at least a little arrangement of
``Twinkle, Twinkle,'' into their world.
</P>
<P>
   The Carnegie Hall climax, a benefit concert necessitated by
school budget cuts, delights. Violin aficionados should have a ball
with the cameos (Isaac Stern, Mark O'Connor, Joshua Bell, Arnold
Steinhardt and scads more), and the sight of tuxedoed urchins
performing in the world's premiere concert hall is cute beyond
reason. Craven deserves credit for not cutting the scene into
ribbons: We actually get to hear them play. And kudos to Streep,
who learned to play the violin for the film and acquits herself
convincingly throughout.
</P>
<P>
   If only the score were less oppressive less fortissimo, more
pianissimo ``Music of the Heart'' might sing.

MORNING SHOWS BRING RUSH HOUR TO MANHATTAN SIDEWALKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's time for morning television viewers to do some window
shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Come Monday, gridlock in Manhattan will more likely be on the
sidewalks than the streets, as CBS opens its street-front studio on
Fifth Avenue and 59th Street (the General Motors Building) for the
debut of ``The Early Show'' with Bryant Gumbel and co-anchor Jane
Clayson.
</P>
<P>
   Streetfront studios, now a requisite following the lead and
success of the ``Today'' show on NBC, provide a good backdrop for
the hosts while they are inside, as well as a chance to mingle with
newlyweds from Dubuque on the outside. ``The cost of admission,''
is what Gumbel said of the multimillion-dollar studios.
</P>
<P>
   That reality means viewers and New York tourists can choose
between Gumbel's new show, the dominant ``Today'' (Rockefeller
Plaza and 49th Street) and ABC's ``Good Morning America'' (Broadway
and 44th Street). (For those who can't get out of bed early, you
can mosey over to Broadway between 44th and 45th streets for
``Total Request Live'' from MTV's studios, airing weekdays at 3:30
p.m.)
</P>
<P>
   CBS has only been a dabbler in the morning TV arena, the one
segment of broadcast network television viewing that is growing.
But with a long-term commitment with a studio and Gumbel, CBS
believes ``GMA'' is vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   The question, of course, is will it be different. The answer, of
course, is no.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be different by the family you see on the air,'' said
entertainment reporter/weatherman Mark McEwen, a holdover from the
old ``This Morning'' show. ``The format is basically the same
wherever you go.''
</P>
<P>
   Morning shows usually break down into two one-hour segments: the
first half is more hard news (with the presumption more working
people are home), while the second hour is laden with features (for
the stay-at-home moms and others).
</P>
<P>
   CBS may be advised to go more for a hard-news bent than the
other shows for these reasons:
</P>
<P>
   _ To distinguish itself from the pack.
</P>
<P>
   _ To maximize Gumbel's interviewing skills.
</P>
<P>
   _ To minimize the impact of Gumbel's less-cuddly persona.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HARSH SENTENCE: Fox has already canned its Friday night lineup:
freshmen ``Harsh Realm'' and ``Ryan Caulfield: Year One'' (an
ironic title since there wasn't even a week three). ``Harsh Realm''
is the second Chris Carter show to be canceled by Fox in less than
a year, joining ``Millennium.'' And don't look for Carter's third
show, ``The X-Files,'' to be back next year.

KEEN NOSE GIVES DEER EDGE AGAINST PUNGENT HUNTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DENNIS APRILL  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Like humans, deer use the five senses to
interpret the world around them, especially to warn of danger.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike humans, who rely heavily on sight, whitetails have a
highly efficient sense of hearing and smell, the latter thought to
be 100 times more sensitive than humans.
</P>
<P>
   Many hunters focus on this sense of smell to either deceive or
attract a deer _ a formidable challenge. In his classic, ``The Deer
of North America,'' Leonard Lee Rue III points out that deer can
detect danger a half-mile away, and perhaps farther. Deer are
capable of such extraordinary smell because, according to Rue,
their nostrils are lined by epithelium, a cellular tissue
containing mucus membranes and sensory nerve endings that are far
more sensitive to odors than human noses.
</P>
<P>
   What does this mean to the average hunter? For one, low humidity
(10 to 20 percent) works against deer because their nasal passages
dry out, hampering their ability to capture scents. Rue concludes
that ideal scenting conditions favoring deer would be days with
breezes of 15 to 20 mph, mid-range humidity, and moderate
temperatures ranging from freezing on up _ conditions often found
during hunting season, especially the early part.
</P>
<P>
   To combat the whitetail's distinct advantage, hunters spend
millions of dollars each year on aerosols, jells and liquids meant
to either deceive or appeal to deer.
</P>
<P>
   These products can be divided into two basic types: masking
scents and attractants. Masking scents cover up or eliminate human
odor, which many successful hunters feel is more important than
trying to attract a deer. They use carbon-scented wash detergents,
odor-eliminating body sprays and even animal urine like those of
fox or skunk on their boots.
</P>
<P>
   All of this, according to expert deer hunter Dave Henderson, is
a waste of time if hunters aren't careful what they eat days before
they go out into the woods.
</P>
<P>
   In his book ``White Tales,'' he writes, ``Diet has a lot to do
with the way you smell, and there is no way to mask some odors.''
He adds that alcoholic beverages and scents from foods like garlic,
onions and hot peppers can seep through human pores for as long as
24 hours after consumption. One of the most persistent smells is
cigarette smoke. So it is not only important to mask natural human
smells, but to avoid adding even more potent ones to your body or
clothing.
</P>
<P>
   The other type of scents are the attractants _ food lures, sex
lures, or a combination of both. Food lures, like Essence of Apple,
are not as popular as the sexual attractants that come in many
forms, including Doe In Heat, Doe Estrus, and Tarsal Gland lures,
to name a few.
</P>
<P>
   But do they work? The key substances in attractants are
pheromones, chemical signals that evoke behavioral responses.
Because does go into estrus (heat) for only 24 hours two or three
times a year, it is very difficult for scent companies to acquire
``doe in heat'' urine, and research has shown that any pheromones
present in that urine dissipate quickly when put in the field.
</P>
<P>
   In a study done at the University of Georgia in Athens,
researchers took does in estrus, does not in estrus, buck urine and
salt water and sprayed each at designated areas in a large pen that
held deer. The researchers could detect no preference for any of
the solutions. The bucks visited the salt water site as often as
the doe in estrus sites.
</P>
<P>
   Some authors and deer hunters freshen deer scrapes with their
own urine or even cow urine.
</P>
<P>
   Does this mean the use of attractant scents are a waste of time
and money? Not at all. Henderson concludes, ``Virtually every
attractant scent on the market will work under the right
conditions. They are probably not sexual attractants but rather
signposts of an unfamiliar animal that are followed by curious
bucks eager to breed or challenge other suitors.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunters, then, can be thankful that curiosity is not just a
fatal attraction for cats.

HOSPITAL CHAPLAIN HELPS PARENTS COPE WITH INFANT DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ She is neither a doctor nor a nurse. But Glee
Miller, a chaplain at Christus Santa Rosa Hospital in San Antonio,
tries to help parents heal after losing a newborn child.
</P>
<P>
   Some parents are angry with their doctors or with God following
the loss of a child. Others feel guilty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't know what to do,'' said Michael Lopez, who along
with his wife, Jo Ann, lost their daughter earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez said a ``big weight was lifted'' after attending a session
of Angels Away, the support group Miller leads. ``I see everybody
here and see that we weren't the only ones,'' Lopez said.
</P>
<P>
   The first-floor conference room of the pastoral ministry
department at Santa Rosa was ringed with chairs clustered around
two boxes of facial tissues. Midway through the Angels Away
session, one box was empty.
</P>
<P>
   The gathering was the third one for Letty Simonton, whose baby
died earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look forward to coming,'' she said. ``I thought after awhile
the pain would go away. But it didn't just go away, so I come every
month.''
</P>
<P>
   Finding others who understand the pain is what Miller calls a
``lifeline'' for parents who may feel that their world has ended.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, 60, encourages group members to ``feel the feeling,'' as
long as they don't cause physical harm. Anger, for instance, can
spur people into action, often with positive results, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're angry enough, you'll come up fighting,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   An outpouring of support from friends and relatives helped
Georgia and David Kace accept the miscarriage of their third child.
</P>
<P>
   The couple was inundated with sympathy cards and food when word
of their loss spread. Writing thank-you notes prompted tears but
promoted healing for Georgia Kace.
</P>
<P>
   During a family trip to South Padre Island, the Kaces' two sons
tossed a shell in the baby's honor into the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Such concrete acts acknowledge the baby, the loss and the fact
that life's routines and expectations will be forever changed,
Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Miller has trained volunteers at St. Brigid Catholic Church to
launch an ancillary group called Rachel's Children.
</P>
<P>
   Both support groups welcome people of any faith and rely upon
confidentiality and sharing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to match the format of Angels Away,'' said Ruth
Cook, adult faith director at St. Brigid, adding that both groups
will coordinate their schedules to offer two meetings per month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people might need another group in two weeks, especially
around Christmas,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Miller has counseled hurting parents as a chaplain for 11 years.
``It's the hardest work I've ever done, and it's the best work I've
ever done,'' she said.

WHOOPING CRANES BEGIN ARRIVING AT WINTER HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first wave of whooping cranes has arrived at the Aransas
National Wildlife Refuge on the Texas Gulf Coast, where they will
spend the winter after the 2,500-mile migration from Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Wildlife officials are forecasting a record population this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday I counted 24 birds, including three chicks, in a
flyover,'' Jennifer Sanchez, manager of the adjacent Matagorda
Island Wildlife Refuge, said Thursday. She said the main influx is
expected Nov. 5 or 6.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is forecasting as many as 185
cranes, including about 15 chicks, up from the 182 cranes who
wintered in South Texas last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It runs in cycles. You'll see a big jump for a couple of years
and then we'll be stable for three or four years, which is where we
are now,'' Sanchez said.
</P>
<P>
   The tallest birds in North America, whooping cranes stand more
than five feet and were once scattered on wintering grounds from
Texas to the Carolinas. But by the 1940s, there were fewer than 20
birds in the wild, and the species was headed for extinction. The
refuge in Aransas County, about 35 miles north of Corpus Christi,
was established in 1937 to save the cranes, and each winter is home
to the only remaining wild colony.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in late October, the birds arrive in small groups
after spending the summer raising chicks in the Wood Buffalo
National Park in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   They begin the return flight to Canada in March, and by
mid-April, the last of the black-winged, red-capped birds is gone.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez said the birds she observed were busy dining on seafood
and setting up housekeeping after their long overland trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``The habitat looks good. We're a little concerned about a
drought we've been having, which causes the birds to go upland to
obtain fresh water, but generally its in good shape,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, about 15,000 people take boat tours of the crane
refuge.

A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MARKETS OF '29 AND TODAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDWARD IWATA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ On Monday, Oct. 28, 1929, the Dow Jones
industrial average tumbled 38 points _ nearly 13 percent. The next
day _ Black Tuesday _ stocks fell another 31 points, or 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Panic selling swept the stock market. Steel, gas and other
stocks were hit hard, losing up to 50 percent of their value.
Thousands of investors were wiped out. Banks and brokerage firms
closed.
</P>
<P>
   The crash and other economic factors would lead to the Great
Depression of the 1930s, which shattered the lives of millions of
Americans and changed the course of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   It took years of struggle and the gargantuan jolt of production
and employment during World War II for the economy to fully
recover.
</P>
<P>
   Today, market analysts believe a financial catastrophe of the
same horrific scale is highly unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Stronger regulations and enforcement have slowed wild
speculation and heavy swings in trading. Fraud and corruption no
longer dominate the stock markets. Stock and options exchanges have
upgraded their technology to safely handle higher trading volume.
And there are higher capital requirements for brokers and traders
to cover losses.
</P>
<P>
   Today's economy also is much stronger and more stable than it
was 70 years ago. And the Federal Reserve keeps a sharp eye on the
nation's money supply and economic performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a completely different world,'' said Charles Morris,
author of ``Money, Greed and Risk: Why Financial Crises and Crashes
Happen'' and a former Chase Manhattan executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The markets are much healthier today and they're much more
regulated,'' Morris said. ``A big market correction would certainly
be damaging, but it wouldn't trigger a 1930s-style downturn.''

CHRISTIAN WRITER OFFERS REASSURANCE ABOUT END-TIMES FEARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The new millennium is a scary, Halloween-type thing to many
Americans, says Max Lucado, a San Antonio minister who is one of
the nation's most popular Christian writers.
</P>
<P>
   Even though no one knows the time of Christ's return, the new
millennium brings to mind fearful visions of Judgment Day, Lucado
said this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``My own church members keep coming to me with wide-eyed
questions about the end of the world and Y2K,'' said Lucado, senior
minister of the Oak Hills Church of Christ in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Lucado preached a series of sermons to calm those fears. And
when this talented writer-preacher does a sermon series, it often
ends up being a bestselling book.
</P>
<P>
   It has happened again with Lucado's latest book, ``When Christ
Comes: The Beginning of the Very Best.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the popular ``Left Behind'' series by Tim LaHaye and
Jerry Jenkins, Lucado does not focus on the Antichrist or ``the
Rapture'' _ the belief that the faithful will be caught up to
heaven in the twinkling of an eye while others are left behind to
endure seven years of tribulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``My contribution to this is to tell everyone to calm down,''
Lucado said. ``I'm telling everyone to prepare to be peaceful.''
</P>
<P>
   In a study guide in his book, he advises those worried about the
last days to get a recording of Handel's ``Messiah'' and listen to
the ``Hallelujah Chorus'' as a reminder that ``the King of Kings
and Lord of Lords'' is coming back to earth.
</P>
<P>
   But Lucado's book isn't comforting to everybody. Despite calming
words, he asserts that there is a hell where nonbelievers will
suffer forever. And he acknowledges that even believers can be
frightened during the end times.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't want to discuss the return of Christ,'' he
writes. ``It makes them nervous that they could be turned away at
the door. They may be God-fearing and church-attending, but still
really nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   His focus, though, is on the love of God and how people should
be prepared for Christ's return by being at their very best.
</P>
<P>
   Lucado, 44, who spoke recently at the National Prayer Breakfast
in Washington, has had an amazing career as a writer. His 1998 book
``Just Like Jesus'' was on the Publisher's Weekly religious
bestseller list for 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   His writing is a gift of God, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been surprised that people like my writing. I've
tried to figure it out. I loved writing, even as a little boy,'' he
said. ``I loved football and baseball, too. I guess God decided to
let Max have this gift (o writing). A lot of gifts he didn't give
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucado grew up in the oilfields at Andrews in West Texas and
went to Sunday school frequently. But during his teen years he did
not always follow a straight-and-narrow path.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm basically a recovered drunk,'' he said. ``I could drink a
six-pack of beer and not even feel it. I was well on my way to
alcoholism.''
</P>
<P>
   But during his senior year in high school, he decided there must
be something better than drinking beer all night.
</P>
<P>
   He enrolled at Abilene Christian College, which is affiliated
with the Churches of Christ.
</P>
<P>
   ``Down deep I was hoping that my college days would give me some
answers,'' he said. He found them.
</P>
<P>
   During his sophomore year, he made a strong profession of faith
and committed his life to ministry. He and his wife, Denalyn, spent
five years as missionaries in Brazil, where two of their three
daughters were born.
</P>
<P>
   His first book, ``On the Anvil,'' came out in 1986 and was a
collection of columns he had written for church bulletins in a
congregation in Miami where he served as minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't too proud of it, but it got me started,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He still preaches almost every Sunday at his church, which
recently moved into a new building. The church has grown from an
average attendance of 500 to 3,000 during his 11 years there. He
doesn't accept a salary because the royalties from his books
provide ample income.
</P>
<P>
   All of his books have grown out of his sermons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I'm a writer who preaches or a preacher who
writes,'' Lucado said.

 &HT;    COELHO CASTS SHADOW ON GORE'S 'HIGHER STANDARDS' CLAIM
 &HT;    1100 and add. Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics
categories for release Sunday, Oct. 31.
 &HT;    With photo.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD and JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore bragged about the ``higher
standards'' of his campaign finance apparatus in his first
nationally televised appearance with challenger Bill Bradley in New
Hampshire last week.
</P>
<P>
   But at the top of Gore's campaign organizational pyramid sits
Tony Coelho, an former California congressman who some critics say
helped usher in the era of ``big money'' in politics that Gore
vowed to ``fight my heart out'' to end if elected president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coelho helped create a system that is very damaging to the
country,'' said Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, a
non-partisan group seeking curbs on campaign money. ``Washington is
a city that floats on political influence money. Tony Coelho didn't
create that, but he made his contribution.''
</P>
<P>
   CNN correspondent Brooks Jackson documented Coelho's
contribution in the book
</P>
<P>
   ``Honest Graft,'' published in 1988 when Jackson worked for The
Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He pressures business lobbyists for campaign money in ways
that sometimes amount to intimidation,'' Jackson wrote of Coelho,
then chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee
(DCCC), the party's primary vehicle for electing and re-electing
Democrats to the House.
</P>
<P>
   Coelho abruptly resigned from Congress in 1989 amid revelations
that he had borrowed money from a prominent Democratic contributor
and had not reported the loan on his congressional ethics form.
</P>
<P>
   He was not charged with any wrongdoing, and told the San
Francisco Chronicle this spring that ``there were no violations on
my part.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been investigated ... and vetted by everybody,'' Coelho
told the newspaper. ``The Reagan-Bush Justice Department
investigated me for two years, and they gave me a clean bill of
health.''
</P>
<P>
   Coelho has refused repeated requests for an interview in recent
weeks as new controversies have arisen from a diplomatic mission he
undertook for the Clinton administration. He said he prefers to
``remain focused'' on the Gore campaign, now entering the final
months before the first caucus and primary voting next January and
February.
</P>
<P>
   Those who know Coelho well credit him with bringing the same
kind of focus and energy to Gore's presidential campaign that he
brought to the job of chairman of the DCCC in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Coelho, 57, took over as chairman of the Gore campaign last May
amid the first signs of a stronger-than-expected challenge from
Bradley, a former senator from New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a high-energy person who is result-oriented,'' said Mike
Andrews, a former Democratic congressman from Texas who served in
the House with Coelho. Bringing Coelho on board sent a message to
Democrats that the Gore campaign would be ``disciplined and
tough,'' said Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in the months since Coelho took over, the Gore campaign
has undergone a complete face lift. It has moved from Washington to
Nashville. It has rid itself of some of the advisers whose high
salaries were draining away critical funds. And it has broken
through the bubble of the vice presidency, allowing Gore to get
closer to voters with a more carefully honed message of ``fighting
for working families.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's running a very strong campaign,'' House Minority Leader
Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., said of Coelho after his former colleague
secured the important endorsement of the AFL-CIO for the vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all Coelho's political skills _ even GOP consultants
grudgingly describe him as an effective decision-maker and
energizer _ his presence gives Republicans unlimited opportunities
to needle the vice president, especially on ethical matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Al Gore heads for the hills of Tennessee, he ought to
listen to Tammy Wynette and get a D-I-V-O-R-C-E from Tony Coelho,''
Republican National Committee Chairman Jim Nicholson faxed to the
news media as the Gore campaign was moving its headquarters to
Nashville. ``You'd think that Gore would have learned by now that
sometimes it just doesn't pay to stand by your man.''
</P>
<P>
   But standing by Coelho is exactly what Gore has done, even as
his campaign chairman has been caught up again in accusations of
financial irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   Coelho is doing a ``terrific job'' as campaign chairman, Gore
told CBS this month, brushing aside reports of Coelho's
questionable management practices as head of the U.S. pavilion at
the 1998 world's fair in Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Public Integrity, a non-partisan watchdog group
in Washington, had just zinged Coelho for not reporting a $300,000
personal loan from a Portuguese bank while he was the U.S.
commissioner general of the 1998 World Exposition in Lisbon. Coelho
recently paid off the remaining $119,000 of the loan.
</P>
<P>
   A probe by the State Department's inspector general had also
criticized Coelho, the son of Portuguese immigrants, for
intermingling private and official activities during the
exposition.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department report also noted that Coelho had taken an
$18,000-a-month Lisbon apartment and rented a chauffeur-driven
Mercedes while vans stood idle, had put his niece on the payroll,
and had authorized $26,000 to repay an employee's expenses that a
government lawyer advised against paying.
</P>
<P>
   When the U.S. pavilion closed at the end of the fair, it left
behind lawsuits and financial loose ends.
</P>
<P>
   Coelho's attorney, Stanley Brand, asserted that his client did
nothing wrong, though there might have been some ``management
lapses'' during the exposition.
</P>
<P>
   He noted, however, that Coelho received no salary as the
commissioner general and that he had ``devoted two years of his
life and spent substantial amounts of his own money.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who has long boasted of helping to rid the federal
government of waste and fraud, showed little interest in the
particulars of the recent revelations, dismissing them as ``inside
baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato, an
expert on political scandal, said Coelho's political skills, while
considerable, ``may not be worth the additional baggage'' for the
Gore campaign, already saddled with ``Clinton fatigue.''
</P>
<P>
   But veteran Democratic consultant James Carville said attacks on

tried it ourselves and it just doesn't work,'' Carville said. ``The
issue is the candidate, not his staff.''

<P>
   Elected to Congress in 1978, Coelho rose to the No. 3 job in the
Democratic majority before resigning over the loan, which he used
to buy $100,000 in junk bonds that eventually brought him a
reported profit of about $6,800.
</P>
<P>
   Since leaving Congress, Coelho has made a fortune as a
deal-maker on Wall Street and now serves on the boards of more than
a dozen corporations.
</P>
<P>
   His stint with the Gore campaign is his second effort at
political redemption since his resignation from Congress. He was
tapped by President Clinton in 1994 to help prevent a Republican
takeover of Congress, but he failed in the face of Newt Gingrich's
campaign fashioned around a GOP ``Contract With America.''
</P>
<P>
   He is volunteering his services to Gore, receiving no salary for
work weeks that typically stretch beyond 80 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Advisers who run a successful presidential campaign often move
on to key White House positions, but Coelho told the Chronicle that
a condition of accepting his current position was that the vice
president would not consider him for a job in a Gore
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has called Coelho a ``close friend,'' but their closeness
appears to date from working together during the Clinton
administration. The pair had been only ``casual friends'' when both
were serving in the House, recalled Roy Neel, a former aide and
confidant of Gore. But as Coelho is fond of telling campaign aides
now, Gore took the time to walk across from the Senate to attend
Coelho's going-away party a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Years earlier, Gore and Coelho each experienced a period of
religious introspection. Coelho went through dark despair after
learning he could not become a Roman Catholic priest. An epilepsy
sufferer, he was excluded from ordination by ancient church law.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, returning from serving as an Army reporter in Vietnam,
spent a year sorting through the bitterness and doubts surrounding
the war at Vanderbilt University's Divinity School.
</P>
<P>
   Both decided to funnel their energies into politics.

 &HT;    COELHO CASTS SHADOW ON GORE'S 'HIGHER STANDARDS' CLAIM
 &HT;    1100 and add. Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics
categories for release Sunday, Oct. 31.
 &HT;    With photo.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore bragged about the ``higher
standards'' of his campaign finance apparatus in his first
nationally televised appearance with challenger Bill Bradley in New
Hampshire last week.
</P>
<P>
   But at the top of Gore's campaign organizational pyramid sits
Tony Coelho, an former California congressman who some critics say
helped usher in the era of ``big money'' in politics that Gore
vowed to ``fight my heart out'' to end if elected president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coelho helped create a system that is very damaging to the
country,'' said Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, a
non-partisan group seeking curbs on campaign money. ``Washington is
a city that floats on political influence money. Tony Coelho didn't
create that, but he made his contribution.''
</P>
<P>
   CNN correspondent Brooks Jackson documented Coelho's
contribution in the book
</P>
<P>
   ``Honest Graft,'' published in 1988 when Jackson worked for The
Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He pressures business lobbyists for campaign money in ways
that sometimes amount to intimidation,'' Jackson wrote of Coelho,
then chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee
(DCCC), the party's primary vehicle for electing and re-electing
Democrats to the House.
</P>
<P>
   Coelho abruptly resigned from Congress in 1989 amid revelations
that he had borrowed money from a prominent Democratic contributor
and had not reported the loan on his congressional ethics form.
</P>
<P>
   He was not charged with any wrongdoing, and told the San
Francisco Chronicle this spring that ``there were no violations on
my part.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been investigated ... and vetted by everybody,'' Coelho
told the newspaper. ``The Reagan-Bush Justice Department
investigated me for two years, and they gave me a clean bill of
health.''
</P>
<P>
   Coelho has refused repeated requests for an interview in recent
weeks as new controversies have arisen from a diplomatic mission he
undertook for the Clinton administration. He said he prefers to
``remain focused'' on the Gore campaign, now entering the final
months before the first caucus and primary voting next January and
February.
</P>
<P>
   Those who know Coelho well credit him with bringing the same
kind of focus and energy to Gore's presidential campaign that he
brought to the job of chairman of the DCCC in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Coelho, 57, took over as chairman of the Gore campaign last May
amid the first signs of a stronger-than-expected challenge from
Bradley, a former senator from New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a high-energy person who is result-oriented,'' said Mike
Andrews, a former Democratic congressman from Texas who served in
the House with Coelho. Bringing Coelho on board sent a message to
Democrats that the Gore campaign would be ``disciplined and
tough,'' said Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in the months since Coelho took over, the Gore campaign
has undergone a complete face lift. It has moved from Washington to
Nashville. It has rid itself of some of the advisers whose high
salaries were draining away critical funds. And it has broken
through the bubble of the vice presidency, allowing Gore to get
closer to voters with a more carefully honed message of ``fighting
for working families.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's running a very strong campaign,'' House Minority Leader
Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., said of Coelho after his former colleague
secured the important endorsement of the AFL-CIO for the vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all Coelho's political skills _ even GOP consultants
grudgingly describe him as an effective decision-maker and
energizer _ his presence gives Republicans unlimited opportunities
to needle the vice president, especially on ethical matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Al Gore heads for the hills of Tennessee, he ought to
listen to Tammy Wynette and get a D-I-V-O-R-C-E from Tony Coelho,''
Republican National Committee Chairman Jim Nicholson faxed to the
news media as the Gore campaign was moving its headquarters to
Nashville. ``You'd think that Gore would have learned by now that
sometimes it just doesn't pay to stand by your man.''
</P>
<P>
   But standing by Coelho is exactly what Gore has done, even as
his campaign chairman has been caught up again in accusations of
financial irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   Coelho is doing a ``terrific job'' as campaign chairman, Gore
told CBS this month, brushing aside reports of Coelho's
questionable management practices as head of the U.S. pavilion at
the 1998 world's fair in Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Public Integrity, a non-partisan watchdog group
in Washington, had just zinged Coelho for not reporting a $300,000
personal loan from a Portuguese bank while he was the U.S.
commissioner general of the 1998 World Exposition in Lisbon. Coelho
recently paid off the remaining $119,000 of the loan.
</P>
<P>
   A probe by the State Department's inspector general had also
criticized Coelho, the son of Portuguese immigrants, for
intermingling private and official activities during the
exposition.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department report also noted that Coelho had taken an
$18,000-a-month Lisbon apartment and rented a chauffeur-driven
Mercedes while vans stood idle, had put his niece on the payroll,
and had authorized $26,000 to repay an employee's expenses that a
government lawyer advised against paying.
</P>
<P>
   When the U.S. pavilion closed at the end of the fair, it left
behind lawsuits and financial loose ends.
</P>
<P>
   Coelho's attorney, Stanley Brand, asserted that his client did
nothing wrong, though there might have been some ``management
lapses'' during the exposition.
</P>
<P>
   He noted, however, that Coelho received no salary as the
commissioner general and that he had ``devoted two years of his
life and spent substantial amounts of his own money.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who has long boasted of helping to rid the federal
government of waste and fraud, showed little interest in the
particulars of the recent revelations, dismissing them as ``inside
baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato, an
expert on political scandal, said Coelho's political skills, while
considerable, ``may not be worth the additional baggage'' for the
Gore campaign, already saddled with ``Clinton fatigue.''
</P>
<P>
   But veteran Democratic consultant James Carville said attacks on
advisers to presidential candidates are often ineffective. ``We've
tried it ourselves and it just doesn't work,'' Carville said. ``The
issue is the candidate, not his staff.''
</P>
<P>

The backdrop for all this is the Missouri forfeit issue -- there's
no way the feds should have ever been involved in the first place.

TIME IS TOO PRECIOUS TO CHANGE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONNIE CAPLANE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PIEDMONT, Calif. _ It's that time of year again when you don't
have to leave your living room to get jet lag. It's time to change
the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``What time is it?'' I'll ask my husband several times during
the first week after the change. ``Is that the real time or just
what the clock says?''
</P>
<P>
   ``What the clock says IS the real time,'' he'll say.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not. The clock says whatever time I make it say. My
internal timekeeper isn't reset quite so easily.
</P>
<P>
   Spring forward, fall back.
</P>
<P>
   Twice every year, we add or take away an hour. And just like
that, your external world and internal reality go out of sync.
</P>
<P>
   You're still at the office but your stomach tells you it's time
for dinner. It's like living in a poorly dubbed movie when the
words keep coming after the lips stop moving.
</P>
<P>
   Spring forward, fall back.
</P>
<P>
   The time change even disturbs my dogs. Sometime during the next
week I'll step out of my bedroom and into a puddle. Sitting in a
corner will be a very embarrassed dog whose only crime was letting
me sleep although his bladder said I should be up.
</P>
<P>
   Fall back. Fall back. Fall back.
</P>
<P>
   I repeat this to myself as I walk through the house changing
wall clocks, alarm clocks, table clocks, wristwatches, clock radios
and appliance clocks.
</P>
<P>
   My house already has several time zones. Microwave time is seven
minutes fast. It's the one we see from the kitchen table, the one
the children go to school by. It keeps them on time.
</P>
<P>
   My bedside alarm clock is 10 minutes fast. That way I can set
the alarm for 7 a.m., lounge in bed for 10 minutes and still get up
at 7 a.m. Setting my alarm 10 minutes earlier just isn't the same.
Those extra 10 minutes are so much more valuable when I trick
myself into thinking they're stolen.
</P>
<P>
   Twice every year I worry about being left out of the loop, not
getting the word to change my clock and being left behind _ or
ahead. One year I spent an entire Sunday one hour off. Then Monday
dawned.
</P>
<P>
   I drove to work in no traffic, no congestion, no road rage.
</P>
<P>
   When I arrived, my office was locked. So was the corner coffee
shop. It was eerie, frightening, quiet. Where was everyone? Had a
virus or a nuclear attack struck San Francisco? Just as I was
making plans for a future without people, the city started coming
alive.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing wrong with playing with the time to suit our
convenience. But when we get our free time in one big, 60-minute
lump it's hard on the system. But what a gift it would be if people
could bank that 60 minutes and choose later how and when to use it.
</P>
<P>
   When you needed 5 minutes here or 10 minutes there, you'd just
pull it out of the bank. For the chronically tardy like me, it
would mean breezing into work, meetings and parties on time.
</P>
<P>
   Daylight savings could mean never having to say you're sorry.
</P>
<P>
   I've marked my calendar. Saturday night: Change the clocks.

WHO REALLY THREW THE BIG FOUL BALL?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Yankees' dissection of the Atlanta Braves was a
baseball masterpiece for the ages. Too bad it was nearly
overshadowed by the controversy over a TV interview that had
nothing to do with the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to be a baseball fan to know what happened. It
was all over the newspapers, TV news and talk radio _ even the
nonsports programs that usually focus their wrath on politicians,
bureaucrats and the liberal media conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing conspiratorial about NBC sports reporter Jim
Gray's Sunday night interview with Pete Rose after Rose was
presented as a member of baseball's All-Century team. Conspiracy
requires subtlety and subterfuge; Gray was as subtle as a
sledgehammer.
</P>
<P>
   Gray has won awards for his tough approach to interviewing, but
baseball fans clearly didn't appreciate his tactics in questioning
Rose about the all-time hit leader's indefinite suspension from the
game. Rose got the boot in 1989 following allegations that he bet
on baseball games _ an activity that is absolutely, positively, 100
percent prohibited by major-league baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Despite evidence that is frequently described as
``overwhelming,'' Rose has been adamant in denying that he bet on
baseball. His refusal to confess and apologize is considered the
major obstacle to his potential reinstatement.
</P>
<P>
   Because the All-Century team was selected by fans _ and because
the election was a colossal marketing ploy by one of baseball's
major sponsors _ Commissioner Bud Selig granted Rose a one-time
dispensation to participate in the All-Century festivities prior to
Game 2 of the World Series in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The fans gave Rose a warm welcome. Gray did not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pete, now let me ask you,'' Gray said after congratulating
Rose on the ovation he had just received, ``it seems as though
there is an opening. The American public is very forgiving. Are you
willing to show contrition, admit that you bet on baseball and make
some sort of apology to that effect?''
</P>
<P>
   It was all downhill from there.
</P>
<P>
   As he has done for a decade, Rose stuck to his guns _ ``I'm not
going to admit to something that didn't happen'' _ but Gray
persisted.
</P>
<P>
   Rose complained that the interview was ``a prosecutor's brief,''
but if Gray had been cross-examining Rose in a courtroom, the judge
surely would have ordered him to move on. Rose's lawyer would have
leapt to his feet: ``Objection! Asked and answered.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray later apologized to fans, saying he could understand why
they thought that his grilling of Rose ``went on too long and took
some of the joy out of the occasion.''
</P>
<P>
   It's worth noting that Gray didn't say he thought it went on too
long _ only that he could understand why others did. It wasn't
much, but it put him one-up on Rose, who has never conceded that he
can understand why lots of fans and sports pundits believe that he
betrayed the game of baseball and compromised the integrity of the
sport.
</P>
<P>
   So. Who is the bigger offender here?
</P>
<P>
   Is it Gray, who violated the dictates of civility by turning a
meaningless interview into an offensive confrontation? Whatever we
think of his ``bombarding'' _ Rose's word _ of a disgraced
ballplayer, Gray didn't do anything that TV interviewers don't do
every day. Have you ever watched Katie Couric or Matt Lauer go
after some of these poor saps who submit to interviews on
``Today''?
</P>
<P>
   Or is it Rose, who cynically turned the fans against Gray by
accusing him of an ambush when Rose knew full well what the subject
of the interview would be? Rose has heard these questions
incessantly for 10 years _ he heard them during a news conference
earlier in the evening, for crying out loud. How disingenuous was
it for Rose to feign shock at hearing them one more time?
</P>
<P>
   Jim Gray is a pain, no doubt about it. But let's not forget what
Pete Rose is: a self-absorbed, stonewalling jerk who forfeited his
status as a sports hero and will remain a blight on the integrity
of baseball until he faces up to the damage he inflicted on the
game.

 &HT;    Song contest hits sour notes for Jimmy Dean
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Oct. 31.
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHAFFIN'S BLUFF, Va. _ Entertainer and sausage baron Jimmy Dean,
who makes his home in a James River mansion just south of Richmond,
became famous with his 1961 song ``Big Bad John.'' Now some
Virginians are calling him Big Bad Jim.
</P>
<P>
   They claim he's trying to buy his way into Virginia legend and
lore with ``sausage money,'' throwing it around to win a bitter
contest for a new state song.
</P>
<P>
   Dean's song ``Virginia,'' co-written with his country-singer
wife, Donna, is one of eight finalists to replace ``Carry Me Back
to Old Virginia,'' which was retired in 1997 because of its
slavery-era references to ``darkies'' and ``massas.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 339 songs were entered in the contest. And many of those
whose songs have been cut are unhappy. Their sniping is aimed
mostly at the Deans, whose anthem came in first among 20
semifinalists as graded by a contest committee of legislators and
musicians.
</P>
<P>
   Candy Lemaire, a former teacher from Springfield whose song,
``Here's to Virginia,'' went nowhere, complains that the Deans
handed out compact discs at one key meeting and arrived in a white
stretch limousine bearing the license plate ``2 Deans.''
</P>
<P>
   Other also-rans point out that the Deans have made campaign
contributions for years to Republican legislators and causes,
including $1,750 this year to state Sen. Stephen Martin of
Richmond, a member of the contest panel.
</P>
<P>
   That constitutes a conflict of interest, argues Bob Campbell, a
Staunton businessman, and his partner, Ray Allen of Clifton Forge,
whose song, ``Home, Sweet Home, Virginia,'' got the ax.
</P>
<P>
   They contend that another committee member, Delegate Frank Hall
of Midlothian, is tainted, too. Hall has never received a dime from
the Deans. But both he and Martin sponsored legislation to make the
Deans' ditty the state song _ before the contest was even under
way.
</P>
<P>
   All of which made for an uneven playing field, says Allen:
``We're basically all working-class people who don't have the money
Jimmy Dean has to sink into this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just sour grapes,'' Sen. Emmett W. Hanger Jr., head of
the song committee, says of the griping. ``Jimmy's not trying to
buy it with sausage money. He can't help it he's rich and popular.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been referred to as an old rich sausage grinder and his
wife as a young saloon singer. But you have to expect that in
something like this.''
</P>
<P>
   In the committee's latest deliberation, the 20 semifinalist
songs were rated from one to five by each judge, and their votes
were added up. The Deans' song won easily, with 36 points, Hanger
says. The other seven finalists earned scores ranging from 18 to
28. Even if Martin and Hall had abstained, the Deans' song still
would have been a finalist.
</P>
<P>
   Martin insists that his vote was not biased by his connection
with the Deans. He says he just likes the song. ``It's the kind of
song we need, and that has nothing to do with his contribution,''
the senator says. ``That's an insult.''
</P>
<P>
   The Deans, while undeterred in their hopes for their song's
adoption by the state, say they're upset that the process has
turned so sour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sausage money,'' snorts Dean, 71, sitting beside Donna, 46, at
their grand piano and singing their ``Virginia'' for a visitor.
``It just ain't true and it just ain't fair. We give to a lot of
people and causes. It's our civic duty.'' In the past three years,
the couple has given $238,000 to nearby Varina High School.
</P>
<P>
   If they wanted to cheat, Dean says, they could.
</P>
<P>
   ``This hifalutin lobbyist group came down and said for $100,000,
they'd guarantee our song would get it. I said to Donna, `Well, I
guess we could afford that, but it's not right.' Whereas we could
afford it, I imagine a lot of others couldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the controversy, the Deans say they've become the
subject of wild rumors. One says Jimmy greets delivery men at his
house with loaded guns. Dean says that's ``just nuts,'' though he
admits he did wind up in court last year for saying ``howdy'' to a
lost college student with a shotgun. The student sued and lost, but
the incident gave ammunition to critics who call Dean a loose
cannon who could tarnish the Old Dominion's image.
</P>
<P>
   Another charge claims that Dean promised money to Liberty
University in exchange for the vote of David Randlett, a music
professor on the contest panel. (``That's the most ridiculous thing
I've ever heard,'' Randlett scoffs.)
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just dumb,'' Dean growls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, my God!'' gasps Donna.
</P>
<P>
   But not all the losers are griping.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our free-market, democratic society, some individuals may
have more resources than others for petitioning decision makers,''
says Michael Clem, whose ``Old Dominion'' was cut. ``It's the
nature of the beast.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry Fitzgerald, whose song, ``Virginia, You're America to
Me,'' also fell out of contention, is philosophical: ``Making
sausages and writing state songs aren't for the fainthearted.''
</P>
<P>
   But enough contestants have made a stink that many Virginians
have heard more about the flap over Dean than about the songs
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Hatlersley, a Norfolk bartender, says she hasn't heard the
songs, only ``shotgun and sausage-money talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward Pleasants, a 31-year veteran of the Richmond Fire
Department and a neighbor of the Deans, doesn't know much about the
songs either but says, ``They're nice people. That stuff about
sausage money is just baloney.''
</P>
<P>
   The flap has left many lawmakers, such as Delegate Jay DeBoer, a
Petersburg Democrat, with a can't-wait-till-it's-over attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tar-baby issue,'' says DeBoer. ``The more you hit it,
the stickier it gets. Everybody's fatigued with it. It's become a
big issue because people can understand it better than, say, mental
health.''
</P>
<P>
   DeBoer got so frustrated during the protracted fight to dump
``Carry Me Back'' that he proposed ``Louie Louie'' as the new state
song. Though the song committee is supposed to make its
recommendation by January, DeBoer thinks the Legislature will find
a way to avoid a definitive vote. ``I don't think we'll see a new
state song in my lifetime,'' he declares.
</P>
<P>
   Dean and his wife say they're too happy living in Chaffin's
Bluff to whine if their song doesn't win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hell, this is a beautiful place to live, and we love it,''
Dean says at his home overlooking the James, on the site of a Civil
War battle, where the couple just recently found a cannonball.
``We're living on history.''
</P>
<P>
   He pauses, gazing at the river.
</P>
<P>
   ``But wouldn't it be a kick in the head to tell my grandkids
that they know who wrote the state song? That'd be such an honor.''
</P>

 &HT;    Song contest hits sour notes for Jimmy Dean
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Oct. 31.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHAFFIN'S BLUFF, Va. _ Entertainer and sausage baron Jimmy Dean,
who makes his home in a James River mansion just south of Richmond,
became famous with his 1961 song ``Big Bad John.'' Now some
Virginians are calling him Big Bad Jim.
</P>
<P>
   They claim he's trying to buy his way into Virginia legend and
lore with ``sausage money,'' throwing it around to win a bitter
contest for a new state song.
</P>
<P>
   Dean's song ``Virginia,'' co-written with his country-singer
wife, Donna, is one of eight finalists to replace ``Carry Me Back
to Old Virginia,'' which was retired in 1997 because of its
slavery-era references to ``darkies'' and ``massas.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 339 songs were entered in the contest. And many of those
whose songs have been cut are unhappy. Their sniping is aimed
mostly at the Deans, whose anthem came in first among 20
semifinalists as graded by a contest committee of legislators and
musicians.
</P>
<P>
   Candy Lemaire, a former teacher from Springfield whose song,
``Here's to Virginia,'' went nowhere, complains that the Deans
handed out compact discs at one key meeting and arrived in a white
stretch limousine bearing the license plate ``2 Deans.''
</P>
<P>
   Other also-rans point out that the Deans have made campaign
contributions for years to Republican legislators and causes,
including $1,750 this year to state Sen. Stephen Martin of
Richmond, a member of the contest panel.
</P>
<P>
   That constitutes a conflict of interest, argues Bob Campbell, a
Staunton businessman, and his partner, Ray Allen of Clifton Forge,
whose song, ``Home, Sweet Home, Virginia,'' got the ax.
</P>
<P>
   They contend that another committee member, Delegate Frank Hall
of Midlothian, is tainted, too. Hall has never received a dime from
the Deans. But both he and Martin sponsored legislation to make the
Deans' ditty the state song _ before the contest was even under
way.
</P>
<P>
   All of which made for an uneven playing field, says Allen:
``We're basically all working-class people who don't have the money
Jimmy Dean has to sink into this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just sour grapes,'' Sen. Emmett W. Hanger Jr., head of
the song committee, says of the griping. ``Jimmy's not trying to
buy it with sausage money. He can't help it he's rich and popular.
</P>

GOVERNMENT'S OBESITY CALCULATOR DOESN'T ALWAYS ADD UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Stands for STEVE-YOUNG.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL DOUGAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ As if San Francisco 49ers quarterback Steve
Young didn't have enough to worry about dealing with his fourth
concussion in three seasons, the federal governments says he is
overweight.
</P>
<P>
   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta this
week announced that the Battle of the Bulge is a blip on the charts
of history. We've moved on to the Battle of the Bloat. Nearly 18
percent of adult Americans are obese, a 50 percent increase since
1991.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers were gleaned from telephone interviews with more
than 100,000 people. The CDC's criterion of choice was the body
mass index, but that measure may not tell the whole story.
</P>
<P>
   According to the CDC, a body mass index number of 25 to 29.9
means overweight, while 30 and up indicates outright obesity. It is
arrived at by a calculation based on weight and height, not fat or
muscle readings.
</P>
<P>
   Young, 38, stands 6-feet-2-inches and weighs 215 pounds. That
gives the sidelined quarterback a body mass index of 27.6, less
than three points shy of obese.
</P>
<P>
   That is nothing compared to former 49er and three-time Pro Bowl
guard Randy Cross. Before retiring from the team in 1988, Cross
weighed 290 pounds. At 6-feet-3-1/2, he had a body mass index of
36.3. Which is really fat. Only he wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   Cross, now a commentator for CBS, said his body fat level was in
the 15 percent range, meaning he was a mountain of muscle.
</P>
<P>
   If somebody had suggested he was fat, said Cross, he would have
dared him to ``say that to my face.''
</P>
<P>
   He admitted, however, that ``three years after that I was about
310 pounds, and it wasn't quite as much muscle anymore.'' Now he
weighs 235 with a body mass index of 29. ``I'm in pretty good
shape.''
</P>
<P>
   To underscore the sometimes absurd anomalies generated by the
numbers, consider Arnold Schwarzenegger at the peak of his
bodybuilding career in 1974, a year he won Mr. Olympia.
</P>
<P>
   His body mass index was 31, a clear indicator of obesity. His
other statistics tell a different tale: Arms, 22.5 inches around;
chest, 57; waist, 53; thighs, 28.5; calves, 20.
</P>
<P>
   Far from corpulent, Schwarzenegger could have been cast in
copper and placed on a pedestal as a symbol of overwrought manhood.
</P>
<P>
   The body mass index numbers of sports celebrities are not hard
to come by. For others in the public eye _ television stars, for
example _ it's like asking the CIA for the names of its informants
in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't know,'' ABC publicist Lauren Tobin said when asked
about the weight and height of popular comic Drew Carey. ``And I
wouldn't give it out if I knew.''
</P>
<P>
   In the field of politics, it's sufficient to know that President
Clinton _ at 6-feet-2, 214 pounds _ has a body mass index of 27.2,
up from 25.5 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   As the athletes illustrate, ``the main problem is that it
doesn't really tell you directly about body composition,'' said
Kirstin Johansen, assistant professor of medicine at the University
of California at San Francisco. ``It's better than weight alone
because it adjusts for height, but it's not as good as knowing how
much of that weight is fat versus muscle.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Hartman, director of behavioral medicine at the California
Pacific Medical Center's Weight Management Program, said that if
the index ``is over 30 and you think you're an athlete, then ask
yourself the other questions.''
</P>
<P>
   These would involve measurements of cholesterol, blood glucose
and blood pressure. ``If everything looks good, yeah, you are
probably healthy,'' Hartman said.
</P>
<P>
   He added another simple test to determine one's condition. If
the waistline is over 35 for women or 40 for men, Hartman said,
it's time to lose some weight.

YANKEES HAVE WHAT IT TAKES: CASH, BRAINS AND HEAVEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RAY RATTO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ And that, ladies and gentlemen, is what happens when
you combine money and smarts. You get the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't leave much for the less wealthy or brainy, now, does it?
</P>
<P>
   You see, what the Yankees did in dismantling the Atlanta Braves
in the World Series was to separate themselves from the rest of
baseball the way they did when they were The Yankees Your Daddy
Remembers. They took a team that won 103 games, found its
weaknesses, grabbed a handful of each and tore it to eensy little
shreds.
</P>
<P>
   That's kind of frightening when you think about it _ to learn
that 103 wins gets you the Miss Congeniality sash, a lovely bouquet
and a Blockbuster card. The Braves must feel the way the Cleveland
Indians did in 1954 when they won 111 games and got swept in the
Series by the Giants. They stand around wondering not only if
anyone remembers all the good things they did, but if they will.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves, you see, carried themselves in New York as men who
knew they had gotten their just deserts. They didn't feel ``happy
to be here,'' the way the San Diego Padres did a year ago, but they
did feel as though they had been beaten soundly by a team that, if
asked, could just as easily do it again.
</P>
<P>
   It makes you wonder if, in fact, we might be looking at another
stretch of baseball history which belongs solely and completely to
the Yankees, the kind we have not seen since the late '40s.
</P>
<P>
   Logic says no. The Yankees are not a young team, although their
two indisputably dominant players, shortstop Derek Jeter and closer
Mariano Rivera, are. Indeed, one of the truest signs of the Yankees
in their present state is that they have no bad players by major
league standards. And every other team has at least a few.
</P>
<P>
   That sort of thing requires money. More to the point, though,
that sort of thing requires brains. And most remarkably of all,
that sort of thing requires trust.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees under George Steinbrenner III have always had money.
They have occasionally had brains. They have rarely had trust. They
now have all those things, and heaven, too.
</P>
<P>
   Other teams have money. The San Francisco Giants have money, as
far as that goes. They just choose to spend it on bayfront real
estate.
</P>
<P>
   The horrific Baltimore Orioles have money, but none of the other
ingredients. The Los Angeles Dodgers have money and a little trust,
but not much brain.
</P>
<P>
   Some teams have the other two ingredients but not the money. The
Oakland A's, as an example: true, they wouldn't spend it if they
had it, but on a scale relative to the aforementioned teams. ...
Well, let's just say they don't eat out much. Or the Montreal Expos
_ gobs of trust they have, and their minor-league system is
productive enough for trust, but they haven't the money and the
money they do have has birds and queens on it and is worth about 65
cents to the American version.
</P>
<P>
   The Cleveland Indians have money and brain, but not much trust,
as general manager John Hart wants to be the lord and master of all
he surveys, which is never a good thing. Same for the Arizona
Diamondbacks, only substitute Buck Showalter for Hart.
</P>
<P>
   Only the Yankees have it all, and even if you allow that
Steinbrenner can be a monumental oaf at times, he has still allowed
manager Joe Torre and general manager Brian Cashman to trust their
own hearts.
</P>
<P>
   That, ultimately, is what makes the Yankees the Yankees, and why
you wonder if their merry ride can't last well into the 'oughts.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, George could go mad again and start behaving like
Vlad the Impaler with his shorts riding up. Torre and Cashman and
the baseball operations people could be fired or quit. Or he could
become ill or distracted by his crusade for a new Yankee Stadium
(and here's hoping that pursuit is unfulfilled for decades to
come).
</P>
<P>
   Or the other owners could finally cram full revenue sharing and
a salary cap past both him and the Players Association (although
that isn't the way to bet). We have never seen George Steinbrenner
on an even playing field, although he could even it out himself in
his more mercurial days.
</P>
<P>
   Or we could see another team discover and actually utilize the
money/brains/trust pyramid to kick sand on everyone else, Or maybe
several. Maybe the Yankees can become a model for the way other
teams are run.
</P>
<P>
   No, what the Yankees have is rare, which is why so few teams
ever stay so dominant for more than a year or so. The last team to
manage it was the A's of the early '70s, which gives you an idea.
</P>
<P>
   So we ask again, where does this leave everyone else? For the
moment, it seems, just watching. Just watching.

EXHIBIT AIMS TO LIFT LEE KRASNER FROM UNDER JACKSON POLLACK'S
SHADOW 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(Eds: for use Sunday, Oct. 31 or thereafter. Fact box at bottom.) 
By REED JOHNSON 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The ``Lee Krasner'' exhibition at the Los Angeles
County Museum of Art is the first major retrospective devoted to
the painter since her death in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   But which Lee Krasner is on view? The dutiful student of Hans
Hofmann and secondhand disciple of Matisse and Picasso? The dynamic
feminist forerunner who became the only female painter associated
with the New York school of abstract expressionism?
</P>
<P>
   The late bloomer who didn't discover her true artistic voice
until her fourth decade on the planet? Or the cantankerous woman
whose abrasive personal style probably cost her points with
posterity?
</P>
<P>
   In fact, all these aspects of Krasner's remarkable life and
career receive their due in this touring show of 60 paintings,
collages and drawings organized by Independent Curators
International and running at LACMA through Jan. 2.
</P>
<P>
   One side of Krasner you won't easily find, however, is the
``neglected'' painter who never escaped the shadow of her famous
husband, Jackson Pollock. If anything, this exhibition suggests
that Krasner's stock may be ready for an upward reappraisal similar
to the one Pollock received following last year's major New York
retrospective.
</P>
<P>
   While Pollock's stature as a modern art icon was probably sealed
the instant he lost his life in a 1956 car accident, Krasner's
output and reputation have ripened with age. While Pollock seemed
to sprint through his too-brief career in an unpremeditated
creative fury, Krasner paced herself, continuing to produce
prescient and important work when she was well into her 60s.
</P>
<P>
   Still, old labels die hard _ particularly when they contain
truthful elements. If it's too simplistic to describe Krasner
merely as Pollock's protege and appendage, it's equally clear from
this show that Krasner used her husband's work as a yardstick and
an entry point for her own development throughout their 11-year
marriage. Krasner herself freely acknowledged Pollock's influence,
which was virtually inescapable for any artist of that generation
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Although Krasner was better-known when they met, Pollock's drip
paintings, made between 1947 and 1951, sent his reputation on a
meteoric trajectory _ followed by an equally swift personal
burnout. At the time of the tragic accident, Pollock hadn't painted
for nearly a year and a half, heaping fuel on an already volatile
ego.
</P>
<P>
   Not coincidentally, it was only after Pollock's death _ preceded
by his backsliding into heavy drinking and taking up with a
mistress 18 years his junior _ that Krasner emerged fully as a
major American painter on her own terms.
</P>
<P>
   Turning away from the macho self-absorption of the abstract
expressionist fraternity, Krasner created artworks that were more
provisional and contemplative but hardly less personal than those
of her impulsive mate and colleague.
</P>
<P>
   By breaking her career into discrete but continuous chapters,
LACMA's show emphasizes the multifaceted quality of Krasner's
output. Her work, rather than being an extension of one mythic,
monumental persona such as Pollock's, is more like a patchwork
quilt of multiple, intersecting artistic strategies and identities.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1908 in a still-rural section of Brooklyn to Russian
Orthodox Jewish immigrants, Krasner was a hard-working, relatively
well-educated teen-ager when she began taking drawing courses in
the late 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   While obtaining a teaching certificate, she met the art critic
Harold Rosenberg and began a lifelong friendship. It was Rosenberg
who introduced her to the poetry of Charles Baudelaire and Arthur
Rimbaud, whose writings impacted the early 20th-century
avant-garde. Through Rosenberg, she also gained entry into the
Greenwich Village intellectual culture of the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   In 1934, Krasner began working for the New Deal's Public Works
of Art Project, followed by the Federal Art Project of the Works
Progress Administration. It was through the Artists Union that she
first met Jackson Pollock.
</P>
<P>
   With like-minded fellow artists, she danced at loft parties,
took part in union-related protests and joined in vigorous
discussions about the merits of Soviet Communism _ then still
perceived by leftist intellectuals as a bastion of enlightened
morality and working-class solidarity.
</P>
<P>
   Krasner's art from this period is represented in the exhibition
with geometric works such as ``Gansevoort II,'' named for a Lower
Manhattan street where she lived in the 1930s. She came under
Hofmann's influence, seen in her cubist still lifes, and began
investigating the tension between representational painting and the
more spiritual, metaphysical possibilities to be found in abstract
shapes and blocks of color. She particularly admired what she
described as the ``airborne'' quality of Matisse: ``It allows you
to step into space,'' she once said.
</P>
<P>
   By the time she married Pollock in 1945, Krasner already had
begun to move past cubism toward a more introspective art. She
produced a somber series appropriately known as the Gray Slabs. In
his comprehensive catalog essay, Robert Hobbs proposes that these
``dense, turgid works'' may have been registering Krasner's
subconscious horror at the first published reports of Holocaust
atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   After destroying these grim canvases, Krasner turned to the far
more appealing Little Image Series. Likely inspired by the Hebrew
writing she'd first seen while growing up, this series utilizes a
made-up lexicon of squiggles, symbols and whimsical designs to
create paintings of primal encoded power, roughly analogous to
Pollock's drips.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there was already evident in Krasner's approach a
deliberative quality that separated her from Pollock. Krasner dealt
in incremental gestures rather than grand, sweeping pronouncements.
Without sacrificing spontaneity or boldness, her works didn't go
out of their way to proclaim they'd been splattered onto the canvas
in a frenzied outburst of ego-driven genius.
</P>
<P>
   Krasner also favored a very different palette from Pollock and
most of her male colleagues. At times her color choices _ hot pink
with orange, mustard with lime green _ were exuberantly, almost
perversely atonal, like a 19th-century parlor room.
</P>
<P>
   Rejecting purist credos, Krasner freed herself to mix and match.
In collage works such as ``Bald Eagle'' (1955), she incorporated
scraps of Pollock's own ink drawings of the 1950s. She also made
visual references to colleagues' paintings in works such as
``Milkweed'' (1955), which alludes to Robert Motherwell's ``Elegy
to the Spanish Republic'' series _ part of her ongoing, interactive
``dialogue'' with such contemporaries as Motherwell, Willem de
Kooning and others.
</P>
<P>
   If abstract expressionism's great, ``unresolvable'' project was
supposed to be the artist's relentless inward focus on ``the
unitary self,'' Krasner determined that this project needn't become
an exercise in solipsistic navel-gazing. Rather, the self could
incorporate the vast world of ideas, the history of art, poetry and
psychotherapy, and the community in which the artist lived and
worked.
</P>
<P>
   Making the case for that point of view is beyond the power of
any one artist, just as making the case for a given artist is
beyond the power of any one exhibition. There's a chance, however,
that ``Lee Krasner'' could mark a turning point for both. &QL;

Pulitzer Prize-winning author Edmund Morris spent 14 years writing
``Dutch: A Memoir of Ronald Reagan,'' inventing characters and
footnotes to form a fictionalized biography of the president. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
hed:  &UR; Morris is no `Dutch' treat &QL; 
Fictional Reagan biography blends &QL; 
author's strange illusions with reality &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &QL; 
By  &LR; Glenn Whipp, Staff Writer &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Edmund Morris isn't really sure when he lost it in his pursuit
of Ronald Reagan. No one else is either. And since I've only met
Morris once, I can't really speculate because, after all, I wasn't
actually there myself.
</P>
<P>
   Or was I?
</P>
<P>
   You see, before interviewing Morris recently, I spent hours upon
hours reading about the 59-year-old former adman and his strange
biography of the 40th president of the United States. I even read
the book, ``Dutch'' (no small task at 874 pages), learning more
about Morris than I did about Reagan in the process.
</P>
<P>
   And as I sat in an auditorium last week at the Los Angeles
Central Library, listening to Morris and his spirited defense of
why he felt it was necessary to make up characters, events and even
footnotes and essentially turn his biography of Reagan into a work
of fiction, it hit me like a ton of overwritten books.
</P>
<P>
   I had read so much about Edmund Morris that I was, almost in an
occult sense (to use his words), right there when he leaped into
the biographical abyss and began his invention spree. It was the
exact same feeling Morris had when, walking one autumn day at
Reagan's alma mater, Eureka College, he stepped on a ``particular
acorn'' (no, it didn't fall on his head) and realized he knew
Reagan so well that he could project himself into any event in his
past.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind the four years he enjoyed unprecedented access to a
sitting president. The access Morris needed had been right there in
his head the whole time.
</P>
<P>
   Thus was born the fictional Edmund Morris, the man who (along
with his fictional son Gavin and other made-up characters) would
come to dominate the biography of one of the most important and
controversial leaders of this century. Some would say this blend of
illusion and reality suits Reagan to a T, since his critics accused
him of doing just that during his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   But Morris didn't really have that in mind when he came up with
the conceit. What was he thinking? Enter the fictional Glenn Whipp.
A (handsome) man able to leap tall buildings in a single bound and
capable of reading the minds of people he has never interviewed.
This Glenn Whipp was present during the 14 years Morris spent
writing and rewriting and ultimately botching his biography of
Reagan. (And let me tell you, I've had better times at an
Oktoberfest sponsored by the Church of Latter-day Saints than I did
with this guy.)
</P>
<P>
   The fictional G.W.'s take? ``Dutch'' is a grand example of a
burned-out biographer letting pride and prejudice overwhelm his
subject.
</P>
<P>
   Morris says that Reagan was a man who ``did not exist unless he
was being observed.'' Fair enough. But most biographers, when
writing about someone still alive, would content themselves with
interviewing their subject's contemporaries. Morris, however, isn't
like most biographers (remember the acorn!), so he invented some
Reagan observers, including his fictional alter ego _ a man 28
years older than himself, a bon-vivant who met Reagan as a young
man and keeps popping up, Zelig-like, throughout Reagan's life.
</P>
<P>
   This device, understandably, has caused some bewilderment.
Newsweek's co-managing editor, Jon Meacham, was ``confused'' when
he read the book because he had met Morris and the Edmund Morris in
``Dutch'' didn't correspond with the Edmund Morris he remembered.
``I read probably the first 50 pages and I was kind of flummoxed
because I couldn't believe Morris' age,'' Meacham said.
</P>
<P>
   Meacham isn't the only one bewitched, bothered and bewildered.
Columnist George Will called the book ``dishonorable.'' Reagan
speechwriter Peggy Noonan wrote that ``Dutch'' was a ``high-dive
belly-flop into the pools of Narcissus.'' New York Times reviewer
Michiko Kakutani opined that Morris had written less a biography
than a ``cloying, egocentric novel.''
</P>
<P>
   You get the idea. Morris _ whether real, fictional or some
unholy blend of the two _ isn't a popular man these days. Not that
he cares. Morris' self-confidence allows him little room to care
about opinions that are not his own, which nicely renders all those
nasty reviews meaningless, not to mention wrong-headed.
</P>
<P>
   For Morris, his penchant for fiction is actually the epitome of
honesty because the narrator is right there on the page for all to
see, not artfully hidden as with some of these other so-called
``objective'' works.
</P>
<P>
   ``David Halberstam keeps going on about me compromising my
professional reputation,'' Morris grouses, ``but it's impossible to
read a page of any book by Halberstam and not see him and hear him
pulsating out of the page. He's there all the time. May I ask then,
what's the difference?
</P>
<P>
   It's a legitimate question. And if Morris was a bit more
forthcoming about his own methodology, I would gladly devote a
little more time to the subject. But the answers Morris gives
typically dance around the subject without really engaging it. What
(BEGIN ITAL)was(END ITAL) he thinking? The obvious answer _ and you
don't really need the fictional Glenn Whipp to tell you this _ is
that he wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   After spending four years with Reagan in the White House (no
other biographer has ever been given such access) and devoting
days, weeks, months (years!) to reading Reagan's diaries and
letters and interviewing thousands of people, Morris sat down to
start his book. He spent two years writing four chapters in a
conventional manner and he admits: ``I thought my head was going to
explode.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ronald Reagan resisted orthodox narrative and resisted
orthodox biography,'' Morris says. ``Reagan's character is action.
He lived his life moving from production to production. On those
few times when he was `between parts,' like when he lost the
Republican nomination in 1976, he was a lost soul. So I deduced
then that Reagan can only be described in terms of an audience, a
witness.''
</P>
<P>
   But other biographers (Lou Cannon and Gary Wills spring
immediately to mind) have managed to explain Reagan and capture
that love of performance without resorting to fictional
doppelgangers. Which leads one to the sad conclusion that Morris, a
talented writer (his biography of Theodore Roosevelt won the
Pulitzer Prize), was overwhelmed by the enigma of Reagan, panicked
and decided to devote his energies to a subject he knew: himself.
The result is a book that can either be viewed as disastrous or
disappointing, depending on just how seriously you take these
things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dutch,'' with its emphasis of style over substance, could have
made for at least an entertaining read if only the fictional Edmund
Morris wasn't so tiresome. Since Morris only fitfully focuses on
Reagan, the reader must endure tedious passages about the
(fictional) author's own emotions and his prejudices against anyone
not as educated, well-bred or enlightened as he imagines himself to
be.
</P>
<P>
   Morris says the book's forays into fiction take biography into
``new and exciting realms of possibility,'' an advancement long
overdue for a form ``in some need of revitalization.'' You wonder,
though, if Morris ever thought of his audience. When ``60 Minutes''
reporter Leslie Stahl asked him how readers would separate fact
from fiction in his book, Morris cheerfully replied that it was all
there in the footnotes.
</P>
<P>
   Morris faked them as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a little fun with them,'' he told me, quickly adding
that he actually wrote the letters attributed to his book's
fictional characters.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's why ``Dutch'' was 14 years in the making. Morris
needed time to write the fiction that would corroborate his more
``substantial'' fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever. ``Dutch'' is just plain unbelievable. &QL;

FAILED MERGER PUTS ADDED PRESSURE ON UC HOSPITAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ULYSSES TORASSA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The hospital merger between the University of
California at Francisco and Stanford University may be unraveling,
but the financial problems that hindered the marriage are not
likely to go away soon.
</P>
<P>
   University of California officials grimly are accepting
Stanford's decision Thursday to pull out of the 2-year-old UCSF
Stanford Health Care, which lost $86 million in the last fiscal
year. Three-quarters of the losses were logged at UC-San
Francisco's Mount Zion and Parnassus Avenue hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Now UC-San Francisco will have to go it alone in efforts to cut
costs and boost revenues. The turnaround plan developed for the
hospital system by the Hunter Group consulting firm will go
forward, UC-San Francisco Chancellor Michael Bishop. That plan
includes doing away with the emergency room and hospital beds at
Mount Zion and keeping only the outpatient services.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford Medical School Dean Eugene Bauer said Thursday that
while Stanford Hospital and the Lucile Packard Children's Hospital
combined lost about $20 million in the past year, they are
projected to make $15 million next year. Both hospitals are located
in Palo Alto.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford President Gerhard Casper opted to pull out of the
merger before a joint review of the operation was completed.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he said he is open to the idea of continuing
to pool resources with UC-San Francisco in purchasing and joint
contracting, as well as in pediatrics.
</P>
<P>
   The wealthy Packard Foundation has indicated it is willing to
bankroll a children's health initiative in the region with hundreds
of millions of dollars _ creating a powerful incentive for the two
institutions to keep working together in that area.
</P>
<P>
   Charles McFadden, a spokesman for the University of California,
said the UC system probably would not fight Stanford's action.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult to hold a marriage together if one of the
parties wants to back out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from both universities stressed that outside forces _
especially cuts in Medicare and the state health care program, as
well as a fierce managed-care market in the region _ were the main
reasons the enterprise failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to run a business if you have so little control over
your revenue,'' Bishop said. ``When you put those pressures on top
of the complexities of putting together a merger like this, the
odds are really stacked against you.''
</P>
<P>
   The merger was supposed to help the two institutions better deal
with the increasingly tough marketplace by pooling resources and
clout. But the failure to persuade the faculties at the two medical
schools to embrace the system proved a major stumbling block. And
officials have acknowledged that poor decisions and overspending
exacerbated the financial problems.

NBA GROPES FOR A RETURN TO EXCITEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JORGE L. ORTIZ  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In a season when it will propel past this
century and into the new millennium, the NBA is taking a step back
and adopting a retro look.
</P>
<P>
   It won't be anything as radical as a return to the days of shiny
shorts, old, musty arenas or, heaven forbid, reasonable ticket
prices. In fact, five new buildings are opening this season, all
with a bevy of expensive luxury suites.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping those arenas full has become a trickier proposition than
in the past. Average attendance declined to 16,738 last season
after years above the 17,000 mark. The six-month lockout and the
rump season that resulted clearly influenced the decline, but the
brutish, boring games that ensued may have played a role as well.
</P>
<P>
   That style of basketball followed an ugly trend that has seen
scoring nose-dive to a team average of 91.6 points per game last
season, the lowest since the inception of the shot clock in 1954
and nearly 10 points less than only four years before.
</P>
<P>
   No longer able to hide its deteriorating product behind Michael
Jordan's brilliance, the NBA has taken steps to improve the game's
flow and showcase its players' athleticism, just as it used to
earlier this decade.
</P>
<P>
   New rules prohibit a defender from making contact with his arms
or forearms on an offensive player except below the free throw line
extended. In addition, old rules against grabbing, holding,
impeding progress away from the ball and setting illegal screens
are being more strictly enforced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our feeling was strength and size were negating ability and
basketball playing, and it was going too much to one side,'' Rod
Thorn, the league's director of enforcement, said. ``I would say
quick players now will have the advantage of being able to play
without being held or knocked around as much.''
</P>
<P>
   The changes, of course, have been knocked plenty. Coaches and
players who prefer more liberal contact have voiced their
displeasure loudly and frequently even before Tuesday's start of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you'll see more physicality going to a salsa bar than
going to a game,'' said Miami Heat coach Pat Riley, whose teams are
infamous for their mauling defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to make the game more sissified. The girls in
the WNBA are allowed to play harder than we're allowed to play,''
Charlotte Hornets muscleman Anthony Mason said. ``The rules will
slow the game down. You'll have a bunch of fouls and it will turn
into a free throw shooting contest, which the fans don't want to
see, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Mason may have a point. Some of the exhibitions evolved into
stultifying parades to the free throw line, for example, the game
between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Golden State Warriors on
Oct. 19 which lasted 2:46 and included 105 foul shots.
</P>
<P>
   Some officiating crews seem to be enforcing every rule to the
letter of the law while others are more lax, leading to mass
confusion among players. But Thorn pointed out that, despite the
transition pains, fouls per team are up only 2.5 per game from two
years ago and 2.0 from the previous preseason (last year clubs
played only two exhibitions each). Furthermore, scoring is up
nearly three points from two preseasons ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game has a less physical, better look to it than it did at
this time last year, so right now we're guardedly optimistic that
what we're doing is having a positive effect,'' Thorn said. ``The
key thing is shots attempted. If teams keep running and trying to
get opportunity shots, we're going to look better.''
</P>
<P>
   Running teams have traditionally resided in the West, and the
rule changes may further widen what has become a large talent gap
between the conferences. As many as five Western teams _ defending
champion San Antonio, Portland, the Lakers, Phoenix and Houston _
harbor legitimate championship aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   The move west of such highly skilled players as Steve Smith
(Portland), Penny Hardaway (Phoenix), Nick Anderson (Sacramento)
and Ron Mercer (Denver) drives the point home even deeper.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of tough teams, especially in the Western
Conference, that have really stocked up to make a run at the
title,'' the San Antonio Spurs' Tim Duncan, arguably the best
player in the league, said.
</P>
<P>
   The talent distribution appears to be much more even in the East
_ which is another way of saying it has become mediocre.
</P>
<P>
   Top contenders Miami and Indiana may be past their prime, while
New York still has to figure out what to do with Patrick Ewing once
he comes back. Charlotte is bursting with talent, but it lacks
championship experience and might run into problems with its
chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the teams in the East are good enough to make the
playoffs,'' Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy said, ``and most are also

   The ones that adjust to the changes _ be it through traps, fast

100 points.

   Last season the Sacramento Kings were the only ones to eclipse
that figure, and just barely (100.2). That's why the league
wouldn't mind taking a step back.

MANY DOCTORS WILLING TO LIE SO PATIENTS WILL GET CARE

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ You be the doctor: The patient is 55 years old and
scared. Her sister was just diagnosed with breast cancer and she's
worried she might have it, too.
</P>
<P>
   All the latest research says her age and the presence of breast
cancer in her family make her an ideal candidate for a screening
mammogram. But her insurance won't pay for the test because a
clinical breast exam turned up no suspicious lumps.
</P>
<P>
   What do you do?
</P>
<P>
   (A) Send her home without the test even though you know it could
catch cancer at its earliest, most curable stage.
</P>
<P>
   (B) Spend weeks slogging through her insurer's bureaucratic maze
of appeals in an effort to get the test approved.
</P>
<P>
   (C) Lie to the insurer and say you found a suspicious lump,
knowing that lying to an insurer is a violation of California law
that, if discovered, could cost you your medical license.
</P>
<P>
   The morally correct answer is B. But if you chose C, you're not
alone.
</P>
<P>
   A study published last week in the Archives of Internal Medicine
found 35 percent of the doctors surveyed across the nation would
condone lying to get the patient a mammogram. The surveys were sent
to more than 471 doctors in eight U.S. cities; only 169 doctors
responded.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of the doctors who answered the questionnaire
supported lying if the patient's insurer denied a more serious
procedure, such as a cardiac bypass or surgery to open a blocked
artery in a patient's leg. The study also found doctors in areas
where HMOs saturated the health-care insurance market were more
likely to approve of lying.
</P>
<P>
   And while 27 percent of the doctors in the study said they would
never condone deception _ even if the procedure was in the best
interest of the patient _ researchers agree the numbers may be
skewed because few physicians will admit resorting to deceit.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Daniel Sulmasy, director of the Bioethics Institute at New
York Medical College and an author of the study, said the findings
speak more to a frustration with HMOs than to the integrity of
doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a moral stress test,'' he said. ``For 2,500 years, the
moral tradition has been that physicians are empowered to make
judgments about what is medically indicated for their patients. But
now they're being asked to assume another moral responsibility _
that of enforcing rules that may prohibit patient access to care
for the economic good of society.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the second study in four months to document a silent
revolt among some physicians and nurses against health-care
bureaucracies _ a battle that helps individuals but may ultimately
drive up the cost of insurance. The issue has attracted the
attention of the American Medical Association's Institute for
Ethics, which is expected to address the matter with its own report
in a few months.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a level of conflict in our system between doctors and
health plans that simply isn't viable, nor is it ultimately good
for patients,'' said Larry Levitt, program director at the Kaiser
Family Foundation, a health-care policy think tank based in Menlo
Park, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation's survey, released in July, found nearly half of
1,821 doctors and nurses admitted to exaggerating a patient's
condition to get access to tests they felt were warranted. Nine of
10 doctors said their patients were denied services and, in many
cases, that denial was detrimental to the patient's health. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
DOCTORS SHARE BLAME &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But while the Kaiser report went relatively unnoticed, Sulmasy's
study hit a nerve among managed_care officials last week.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jennifer Gutzmore, chief medical officer at Health Net in
Woodland Hills, said the researchers appear to have set out with a
bias against managed care, crafting unrealistic scenarios that
appealed to a doctor's sense of advocacy, not honesty. She
criticized the study sample size of only 169 doctors as too small
to be of scientific merit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's unfair not only to managed care, but also to
physicians,'' Gutzmore said. ``I found fundamental flaws with the
questions. And I found the extrapolations to be very biased.''
</P>
<P>
   The six questions, which included scenarios ranging from heart
bypass surgery to mental health referrals for a severely depressed
patient, do appeal to a doctor's sense of nobility. And since they
require physicians only to comment on the behavior of a fictional
colleague _ not admit deceit _ it's easy to support the lie.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, most of the physicians surveyed supported
lying only in cases where the patient appeared to be at risk, or in
severe pain. Only 3 percent of the doctors in the study supported a
scenario that required deception to get a patient cosmetic surgery
for a crooked nose.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Virginia Ambrosini, medical director at Kaiser Permanente
Medical Center in Panorama City, said she would never condone lying
and would leave any job that required her to compromise a patient's
health for the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   But she could sympathize with the fictional doctors: ``Fraud is
clearly wrong, but it is an ethical dilemma. If indeed there were
no other choices, I would side with the patient in every case
except the rhinoplasty case. Not to give treatment to those
patients would be wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake, though, this is not purely a case of Robin Hood
medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it is not only a question of, `Does the patient get
care?' It's also a question of, `Will the doctor get paid?''' said
Alexander Capron, an expert in bioethics at the University of
Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   He said cheating the system only fuels the continued rise in
health insurance costs, which climbed an average of 5 percent in
the last year, according to another Kaiser Family Foundation survey
released on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tend to see these insurance companies as big, faceless
behemoths, but they're dependent on setting rates that make
sense,'' Capron said. ``They do that based on predictions about
what's going to happen with claims. If they get a certain number of
false claims,'' rates will go up. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
NO IMMEDIATE SOLUTION &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So why aren't physicians simply working within the system to
change it?
</P>
<P>
   ``The sad irony is that when doctors do appeal a decision, more
often than not they end up getting the care for the patient, but
there is no way they can do it for every patient,'' Levitt said.
</P>
<P>
   Sulmasy offers his own case in point: He once had a patient
whose surgery for colon cancer left him with a colostomy bag.
Surgeons at the patient's HMO said there was only a 10 percent
chance they could restore normal bowel function. Sulmasy checked
around and found a surgeon at a cancer center who felt there was a
90 percent chance the operation would succeed, but the patient's
insurance refused to pay for surgery outside the network. It took a
month of phone calls to reach the top of the appeals pyramid, the
HMO's medical director.
</P>
<P>
   ``The medical director said, `You have to understand we're not
in the business of providing boutique medicine. We have fine
surgeons in our network,''' Sulmasy recalled. ``Boutique medicine?
He was going to be defecating into a bag for the rest of his life
vs. having normal bowel movements. A 10 percent chance vs. a 90
percent chance it would work. This is boutique medicine? I was
practically screaming at the guy.''
</P>
<P>
   The man got his operation. But in many other cases, a lie is the
path of least resistance. Sulmasy said it used to be common for
physicians to lie about breast lumps so Medicare would pay for a
mammogram. Medicare now covers the test. It's still common for
physicians to submit a symptom instead of a full diagnosis _ which
technically is not a lie since the patient is experiencing the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a game, a stupid, silly game,'' Sulmasy said. ``And it's
played continually. There's something wrong with the system when
people have to practice this way.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kaiser Family Foundation's Levitt said doctors share some
blame for the HMO system. Under the old fee-for-service insurance
plans, doctors were paid for whatever services they performed, a
system that invited abuses and ultimately fueled skyrocketing
insurance costs.
</P>
<P>
   HMOs were the antidote. The giant health-care corporations,
which provide insurance to 68 percent of California workers, often
take a one-size-fits-all approach to medicine. That's fine when it
comes to annual checkups but can be troublesome when a patient is
seeking intravenous pain medication or the latest cancer treatment.
</P>
<P>
   But reform is under way. Congress is considering a patient's
bill of rights that would grant broad rights, including the ability
to sue a health plan.
</P>
<P>
   And California is leading the nation with a law that, beginning
in 2001, will allow patients and doctors to appeal a denial of
coverage to an objective third-party physician.
</P>
<P>
   ``That should go a long way toward restoring trust in the system
and also creating a neutral arbiter to handle these kinds of
disputes,'' Levitt said. ``What concerns doctors and patients now
is if an HMO denies something, there is nowhere else to turn.''
</P>
<P>
   His advice: Don't lie. Fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly,'' Levitt said, ``as with anything, the squeaky wheel
gets the grease.'' &QL;

 &HT;    AUTHORITARIAN POLITICAL TRADITION SURVIVES ON EVE OF FIRST
MEXICAN PRIMARY ELECTION
 &HT;    EDS: Ecatepec is in the state of Mexico about five miles north
of Mexico City.
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service(at)
<TEXT>
<P>
   ECATEPEC, Mexico Gabriel Medina says he recently got his job
peddling a bicycle taxi by agreeing to join Mexico's ruling
Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
</P>
<P>
   Because he has little education and few marketable skills,
Medina intends to keep that $10-a-day job by doing exactly what a
local PRI-affiliated leader tells him to do. That's why he
dutifully accepted his leader's instruction about a month ago to
put campaign bumper stickers for PRI presidential hopeful Francisco
Labastida on his cab.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida, the leader told Medina and about 70 other workers,
was the best man to vote for in Mexico's historic Nov. 7
presidential primary _ the first ever held by the powerful PRI,
which has controlled Mexico's highest office for seven decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's true that Mr. Labastida will help us, I don't mind
voting for him,'' shrugged Medina, 21, who has to pay his leader $1
a week for the right to drive his bicycle taxi around this
sprawling working-class city just
</P>
<P>
   outside Mexico's capital. ``Me, I just want to work and live
without any problems. The truth is I don't think our lives will
change much no matter which of these politicians is elected.''
</P>
<P>
   Medina's compliance _ and his party leader's pressure _
represent the street-level version of a system deeply ingrained in
Mexico's political life. It's known here by the nickname ``la
cargada.'' And it means, loosely, that PRI-affiliated state
governors down to the lowest party functionary will ``carry'' a
candidate's campaign by using subtle to extreme coercion as well as
public resources to garner votes.
</P>
<P>
   Allegations of a widespread ``cargada'' in favor of Labastida
have become a flash point in the PRI's Nov. 7 primary election.
Labastida, who was most recently Mexico's interior minister, and
another candidate, Roberto Madrazo, the former Tabasco state
governor, are locked in a close race that has them fighting for the
endorsement of PRI sympathizers.
</P>
<P>
   For decades the PRI has dominated Mexican politics in large part
by mustering to the polls its vast network of PRI-affiliated
unions, neighborhoods, farmers and business associations. These are
groups that have long held the keys to jobs, contracts and simple
services like water, drainage, electricity and food subsidies in
this country where half the population lives in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, candidates for all elections here have been
selected by party leaders without primaries. For the 70 years that
the PRI has controlled the presidency, the sitting president of the
republic has always
</P>
<P>
   picked the party's nominee in an autocratic process known
jokingly as the ``dedazo,'' the ``big finger.''
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 7, however, the PRI is trying to break with that
tradition and construct a more democratic image by holding a
self-supervised primary. The balloting will be open to all Mexican
voters, but PRI loyalists are expected to be the majority of those
who turn out.
</P>
<P>
   Competition has appeared fierce among four candidates,
particularly between Labastida and Madrazo, who have been running
close in opinion polls for most of the three-month campaign.
Madrazo's television ads and his rhetoric, especially, have been
unusually bold in their attacks on Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, Mexican society thought this process was a show and
would end up with a designation as things used to be done. But as
days, weeks and months passed, people realized this was for real,''
PRI primary organizer Fernando Gutierrez Barrios told foreign
reporters on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But the primary's democratic blush has been marred by the
perception that Labastida alone is benefiting from the PRI's
traditional well-oiled political machine. Indeed, at least one
state governor _ Roberto Albores of Chiapas _ has been verbally
reprimanded by the PRI for using his position to support Labastida
in his state, acknowledged Gutierrez Barrios.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, those complaining the loudest about Labastida's
alleged advantage are Madrazo and two other contenders, Manuel
Bartlett and Humberto Roque Villanueva. Like Labastida, all are
party insiders who in the past have advanced in their careers with
the help of the same system they are now attacking.
</P>
<P>
   But others are also casting a jaundiced eye toward campaign
methods employed during the primary, which could be a dress
rehearsal for Mexico's July 2000 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PRI is using the same tactics it always has,'' said
Rogelio Gomez, a national representative of Civic Alliance, an
independent organization monitoring election fraud and questionable
campaign activities here. ``There is a culture of doing politics in
Mexico where people with low incomes and little education give
their votes in exchange for government services that should just be
given to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Vicente Fox, who is mounting a strong opposition campaign as the
presidential candidate for Mexico's National Action Party, or PAN,
said that ``only a blind person'' couldn't see that ``the
unconditional support of the whole state apparatus and the PRI's
party apparatus is behind Labastida.''
</P>
<P>
   Joel Estudillo, an analyst with the Mexican Institute for
Political Studies, said that many PRI affiliates, especially those
in very poor urban and rural areas, appear to still be locked into
the habit of waiting to be
</P>
<P>
   told for whom they should vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the principle dilemma of the PRI and of Mexico as both
try to make a transition to democracy,'' Estudillo said. ``The PRI
member is asking: Do I respond to that tradition of 70 years, which
may be serving me in some way, or do I dare to rebel? ``
</P>
<P>
   During the campaign, Labastida workers have reportedly been
observed handing out T-shirts, hats, shopping bags, free breakfasts
and free medical exams and legal advice at a greater pace than
Labastida's opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to a meeting with (Labastida) not long ago,'' recalled
Medina. ``They gave us our sandwich, a dessert and a banana. The
truth is it was fun. Our leader didn't really force us to go, but
she suggested we go to support him so he'll support us later.''

<P>
   As long as such services and gifts are not paid for by
government funds, their provision to would-be voters at campaign
rallies does not violate the PRI's internal primary rules or
Mexican law. Other parties hand
</P>
<P>
   out gifts, too, but the PRI is considered the king of such
practices after 70 years of power.
</P>
<P>
   What is strictly prohibited, however, is using public money,
services or the influence of government or high-ranking party
officials to buy votes. In the primary, the PRI has also required
that governors and other officials refrain from even expressing a
preference for a candidate.

   Although the party did not publicize it, Gutierrez Barrios
revealed this week that the PRI verbally sanctioned Gov. Roberto
Albores of Chiapas early in the campaign. But according to
newspaper reports here, some state congressmen in Chiapas accused
Albores of recently trying to force them into delivering votes for
Labastida. The accuracy of the charges is in dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo has complained about other governors using their clout
on behalf of Labastida. The PRI is supposed to investigate the
complaints. So far, no other governors have been reprimanded. But
about a dozen lower-ranking PRI figures have been sanctioned for
using their positions to support certain candidates, not just
Labastida, Gutierrez Barrios said.
</P>
<P>
   For many Mexicans, the mere fact that Labastida has many former
cabinet secretaries and other powerful PRI figures working in his
campaign is a sign that he has the stamp of approval of President
Ernesto Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
   And during a trip to Europe, newspapers here reported, a group
of the PRI representatives reportedly praised Labastida in a
meeting with German officials and spoke harshly about Madrazo,
characterizing him as a corrupt figure.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida has tried to fight the notion that he is considered
the party elite's preferred candidate. His campaign touts his
experience as governor of Sinaloa state, agriculture minister and
interior secretary in Zedillo's cabinet. He also has the benefit of
some new polls showing that voters believe he is more honest and
more of a leader than Madrazo.
</P>
<P>
   But the fuss inside the PRI over the alleged ``cargada'' has
dogged Labastida as well as Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida's three rivals recently implored Zedillo to speak out
against governors and other public officials taking sides during
the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Zedillo met with PRI functionaries and governors
last week, reiterating that he had no preferred candidate. He also
warned: ``In a democratic and open election . . . attempts at
manipulation, coercion

   MEXICO-LACARGADA _ MEXICO CITY _ As the campaign begins to
close, some Mexicans are wondering whether things really have
changed so much in this new democracy. Charges of old-fashioned
vote-buying and official coercion are cropping up against
frontrunner Francisco Labastida from all three of his rivals for
the PRI's presidential nomination. They're complaining about the
``la cargada,'' which means, roughly, having local governments and
officials (all PRI members) send people to pack events, and
otherwise send messages that one should vote for a specific
candidate. It also means distributing goods _ like building
materials _ or offering free breakfasts for medical exams for the
poor. Ironically, Labastida's rivals find themselves complaining
about the same tactics that the opposition here has denounced for
decades. (Ferriss, Cox News Service).

Crider, the ghost of the former owner, had taken up residence in
her 60-year-old house. Prospective buyers would walk in and walk
back out, Bradshaw said. ``It just felt like there was a spirit

eggs, to see if it was a scam to increase traffic to his porn sites
(Trying to reach Harris, the models on his sites and associates for

By GLENN WHIPP 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Edmund Morris isn't really sure when he lost it in
his pursuit of Ronald Reagan. No one else is either. And since I've
only met Morris once, I can't really speculate because, after all,
I wasn't actually there myself.
</P>
<P>
   Or was I?
</P>
<P>
   You see, before interviewing Morris recently, I spent hours upon
hours reading about the 59-year-old former adman and his strange
biography of the 40th president of the United States. I even read
the book, ``Dutch'' (no small task at 874 pages), learning more
about Morris than I did about Reagan in the process.
</P>
<P>
   And as I sat in an auditorium last week at the Los Angeles
Central Library, listening to Morris and his spirited defense of
why he felt it was necessary to make up characters, events and even
footnotes and essentially turn his biography of Reagan into a work
of fiction, it hit me like a ton of overwritten books.
</P>
<P>
   I had read so much about Edmund Morris that I was, almost in an
occult sense (to use his words), right there when he leaped into
the biographical abyss and began his invention spree. It was the
exact same feeling Morris had when, walking one autumn day at
Reagan's alma mater, Eureka College, he stepped on a ``particular
acorn'' (no, it didn't fall on his head) and realized he knew
Reagan so well that he could project himself into any event in his
past.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind the four years he enjoyed unprecedented access to a
sitting president. The access Morris needed had been right there in
his head the whole time.
</P>
<P>
   Thus was born the fictional Edmund Morris, the man who (along
with his fictional son Gavin and other made-up characters) would
come to dominate the biography of one of the most important and
controversial leaders of this century. Some would say this blend of
illusion and reality suits Reagan to a T, since his critics accused
him of doing just that during his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   But Morris didn't really have that in mind when he came up with
the conceit. What was he thinking? Enter the fictional Glenn Whipp.
A (handsome) man able to leap tall buildings in a single bound and
capable of reading the minds of people he has never interviewed.
This Glenn Whipp was present during the 14 years Morris spent
writing and rewriting and ultimately botching his biography of
Reagan. (And let me tell you, I've had better times at an
Oktoberfest sponsored by the Church of Latter-day Saints than I did
with this guy.)
</P>
<P>
   The fictional G.W.'s take? ``Dutch'' is a grand example of a
burned-out biographer letting pride and prejudice overwhelm his
subject.
</P>
<P>
   Morris says that Reagan was a man who ``did not exist unless he
was being observed.'' Fair enough. But most biographers, when
writing about someone still alive, would content themselves with
interviewing their subject's contemporaries. Morris, however, isn't
like most biographers (remember the acorn!), so he invented some
Reagan observers, including his fictional alter ego _ a man 28
years older than himself, a bon-vivant who met Reagan as a young
man and keeps popping up, Zelig-like, throughout Reagan's life.
</P>
<P>
   This device, understandably, has caused some bewilderment.
Newsweek's co-managing editor, Jon Meacham, was ``confused'' when
he read the book because he had met Morris and the Edmund Morris in
``Dutch'' didn't correspond with the Edmund Morris he remembered.
``I read probably the first 50 pages and I was kind of flummoxed
because I couldn't believe Morris' age,'' Meacham said.
</P>
<P>
   Meacham isn't the only one bewitched, bothered and bewildered.
Columnist George Will called the book ``dishonorable.'' Reagan
speechwriter Peggy Noonan wrote that ``Dutch'' was a ``high-dive
belly-flop into the pools of Narcissus.'' New York Times reviewer
Michiko Kakutani opined that Morris had written less a biography
than a ``cloying, egocentric novel.''
</P>
<P>
   You get the idea. Morris _ whether real, fictional or some
unholy blend of the two _ isn't a popular man these days. Not that
he cares. Morris' self-confidence allows him little room to care
about opinions that are not his own, which nicely renders all those
nasty reviews meaningless, not to mention wrong-headed.
</P>
<P>
   For Morris, his penchant for fiction is actually the epitome of
honesty because the narrator is right there on the page for all to
see, not artfully hidden as with some of these other so-called
``objective'' works.
</P>
<P>
   ``David Halberstam keeps going on about me compromising my
professional reputation,'' Morris grouses, ``but it's impossible to
read a page of any book by Halberstam and not see him and hear him
pulsating out of the page. He's there all the time. May I ask then,
what's the difference?
</P>
<P>
   It's a legitimate question. And if Morris was a bit more
forthcoming about his own methodology, I would gladly devote a
little more time to the subject. But the answers Morris gives
typically dance around the subject without really engaging it. What
(BEGIN ITAL)was(END ITAL) he thinking? The obvious answer _ and you
don't really need the fictional Glenn Whipp to tell you this _ is
that he wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   After spending four years with Reagan in the White House (no
other biographer has ever been given such access) and devoting
days, weeks, months (years!) to reading Reagan's diaries and
letters and interviewing thousands of people, Morris sat down to
start his book. He spent two years writing four chapters in a
conventional manner and he admits: ``I thought my head was going to
explode.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ronald Reagan resisted orthodox narrative and resisted
orthodox biography,'' Morris says. ``Reagan's character is action.
He lived his life moving from production to production. On those
few times when he was `between parts,' like when he lost the
Republican nomination in 1976, he was a lost soul. So I deduced
then that Reagan can only be described in terms of an audience, a
witness.''
</P>
<P>
   But other biographers (Lou Cannon and Gary Wills spring
immediately to mind) have managed to explain Reagan and capture
that love of performance without resorting to fictional
doppelgangers. Which leads one to the sad conclusion that Morris, a
talented writer (his biography of Theodore Roosevelt won the
Pulitzer Prize), was overwhelmed by the enigma of Reagan, panicked
and decided to devote his energies to a subject he knew: himself.
The result is a book that can either be viewed as disastrous or
disappointing, depending on just how seriously you take these
things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dutch,'' with its emphasis of style over substance, could have
made for at least an entertaining read if only the fictional Edmund
Morris wasn't so tiresome. Since Morris only fitfully focuses on
Reagan, the reader must endure tedious passages about the
(fictional) author's own emotions and his prejudices against anyone
not as educated, well-bred or enlightened as he imagines himself to
be.
</P>
<P>
   Morris says the book's forays into fiction take biography into
``new and exciting realms of possibility,'' an advancement long
overdue for a form ``in some need of revitalization.'' You wonder,
though, if Morris ever thought of his audience. When ``60 Minutes''
reporter Leslie Stahl asked him how readers would separate fact
from fiction in his book, Morris cheerfully replied that it was all
there in the footnotes.
</P>
<P>
   Morris faked them as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a little fun with them,'' he told me, quickly adding
that he actually wrote the letters attributed to his book's
fictional characters.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's why ``Dutch'' was 14 years in the making. Morris
needed time to write the fiction that would corroborate his more
``substantial'' fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever. ``Dutch'' is just plain unbelievable. &QL;

MORE YAWNS THAN CHILLS THIS WEEKEND 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   My big sister believed that God awarded her extra points for
torturing me.
</P>
<P>
   She seemed to think that when she finally stood at heaven's
gate, she could plead guilty to this or that mortal sin, but then
perk up and recall how she'd afflicted little me.
</P>
<P>
   And just like that, the gate would roll open like some kind of
automatic garage door.
</P>
<P>
   It was she who dragged me, a child, to my first movie: ``The
Thing,'' back in 19(set ital)mumble.(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; Through the entire movie, I knelt on the floor of the Avalon
Theater in Des Moines, Iowa, with my back to the screen, terrified.
</P>
<P>
   Today, ``The Thing'' is remembered mainly because James Arness
was the big veggie monster, before he became the equally huge Matt
Dillon.
</P>
<P>
   The point is that movie scares are dependent on their time, and
ours. Meaning the standard of scares at the time, and our state of
maturity.
</P>
<P>
   All of us are now riding the crest of the usual Halloween
hogwash about things that are supposed to make us shudder.
</P>
<P>
   At the bottom is the smiley TV feature reporter with her witless
Halloween story about bored little kids tromping through some
duded-up suburban ``haunted house.'' And oh my, how (set
ital)scary(end ital) that is.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly as awful are sitcoms that reserve allegedly scary
installments for Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   Scary sitcoms? I'll give a pass to ``The Simpsons,'' which has
established something of a Halloween tradition. Outside of that,
the whole notion can come only from feeble minds.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the movies. This weekend, TV will brim with oodles of
movies about monsters, aliens, witchcraft, ghosts and slasher
killers.
</P>
<P>
   Know what they have in common? They're not scary. Often gross,
and sometimes shocking, but hardly ever scary to grown-up viewers.
</P>
<P>
   And after all, what's Halloween for, if not for grown-ups?
</P>
<P>
   I'll give Cinemax credit for ``The Avengers,'' which shows
Saturday. That 1998 bomb is one of the scariest movies in Hollywood
history. But it's terrifying only to people who make their living
in films.
</P>
<P>
   Also, a ``nice try'' to Turner Classic Movies for the 1925
``Phantom of the Opera,'' on Sunday. And a wan salute to VH1 for
``The Rocky Horror Picture Show,'' Saturday. It isn't scary, but
it's definitely Halloweenish.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday morning, AMC launches its Godzilla marathon, which AMC
describes as ``the biggest scare ever.'' Oh, please. Godzilla is
practically a huggy toy.
</P>
<P>
   Check out ABC's ``Wonderful World of Disney'' on Sunday, in the
midst of Halloween, and you'll find ``Casper.'' It's come to that.
</P>
<P>
   The better-regarded horror movies aren't on TV, for some reason.
Not ``Psycho,'' or ``The Exorcist,'' or even Tod Browning's 1932
curiosity, ``Freaks.'' I suppose this is why video stores exist.
</P>
<P>
   We should remember, though, that these movies weren't
necessarily meant to scare us over and over again. Once you know
what Vera Miles will find in the basement of the Bates mansion,
``Psycho'' loses one of the best punches in its horror combination.
</P>
<P>
   While you're at the video store, you might see if you can find
``The Innocents,'' a 1961 British film that's been unfairly
neglected. It's based on a Henry James story, ``The Turn of the
Screw,'' and it should induce a ghostly chill.
</P>
<P>
   Odd, but there doesn't seem to be much sign this weekend of the
old standards from the 1930s _ ``Dracula,'' ``Frankenstein'' and,
actually from 1941, ``The Wolf Man.'' They haven't really scared
anybody since 1959 or so, but they have a certain nostalgic appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The horror genre has been in a rotten rut for two decades. Lots
of blood and slime, precious few scares.
</P>
<P>
   And while advances in special effects have boosted other film
genres _ notably science fiction _ they might actually have hurt
horror.
</P>
<P>
   Case in point: this past summer's ``The Haunting,'' an effects
riot in which banisters slithered, windows melted into monsters and
audiences yawned. Dumb filmmakers are forever confusing horror
movies with amusement park rides. Wrong. They're different sorts of
thrills.
</P>
<P>
   The low-budget ``Blair Witch Project'' rediscovered the creepy
priorities of well-made horror films. Those filmmakers got it.
Nothing is scarier than what's in our heads.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Alfred Hitchcock expressed it, ``I believe in putting the
horror in the minds of the audience, and not necessarily on the
screen.''
</P>
<P>
   The next great test will be the inevitable sequel to ``The Blair
Witch Project.''
</P>
<P>
   All the money in the world will be available. That's the
problem. It's all that money that can wreck the film.

GORE FLOGS BRADLEY WITH A PROVEN WEAPON -- ENTITLEMENTS

</P>
<P>
   Ever since Al Gore woke up and opened fire on Bill Bradley, Gore
has vacillated between two lines of attack. One is that Bradley is
a big-spending liberal. The other is that Bradley is a closet
Republican who voted for President Reagan's budget cuts and
promoted school vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   In Wednesday night's debate, Gore finally demonstrated how he
plans to unite these two indictments. He will tell voters that
Bradley's big spending threatens middle-class entitlements.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's message reflects a cynical lesson of the past six years:
Defense wins.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993 and 1994, Gore and President Clinton pursued a bold
liberal idea: mandating universal health insurance. Conservatives
thwarted them and captured Congress by convincing voters that the
plan threatened existing health benefits, particularly the right of
patients to choose their doctors.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995 and 1996, Newt Gingrich and Bob Dole pursued a bold
conservative idea: reducing the size of government to liberate the
economy and to let taxpayers keep more of their money. Clinton and
Gore thwarted them and defeated Dole by convincing voters that
Republican budget cuts threatened Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   To cynics, the lesson of these wars is that most voters don't
care about liberal or conservative principles. What they care about
is losing the benefits they have.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has proposed to extend health insurance to 95 percent of
Americans through subsidies and tax credits. Ten minutes into
Wednesday's debate, a librarian asked him how much the plan would
cost and how he would pay for it. Bradley said it would cost
``between $50 billion and $65 billion a year'' and would be funded
either ``from the surplus'' or ``through the enormous savings that
we can get through the application of technology to the medical
system,'' such as ``moving things from paper to Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   When Gore got his next chance to speak -- in response to a
different question -- he turned back to the cost issue. He said his
own health insurance plan, which would ostensibly cover ``90
percent of the American people'' and ``100 percent of all
children,'' would cost ``$146 billion over 10 years,'' plus ``a
prescription drug benefit ... under Medicare for $118 billion over
10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing an analysis by Emory University, Gore said Bradley's plan
``costs $1.2 trillion. That is more than the entire surplus over
the next 10 years. We have to look ahead and save some of that
surplus for Medicare. If we wipe out Medicaid and wipe out the
chance to save Medicare'' by funding Bradley's health insurance
plan, we would ``shred the social safety net'' and ``give
two-thirds of the money to those who already have health
insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   The next questioner asked about campaign reform, but Gore
refused to let go of the health-care dispute. ``Medicare cannot be
an afterthought,'' said Gore. ``The only way to fix Medicare fairly
is to set aside 15 to 16 percent of the surplus to do it now.
Otherwise, you're putting Medicare at risk. Senator Bradley said in
an interview that he would speak to this issue later on, but if you
spend the entire surplus on the first campaign proposal, then that
does not leave money that should be allocated for Medicare.''
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, Gore steered a question about education
back to the Bradley health plan. ``If the entire surplus is spent,
then there is no money left over for new initiatives on
education,'' he argued.
</P>
<P>
   From one perspective, Gore's attack is conservative. Liberals
habitually champion new programs and entitlements without
explaining what they would cost. Conservatives habitually expose
and exaggerate the cost of these programs, which they translate
into tax increases. On health care, Bradley is championing an
entitlement, while Gore is exposing -- and, according to Bradley,
exaggerating -- its cost.
</P>
<P>
   From another perspective, Gore's attack is liberal.
Conservatives habitually champion smaller government and tax cuts
without explaining which programs would be reduced and which
beneficiaries would suffer. Liberals habitually expose and
exaggerate the suffering caused by these reductions. Gore isn't
suggesting that Bradley's health insurance plan will force a tax
increase. He's suggesting that in order to fund that plan, Bradley
will have to cut other programs, particularly Medicare and
education.
</P>
<P>
   The advantage of this critique is that because it is
conservative as well as liberal, Gore can use it in the Democratic
primary and then build on it in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   In the primary, he can tell liberal voters that Bradley's health
insurance plan would suck up all the oxygen in the budget, thereby
suffocating the left's favorite programs. If Gore were to complain
that Bradley's plan required a tax increase, liberals would shrug
and vote for Bradley. By confronting them with budget cuts instead
of tax increases -- claiming that Bradley would ``shred the social
safety net'' and stifle ``new initiatives on education'' in order
to ``give two-thirds of the money to those who already have health
insurance'' -- Gore gives them pause.
</P>
<P>
   In the general election, Gore can hold the same ground against
the Republican nominee. He can tell moderate voters that the GOP's
``risky tax scheme'' (translation: tax cuts) would eat up the
surplus and force deep cuts in -- remember this? -- ``Medicare,
Medicaid, education, and the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   And now that the government is in sufficiently good shape to
stop borrowing from Social Security, Gore can tell voters that he
would protect that trust fund, whereas the Republican tax cuts
would force the government to ``raid'' it again.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also gets the benefit of triangulation. When the Republican
nominee portrays Gore as an arrogant Washington politician who
won't give back the tax money you overpaid the government, Gore can
remind voters that he defended ``fiscal responsibility'' against
Bradley's reckless spending as well as the GOP's reckless tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's accuracy can certainly be disputed. Bradley has already
accused him of exaggerating the cost of Bradley's health-care plan.
Likewise, Republicans can accuse Gore of overestimating the cost of
their tax cut and underestimating the projected budget surplus. And
reporters can question Gore's inference that any candidate who
fails to reserve 15 percent of the surplus for Medicare is putting
the program ``at risk'' and ``wiping out'' the chance to ``save''
it.
</P>
<P>
   But as a political strategy, Gore's position has an unbeaten
record. Hillary Clinton messed with health insurance and went down
in flames. Newt Gingrich messed with Medicare and went down in
flames. Democrats offered more spending and lost the House.
Republicans offered tax cuts and nearly lost it back.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing still standing is the entitlements middle-class
voters feared they might lose to visionaries on the right or the
left. For six years, Bill Clinton has stayed alive by clinging to
those entitlements. Al Gore could do worse.

<P>
   However shaky its methodology, online polling is already a
reality. Online voting, too, is being debated in a variety of
communities.
</P>
<P>
   Now, one Internet company has announced that it will hold an
online primary--among a group of voters bigger than the population
of California and New York combined: women.
</P>
<P>
   During the week of March 1, 2000, a new Web site called
``Majority 2000: Women Count'' plans to hold a nationwide primary,
designed to gauge the way women will vote in the Super Tuesday
primary March 14.
</P>
<P>
   Calling itself a ``political women's portal for presidential
politics,'' the site is a joint project between Good Housekeeping
and Women.com (http://www.women.com/), the New York-based community
site. (They became corporate siblings when Women.com merged with
Hearst, Good Housekeeping's publisher, in January of this year.)
</P>
<P>
   The virtual primary will be the culmination of several months of
online surveys designed both to provide information about which
political issues are important to women and to determine how women
are likely to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining the rationale for the new site, Lisa Stone,
programming director for Women.com, says, ``It's an underreported
fact that women have been the voting majority since 1964.'' In the
1996 race, President Clinton was re-elected largely because of the
11-point gender split in his favor among women voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the same year that women are poised to take over the Net,
we'll also choose who our next president will be,'' Stone adds.
</P>
<P>
   The Majority 2000 site, which plans to launch next week, is part
of a growing trend of powerful voting blocs using the Internet to
flex their political muscles. Earlier this month, the AFL-CIO
announced that it was partnering with the Massachusetts-based
company iBelong (http://ibelong.com/) to produce a Web service
called Workingfamilies.com. Scheduled to launch Dec. 1,
Workingfamilies.com will offer all the features of a traditional
Internet service provider, plus added facilities to make it easy
for members to contact elected officials and corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Other efforts include Rock the Vote, aimed at young voters, and
Starmedia's soon-to-be-launched Voto 2000, which targets the Latino
community.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Oxygen Media announced that it had received $4.5
million from the Markle Foundation to form Oxygen-Markle Plus, a
publicly accessible market-research firm designed to measure and
reflect women's opinions on a variety of subjects from consumer
tastes to public affairs. That project uses the politically
connected polling firm of Penn-Schoen &AMP; Berland, which has counted
Bill Clinton among its clients.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the Good Housekeeping-Women.com project is
retaining Harris Interactive, one of the premier online polling
firms.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the political impact of such Net initiatives has yet
to be proved. But executives at Good Housekeeping and Women.com say
that Elizabeth Dole's withdrawal last week from the 2000
presidential primary convinced them that such a project was
necessary. More than 1,800 women responded to an online survey
about Dole's candidacy, and many wrote heartfelt responses.
</P>
<P>
   Marqueta Bentley, of Oklahoma City, for example, wrote, ``I was
sad when I heard that Mrs. Dole had pulled from the 2000
Presidential Race. I and many of my friends think that Mrs. Dole
has impeccable credentials and would have been a very knowledgeable
president. I hope that Mr. Bush will choose Mrs. Dole as his
running mate. We are ready to put Mrs. Dole to work in the White
House. She has paid her dues politically and proved to be an asset
in any position she has held.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that this is one of the instruments that can help
give women the sense that their vote really matters,'' says Ellen
Levine, Good Housekeeping's editor in chief.

   BEAM-COLUMN (Undated) -- Lawyers involved in ``A Civil Action''
case are finding more opportunities to tell their side of the
story. By Alex Beam.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ENTERTAINMENT/ARTS (e) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   MOVIE-MALKOVICH (Undated) _ ``Being John Malkovich'' is more
than just the latest cool, smart, funny movie. It jumps off the
screen with the kind of freshness, originality, and light-handed
stranglehold on the Zeitgeist that moves movies forward. By Jay
Carr. 800 words.
</P>
<P>
   MOVIE-PRINCESS (Undated) _ Epic, mythic, simply terrific,
``Princess Mononoke'' brings a new kind of animation experience to
the American moviegoing mainstream. By Jay Carr. 860 words.
</P>
<P>
   MOVIE-HEART (Undated) _ Don't be put off by the sappy title of
``Music of the Heart.'' The movie, starring Meryl Streep as a
tenacious woman who refuses to stop teaching violin to East Harlem
schoolchildren, avoids the potentially suffocating pall of uplift.
By Jay Carr. 770 words.
</P>
<P>
   MOVIE-DONKEYBOY (Undated) _ At its best, Harmony Korine's
``Julien Donkey-Boy'' will impale you on its raw urgency. At other
times, it's a slog through long improvisations that never achieve
dramatic liftoff. By Jay Carr. 640 words.
</P>
<P>
   MOVIE-GRANDFATHER (Undated) _ In ``The Grandfather,'' director
Jose Luis Garci never flinches from allowing this period piece to
play out with the leisurely amplitude of a 19th-century novel, in
which an aristocratic patriarch appears to be going the King Lear
route. By Jay Carr. 600 words.
</P>
<P>
   MOVIE-BEEFCAKE (Undated) _ ``Beefcake,'' Thom Fitzgerald's drama
with a documentary feel, is a behind-the-scenes look at
bodybuilding in the 1950s. But there is a weird, unsettling tone
about this movie. By Jim Sullivan. 700 words.
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC-MEATLOAF-INTERVIEW (Undated) _ Meat Loaf _ that round
mound of sound, that Wagnerian voice of theatrical pop-rock, that
proud king of bombast and melodrama _ is back on the stage and on
movie screens. Jim Sullivan. 1,000 words.
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC-HAMMILL (Undated) _ Veteran English rocker Peter Hammill,
who has been recording for 30 years and made 40 albums, is still
creating music that takes risks. By Jim Sullivan. 1,100 words.
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC-ROCK (Undated) _ The Counting Crows' new album, ``This
Desert Life,'' due out Tuesday, is among the best pop-rock efforts
of the year. By Steve Morse. 1,200 words.
</P>
<P>
   BOOK-BOSTON (Undated) _ Using an extraordinary map collection,
``Mapping Boston'' lays out the city as it has appeared in the
rough charts of the earliest explorers, in the detailed maps of
18th-century cartographers, in the utilitarian maps of 19th-century
draftsmen, and in the computer-generated documents of present-day
planners. By Michael Kenney. 850 words.

LOOKING FOR INFORMATION? DON'T DIAL 411 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last Sunday my wife and I awoke at 7:10 a.m. The October dawn in
the Maine mountains was coming so late I asked, ``Honey, was this
the Sunday we changed back to standard time?''
</P>
<P>
   My wife, Michelle Holmes, did not know. She gave her annual
speech about why don't they end the silliness and permanently set
the clocks halfway between Standard and Daylight Saving Time. But
since we had some commitments, we had to know the time.
</P>
<P>
   But how? We were in a house with no TV. There was a radio, but
it was downstairs in the kitchen. We were not ready to touch warm
toes to cold wood. The nearest source for a newspaper was eight
miles away. OK, call us lazy or stupid or worse, but this was a
weekend when we were trying to stay away from schedules.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle said, ``Call the time in Boston.'' I dialed directory
assistance. After asking for the time, there was a dire silence
broken only by ``Please hold for your number . . . Please continue
to hold.''
</P>
<P>
   That is when you know the computer has no clue. This means you
are about to get a clueless human being, like the one I reached
when I was trying to find Bob Dole's Los Angeles headquarters
during the 1996 presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   After the computer failed its job, a man said, ``What was that
you wanted sir?'' I repeated ``the Dole presidential campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no listing for that, sir.''
</P>
<P>
   I tried again, using every possible combination I could think
of. ``How about Dole '96? Or Dole/Kemp '96? Or Dole for the White
House or Republicans for Dole?''
</P>
<P>
   The clueless man said, ``Excuse me, but how long has Bob Dole
been running for president?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're kidding,'' I said. ``You don't know that Bob Dole is
the Republican nominee for president?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not really, sir.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Where are you, anyway?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phoenix,'' he said. ``Is that any of your business?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It would seem that it is my business to know whether my time
is being wasted by someone not on this planet.''
</P>
<P>
   I called 213-555-1212 right back and got the number for Dole's
campaign. For me, such episodes are but momentary setbacks and
represent lost American economic productivity. But just as sure as
they talk about a digital divide in computers. Directory assistance
is a modern wedge between the haves and have nots, ridiculously
punishing people who do not have PhDs in mazeology.
</P>
<P>
   Folks over 35 know what I am talking about. No longer can a
local directory assistant straighten out slightly wayward or
misspelled inquiries.  &UR; Yesterday &LR;  a friendly local directory
assistant could tell you the name of the local newspaper in Podunk
or spell the name of the mayor. Now we have directory assistants
who don't even know who is running for president.
</P>
<P>
   One of these days, people are going to fight back against this
form of corporate greed, the greed that began with the pink slips
to local operators in the 1980s and ended with a cannibalized world
that passes for service, a computer roulette with backup operators
in low-cost cities like Orlando, operators who would not know your
city even if you handed them an atlas.
</P>
<P>
   The system is so bad that US News and World Report found that 1
million wrong phone numbers are given out every day by the
telephone companies _ one out of every six. In response, the
telephone companies say they are providing more real voices and
being more flexible so if you ask for a number in Jamaica Plain
that really is in neighboring Allston, you might actually be told
the number.
</P>
<P>
   But if you are like me, you still get people who not only do not
know what planet they are on; they do not even know the time. When
the human being got on the phone to respond to my bedside request
in Maine, he said, ``The time?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' I said. ``I'm looking for the phone number that gives
you the official time on the East Coast because I don't know if the
clocks changed  &UR; last night &LR;  to standard time. By the way, do you
know what time it is?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's 6:18,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe? Oh, I get it. You're not from Boston. Where are you?
</P>
<P>
   ``New Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So what time is it out there?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's 5:18.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, well then, it has to be 7:18, since you're two hours
behind on Mountain Time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't know,'' he said. ``I don't know much about time
zones.''
</P>
<P>
   I figured that would be the end of this story except for a
dead-end 411 call I made two days ago. I was trying to get the
phone number of a hospital clinic. She could not find it (but, of
course, the next 411 operator did). Before I hung up, I asked the
woman where she was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry, but I can't give you that for security reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   The only secret she could be holding was that Bell Atlantic had
moved its operations to Mars.

HE'S PUTTING D.C. BACK ON ITS FEET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With all the amateurs, nitwits, actors, and egotists invading
politics these days, it is a pleasure to report the arrival of a
gifted rookie in an important elective office who is not only
making sense but progress.
</P>
<P>
   Say hello to Tony Williams, the mayor of the nation's capital,
who has lived in D.C. for only six years, but rode his considerable
managerial and organizational skills from the obscure backbench
post of chief financial officer to becoming a popular mayor elected
with 70 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   You need a stopwatch and a roadmap to trace this fellow's
resume, which included a one-year stint in Boston. Now he's
spearheading a revival of the creaky, corrupt, and corroded
municipal machinery of Washington. So far Williams, a highly
educated technocrat with degrees from Yale, Harvard Law, and the
Kennedy School of Government, has largely justified the faith of
the business community and Washington establishments which
supported his unlikely candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Williams had been picked by former Mayor Marion Barry, a loose
cannon if ever there was one, to be the city's chief financial
officer for three years. Before that, Williams had been chief
financial officer at the Department of Agriculture, deputy state
comptroller of Connecticut, executive director of the St. Louis
community development authority, a professor at Columbia, and
member of the New Haven Board of Aldermen.
</P>
<P>
   Off to a brilliant start, he has reassured investors and
business elites, begun to tame the district's ornery bureaucracy,
reached accommodations with unions, and placated the previously
hostile conservative Republicans who run Congress and look over
every D.C. mayor's shoulder like traffic cops outside a driving
school.
</P>
<P>
   D.C.'s municipal government was as weird and wacky as ``an
emerging democracy,'' Williams cheerfully admits, a sort of Third
World satrapy without appropriate controls, incentives,
record-keeping or discipline. ``We have to start commanding the
respect of the rest of the country,'' he said of Washington, whose
525,000 citizens, relatively small size, and hot-as-a-pistol
downtown reminds him in many ways of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Williams's signal achievement to date is conveying the
conviction that Washington's municipal government is off its back
and is well on its way to regaining its footing _ and respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a sort of feeling in the city that things are on the
mend,'' said Jake Jones, a labor lobbyist who bought a Capitol Hill
condo a year ago. ``My wife just went down to the Dept. of Motor
Vehicles, and it was amazing; she came back saying it was actually
a pleasant experience. They had done over the place. Before, it was
awful.''
</P>
<P>
   After the rambunctious reign of Mayor Marion Barry, a talented
but erratic populist high-wire act who was a black version of the
roguish James Michael Curley, the bow-tied, all-business Williams
offered the city a buttoned-down urban planner with a tough hide
and skills honed in a bunch of other cities, including Boston. For
one year in the late '80s, in the administration of Mayor Ray
Flynn, Williams was an assistant director of the Boston
Redevelopment Authority in charge of neighborhood development under
BRA chief Steve Coyle, the brilliant planner now running the
mammoth AFL-CIO pension fund in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a big fan of Steve Coyle,'' chortled Williams, who
apparently picked up some of his
you-gotta-break-eggs-if-you-want-omelettes approach from the wily
Coyle.
</P>
<P>
   Williams's life is a remarkable parable of overcoming tremendous
adversity early in life. Abandoned by a teenage mother in Los
Angeles, he had a rough launch into this life. ``He spent the first
three years of his life languishing in the home of a foster family
that didn't talk to him, sing to him, or even turn him over in his
crib,'' wrote The Washington Post's profiler Laura Stepp. ``Then
Virginia and Lewis Williams swooped him up and he found love. He
also found brothers and sisters, strict Catholic schools, a host of
after-school activities and a frame bungalow to grow up in.''
</P>
<P>
   His adoptive parents, both postal workers, set him on a path
that, despite some wobbles and stumbles, ot him through the Air
Force, then college and beyond. Now he is a crisp, decisive
technocrat firing off advanced notions for municipal innovations
and reform that has vaulted him to the forefront of the nation's
most creative mayors.
</P>
<P>
   He hopscotched the US before inaugural for advice from mayors he
admired _ Dennis Archer in Detroit, Ed Rendell in Philadelphia,
Steve Goldsmith in Indianapolis. ``People want to see the
fundamentals addressed,'' he said, adding praise for Mayor Menino's
``Main Streets'' revitalization scheme for neighborhood shopping
centers ouside Boston's downtown core.
</P>
<P>
   In D.C., he likens his role to restoring a sports franchise
fallen on hard times. ``This is like rebuilding a baseball or
football team. You try to get some victories, while you assemble a
coaching staff. Here, you're rebuilding a government.''
</P>
<P>
   He plots to hire 900 middle managers, salaries tied to federal
payscales, who would serve without tenure, who could be axed if
they failed to deliver. He's big on accountability, and spends a
lot of time talking about systems, and how to craft lines of
authority so that municipal time-servers and chore-evading drudges
can be somehow altered to become ``change agents.''
</P>
<P>
   He came in with a big broom and a free hand. ``I inherited a
government that really didn't exist,'' he shrugs. His tours of
other cities left him convinced of this: ``The biggest signature of
a successful city is this sense of purpose.'' Off results so far,
the verdict is that Williams not only ``got game,'' he's also got a
sense of purpose that only a scrappy survivor or a foster child
could come by.

ANIMATION, WITH STYLE   AND SWEEP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Epic, mythic, simply terrific, ``Princess Mononoke'' brings a
new kind of animation experience to the American moviegoing
mainstream. What's novel about Hayao Miyazaki's animation isn't so
much its style. Although it has its own distinct look, it's
comfortingly traditional in its drawing. But American animation
almost never attempts the reach Miyazaki unfurls in this medieval
Japanese saga. It's teeming with action and enough characters for
several stories. Yet the ultimate star is nature itself in
Miyazaki's take on the twilight of the gods, the retreat of nature
before the onslaught of humans, and the struggle between love and
the forces of fear and hate.
</P>
<P>
   In deploring an onslaught against an ecosystem, it relates to
nature more personally and more mystically than anything
customarily seen by Western audiences. And yet it's so much more
than just a Greenpeace commercial. Set in the mists of history, it
intertwines several plot strands, all of which deal with the
inevitability of change and the need for each new generation to
work its way toward peace and purity. Sometimes it's brutally
violent. Princess Mononoke is a fierce little warrior (voiced in
what might be called cutting-edge fashion by Claire Danes) who
literally runs with the wolves who raised her, is especially
devoted to her big mother wolf, and is doing her best to destroy an
iron foundry that's polluting the water and pushing back the
forest. And yet the remarkable woman _ her voice is filled with
steely purpose by Minnie Driver _ who for better and worse founded
this frontier enterprise, Lady Eboshi, built it as a utopia.
</P>
<P>
   By employing lepers and former prostitutes, she gains a devoted
work force and gives them dignity by allowing them to better their
lives through her primitive military industrial complex. Coming
between the two women is a brave youth, Ashitaka, from a dying
community in the north. He killed a rampaging boar, not realizing
it was a forest god driven mad by an iron ball shot into it. But
the boar nicked his arm, leaving a wound an old seeress sees
ascursed and fatal unless he can get it healed by the supreme god
of the forest. This deity, many miles away in Mononoke's neck of
the woods, takes the shape of a magical glowing stag by day, then
changes into a vast sheet of ectoplasm that canopies the forest at
night. En route, Ashitaka saves the lives of two of Lady Eboshi's
retainers and glimpses just enough of Princess Mononoke to fall in
love with her.
</P>
<P>
   Complicated enough? There's one more element, a federation of
ruling lords who plot to steal immortality by possessing the head
of the magic stag and destroying the increasingly strong peasant
encampment of Lady Eboshi. It's a rich mix, and one that casts a
spell, both in the intimate yet reverent takes on nature, which
always retains a dimension of otherworldliness alongside its
ultimate benevolence, and the pungent characters with their
clashing agendas. It also has something to say about the
deceptiveness of appearances. A view of Princess Mononoke seen with
blood on her mouth is initially startling, speaking to usof
savagery, until we realize shehas been trying to suck from
thewounded body of her mother thewolf an iron ball from
LadyEboshi's foundry.
</P>
<P>
   You'll be riveted to see if ``Princess Mononoke'' can possibly
reconcile industrializing, encroaching man with nature, which would
heal if it can, but may not be given the chance. At once, it
occupies common ground with the great reworkings of the oldest
myths and archetypes, with its wandering hero and promethean
builder. It's filled with quests and tests and growth and
destruction, in short, with tumultuous change. And yet, beneath it
all, it speaks of a link to eternal, unchanging forces and
entities. It relates to nature in both spiritual and bloody ways,
and incorporates its human strivers into a larger plan. A lesser
film would simply editorialize, asking us to learn to relate to
nature with love and respect instead of trying to conquer it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Princess Mononoke'' is in the same ballpark as landmark
Western allegories ranging from ``Pilgrim's Progress''' to the
Wagner Ring Cycle. It evokes nature in a more immediate yet more
profound way than we're used to. If the iron represents technology
and transmits the curse of divisive fear and hate _ call it the
dark side _ this profound, humane, and enormously generous film
rides a vision of forgiving nature. ``Princess Mononoke'' realizes
that we may need to work our way through chaos and the tumult in
order to find our way back to nature. Meanwhile, it transports us
to some pretty wonderful realms of imagination and heart. Enhanced
by a moody score that wisely utilizes both silence and natural
sounds, its breadth, profundity, and stunningly rendered vision
make idealism seem renewed and breathtaking again.

ECHOES OF OLD SPAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Grandfather,'' Spain's 1999 Oscar nominee, flies in the
face of everything that's prized in films today. This means it's
rewarding in ways that few films are. Director (and
co-scriptwriter) Jose Luis Garci never flinches from allowing this
period piece to play out with the leisurely amplitude of a
19th-century novel (its source).
</P>
<P>
   It's not only a sumptuous piece but one of substance, in keeping
with the values it emphasizes, such as family honor and noblesse
oblige. Both are on the way out in the turn-of-the-century world in
which the film unfolds. The story shuttles between Madrid and a
rocky seacoast village where Fernando Fernan-Gomez's aristocratic
patriarch appears to be going the King Lear route.
</P>
<P>
   The once-proud owner of virtually everything in sight is now
impoverished and going blind. He's still a figure of towering
presence and authority, although he's at the mercy of his
daughter-in-law. The story hinges on his discovery that only one of
the two young granddaughters he loves was fathered by his late son.
The other was born of an affair his daughter-in-law had with a
painter. Obsessed with finding out which is, as he puts it, his
true granddaughter, he runs afoul of his daughter-in-law, a woman
whose power is waning along with the career of the minister who
until recently had been her lover. But she's still powerful enough
to arrive from Madrid in a carriage, determined to shut the old man
up and end his embarrassing inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   She and a few minions plot to stash him away in a monastery, but
the fierce old man won't stand for it. There's a wonderful set
piece when he marches into the town's tavern and shames the
plotters by reminding them how he supported them and their parents
when he still ran things. Then he storms out magnificently in high
dudgeon and a driving rain. The stature with which Fernan-Gomez
fills the role elevates it to something like tragic grandeur and
largely carries the otherwise gorgeous but often pedestrian film.
He's a hypnotic presence, this old lion come to ruin, whether he's
gloomily exchanging philosophies with the girls' graceful but
defeated old tutor, or warming us in the exchanges with his
granddaughters, appealingly played by Cristina Cruz and Alicia
Rozas. Both convince us they not only love him but love him enough
to fight for him.
</P>
<P>
   Cayetana Guillen Cuervo turns the daughter-in-law into an
increasingly sympathetic and substantial character as the film
proceeds, showing that while her father-in-law chose honor above
love, she did the reverse. The Iberian landscapes, especially the
cliffside settings, add to the somber pull of an essentially
melodramatic story that could seem overextended. But it isn't,
thanks to the warmth and conviction of the acting and the
handsomely turned language, which comes across even in subtitles.
The cast even amasses enough cumulative impact to carry the film
past a sentimental ending. ``The Grandfather'' is a solid, humane,
old-fashioned film in the best sense of the term.

BRITISH ROCK PIONEER KEEPS EVOLVING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In terms of what is happening,'' says veteran English musician
Peter Hammill, ``I think the only time there was anything remotely
close to me being fashionable would have been in the early days (of
the band Van der Graaf Generator) and even then the relationship
was a little bit achy . . . because we struggled to avoid being
categorized or put in a box.''
</P>
<P>
   Hammill, 51, has been recording for 30 years and made 40 albums,
either as the singer for Van der Graaf Generator or as a solo
artist. He's a friend and sometime collaborator with Peter Gabriel,
and he's highly regarded in his native country and across Europe.
He was there at the beginnings of progressive rock, and he has kept
his music true in the real sense of the term: He makes music that
takes risks, explores diverse themes and genres, and
</P>
<P>
   is emotionally compelling.
</P>
<P>
   The progressive genre itself, notes Hammill, seems to have ended
up ``a long long way from where we started.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my main objectives,'' says Hammill, ``is to avoid being
boring to myself . . . on the principle that if it is boring to
myself, then I might last another year doing this boring stuff, but
sooner or later the audience will be bored as well.''
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, Hammill's profile is on the low end of the
scale. Hammill has just embarked upon his first US tour since 1990.
He comes to Boston on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of people will go, `Oh, he has just shut up for
the last 10 years and is only getting ready to do music again,' ''
says Hammill, from Montreal, where he has just landed, ``which is a
long way from the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It kind of slipped by,'' Hammill says of America. ``I did not
mean it to be that long, but I have done my share of endless
touring back in the days of Van der Graaf, and from a personal and
artistic point of view I don't like to tour too much in any given
year. The maximum is three to four months. I had offers from other
places and I took the offers. In the end, it took a conscious
effort to do this. I thought, `This is ridiculous, I can't go and
never play (America) again.' ''
</P>
<P>
   His recent albums, including the studio album ``This'' and a
double-live solo set recorded in 1992 called ``Typical,'' are
available only as imports. Both reveal a singer-songwriter
operating, still, at peak form. ``When I am actually working on the
material, either writing it or recording it,'' Hammill says, he
does so ``without being egotistical, without a reference to the
audience. I think one of the characteristics of my audience, small
as it is, is a lot of them expect change from song to song, from
album to album, and they are prepared to go along with what
(another person) might seem to think are unpromising trails, in the
hope there will be something interesting at the end of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Working as a solo artist _ even though that can emcompass
multiple collaborations _ makes more sense as you get older,
Hammill believes. That was part of the reason he left Van der Graaf
Generator in the late-'70s. He was in his late 20s and thought:
``If there aren't other things in your life other than being in a
boys gang, which is technically what a band is, then there is
something wrong with the life. And if there is something wrong with
the life then there will be something wrong with the music.''
</P>
<P>
   As with Gabriel and Genesis, leaving the group was an
opportunity for Hammill to strip songs down, make them more
personal. He felt freed in that he did not have to write things
``all of us could agree this is material we could stand by.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that he has been able to pursue this career, he says,
``remains a fantastic privilege. I get to do what makes sense to me
_ the hour-and-a-half of performing live or the fun of making a
record is something that doesn't come into most people's lives. To
do a job where you're grappling with your demons or obsessions or
what have you, but it's the grappling with them that makes some
degree of sense of things. It's enormously uplifting.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone would apply the term ``uplifting'' to this music.
Hammill certainly wrestles with dark themes, and he's been tagged
by some critics as possessing an apocalyptic outlook. ``It comes
with the territory of actually addressing (those themes),'' says
Hammill. ``Maybe it's a thing of commission on my part and a thing
of homage in terms of other people writing that stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an undertow of the cathartic element,'' says Hammill,
of performance. ``It requires a lot of concentration, and the
catharsis is on a slower, more gradual level than on any kind of
primal scream point. Part of being a performer who's done it for 30
years is that gradually one becomes an actor. . . . Each song, and
each person in the song is a character in a different situation,
and to make the performance better one has to be an actor.''
</P>
<P>
   Actors, of course, often get stereotyped by the kind of roles
they tend to play or misperceived by the public as being their
roles. Hammill says his audience doesn't tend to fall into that
trap. ``They've seen what I've done,'' he says, ``and the point has
been made. I've made it oblique sometimes by actually writing about
actors, saying they pick up a role, drop off a role. But I think
there is a complete understanding in the audience that, of course,
there is an element of me in each characterization and each bit of
writing . . . but generally there is a proper understanding that I
am also a fun-loving and normal guy; the demons are exorcised, not
in the most dramatic of senses, but . . . I'm liberated to some
extent. They're not put away in the box, never to be addressed
again, but at least once you've looked at them one can get on with
the rest of life. The hope is that that same process is what
happens with any art; it's not about aggrandizing the artist, it's
about saying the stuff that is actually common human experience,
and by the `magic' of whatever form one is working in, your own
personal experience as an artist is mirrorred in the experience of
the listener, the viewer, the reader, whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   The range of Monday's show, says Hammill, is ``enormous. We do
that classical stuff, we can be very quiet, and we can be very,
very loud as well.''

SPONTANEITY SUITS THE COUNTING CROWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Given the high cost of studio time, most bands rehearse their
songs carefully before spending the money to record them. But the
Counting Crows put extra pressure on themselves. They went into the
studio without new songs _ a rarity for them _ and prayed they
could write them there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't even rehearse because we had no songs,'' says
Crows singer-songwriter Adam Duritz. ``But I felt we had been
learning to be a band all along and this would be a good test of
how far we had come.''
</P>
<P>
   The answer is very far, judging from the new album, ``This
Desert Life,'' due out Tuesday. It's among the best pop-rock discs
of the year. It starts with the infectious ``Hanginaround'' (``I've
been hanging around this town too long''), then heads uptempo with
``Mrs. Potter's Lullabye'' (sounding like a streetwise tune from an
early Bruce Springsteen album), the jangly ``Four Days,'' and the
Dylan-like story song, ``Saint Robinson and His Cadillac Dream.''
</P>
<P>
   As always, the quippy lyrics of the prep-schooled Duritz carry
the day (``Things are getting worse but I'm feeling a lot better,''
he sings at one point), but the rest of the Crows, especially
guitarist Dan Vickrey, also distinguish themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to get more out of the whole band, and stop myself
from smothering them this time,'' says Duritz. ``We've always been
a collaborative band, but we were way more collaborative on this
record,'' he adds.
</P>
<P>
   Duritz, known best for his Dylanesque modern-rock anthem, ``Mr.
Jones,'' conceived some of the new songs as thematic follow-ups to
tracks from past Crows discs. ``I Wish I Was a Girl'' is a sequel
to the earlier ``Goodnight Elzabeth.'' Sample lyric: ``Elizabeth,
I'm doing all right these days _ I'm going down to Hollywood and
they're going to make a movie from the things crawling around in my
brain.'' ``Saint Robinson and His Cadillac Dream,'' about someone
teetering on the edge, is a companion piece to the older
``Mercury.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hollywood-based Duritz says the album's characters and tone
were inspired by living in Los Angeles. The song ``Amy Hit the
Atmosphere'' is about a ballerina from Montana who comes to LA and
struggles with heroin. ``Speedway'' is about how life can grind you
down in LA, while ``All My Friends'' shows the flip side of just
looking for a little fun.
</P>
<P>
   The title ``This Desert Life'' also applies to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about the duality of LA,'' Duritz says. ``It's a desert
city, but also an ocean city. And LA is a soul-less business town,
but also a town with thriving artists. LA is full of people who
didn't want to be what their parents were and left their hometowns
to go there. It's a dreamer's town and I'm a dreamer.''
</P>

   A Ryko farewell: Rykodisc, often called ``The little label that
could,'' was recently bought by Chris Blackwell's Palm Pictures
label, which is requiring that Ryko move its headquarters from
Salem, Mass., to New York. The last remaining Ryko staffers packed
up this week. It was a bittersweet night (though made sweeter by
hearing guest DJ Monoman of the Lyres play his home collection of
international Merseybeat records). Still, as Ryko's Sonya Kolowrat
said, ``The shock hasn't set in yet. I've found a place to live in
Brooklyn, but I'm going to miss this area.'' The feeling is mutual.

`DONKEY-BOY' A RAW, URGENT VIEW OF SCHIZOPHRENIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the family at the center of Harmony Korine's ``Julien
Donkey-Boy,'' dysfunction would be a step up. Korine wrote the
script for the provocative ``Kids'' and made his directorial debut
with ``Gummo,'' a meretricious wallow in squalor. With ``Julien
Donkey-Boy,'' his study of schizophrenia, he has earned the
imprimatur of Denmark's edgy Dogma 95 group, with its
stripped-down, back-to-basics aesthetic. His cinematographer,
Anthony Dod Mantle, and editor, Valdis Oskarsdottir, are charter
Dogmatists both, Mantle having filmed ``The Celebration'' and
Oskarsdottir having worked on ``Mifune.'' They used small hand-held
digital video cameras, some attached to the bodies of the actors,
some hidden, all designed to shake up film's usual visual
strategies and points of view. At its best, it will impale you on
its raw urgency. At other times, it's a slog through long
improvisations that never achieve dramatic liftoff.
</P>
<P>
   It can be argued that Korine's guerrilla shooting style is
suited to the chaotic life of Julien and his family, whose
patriarch, played by Werner Herzog, shuttles between grotesque and
really creepy. He's given to sadistically hosing down one of his
sons naked in the backyard, yelling at him to be a man, then later
offering him $10 to slip into his dead mother's dress and dance for
him. Julien, played by Ewen Bremner, the most scarecrow-like of the
``Trainspotting'' cast, with a tenuousness that makes him seem to
have not quite been put together right, begins the film on a note
of unsettling violence as we see him approach a little boy and a
few turtles in the woods, then cut to a shot of him patting down a
shallow grave.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Julien spends most of the film chasing love and redemption.
He plays make-believe telephone games with his pregnant teenage
sister (Chloe Sevigny), in which they pretend to speak to their
dead mother. He also visits church regularly and takes everything
that happens there, including confession, to heart. And he does
janitorial work at a school for the blind, where he also helps the
students get around and befriends an ice skater named Chrissy.
These are the boundaries of Julien's skewed world, and Bremner's
broken hobble through it takes on increasing urgency as we can feel
Julien's grip beginning to weaken, pushed by the constant carping
of his critical father and also by Julien's inner turmoil coming to
a boil. The end, involving Julien's reaction to what happens to his
pregnant sister, is shattering.
</P>
<P>
   At times the film makes you squirm, partly from the emotional
nakedness in which it convinces you it's dealing (if nothing else,
``Julien Donkey-Boy'' is the most primal film of the year, with an
anguished ambulatory id as its protagonist), partly from what you
can't help feeling are violations of its characters' innermost
intimacies.
</P>
<P>
   But there also are times when you feel the improvs flailing and
reaching and borrowing Felliniesque grotesques (a magician who
stuffs his mouth full of cigarettes, which he lights, then eats; an
armless drummer) just to keep the bizarre flavor going. The end of
``Julien Donkey-Boy'' is wrenching, yet you can't say you didn't
see it coming. The question is whether, if you're not a Dogma 95
completist, you'll be able to make it to the end.

POLL SHOWS MAYORAL RACE HEADING FOR A RUNOFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RACHEL GORDON and ILENE LELCHUK  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The real contest in San Francisco's mayoral
election Tuesday is which of incumbent Willie Brown's three top
challengers will break out of a tie to challenge him in a run-off
race.
</P>
<P>
   With nearly three in 10 voters undecided and the electorate
apparently unhappy with the choices, the race comes down to the
candidates' final hours of appearances, campaign mail and
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``This really is a race for the Number 2 spot,'' said pollster
Del Ali of Research 2000 in Rockville, Md., which conducted an
election poll for the San Francisco Examiner and KTVU-TV.
</P>
<P>
   Former Mayor Frank Jordan and Board of Supervisors President Tom
Ammiano, who launched an unorthodox write-in campaign just two
weeks ago, each received support from 12 percent of those surveyed
earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   Former political consultant Clint Reilly, at one time Brown's
major rival, had the support of 11 percent of those surveyed,
losing support after voters were bombarded with publicity about a
20-year-old domestic violence incident.
</P>
<P>
   The poll shows Brown on top with 35 percent, but that is well
short of the 50 percent plus one vote needed to win on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   If no candidate wins a majority, the top two vote-getters face a
run-off election on Dec. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Ali said Brown is all but assured of a place in the runoff,
barring a disaster over the next few days, even if voters aren't
enthusiastic about his performance.
</P>
<P>
   The random telephone poll of 630 registered voters was conducted
Monday through Wednesday. The margin of error is plus or minus 4
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano's write-in campaign adds the most uncertainty to the
outcome. The poll showed he has taken support away from each of the
major candidates during the past month, but doesn't have a majority
of gay voters _ his strongest constituency.
</P>
<P>
   The poll also reflects that voters are growing more critical of
Reilly as the campaign continues, with his negative ratings more
than double his positives.
</P>
<P>
   While Reilly is hurt by the domestic violence incident, the poll
shows Brown's candidacy is damaged by the ongoing FBI investigation
into minority contracting at City Hall. More than 40 percent of
those surveyed said the investigation makes it less likely they
will vote to give the incumbent a second four-year term.
</P>
<P>
   And those polled identified homelessness as the most important
issue affecting their vote, although they spread responsibility for
solving the problem among the mayor, other elected officials and
charitable organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Brown campaign consultant Jack Davis has alleged that Reilly
viciously beat a former girlfriend, breaking her ribs and jaw.
Reilly admits to a domestic violence incident, but said the Davis
account is an overblown fabrication.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly will not describe what happened, although he said no
bones were broken. He also said the incident happened when he had a
drinking problem. He said he has not touched alcohol in years.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning this weekend will be crucial as the candidates try
to woo voters, particularly the undecided. The campaign
organizations also will do everything they can to make sure people
identified as supporters actually vote.
</P>
<P>
   The poll found that Ammiano, a long-time gay activist, doesn't
have the vote of homosexuals and lesbians locked up. Eleven percent
of the poll respondents said they are gay, and of those, 34 percent
expressed support for Brown and 28 percent for Ammiano, with Jordan
and Reilly each getting 7 percent. Several lesser-known candidates
got 3 percent of the gay vote, while 21 percent of those surveyed
said they were undecided.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano's entry has drawn voters from all the other candidates.
Support for Brown and Jordan is down 2 percentage points each from
the Examiner/KTVU poll of Sept. 21-23. And Reilly, who has been the
target of unrelenting attacks from Brown, sank 5 points from that
survey.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, Reilly and Jordan continue to see their favorable ratings
erode, the poll found, but by far the most growing dissatisfaction
is with Reilly. Fifty percent of the voters said they don't like
him. Only a month ago, 34 percent gave him low marks. Reilly's
favorable mark is at 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's unfavorable rating was up 4 percentage points, to 46
percent. His favorable rating was 39 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's unfavorable rating also went up 4 percentage points to
44 percent. His favorable rating was 31 percent. The poll said that
people find him ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, a former police chief and career cop who served one term
as mayor before Brown ousted him in 1995, is relying heavily on
rousing his constituency of more conservative voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're concentrating on continuing to identify our voters and
making sure they get out to vote,'' said Ed Slevin, Jordan's
campaign manager.

RED SOX LOOKING FOR THE RIGHT CONNECTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Red Sox are meeting with potential television carriers to
fix the mess left by Gene Jankowsky and Kevin Dunn.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox fired JCS New England Television Network Company at
the end of the season because it failed to pay an estimated $6
million in telecast rights fees.
</P>
<P>
   JCS also failed to pay an untold amount to New England Sports
Network, the premium cable channel partly owned by the Red Sox.
NESN produced the games for JCS.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox seem to bungle their television deal every time it
comes up for renewal. Channel 68 carried games for two years but
deemed the $14 million the Red Sox sought as exorbitant, leaving
the door open for JCS, which acquired the rights for about $11
million.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Red Sox are back at the table reviewing updated bids
from old suitors. Red Sox vice president Jim Healy said the biggest
problem has been finding a station with enough clear time to handle
between 70 and 80 games. Over the years, network programming has
dominated prime-time slots, leaving sports in the hands of
independent stations, most of which were in need of strong anchor
programming. ``The baseball audience had declined,'' Healy said.
``And we didn't have that many options.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox' relationship with JCS remains ``amicable'' and the
team is working with the company to resolve the debt. ``There's
nothing in dispute,'' Healy said.
</P>
<P>
   The team wants to secure a deal as soon as possible and has been
``very pleased'' with the responses, Healy added.
</P>
<P>
   Among the bidders is Channel 56. The station had a deal with JCS
and carried half the games last year. The Warner Bros. affiliate is
one of the candidates, as is Channel 38, the United Paramount
Network affiliate known for its Bruins coverage. The future of
Channel 38 is tied up in the regulatory process overseeing the
merger of Viacom and CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Diller is supposedly another candidate. Diller, one of the
most powerful media moguls in the country, was interested in
purchasing Channel 68 last year _ it was eventually sold to PAX _
if it had the Red Sox deal. The Red Sox refused to get involved
with Diller.
</P>
<P>
   The other suitor is Fox. It is unclear how the games would be
spread between cable's Fox Sports New England and the network's
Channel 25. But Rupert Murdoch offered the Red Sox a 10-year deal
last year and was rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Stay tuned and pray that team officials finally get it right.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   No friend in Bird
</P>
<P>
   Seems that NBC's Jim Gray had a few run-ins with none other than
Larry Bird. In his recent book, ``Bird Watching,'' Bird said Gray
was even ``more pushy'' than he thought.
</P>
<P>
   Before Game 7 of the Indianapolis Pacers-Chicago Bulls Eastern
Conference final in 1998, Bird wrote, he had to turn the team's
play board toward the wall, away from unwanted eyes. ``Sure enough,
there's Jim Gray in our locker room, trying to turn the board back
around so he could see our plays,'' Bird wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, during the game, we're in a timeout and our public
relations guy, David Benner, is standing there, and Gray is trying
to listen in on our huddle. After the players went back on the
court, I quietly told Benner, `David, you tell Mr. Gray if he
sticks his nose in my huddle again I'm going to pull him over those
seats and kick his butt in front of 20,000 people.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Bird thought Gray was a weasel. When he later was begged by an
NBA executive to talk to Gray after the Pacers had lost, Bird
agreed and was pretty cold.
</P>
<P>
   Gray asked, ``Do you think Chicago can beat Utah for the
championship?''
</P>
<P>
   Bird looked right at him: ``I don't really care.''
</P>
<P>
   So much for having an effective sideline reporter.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Enlightening news
</P>
<P>
   The NFL is willing to rethink its doubleheader blackout rule. It
doesn't affect Boston on Sunday because the Patriots play in
Arizona. But if the Patriots were home, Boston would receive only
two of the three nationally broadcasted games.
</P>
<P>
   The rule has been around seemingly forever and was designed to
get fans to attend games. In 1973, Congress enacted a law giving
the NFL power to black out a home market if the game wasn't sold
out within 72 hours of kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   The doubleheader rule was part of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Paul Tagliabue believes eliminating the blackout
rule would be a tragic mistake. But he recently told Sports
Illustrated, ``The doubleheader rule, maybe you might convince me
to compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said no specific meetings have been
scheduled yet, but ``the door was open, slightly.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They'll make the call
</P>
<P>
   Craig Bollerjack and Ed Cunningham will call the West
Virginia-Miami game on CBS at noon Saturday. Sean McDonough and
Todd Blackledge will work the Florida-Georgia game at 3 p.m. . . .
Kevin Harlan and Sam Wyche have the Patriots-Arizona Cardinals game
at 4 p.m. on Sunday. Fox has St. Louis at Tennessee at 1 p.m., with
Dick Stockton and Matt Millen, followed by Dallas-Indianapolis with
Pat Summerall and John Madden . . . HBO's ``Inside the NFL'' is
moving to Thursday nights at 8 p.m.

PROVIDING AN INCOME STREAM AFTER JOB ENDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, October 31, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My job is about to end in two months because of outsourcing.
I am 61 and would like to retire rather than job hunt. I am single
and have no dependents. My assets are: $127,000 in a traditional
annuity with TIAA, $234,000 in the CREF stock fund, a $58,000 IRA
in American Century Select, a $23,000 IRA in Westwood Equity, a
$7,000 SEP-IRA in Hotchkiss and Wiley International, a $3,600
SEP-IRA in Stein Roe Capital Opportunities, a $3,200 SEP-IRA in
Schwab's Standard and Poors 500, a total of $15,200 in bank CDs and
$25,000 in a money market fund. I get $600 a month from the rental
of a small apartment, and anticipate Social Security benefits of
about $960 a month at age 62. My house has an $80,000 mortgage and
costs about $17,000 a year to run. My personal expenses are
approximately $16,000 a year. I am thinking about rolling over 5
percent to 10 percent of the CREF account into the TIAA Real Estate
fund. What do you think of that?
</P>
<P>
   N.N., Newton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. As I add up the situation, you anticipate annual expenses of
$33,000, and income of $18,720 (once Social Security kicks in). My
suggestion to provide you with the required $14,280 income stream
is to move approximately half of the portfolio to the fixed-income
side.
</P>
<P>
   Leave the money market account as is, since you'll need cash to
tide you over until your first Social Security checks arrive. Then,
if there is money left in that account, I'd move it to the Vanguard
GNMA fund, where you can expect a yield of about 6.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Next, I suggest you move all of the TIAA annuity money and
$123,000 of the money in TIAA-CREF into the TIAA Bond Plus account,
which invests in an intermediate-term bond portfolio dominated by
government issues. This would leave you with the CD accounts as
emergency funds and $230,800 remaining in stock investments, which
should provide the long-term growth that will protect you against
the inflation of the later years of your retirement.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am 64 and my wife, who has no earned income, is 60. I will
retire in five years. My goal is to accumulate about $3 million to
have spendable income of $120,000 and a like amount for
reinvestment as a hedge against inflation. I would like to preserve
as much as possible of my annuity account accumulation for my
estate, and therefore am planning not to annuitize my benefits at
age 69, but to take required minimum distributions as of age 70
1/2. My TIAA-CREF accounts include $282,000 in TIAA, $222,000 in
the Real Estate account, and $353,000 in the CREF Stock account;
annual contributions will be about $11,500 for the next five years,
divided evenly between the TIAA and CREF Stock accounts. Personal
investments for myself and my wife consist of $380,000 in General
Electric stock, $29,000 in Duff and Phelps Utilities Income,
$277,000 in Flag Communications class A, $222,000 in Vanguard
Morgan Growth, $69,000 in Vanguard U.S. Growth, a $76,000 403(b)
account in Sentinel Balanced, and $45,000 in various municipal
bonds, averaging a 5.15 percent yield. Are my investment and income
goals realistic? Is it a good idea to avoid annuitization?
</P>
<P>
   C.L., Nantucket, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Is the target realistic? It's in the ballpark. You would have
to produce an 8.44 percent average annual portfolio return over the
next five years for your current $1,953,000 accumulation to reach
$3 million, with $11,500 annual contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Thats a reasonable expectation when you look at long-term
average gains for the stock market. As for whether its a reasonable
expectation for the next five years, maybe and maybe not. If I were
you I would hedge my bets by moving a bit more to the fixed-income
side.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the TIAA-CREF positions, you have nothing but that
$76,000 403(b) account which you can move without tax consequences,
so start there, putting that account in Vanguard GNMA.
</P>
<P>
   Also, I'd divide the CREF Stock account into thirds, one-third
remaining as is, another third going to TIAA-CREF Bond Plus fund
and the final third into TIAA-CREF Managed Allocations.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, I agree with you that as long as you desire to
maximize your estate, annuitizing is a poor idea.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am 43 and have $8,000 in a Fidelity Puritan fund account
and $5,000 in Scudder Growth and Income; I add $200 to each fund
monthly. I also have $5,000 Roth IRAs in Vanguard Windsor II and
Vanguard Index funds, to which I will make the maximum
contributions. I have $40,000 in my 401(k) plan at work, all
invested in T. Rowe Price's Science and Technology. I contribute 10
percent of my salary to the account. Finally, I have $15,000 worth
of individual stocks and $25,000 in savings. Am I diversified
enough? All these funds have good track records but all but Science
and Technology are having bad years. Should I seek other funds for
the Roth IRA accumulation? The Price fund is doing well, but do I
need to move some of it to balance the portfolio out?
</P>
<P>
   A.M., San Diego
</P>
<P>
   A. With 51 percent of your total portfolio in the Science and
Technology sector, you don't have a well-balanced portfolio. But
rather than selling some of those shares, I suggest you bring the
portfolio into balance by reallocating your on-going contributions
to the 401(k) into other investments.
</P>
<P>
   I'm presuming that by Vanguard Index you are referring to the
Vanguard Index 500, and if that's the case, all four of your other
funds focus on large-cap domestic stocks, with the exception of the
bond side of the Fidelity Puritan portfolio. You might lump these
together and think of them as the core holding of your portfolio.
It now represents nearly 29.5 percent of the total portfolio. I
would set a target of working your core segment up to at least 50
percent of the portfolio, and also rounding out your
diversification by adding minor positions in small-cap and
international funds.
</P>
<P>
   Since you don't supply an amount for the contributions to the
401(k), I can't suggest dollar allocations within the 401(k), but
you probably would want to allocate your contributions somewhere in
the area of 60 percent to whatever large-cap core-type offerings
are on the 401(k) menu, and then divide the remaining 40 percent
between small-cap and international offerings, if available.

LAWYERS, TEACHERS REVISIT `A CIVIL ACTION' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yale president Kingman Brewster was once asked what he had
learned during his years as a professor at the Harvard Law School.
``I learned that every proposition is arguable,'' he replied. And
in some cases, re-arguable.
</P>
<P>
   A recently published law school text, ``A Documentary Companion
to `A Civil Action' '' (Foundation Press), features introductory
essays by every major player in the Woburn toxic-wells trial that
produced a best-selling book for Jonathan Harr and a star vehicle
for actor John Travolta. Harr's book is widely used in law schools,
and the ``Companion'' is also catching on. ``Harr wrote the book
largely from the perspective of the plaintiff, because they gave
him access,'' says coauthor Lewis Grossman, a law professor at
American University. ``This is a counternarrative to Jonathan's
book.''
</P>
<P>
   In his introduction, Harr mentions that Harvard law prof Charles
Nesson, one of the plaintiffs' lawyers, orginally wanted to get
Harr's friend and neighbor Tracy Kidder to do the book. Kidder
wasn't available and recommended Harr. For his part, Nesson
comments: ``My best move in the Woburn litigation: Bringing in
Jonathan Harr.'' All three of the primary combatants _ Foley,
Hoag's William Cheeseman, who represented W. R. Grace; Hale and
Dorr's Jerome Facher, who represented Beatrice ; and the
plaintiffs' lead attorney, Jan Schlichtmann _ contribute relatively
dispassionate and thoughtful analyses of the trial and the issues
at law. Facher has also written a longer, more combative critique
of the movie and book slated for publication in the Seattle
University Law Review.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, we learn that the Boston Bar Association plans to
honor the judge in the Woburn case, Walter Jay Skinner, with the
Haskell Cohn Award for Distinguished Judicial Service next month.
The primary purpose of the award is to honor Skinner's
achievements, first as a crusading prosecutor on attorney general
Edward Brooke's staff, and then for more than two decades on the
federal bench. A secondary agenda is to express many lawyers' sense
that Skinner ran the Woburn trial fairly, but got tagged as a
corporate flunky by Harr's book and the Hollywood movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``He put away some very bad guys in the 1960s,'' says
association president Thomas Dwyer. ``Not guys who were cheating on
their breakfast tabs, but guys who were real thieves. He used
government power to do good.''
</P>
<P>
   An in-house job
</P>
<P>
   More hilarity emanates from the temple of self-dealing, public
broadcasting giant WGBH. At the station where the boss of ``Nova''
sent her husband off to find the Loch Ness monster and where
employing the wife of the Democratic National Commitee's finance
chairman had nothing, repeat nothing to do with selling those donor
lists to the Democrats, we find the crew of the hit show ``This Old
House'' building a new home for the brother of a crew member. The
lucky fellow in question is Dick Silva, the brother of the show's
construction manager, Tom Silva. (Dick's house burned down.) A
``House'' watcher writes: ``I'm certain that donors will be happy
to learn their contributions are helping construct a four-bedroom
manse on a landscaped, wooded lot in Billerica,'' Mass.
</P>
<P>
   But wait _ I thought these clowns just renovated houses.
Generally, yes, a spokeswoman allows, but twice before in the
series's 21 years, they have built from the ground up. Asked if
Silva's status seemed like an unusual qualification for 'GBH
munificence, she gamely replied: ``I wouldn't call him an
insider.''
</P>
<P>
   The Arguably Watch
</P>
<P>
   Readers with short memories will recall my suggestion that the
overused adverb ``arguably'' has become a gawky synonym for
``not.'' An in-house propaganda sheet of the Pew Charitable Trusts
describes grantee Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of the University of
Pennsylvania's Annenberg School, as ``arguably the nation's leading
scholar of political discourse,'' perhaps on the strength of her
imposing, 18-page resume. Reader submissions to Arguably Watch
gratefully accepted.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Osie Burleigh puzzled over the cordless phone connection. OK,
her telephone was a piece of fruit, and the other party was sitting
less than 4 feet away. But when you're 3 years old and speaking to
one of your idols through the business end of a banana, you take
the deal pretty seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know what you're supposed to say when you talk on a
bananaphone?'' asked Raffi, the popular children's entertainer.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' said Osie, frowning.
</P>
<P>
   ``You say, `Yello,' '' said Raffi.
</P>
<P>
   Osie's face brightened. ``Oh,'' she said. ``Yello?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yello, Osie,'' the singer said softly. ``I'm Raffi.''
</P>
<P>
   Osie, like other wee ones at her Dorchester day-care center,
probably had a good fix already on the bearded guy holding the
Chiquita. After nearly a quarter-century in the business, 13
mega-selling albums, three home videos, seven songbooks, 13 picture
books, a trio of Grammy nominations, and dozens more awards for his
recording projects and educational initiatives, Raffi belongs to an
elite group of mono-name performers (think Elvis, Liza, Bruce,
Madonna) who need no further introduction to their fans.
</P>
<P>
   A concert last Saturday in Cambridge, Mass., to benefit the
Horizons Initiative, a Boston-based agency serving homeless
children like Osie, was an instant sellout: one testament to the
singer's evergreen popularity with the ``Baby Beluga'' set.
Desperate parents were calling up the agency a few days before the
show and offering $500 a ticket. To paraphrase one Harvard Graduate
School of Education official, try telling your preschooler that
Raffi is in town but he or she will have to catch him next
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   At the concert hall Saturday evening, hundreds of more fortunate
toddlers squirmed in their seats waiting for The Man to appear.
When Raffi finally came out, unaccompanied and wearing lime-green
sneakers, lugging only a guitar and kazoo onstage with him, the
crowd really went nuts.
</P>
<P>
   For 90 minutes, kids who should have been home in their pajamas
were dancing in the aisles instead, to familiar tunes like ``Shake
Your Sillies Out'' and ``Down By the Bay.'' Moms and dads, nannies
and grandparents, aunts and uncles all clapped hands and sang along
_ every line committed to memory from countless trips in the family
car _ to ``Tingalayo'' and ``The Corner Grocery Store.''
</P>
<P>
   The old theater rocked like Springsteen at the FleetCenter, with
an Enfamil chaser. Not bad for a 52-year-old Canadian-based
performer who barely tours anymore and who has released only four
albums in the 1990s, none since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   That's the brand-name Raffi, the commodity Raffi. But there are
other aspects to the performer, other line items on his agenda, as
demonstrated by his three-day visit to the Boston area this week.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday afternoon, he toured the Dorchester day-care facility
and showed a more private side of his astonishing ability to
connect with young people. Dropping to all fours and greeting even
the smallest children by name, he drew warm hugs and wondrous
stares wherever he went. It was Ted Williams at a sports
memorabilia show, Tom Cruise on a location shoot, the pope and the
president, all rolled into one. It was magic. More important, magic
for some kids who have not seen much magic in their lives before.
</P>
<P>
   After a couple of choruses of ``The Wheels on the Bus,'' Raffi
bowed and made his exit. Moments later, one toddler picked up a
cassette tape of Raffi's songs. ``Is that still you in there,
Raffi?'' the child asked, his face pressed to the picture on the
tape box.
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually when I meet a child, I can make some assumptions about
his or her life,'' Raffi said as he stepped onto an elevator with
Sue Heilman, executive director of Horizons Initiative. ``But here
I can't make any assumptions, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And any you made would probably be wrong,'' said Heilman.
</P>
<P>
   Which is a good place to start when describing the singer's
current preoccupations, too.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The serious side
</P>
<P>
   Monday night was a different sort of Raffi performance. He gave
a talk titled ``A Child-Honoring Society as the New Paradigm'' for
the Askwith Forum at Harvard University's Ed School. In the talk,
one of several he has delivered so far this year on college
campuses and at environmental conferences worldwide, Raffi proposed
what he called a ``new global ethic,'' one that focuses on
ecological and economic concerns that affect the long-term welfare
of young children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not talking about a society where children rule, not at
all,'' Raffi said, taking long pauses and reading from detailed
notes. ``I'm talking about a renewed and reverent look at young
children. Our most important work is building a restorative and
sustainable future for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Included in the talk were brief snatches of autobiography. Born
in Egypt to Armenian parents _ his father, Arto Cavoukian, was a
renowned portrait photographer _ Raffi recounted his family's move
to Toronto when he was 10 and the folk-singing career he pursued in
the early '70s after dropping out of the University of Toronto.
Characterizing his life story as one of ``adaptation and change,''
he spoke of his interest in yoga, meditation, and philosophy. He
called himself ``a city boy who grew up to become a man of
nature.''
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1970s, Raffi continued, he had all but abandoned folk
singing to concentrate on his burgeoning career as a children's
entertainer, steered in that direction by his wife, a
schoolteacher. In 1980, he wrote and recorded ``Baby Beluga,'' a
song about a little beluga whale that ``swim(s) so wild and swim(s)
so free.'' That song plus others of its ilk not only earned him
fame and fortune but also helped identify Raffi with causes like
anti-pollution efforts and wildlife protection. In 1989, the singer
learned that beluga whales were so threatened by pollution that
their dead bodies were being classified as hazardous waste sites.
That one piece of news, he said, changed his priorities for the
next decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can imagine how that made me feel,'' Raffi said with a
catch in his voice. He went on to excoriate political and business
leaders for ignoring environmental issues _ and by extension,
child-welfare issues _ while the New Economy keeps booming right
along. Having spurned all commercial endorsements throughout his
singing career, he also questioned the wisdom of introducing very
young children to computers, or allowing them too much exposure to
TV. Even to his own videos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, I'd rather be singing than reading this (speech)
today,'' said Raffi. ``But I feel the need to speak out about this
stuff. Unlike computers, children cannot be hurried up and made
better.''
</P>
<P>
   The speech drew enthusiastic applause, and many attendees lined
up afterward to have a book or album autographed by Raffi. Yet, it
was evident from the many empty seats that the more serious side of
Raffi was in some ways a tough sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may have scared some people off by putting in the brochure
that the event was not suitable for young children,'' admitted
Dottie Engler, the forum organizer. ``It could be like, `Come hear
Elmo talk about nuclear disarmament.' It's disjointing to hear the
serious side of a happy person.''
</P>
<P>
   The latter comment may also explain the lukewarm reception given
the singer's autobiography, which came out nearly a year ago.
``Raffi: The Life of a Children's Troubadour'' was published by
Homeland Press, a division of Troubadour Records, the company Raffi
founded more than 20 years ago. He spent two years writing the book
_ the hardest thing he's ever done, he now says _ and waited for
publications like The New York Times to take notice. By and large,
they have not. Raffi is perplexed by this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything I do for children is instantly accepted,'' he said
in transit Monday from Dorchester to Cambridge. ``Whenever I do
something that's more for adults, it takes three times as long to
reach an audience. I'm not sure why that is.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The desert child
</P>
<P>
   Undertaking the book was triggered, he writes, by the deaths of
both his parents _ 12 hours apart, and of unrelated causes _ in
1995. The narrative is not as upbeat as older Raffi fans might
expect. His father is described as an old-world disciplinarian who
often resorted to the palm and the cane to keep his three children
in line. Raffi's marriage to his high school sweetheart, Deborah
Pike, ended in divorce more than a decade ago. Despite their love
of children, the couple never produced a child of their own _ one
more somber note in a story that details the singer's therapy
sessions, struggles with self-esteem, career frustrations, and
dust-ups with the media for portraying him as an environmental
``madman.''
</P>
<P>
   In his final chapter, Raffi writes of coming to terms, and
largely making peace, with his troubled past.
</P>
<P>
   ``The desert child flew across the ocean to another continent,''
he writes, ``and, after a time, came to live in a temperate
climate. At age fifty he finally understands that he is the son of
holocaust survivors _ two children who prevailed against great odds
to make their mark in the world. And still, he grapples with the
basics. Who am I. Whose am I? Where is home?''
</P>
<P>
   Staring out the car window at the Charles River flowing by,
Raffi acknowledged that not all of those questions have been
answered yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what I describe in the book is a fair portrait of the
person I used to be,'' he said, reflectively. ``But I also think
that all of us grow and change. Could I have written the book when
my parents were alive? Maybe not. Or maybe it would have taken me a
much longer time.''

A BIZARRE MIX IN MIND-BENDING `MALKOVICH' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Being John Malkovich'' is more than just the latest cool,
smart, funny movie. It jumps off the screen with the kind of
freshness, originality, and light-handed stranglehold on the
Zeitgeist that moves movies forward. It bridges for a moment the
nervously behind-the-times media establishment and the
envelope-pushing energies of the new media-savvy Internet and video
mavens. It's a match made in virtual heaven, a millennial ``Alice's
Adventures in Wonderland'' as John Cusack's downmarket puppeteer
named Craig, temping in an office, moves a file cabinet away from a
wall so he can retrieve a dropped sheet of paper and finds a portal
into John Malkovich's brain.
</P>
<P>
   What follows is one of film's trippiest pieces of surrealism.
The puppeteer turned office drone tumbles through a tunnel at just
a little less than warp speed and finds himself inside John
Malkovich's head, looking at the world through John Malkovich's
eyes. But only for 15 minutes. Then he's spit out on a grassy
shoulder of the New Jersey Turnpike. Experience over. But this
brush with 15 minutes of borrowed celebrity is about to change his
life, especially when he finds he can repeat it at will by
reentering the portal. What clinches the arc of change is Craig
sharing his discovery with two women _ his wife, and an astringent
looker who works in an office down the hall and has caught Craig's
eye.
</P>
<P>
   It should also be explained that the floor of their office
building is 7 1/2. Squeezed in between the seventh and eighth
floors, it's only about 5 feet high, which means everybody walks
around stooped (low overhead, says Orson Bean as Craig's distracted
boss, joking and not joking). This adds to the comic weirdness and
the disorientation that are the film's motor. Catherine Keener's
Maxine is all angles and all sleekness. She lets Craig know right
off that she's not interested in him as a man, but that she'd like
to go into business with him, selling trips into John Malkovich's
head. In no time, there's a line of people who, unsure they'll ever
get their own 15 minutes of fame, are eager to pay to get inside
Malkovich's.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Cameron Diaz, amusingly frumped down as Craig's wife,
Lotte, fills their loft with neurotic animals and is content to
mother everything in sight. But it isn't long before she also gets
into the mix. Eventually, Malkovich figures out what's going on,
too. This, of course, isn't a documentary take on Malkovich. It's
Malkovich playing a fictionalized version of himself (nobody said
this wasn't going to get a little convoluted). Apart from being a
good sport and an actor shrewd enough to sense that he was hooking
up with a cool project, Malkovich provides exactly the kind of
affectless flatness onto which a lot of other stuff _ and more than
a few personalities _ can be projected.
</P>
<P>
   You'll want to see how it all gets sorted out, and how, before
it does, the film cleverly plays with the fallout from our
celebrity-oriented society and, even more venturesomely than the
excellent ``Boys Don't Cry,'' with the ideas of identity, sexual
identity, and gender scrambling. The latter figures in some sexual
complications when a woman has sex with Malkovich while he's being
inhabited by another woman, and both of them later find out they
like it. Malkovich, acting all the characters who inhabit him,
turns in a virtuosic juggling act. But then ``Being John
Malkovich'' is a brilliant juggling act, too, brilliantly brought
off.
</P>
<P>
   Spike Jonze, perhaps best known as the fourth king of ``Three
Kings'' and as a director of concept-bending music videos, was a
bit of a gamble as director here, in view of his inexperience in
feature filmmaking. But Jonze, born Adam Spiegel to the Chicago
family of Spiegel catalog fame, turns out to have been an inspired
choice. Taking comedian Charlie Kaufman's knowing script, he plays
the coolness card dazzlingly, nudging the surreal into the bizarre
(check out the puppeteer's dark ``Petrushka'' update) and keeping
the laughs both primal and ironic. He also makes sure that the
film's Silly Putty metaphysics never get in the way of the laughs
as ``Being John Malkovich'' cheerfully presents the universe as
God's own pinball machine.

STREEP HITS RIGHT NOTES IN `MUSIC OF THE HEART' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don't be put off by the sappy title of ``Music of the Heart.''
The movie starring Meryl Streep as a tenacious woman who doggedly
refuses to be stopped from teaching schoolchildren in East Harlem
how to play the violin avoids the potentially suffocating pall of
uplift hovering over its quite exhilarating story _ and then some.
</P>
<P>
   ``Music of the Heart'' doesn't make any speeches about the
struggles that go with a run-down bilingual part of Manhattan
shortchanged by the establishment. It just plunges in and sweeps us
along in its reworking of the 1996 documentary ``Small Wonders,''
which showed how much Roberta Guaspari has been able to accomplish
with unsinkable determination and 50 violins she bought cheap while
living in Greece.
</P>
<P>
   The film feels a bit schematic as Streep's Guaspari is floored
when her husband tells her he wants a divorce and then when she
gets up off the floor, moves out of her mother's house with her two
young sons, buys a brownstone in East Harlem with her divorce
settlement, and digs in. A bit too conveniently, an old boyfriend,
now a teacher, played by Aidan Quinn, reenters the picture and
connects her to Angela Bassett's public school principal, who lets
her begin teaching the violin, with no promises. Streep, whose
excellence is unfairly taken for granted, quickly and convincingly
inscribes Roberta's emotional roller-coastering in the wake of her
divorce. And she doesn't miss a beat once she sets foot inside the
school.
</P>
<P>
   The film's secret is that it never lets Roberta's personal or
vocational lives slow down enough for things to get sticky. ``Music
of the Heart'' is carried by the way Streep becomes part of the
often gritty reality of Roberta's world. This includes not only
walking the walk and talking the talk of East Harlem, but
interacting with kids who in real life had already paid their dues
to get into the violin-playing fraternity Streep so convincingly
joins. While in truth she played nowhere nearly as well as the kids
she's supposedly teaching in a tough, no-nonsense style, the
remarkable thing is that Streep, whose thorough preparation for
roles is legendary, mastered the violin enough in six weeks to play
it at all.
</P>
<P>
   Streep being Streep, she took no short cuts. It would have been
easier, for instance if she had settled for the first position when
holding her instrument. But no. Streep worked her way up to the
more difficult third position, the one a pro would use. Yet it
would be easy to overstress Streep's technical accomplishment,
which usually is overstressed to the detriment of her emotional
contribution to a role. I hope it's not overlooked here. Mostly,
she gets the job done simply by making us feel the force of wanting
that we're convinced she's feeling. We can feel her willing a kid
to bear down, put a little resin on the bow, and get through that
passage! And there are dozens of little grace notes, like her way
of making us feel, with one involuntary-seeming hop, the lift
Roberta feels when a kid who had dropped out returns.
</P>
<P>
   Angela Bassett and Josh Pais handily fill the good
bureaucrat-bad bureaucrat roles, and Gloria Estefan (whose own
mother was a teacher) is a plus as a younger teacher who's on
Roberta's side. Perhaps the biggest surprise of all is the fact
that this film was directed by horror meister Wes Craven, who
couldn't have chosen a better way to break out of the typecasting
box.
</P>
<P>
   In short, a lot of people do a lot of things right, including
Isaac Stern and Itzhak Perlman, who pitch in and contribute cameos.
Even before the kids' achievement is capped with a glowingly
triumphant concert at Carnegie Hall, ``Music of the Heart'' is
transported to the realm of the inspirational. It ushers us into
the lives of neglected good people working hard to make dreams come
true, reinforcing their self-worth, sending all the right messages.
I've always had a soft spot for teacher movies, and this one is
high on my list.

BUSH'S ABSENCE A BOOST FOR MCCAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HANOVER, N.H. _ As the five Republican presidential candidates
appeared at a nationally televised forum here Thursday night, they
didn't just advocate contrasting views. They offered an outline of
the way the missing man, Texas Governor George W. Bush, could run
into serious political trouble in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Like marksmen aiming at a limited number of targets, each of the
five GOP candidates appealed directly to a sizable slice of the
electorate in the first-primary state, from the antitax
conservatives, to the antiabortion movement, to Independents who
can choose to vote in the GOP primary. If even some of those
appeals are successful, the Bush vote may be squeezed from several
sides, and his front-runner standing could fade.
</P>
<P>
   Senator John McCain of Arizona, who has risen steadily to second
place in the polls, may have gained the most from the opportunity
the town-meeting format offered to make just that sort of focused
appeal. The first question of the night was whether those favoring
abortion rights should be welcomed into the Republican Party, and
it played into McCain's hands as he appealed to voters in this
state where a majority of people back such rights.
</P>
<P>
   McCain responded in a way clearly designed to resonate with
moderate Republicans as well as Independents who favor abortion
rights. While assuring conservatives that he is opposed to
abortion, McCain said, ``I worry a great deal about the unintended
consequences about sending a message that we are not an
inclusionary party.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain also benefited because none of the other White House
prospects aimed their criticism at him, leaving him unscarred as
the second-place candidate. Instead, the only direct clash of the
night came between former Reagan aide Gary Bauer and publisher
Steve Forbes. Bauer said that his plan for a 16 percent flat tax
would help working people better than Forbes' 17 percent plan,
prompting Forbes to respond: ``Gary, you are wrong.'' Both Bauer
and Forbes are seeking votes from a similar slice of the
electorate, antiabortion conservatives who favor a flat tax.
</P>
<P>
   But all of the candidates benefited from being on the same stage
without Bush and before a nationally televised audience, with more
than 300 members of the news media on hand to report the event.
Particularly for the candidates who now barely register in the
polls, such as Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, it was the best chance
yet to publicize their views.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, whose game plan in the session was to go after Bush, got
a break when a questioner regretted that she was being forced to
address Forbes instead of Bush on the question of campaign
financing. Forbes said he shared the frustration that Bush didn't
appear, adding acidly that the Texas governor might have come if
the forum had been cast as a chance to raise more campaign
cash.``Perhaps in the future if we call this a fund-raiser, he
might show up,'' Forbes jibed.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who chose to attend a Dallas award ceremony for his wife,
Laura, clearly had the most to lose. Bush's absence played into the
hands of those who say the governor is a fragile front-runner, who
looks strong now but could easily start to tumble.
</P>
<P>
   The 60-minute forum at Dartmouth College also underscored that
there are several races going on within the Republican field. There
is the race to be an alternative to Bush, the race to be the
leading social conservative candidate, and the race to be the
leading moderate alternative.
</P>
<P>
   And, perhaps most important, there is the race for the
Independent vote, which could determine the winner of both the GOP
and Democratic primaries. Some analysts say McCain and Democrat
Bill Bradley are likely to compete most heavily for the Independent
vote. In the GOP race, that means that McCain could add thousands
of votes to his total, while Bush is expected to draw his support
mostly from Republican voters.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes has been low in the in New Hampshire polls all year
despite campaigning here nonstop since his failed 1996 effort. He
delivered a pitch that theoretically should resonate with New
Hampshirites, highlighting his 17 percent flat-tax plan. Just hours
before the forum, the state Legislature rejected a proposal for an
income tax to pay for education programs, hewing to New Hampshire's
tradition as an antitax bastion.
</P>
<P>
   But Forbes's biggest impact in the race is likely to come in a
few weeks, when he is expected to launch a series of advertisements
accusing Bush of raising taxes in Texas. Forbes hopes that such
attacks help his own campaign, but the effort may mostly serve to
soften up Bush. That is similar to what happened in 1996, when
Forbes unleashed a broadcast broadside against Bob Dole, which hurt
the Kansas senator and helped Patrick Buchanan win the primary.

CEILING FANS: WHICH WAY TO BLOW THE AIR? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, October 31, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Which direction should a ceiling fan go in the summer? A
Globe story said one way, the makers of my fan said another. Who's
right?
</P>
<P>
   DOROTHY ALLEN, Sudbury, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, it certainly wasn't the handyman's story, because the
handyman feels that it doesn't make that much difference; the air
is going to be circulated no matter what direction the air is
pushed in. But, fans are reversible, electronically or by moving
the paddles, therefore there must be some merit in it.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus is this: Blow the air down in summer, up in
winter. In summer, the down-blowing air will help bring warm air
near the ceiling downward, mixing with cool air. This works whether
you have air conditioning or not. And, in summer, the down-blowing
air will help cool your sweltering body, if you take your clothes
off. In winter, the up-blowing air helps draw cool air up to the
ceiling and warm air down, mixing it as it moves.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure we will get an argument, but in the end, it does not
matter; the fan will circulate and mix the air no matter what
direction it pushes the air in.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Someone _ I don't know who _ spilled grape juice on a beige
rug. How can I remove it?
</P>
<P>
   MARIA, Malden, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Why is it that it is always a beige rug? I suppose because
things spilled on a beige rug really show up, unlike spills on a
Persian.
</P>
<P>
   Speed of treatment is most important in successful cleaning; get
to the spill in a hurry. Early or late, cool water will do well.
Apply water to dilute the stain, then wipe with paper towels or a
cloth, rubbing from outside in, so you won't spread it. Make a mix
of one teaspoon of laundry detergent, one teaspoon of white
vinegar, and a quart of cool water. This is safe for almost
anything. Use this solution and repeat until the stain is gone.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Some of the sills in my house, the ones that sit on the
foundation, have rotted out. Joists sit on top of this sill, but I
can't get to them because they are covered by the basement ceiling.
Can I replece the sill in pieces?
</P>
<P>
   FRANK HARRINGTON, Lexington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, but because the sills involve structure, you should
contact an architect or engineer to find out how to do it, for a
fee.
</P>
<P>
   This is how it is done: While a sill can be pieced or laminted,
it is best to replace large pieces, and that requires that the
joists be shored up so they will not collapse when the rotted wood
is removed and the new put in. The way to shore up the joists is to
set a beam against the ceiling and support it with temporary jack
posts. This technique is not intended to raise the joists, just to
keep them in place when the sill is removed. The best way to work
on this sill is from the outside; the siding and sheathing must be
removed to get to the sill, but it is easier than working from the
inside.
</P>
<P>
   If you discover some of the joists rotted, you can sister them;
that is, insert a short joist (called a sister) beside the bad one,
and nail it to the sound part of the bad joist. To do this, the
ceiling finish must be removed.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody said it would be easy, but it is definitely possible.
When everything is fixed and working beautifully, find the leak or
the cause of the sill getting wet and fix it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have to replace some soffit and fascia boards on a round
part of my old Victorian. How can these boards be curved, to match
the round part, and who can do it?
</P>
<P>
   HENRY ROSYNKRANZ, West Roxbury, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Any carpenter can do it, if you can find one. Or, possibly, a
renovation contractor or architect who specializes in old houses.
</P>
<P>
   The soffits (the under part of the roof overhang) are easy;
simply cut boards to fit a short curve; you may have to do a fair
amount of piecing, and use a lot of boards, but that is the nature
of the work. Besides, you cannot bend a board along its flat plane.
Fairly long, wide, shallow-curved boards can be cut from large
sheets (4 by 8 feet) of exterior plywood.
</P>
<P>
   The fascia (the boards just under the roof line), are the boards
that must be curved. You can do it with steam; heat and dampen the
boards, bend them to the right radius, and keep them in position
until they dry, then install, with lots of fasteners. Use
half-inch-thick boards for this purpose; they bends more easily.
Or, take an ordinary 3/4-inch-thick board and cut a vertical kerf
on its back, about half the depth of the board. Make the kerfs
about an inch apart, along the full length, so the whole board will
bend without breaking. Needless to say, the lengths of these boards
are limited.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, you could say the heck with the curve and nail a
straight fascia board connecting two rafter ends, and repeat until
you have gone the full length of the fascia. This will provide
straight increments on a shallow curve, and might work for you.
And, since it is probably two or more stories high, who will notice
it from the ground?
</P>

   Meat Loaf _ that round mound of sound, that Wagnerian voice of
theatrical pop-rock, that proud king of bombast and melodrama _ is
back, walking among us and stalking stages, sweat pouring off his
body, once again. Movie screens, too, albeit in different, subtler
guises. He plays a redneck sheriff in ``Crazy in Alabama'' and a
pudgy pugilist in ``Fight Club.'' He's got a live disc, ``VH1
Storytellers,'' in the shops. His autobiography, ``To Hell and
Back,'' co-written with David Dalton, is new on the racks, too.
</P>
<P>
   It's a book that ends with him complaining that the two ``Bat
Out of Hell'' albums he made with producer Jim Steinman, which have
sold more than 48 million copies worldwide, have turned him into a
cartoon character. But then a friend points out: ``You are a
cartoon character. Look at your videos. Look at what you do on
stage. That's what people love about you, you're larger than
life.''
</P>
<P>
   So, Meat Loaf, reasoned, ``instead of rejecting the cartoon, I
would embrace him. . . . I came to the realization that, like
Popeye, `I yam what I yam, and that's all that I yam.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Meat Loaf _ born Marvin Lee Aday, which he changed to Michael
Lee Aday and later to the moniker that forces The New York Times to
refer to him as Mr. Loaf _ is hot again, even if he is far from
MTV's prime demographic, at age 52. And no self-respecting modern
rock radio station will be interested in playing his songs. Doesn't
matter.
</P>
<P>
   Meat Loaf is a very busy man _ ``I've got six press agents out
there, the people at Fox, Columbia, Sony-TriStar, whatever the
movies are on, then you have the record company people, the people
doing the tour, the book people, then my own person who coordinates
things, it's a little crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   He lives with his wife, Leslie, in Los Angeles _ he moved there
from New York so he could be home while doing movies _ but he says
he's essentially been on the road since 1993. His primary
avocation, pitcher on a fast-pitch softball team, had to be set
aside. ``If I was in one place long enough and I could sit down and
find a team, I would play,'' he says, somewhat wistfully.
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't seem likely anytime soon. VH1 provided Meat Loaf with a
``Storytellers'' slot, and he's taking this concept _ songs and
chat, a long give-and-take session with the audience _ on the road
for 25 shows. Meat Loaf and his backing septet start the tour
Saturday in Albany and stop in Boston on Tuesday and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Potential repertoire: 116 songs. ``We can play 36 of them at the
drop of a hat,'' says Meat Loaf, ``and after that it is going to be
interesting. We have a cheat book with 80 songs with chord changes
in one and lyrics in the other. We will have to figure out the
right keys.''
</P>
<P>
   The one and only rule: He will not play the epic megahit
``Paradise By the Dashboard Light'' right away.
</P>
<P>
   If there's anyone who can keep his head straight during the
tumultuous hurly-burly of the pop whirlwind, it is Meat Loaf. He
says he got lost for about three years, dazed and dazzled when
``Bat Out of Hell'' became a multiplatinum success 20 years ago.
He's been up, down, called out, and called up so many times since
then it could make your head spin. But he's always worked hard.
Club, theater, arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not about being in magazines,'' he says, of working
through the down years, without much attention. ``It was about
proving I was right. I have always been about the work.'' Whether
it be on the concert stage or the movie set, Meat Loaf says, ``I
will push to the end to make sure that I have done my best before
we leave. If the director says, `Well, that's good,' I'll say: `Can
we set up just one more time?' ''
</P>
<P>
   You could be forgiven for thinking Meat Loaf was a singer who
dabbles in acting, but the two careers are important to him. He
admits he made some early poor role choices, _ ``Anybody that
called me up, I wanted to work'' _ but something changed when he
rejected a part in ``Mr. Magoo'' and landed the ``Crazy in
Alabama'' role. `` `Alabama,' '' he says, ``was a turning point.
Now, I am getting calls from everyone from (Martin) Scorsese on
down.''
</P>
<P>
   He is adamant about his film characters not exhibiting his
``rock persona.'' ``In `Fight Club' and `Crazy in Alabama,' Meat
Loaf does not exist anywhere in that realm. I just disappear
completely. In both films, there is just one slight movement, a
little hand movement for 10 seconds, and that was the only thing
that I do in real life. When I saw it, I cringed.''
</P>
<P>
   He suggests that passion and artifice are not warring elements,
that a rock 'n' roll concert is closer to theater than many rock
fans want to admit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been accused of a lot of our shows being over the top
and melodramatic,'' says Meat Loaf, ``and I just say: `Wait a
second. Most people, if they go on stage _ I don't care who they
are, even the alternative stuff where you are not (supposed to be)
interested _ you are still bigger on that stage than when you are
in the shower. And don't try to convince me otherwise, because you
are just lying to yourself.' I've seen Patti Smith on stage and I
have been around her offstage and there are two different people
there. It has to be bigger than life, it has to be over the top
because my whole life is over the top.''
</P>
<P>
   He spells out his goals for each concert: ``To give it a spark,
a new life, to make it different from night to night, because you
are working for the audience, that is who you care about. I have an
advantage because I have done theater, improv, taken classes, had
coaches. I've worked with some of the greatest actors in the world
and that makes my shows better.''
</P>
<P>
   On the ``Storytellers'' tour, nothing is scripted (save the
opening line) or set in stone, he says. Four dolly boom microphones
will be located throughout the theater, so fans will be able to
converse with him. ``Out of the conversations,'' he says, ``the
song comes.'' And what if idiots or hecklers commandeer the mikes?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got `National Lampoon' training,'' he says, referring to
the stage show with which he performed before he did ``The Rocky
Horror Picture Show.'' ``If I get a heckler, well, we're not on
equal footing. I've been doing this for 32 years. I don't have a
fear of not being able to control the situation. That's a piece of
cake.''

BEHIND THE SCENES OF FIFTIES BODYBUILDING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Occasionally, a movie opens a window to a world you just did not
know existed. Call me a cultural groundhog, but such was the case
with yours truly vis-a-vis the world of ``Beefcake,'' Thom
Fitzgerald's drama with a documentary feel about the realm of male
physique magazines and films of the 1950s, as viewed mostly through
the lens of Bob Mizer, a sweet-seeming Los Angeles photographer who
loved nothing more than capturing naked or nearly naked young buff
men, posing at play. Mizer, played by Daniel MacIvor, runs The
Athletic Model Guild, an agency for bodybuilders; publishes
``Physique Pictorial,'' a magazine featuring his clients; and has a
secret business that gets him in trouble with the law.
</P>
<P>
   In a time before over-the-counter hardcore pornography, and way
before the era of gay rights _ and way before the term ``gay''
meant homosexual _ these physique magazines, ostensibly about
bodybuilding, served a dual purpose in tantalizing scores of young
gay men who never had a visual outlet for their fantasies. There is
a touching scene where a young boy in a small town discovers a
physique magazine and simultaneously realizes he is not alone in
the universe. Others share his perhaps as yet undefined feelings
about his gender.
</P>
<P>
   There's a light, campy feeling about the photos and the sets. A
song where the refrain runs ``bum-bum-bum-bum'' is accompanied by
cut-to-the-beat images of, well, you know. Many of the film's
images have a faux innocence about them _ all these well-toned men
playing cowboys and Indians or posing as sailors (hello, Village
People!).
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald offers up a barrage, and a collage, of nude images,
both real and fictionalized. Mizer, who died in 1991, left behind
more than 1 million negatives, and Fitzgerald, a Canadian filmmaker
who won awards for his first feature ``The Hanging Garden,'' seems
to have used almost all of them.
</P>
<P>
   The film mixes actors and some of the original players from the
bodybuilding scene. One of the film's protagonists is Neil O'Hara
(Josh Peace), who leaves a rural town for the big city and is swept
up in Mizer's scene. Giving the drama both gravity and perspective
are the real people from the scene such as Jack LaLanne. LaLanne is
not gay, and when that aspect comes up he laughs and asks his
interviewer why: ``You want a date?'' He says a lot of the models
were straight and that he himself had ``no inkling about any
homoerotic'' content. Photographers Russ Warner and Dave Martin
discuss the models as ``art objects'' and ``sculptures.'' Andy
Warhol star Joe D'Allesandro, a child model for Mizer, offers
perspective: Maybe he was exploited, but he looked good then and
here's proof.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a darkness on the edge of this town. There is a
weird, unsettling tone about this movie and this semi-secret world.
It creeps up on you and contrasts sharply with the giddy froth and
playful sexuality we've been spoonfed early on. Mizer's milquetoast
demeanor while photographing _ he's interested in his subjects, but
never, it seems, sexually turned on _ runs up against what he
appears to have indulged in when the camera is off. Mizer is
arrested for operating a prostitution ring using his models; a
young man talks in the courtroom about Mizer sodomizing him (this
scene is recreated from a trial transcript). This movie flits
pretty seamlessly between documentary, which is in black-and-white,
and drama, which is in color. It leaves you with an odd,
sweet-and-sour taste _ nostalgia painted in pastel colors, streaked
with black smears.

TRACKING OLD CITY'S HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KENNEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; MAPPING BOSTON
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Edited by Alex Krieger and David Cobb with Amy Turner
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; MIT Press, 277 pp., illustrated, $50

<P>
   A visitor to Boston puzzling over a guidebook map of the city,
or trying to figure out where the ``here'' is on a ``you are here''
kiosk, seems as much a part of the streetscape as the cobblestones
and bricks. It is, after all, pretty hard even for locals to orient
themselves in a city where the North End is southwest of East
Boston, South Boston is due east of the South End, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   But it is that enduring mystery about what might be around the
next curve of street that has made the mapping of Boston such an
intriguing task for 350-plus years and has now produced what is
certain to stand as one of the most valuable sources for
understanding Boston's history.
</P>
<P>
   As Alex Krieger, chairman of Harvard's department of urban
planning and design, notes in his introduction to ``Mapping
Boston,'' the city's ``complex social history is matched by its
radical transformation over the years, a transformation best
recorded in a series of maps.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mapping Boston'' draws mainly on the extraordinary map
collection of real estate developer Norman B. Leventhal. With it,
Krieger and his fellow editors and essayists have laid out the city
as it has appeared in the rough charts of the earliest explorers,
in the beautifully detailed maps of 18th-century cartographers, in
the utilitarian maps of 19th-century draftsmen, and in the
computer-generated documents of present-day planners.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most significant thing about Boston over the entire
span of its history, and not just when considered in the context of
maps, is its physical transformation through successive fillings of
the surrounding water. Even though this process is generally
understood, it has never been as dramatically presented as it is in
the series of eight computer-generated maps produced by
archeologist Nancy S. Seasholes and architect Amy Turner. They
digitalized the shorelines appearing on selected historical maps at
roughly 35-year intervals _ starting with a 19th-century
reconstruction of the original 1630 shoreline _ and then overlaid
each one on a digitalized version of a 1995 aerial photograph.
</P>
<P>
   An essay by Seasholes explains why the successive fillings took
place and the various methods employed _ the early ``wharfing-out''
followed by the leveling of hills for fill. While Seasholes
acknowledges that it remains unclear ``where Bostonians acquired
the concept of large-scale land-making,'' she traces the process as
it was employed for varied reasons: commercial developments, new
residential areas, transportation routes and facilities, even for
parks.
</P>
<P>
   A striking example of the interplay of social history and
physical transformation noted in Krieger's essay is the leveling of
Fort Hill in the late 1860s, one of the least-known but most
significant events in Boston history.
</P>
<P>
   Now the edge of the financial district, Fort Hill was a
fashionable residential neighborhood in the early 1800s. But as its
merchant homeowners moved on to the newly fashionable South End,
its mansions were cut up into boardinghouses for Irish immigrants,
``ramshackle housing was built on every available inch of space and
habitations were tunneled into the hill.''
</P>
<P>
   Following a cholera epidemic that swept through the neighborhood
in 1849, there were proposals to cut down the hill. ``The
ostensible motive was to permit an expansion of the business
district . . . but the hidden agenda was to initiate Boston's first
slum-clearance project.'' And this became economically feasible
when the city decided to construct Atlantic Avenue across the
nearby docks and wharves, with the readily available fill from Fort
Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because of the primary reliance on the Leventhal
collection, ``Mapping Boston'' misses what would have been several
valuable additions. Successive maps of Creek Square, where
late-17th-century street patterns remain today, would have helped
to show the continuity that is so vital a part of the Boston
landscape. The ``tall spine'' that channeled downtown development
between the Back Bay and the South End would be better illustrated
by a three-dimensional axonometric map than by a photographic view
from far-off Blue Hill.
</P>
<P>
   And the evocative concluding essay of novelist James Carroll,
with its comment that Boston ``lives in the American imagination,''
calls out for illustration by the maps created by architect Kevin
Lynch in the late 1950s, which reflected the image of Boston as it
appeared to city residents.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the shortcoming or the omissions, the sheer visual
impact of the maps and the generally illuminating text make
``Mapping Boston'' a treasure for anyone fascinated by this most
discoverable of cities.

BEAN GIVES THE BOOT TO ITS HUNTING HERITAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   From the Times-They-Are-A-Changing Desk, word from Maine
concerns the fabled outdoor boot made famous because the company
that sold it would repair or replace the boot whenever it wore out.
</P>
<P>
   This led to quite a number of stories about people who had worn
their boots to hell and back, up and down craggy terrain, through
mud and ice. And, sure enough, when the owner returned the worn-out
boot, the company did indeed repair or replace it.
</P>
<P>
   That company, of course, is L.L. Bean, and the boot in question
was once called the ``L.L. Bean Hunting Shoe.'' Now, as Tom
Hennessey, outdoor writer at the Bangor Daily News, pointed out, it
is simply called the ``Bean Boot.''
</P>
<P>
   Checking my latest catalog I found this to be true. And the name
wasn't the only part of the boot to change. The catalog describes
the ``Bean Boot'' this way: ``Revolutionary in 1912, still
revolutionary in 1999 . . . A lot has changed about our L.L. Bean
Boots, but one thing has stayed the same _ they're still made by us
in Maine, one pair at a time.'' The catalog claims the boots are
``lighter, more durable, more waterproof, and more stable. They
have better traction and a better fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps everything is just as the folks at Bean say. The old
boots were good, though, and few customers will disagree that L.L.
Bean has long sold good stuff.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not the problem. Why are these not called ``L.L. Bean
Hunting Shoes'' anymore? Why the change?
</P>
<P>
   It may be that the ``modernization'' of L.L. Bean began when the
company stopped using employees as catalog models and replaced them
with those big glossy shoots of New York models, giving the catalog
a distinctly Martha Stewart feel.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally L.L. Bean has to modernize its product line as well as
its image. But what about its heritage?
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been getting a lot of calls about the Bean Boot,'' said
Dave Teufel, a company spokesman in Freeport as well as a bow
hunter. ``We've gone back and forth, but it's been the `Bean Boot'
ever since I came here seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the '60s it was changed for a while. Then it went back to
Hunting Shoe again. At one time L.L. himself changed it to Bean
Boot.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Teufel, people recognize the ``Bean Boot'' tag, and
the company wants the boots to appeal to a wider audience than just
hunters. But even the term ``hunter'' doesn't have the same meaning
as it used to.
</P>
<P>
   As we noted two weeks ago, the number of deer hunters in Maine
has dropped 17 percent in the last decade. In Massachusetts, a
hunting force of around 60,000 has not decreased as dramatically,
but the number ``has been flat for several years,'' said John
McDonald, state deer specialist for MassWildlife. ``There hasn't
been any increase in several years. We're not growing any new
hunters these days.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the deer population has grown so large in
coastal Massachusetts that problems are rising. From car/deer
accidents to flower and shrub despoliation, whitetail deer soon
overstay their welcome as objects of natural wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   ``The suburbs create pockets where hunters can't get at them,''
said Teufel, ``and when a deer gets into the strawberry patch of a
small farmer, that can really affect his annual income. I think
we're right on the cusp of real problems in some areas with the
deer population. After deer eat a lot of stuff in our back yard and
on the farms, we go out and buy more. And they do get into pumpkins
and apples, squash, lettuce, beans . . . When the population rises
to 20-30 deer per square mile, the tolerance level wears thin. And
I'm hearing about more and more problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Where a burgeoning whitetail population continues to grow, and
the hunting force declines, land owners are coming closer and
closer to a showdown with a creature that many, ironically, have
sought to protect with anti-hunting ordinances.
</P>
<P>
   Said McDonald, ``It's just hard to attract new young people to
hunting. There are so many activities that compete with it these
days, and kids don't have the adults around to show them how to get
into it.''

 &HT;    MORE THAN DOLLARS SEPARATE CLINTON, CONGRESS IN BUDGET END GAME
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Oct. 31.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After months of heated rhetoric and partisan
maneuvering, President Clinton and congressional leaders are poised
to wage the final skirmishes this week in their fight over the 2000
budget.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of money, the Democrats and Republicans are not far
apart. They are squabbling over a difference of about $10 billion
in a budget whose tax and spending proposals total $1.8 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   But the two sides have staked out sharply different positions on
several important issues, including education and foreign policy.
While funding disputes are often settled by splitting the
difference, compromises on policy are harder to reach.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has signaled his willingness to bend on some of these
issues _ ``I never thought I'd get 100 percent of what I wanted,''
he said last week _ but aides insist he will not give them up
completely.
</P>
<P>
   The political stakes are making the negotiations even harder.
Each party hopes to make points they hope will carry them to
victory in next year's presidential and congressional elections.
</P>
<P>
   The Social Security surplus has emerged as the battleground that
underlies all the combat.
</P>
<P>
   Both Republicans and Democrats have agreed to depart from 30
years of budget practice and reserve surplus Social Security taxes
_ projected to hit $147 billion next year _ to reduce the $5.7
trillion federal debt.
</P>
<P>
   Each side has already accused the other of trying to renege.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to requests from Democrats, the Congressional Budget
Office reported last week that under its own spending assumptions,
the Republican budget would gouge $17 billion out of next year's
Social Security surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans quickly got the CBO to state that under the more
flexible accounting rules used by GOP appropriators, the surplus
would not be tapped. In contrast, they said, it is Democrats who
want to spend the surplus for unneeded programs.
</P>
<P>
   To make their own budget add up, House Republicans last week
approved a 1 percent across-the-board cut in discretionary
spending, excepting some defense programs. Discretionary spending
is the one-third of the federal budget not mandated as payouts to
veterans, retirees and Medicare and Medicaid recipients.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are asking federal agencies to do is what single moms
and single dads, working moms and dads all over the country do on a
weekly basis,'' House Republican Conference Committee Chairman J.C.
Watts of Oklahoma told PBS on Friday. ``For someone to say that we
can't find one penny, one penny of every dollar that comes into the
government in savings, seems to be a bit of a stretch to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House countered that the plan would cut into the
marrow of needed programs. Discretionary spending, points out White
House spokesman Barry Toiv, has already fallen over the past eight
years from 8.7 percent of the country's total economic output to
6.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a point,'' said Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, ``at
which you can die of a thousand cuts.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why Clinton is expected to veto the GOP plan for
across-the-board cuts. The plan is likely to be passed by the
Senate early this week and sent to Clinton's desk after he returns
Tuesday night from a trip to Norway.
</P>
<P>
   That trip will spotlight his fight for increased funding of a
host of his foreign affairs priorities. He and his congressional
foes are roughly $3 billion apart on his request for money to help
pay back dues the United States owes to the United Nations, Third
World debt relief and aid Clinton has promised to Palestinians and
Israelis as part of their efforts to secure peace in the Mideast.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who agreed to Republican increases in the $268 billion
defense spending bill, wants his foreign aid requests funded in
return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that, you know, I've worked with them. I signed that
defense bill ... and I think they ought to work with me so that we
can have a balanced national security policy,'' Clinton said in an
interview. ``I feel very strongly about it, and I'm going to fight
hard for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Clinton has dug in his heels on money to hire new
teachers to reduce the size of elementary school classes. Congress
wants to lump the education money into block grants that states can
spend as they choose.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their differences, Clinton on Friday signed a third
temporary spending bill that will government operating without a
formal budget until Nov. 5.
</P>
<P>
   He said he remains optimistic that he and his Republican foes
can wrap up this contentious season of budget wrangling.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, as much as I fight with these Republicans, it's
amazing, if we just sit down and talk and spend a few hours
together, normally we can work it out,'' Clinton said in an Oval
Office interview Wednesday. ``You actually have to work hard not to
make an agreement with me _ if we can do it in good faith.''

BEAN GIVES THE BOOT TO ITS HUNTING HERITAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   From the Times-They-Are-A-Changing Desk, word from Maine
concerns the fabled outdoor boot made famous because the company
that sold it would repair or replace the boot whenever it wore out.
</P>
<P>
   This led to quite a number of stories about people who had worn
their boots to hell and back, up and down craggy terrain, through
mud and ice. And, sure enough, when the owner returned the worn-out
boot, the company did indeed repair or replace it.
</P>
<P>
   That company, of course, is L.L. Bean, and the boot in question
was once called the ``L.L. Bean Hunting Shoe.'' Now, as Tom
Hennessey, outdoor writer at the Bangor Daily News, pointed out, it
is simply called the ``Bean Boot.''
</P>
<P>
   Checking my latest catalog I found this to be true. And the name
wasn't the only part of the boot to change. The catalog describes
the ``Bean Boot'' this way: ``Revolutionary in 1912, still
revolutionary in 1999 . . . A lot has changed about our L.L. Bean
Boots, but one thing has stayed the same _ they're still made by us
in Maine, one pair at a time.'' The catalog claims the boots are
``lighter, more durable, more waterproof, and more stable. They
have better traction and a better fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps everything is just as the folks at Bean say. The old
boots were good, though, and few customers will disagree that L.L.
Bean has long sold good stuff.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not the problem. Why are these not called ``L.L. Bean
Hunting Shoes'' anymore? Why the change?
</P>
<P>
   It may be that the ``modernization'' of L.L. Bean began when the
company stopped using employees as catalog models and replaced them
with those big glossy shoots of New York models, giving the catalog
a distinctly Martha Stewart feel.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally L.L. Bean has to modernize its product line as well as
its image. But what about its heritage?
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been getting a lot of calls about the Bean Boot,'' said
Dave Teufel, a company spokesman in Freeport as well as a bow
hunter. ``We've gone back and forth, but it's been the `Bean Boot'
ever since I came here seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the '60s it was changed for a while. Then it went back to
Hunting Shoe again. At one time L.L. himself changed it to Bean
Boot.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Teufel, people recognize the ``Bean Boot'' tag, and
the company wants the boots to appeal to a wider audience than just
hunters. But even the term ``hunter'' doesn't have the same meaning
as it used to.
</P>
<P>
   As we noted two weeks ago, the number of deer hunters in Maine
has dropped 17 percent in the last decade. In Massachusetts, a
hunting force of around 60,000 has not decreased as dramatically,
but the number ``has been flat for several years,'' said John
McDonald, state deer specialist for MassWildlife. ``There hasn't
been any increase in several years. We're not growing any new
hunters these days.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the deer population has grown so large in
coastal Massachusetts that problems are rising. From car/deer
accidents to flower and shrub despoliation, whitetail deer soon
overstay their welcome as objects of natural wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   ``The suburbs create pockets where hunters can't get at them,''
said Teufel, ``and when a deer gets into the strawberry patch of a
small farmer, that can really affect his annual income. I think
we're right on the cusp of real problems in some areas with the
deer population. After deer eat a lot of stuff in our back yard and
on the farms, we go out and buy more. And they do get into pumpkins
and apples, squash, lettuce, beans . . . When the population rises
to 20-30 deer per square mile, the tolerance level wears thin. And
I'm hearing about more and more problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Where a burgeoning whitetail population continues to grow, and
the hunting force declines, land owners are coming closer and
closer to a showdown with a creature that many, ironically, have
sought to protect with anti-hunting ordinances.
</P>
<P>
   Said McDonald, ``It's just hard to attract new young people to
hunting. There are so many activities that compete with it these
days, and kids don't have the adults around to show them how to get
into it.''

BEYOND POKEMON: THERE'S MORE ANIME OUT THERE
</HEADLINE>
  (David Bloom's weekly Digital L.A. column)  
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(Eds: note ITALICS throughout; also note tilde character in Web
address) 
 &HT;    By DAVID BLOOM 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   Saucer eyes, pointy chins and wasp waists, ravening plants and
exploding heads, Shinto animism and sci-fi weirdness. This is the
world of anime, as the wacky, way-out world of Japanese animation
is called.
</P>
<P>
   Anime's distinctive look and approach have been creeping into
the American pop vernacular for years now, particularly in the
video-gaming and role-playing game worlds, many comic books and the
occasional American-made homage such as ``Powerpuff Girls'' or
``Aeon Flux,'' along with Japanese imports to Saturday morning such
as ``Speed Racer'' and ``Gigantor.''
</P>
<P>
   But now, with this weekend's release of Hayao Miyazaki's
``Princess Mononoke'' and the debut in two weeks of the Pokemon
movie, we'll be seeing a full-frontal assault of Japanese animation
on American movie screens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mononoke'' is a gorgeous movie, visually inventive in utterly
unique ways, like so much of Miyazaki. It's a meditation set in
feudal Japan on the collision of nature and industrial man, with
characters of uncertain, often conflicting motivations.
</P>
<P>
   It was Japan's best-selling film of all time before ``Titanic''
sailed in, and Miramax hopes it will do well here, though its
occasional explicit violence and complex themes make it
inappropriate for children. It's also a bit of a box-office risk.
</P>
<P>
   Pokemon is, well, Pokemon, a brilliantly constructed video game
that kids can't resist, even when it transmutes into a movie, TV
show or trading cards. Your kids will want to go, too. Submit.
</P>
<P>
   But should a peek at ``Mononoke'' (or, less likely if you're
over the age of 12, the Pokemon movie) inspire you to explore more
of the world of Japanese animation, you're in luck, because you can
rent or buy many of the best anime films by mail order or even, to
a much lesser extent, in video stores (except for (BEGIN
ITAL)hentai(END ITAL), the fast-growing, but (BEGIN ITAL)really(END
ITAL) out-there porn sector of anime).
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, there are several companies selling anime tapes
and DVDs through the Internet and mail-order.
</P>
<P>
   Start with Manga Entertainment (www.manga.com), A.D.Vision Inc.
(www.advfilms.com), Central Park Media (www.centralparkmedia.com)
and Pioneer (www.pioneer.com) as distributors, though there are
plenty of options out there.
</P>
<P>
   Viz Communications (www.viz.com) in San Francisco offers a nice
range of anime and related products, including the most prominent
U.S. magazine on the genre, Animerica (www.animerica-mag.com).
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of anime titles are now available in the U.S., but you
should definitely check out the other Miyazaki titles on the market
(Disney, which has called Miyazaki the ``Walt Disney of Japan,''
acquired U.S. distribution rights last year to nine of his films
and has been slowly releasing them on video).
</P>
<P>
   The two I've seen (both are great for children, by the way) are
``Kiki's Delivery Service'' and ``My Neighbor Totoro.'' They
feature wonderfully inventive fantasy creatures and a clean,
realistic visual style somewhat similar to that of French graphic
artist Jean ``Moebius'' Giraud.
</P>
<P>
   As with many of his films, Miyazaki personally hand-drew tens of
thousands of the frames in each of these works, which focus on
children in magical situations. Manga Entertainment has said it
will remaster and retranslate Miyazaki's first feature, ``Castle of
Cagliostro'' for DVD and VHS tape early next year.
</P>
<P>
   And for a greater appreciation of Miyazaki's work, Stone Bridge
Press in Berkeley just published ``Hayao Miyazaki: Master of
Japanese Animation,'' by Helen McCarthy, a veteran author of books
about anime.
</P>
<P>
   But don't just focus on Miyazaki, for all his brilliance, if you
want to explore the huge world of anime.
</P>
<P>
   Something like 20 percent of all Japanese films are animated,
and most deal with grown-up subject matter. There are at least half
a dozen subgenres, ranging from innocent stories from either girls'
or boys' perspectives to fairly kinky adult material rife with
rapacious vegetables and the Japanese fondness for bondage.
</P>
<P>
   One influential subgenre is (BEGIN ITAL)mecha,(END ITAL) with
its sci-fi robots and other mechanical gadgetry. Mecha has had a
great deal of success infiltrating the American pop mind, given the
influence of imports such as the various iterations of ``Macross''
and ``Gundam,'' ``Ghost in the Shell'' (also a fun PlayStation
game), ``Neon Genesis Evangelion'' and the landmark ``Wings of
Honneamise: The Royal Space Force.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sailor Moon,'' the best-known series in the (BEGIN
ITAL)shojo(END ITAL) subgenre, follows the adventures of a group of
girls who struggle through puberty in sailor outfits while fighting
evil.
</P>
<P>
   If ``Pokemon'' floats your boat, try the '80s TV series ``Astro
Boy'' or ``Tenchi Muyo!'' _ fine examples of the boys' version of
(BEGIN ITAL)shojo(END ITAL), known as (BEGIN ITAL)shonen.(END ITAL)
</P>
<P>
   I've enjoyed the stylish ``Cowboy Bebop,'' space-pirate saga
``Queen Emeraldas,'' and the underwater sci-fi of ``Blue Submarine
No. 6,'' ``Bubblegum Crisis'' and ``Record of Lodoss War'' among
many others. Those are the American titles, but the vagaries of the
anime business mean sometimes movies get new names whether they
need them or not.
</P>
<P>
   Stone Bridge Press has put out a couple of other books that may
be of interest to budding anime fans. If you're trying to figure
out all those obscure cultural references in anime, check out
Gilles Poitras' ``The Anime Companion: What's Japanese in Japanese
Animation.''
</P>
<P>
   Poitras also maintains an extensive update site on the Internet
at www.siriuscom/(TILDE)cowpunk/. He suggests tapping into the
Animation Web Turnpike (at www.anipike.com/) for a good site that
has links to many anime sources, publications and Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   And if you want to better understand anime's printed cousin,
manga, start with Frederik Schodt's ``Dreamland Japan,'' which
explores what the comic-booklike manga mean in that country's
culture. Schodt, like McCarthy, has written a number of books on
anime and manga worth digging out.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
POKEMON FEVER &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As the Pokemon movie nears release, I'm taking relatively small
comfort in having proclaimed way back in September of last year
that the whole pocket monster phenomenon would be big.
</P>
<P>
   Some $5 billion in revenues later, I can say I told you so, and
warn you that it will only get worse. Nintendo now plans to sell a
special version of its Game Boy Color, with a yellow outer shell
decorated with the Pikachu character, and bundled with the game's
new Yellow edition.
</P>
<P>
   The Pokemon Yellow edition, truth be told, isn't much different
from the original red and blue versions, but try to tell that to my
_ or anyone else's _ children.
</P>
<P>
   The main change, and one kids seem to love, is that Pikachu _
the round, yellow pokemon that has become the game's mascot _
follows the player around throughout the game, and interacts with
the player.
</P>
<P>
   It does change the game's dynamics somewhat, in part because the
Pikachu are pretty tough customers in a trainer-fight (that's
Pokemon talk; believe me, the little kids understand). You may not
understand the necessity of buying this, but I guarantee your
children will have a different notion. Remember, you heard it here
first. &QL;

 UNDATED: weapon (Maslin).  
<TEXT>
<P>
   `THE LIMEY,' starring Terence Stamp and Peter Fonda. Directed by
Steven Soderbergh (R, 89 minutes). From a director for whom the
quirky stylistic exercise is standard style, this is a handsome
throwback to the salad days of its two iconic stars. Stamp, in a
stony, magnetic performance punctuated by flashbacks to his early
career, plays an ex-con seeking revenge for the death of his
daughter. He becomes the nemesis of Fonda's slick Hollywood
hipster, in another role that's piquantly tailor-made. Soderbergh
resurrects the lean, hard-boiled look of John Boorman's ``Point
Blank'' as he dissects and considers these two tough customers from
every conceivable perspective (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `LUCIE AUBRAC,' starring Carole Bouquet and Daniel Auteuil.
Directed by Claude Berri (R, 116 minutes). What lifts this taut
World War II thriller based on a true story above the ordinary are
the impassioned performances of Ms. Bouquet and Auteuil as Lucie
and Raymond, a married couple who are fighters in the French
Resistance. When Raymond is arrested by the Nazis and convicted of
war crimes, Lucie conceives an audacious plan for his escape. Ms.
Bouquet and Auteuil are as romantically intense as Bogey and
Bergman in ``Casablanca,'' but here the woman is the one who ends
up doing the thinking for both of them (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `RANDOM HEARTS,' starring Harrison Ford and Kristin Scott
Thomas. Directed by Sydney Pollack (R, 131 minutes). Pollack's
characteristically solid, incisive direction has become a throwback
to the days of subtler movie storytelling. But it still rivets
attention during the first half of this star-crossed romance, which
tells of two people who meet after their spouses die in the same
plane crash. The plot becomes very thick indeed when it develops
that the dead spouses were having an affair, and the survivors fall
into a bittersweet relationship of their own. Ford is taciturnly
forceful, Ms. Scott Thomas a shade too familiar, as
credulity-stretching complications ensue (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `ROMANCE,' starring Caroline Ducey, Sagamore Stevenin, Francois
Berleand and Rocco Siffredi. Written and directed by Catherine
Breillat (not rated, 93 minutes). A solemn, sexually graphic
exploration of the nature of a woman's need for male attention and
erotic love, even if its insights are already familiar to readers
of Cosmopolitan and the Marquis de Sade. And it's doubtful that the
film's intellectual aspects would command the same attention if its
camera did not make the actors' genitals as familiar as their
faces. The carnal and cerebral erotica here have already achieved
the considerable feat of shocking France, but the film is often
stilted and methodical to the point of tediousness. It hovers
between passion and philosophical argument without often achieving
Ms. Breillat's ambition to fuse the two (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE SIXTH SENSE,' starring Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment.
Written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan (PG-13, 107 minutes).
What starts out as a horror movie about a troubled 8-year-old boy
(Osment) who claims to see dead people, and the child psychologist
(Willis) determined to cure him, eventually turns into New Age mush
(think ``What Dreams May Come'' and ``Simon Birch''). When you
trace the plot backward after its big secret is revealed, the story
doesn't begin to add up. Willis gives his usual smirking one-note
performance. What empathy the movie generates comes from Osment's
intense portrayal of the tormented child (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `THE STORY OF US,' starring Bruce Willis and Michelle Pfeiffer.
Directed by Rob Reiner (R, 90 minutes). The first unofficial Jack
Lemmon comedy for the baby boom generation. As an ode to the ups
and downs of middle-aged marriage, this arthritic suburban story is
enough to make single people want to file for divorce. Willis makes
iffy casting in the role of a sensitive father and husband, while
Ms. Pfeiffer is not well served by a role that makes her scream so
hard that her neck turns red. Together, with the help of noisy
friends and acquaintances, these two run through the long history
of a marriage with the help of a criminal set of wigs and
hairpieces. Small talk turns to matters like home repair jobs and
prostate trouble (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE STRAIGHT STORY,' starring Richard Farnsworth and Sissy
Spacek. Directed by David Lynch (G, 110 minutes). As the least
likely filmmaker on the planet to pull off a G-rated miracle, Lynch
rises to the challenge with exhilarating vigor. It may not sound
like much, but this account of an old man making a long trip on a
riding lawnmower turns out to be a slow moving, folksy looking,
deeply spiritual film with the power to hold audiences in thrall.
And as Oscar may well note next spring, it would not have been
possible without Farnsworth's terse, no-nonsense honesty at its
heart. Lynch's famously unwholesome imagination crosses a new
frontier to explore simple virtues and natural beauty. The result:
a supremely improbable triumph (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THREE KINGS,' starring George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg and Ice
Cube. Written and directed by David O. Russell (R, 105 minutes).
The prodigiously talented writer-director of ``Spanking the
Monkey'' and ``Flirting With Disaster'' has made a much more
ambitious film, with mixed results. His gimlet-eyed Persian Gulf
War film has a ``Catch-22'' absurdist edge, but it also has an
oversupply of visual affectations. Vertiginous music-video camera
tricks jazz up the otherwise straightforward story of American
soldiers who have larcenous designs on Saddam Hussein's captured
gold and then develop conscience pangs about their own roles in
Iraq. There are many clever peripheral touches, but there's
something tamely conventional at the film's core (Maslin).

<P>
   Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of
new or noteworthy movies currently playing in theaters. Running
times and ratings of films are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   `AMERICAN BEAUTY,' starring Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Chris
Cooper, Wes Bentley and Thora Birch. Written by Alan Ball. Directed
by Sam Mendes (R, 116 minutes). With heavenly finesse, Spacey plays
a buttoned-down 42-year-old suburbanite who flips his lid for a
teen-age cheerleader. And he never gets it back on. The midlife
crisis motif is familiar, but stage director Sam Mendes brings
terrific visual flair and dry humor to this barbecuing of the
bourgeoisie. All the actors display coolly expert timing,
especially Ms. Bening as the antihero's grasping wife. Although the
story spreads itself thin among many characters, the film coalesces
for a devastating finale (Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE BEST MAN,' starring Taye Diggs, Morris Chestnut, Nia Long
and Harold Perrineau. Directed by Malcolm D. Lee (R, 118 minutes).
This feel-good ensemble film turns Diggs into a bespectacled but
hunky novelist en route to a friend's wedding. There he finds
temptation in the form of an old flame and a lot of genial guy talk
about the meaning of marriage. No problem here is too complicated
to be settled by a good-humored dance scene. Another demonstration
that current movies about upscale black characters have much more
solid traditional values than ones about catty white teen-agers
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `BOYS DON'T CRY,' starring Hillary Swank and Chloe Sevigny.
Directed by Kimberley Pierce (R, 114 minutes). This stunning debut
feature tells the strange and resonant story of Brandon Teena, who
despite being born Teena Brandon went on to create a charismatic
identity as a young man. Brandon's ultimately wrenching tale may
sound tabloid-ready, but on screen it turns into Theodore Dreiser's
idea of American tragedy. The film makes it hauntingly real and
even tenderly romantic, with the astonishing acting needed to make
it work. One of the year's best (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `BRINGING OUT THE DEAD,' starring Nicolas Cage and Patricia
Arquette. Written by Paul Schrader from a novel by Joe Connelly.
Directed by Martin Scorsese (R, 115 minutes). An intense, volatile
film full of sorrow and wild, mordant humor. This time it took prop
garbage on the streets of Hell's Kitchen to create a sufficiently
hellish ambiance for another nighttime tour of Manhattan. But
Scorsese has mellowed significantly since his ``Taxi Driver'' days,
and his uneven but impassioned, visually inventive new film is more
contemplative than it looks. Cage gives a fine, soulful performance
as a New York ambulance driver haunted by ghosts. Ving Rhames is a
major scene-stealer as one of his partners (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `CRAZY IN ALABAMA,' starring Melanie Griffith and Lucas Black.
Directed by Antonio Banderas (PG-13, 104 minutes). Ms. Griffith, in
a black fright wig, plays a madcap murderess named Lucille who
heads from Alabama to California after disposing of her husband.
The film is set in 1965 and means to link Lucille's quest for
freedom with the civil rights movement. That's quite a stretch. The
star vamps gaudily, but at least bragging rights to the phrase
``the directorial debut of Antonio Banderas'' are within reason.
His direction is adequate and unobtrusive (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `DOUBLE JEOPARDY,' starring Ashley Judd, Tommy Lee Jones and
Bruce Greenwood. Directed by Bruce Beresford (R, 106 minutes). In a
touristy thriller that roams from the coastline of Washington state
to the French Quarter of New Orleans, Ms. Judd plays a woman who is
free to kill her husband because she has already gone to prison for
the crime (see title). Not even she is beautiful enough to get away
with rote acting and a far-fetched plot, but she perks up as her
character becomes less of a victim. In this coed homage to ``The
Fugitive,'' Jones is on hand as another weathered sourpuss with a
knack for barking orders. Beresford directs so unremarkably that it
takes a line like ``I feel like I've grown in the last six years''
to signal the passage of time (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `EARTH,' starring Aamir Khan, Nandita Das, Rahul Khanna and Maia
Sethna. Directed by Deepa Mehta (not rated, 99 minutes). It is 1947
and India is about to explode into ethnic violence as British
colonial rule ends and the country is partitioned into two nations,
mostly Hindu India and mostly Muslim Pakistan. These momentous
changes are observed by Lenny (Ms. Sethna), the 8-year-old daughter
of a well-to-do Parsi family in Lahore. As Hindus, Muslims and
Sikhs slaughter one another in the streets, old friends become
deadly enemies. Caught in the middle is Shanta (Ms. Das), Lenny's
beautiful Hindu nanny, who has two Muslim suitors. The movie's
child's-eye view somewhat mutes its dramatic sweep (Stephen
Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `FIGHT CLUB,' starring Brad Pitt, Edward Norton and Helena
Bonham Carter. Directed by David Fincher (R, 135 minutes). The
sardonic, testosterone-fueled science fiction of this grunge
parable means to hit raw nerves. Making a tougher but less
stomach-turning film than his earlier ``Seven,'' Fincher taps into
the nexus of computer-age malevolent fantasy and attempts to
psychoanalyze an entire culture in ways that aren't entirely clear
until the film's whammy of a denouement arrives. A reckless but
fascinating attempt, expertly acted, to make sense of contemporary
frustrations (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `JULIEN DONKEY-BOY,' starring Ewen Bremner, Chloe Sevigny and
Werner Herzog. Directed by Harmony Korine (R, 94 minutes). Working
in accordance with the Danish set of directorial strictures known
as Dogma '95, the enfant terrible director of ``Gummo'' finds
creative ways to bend the rules. Inventively and kinetically shot,
this film about a schizophrenic is vastly more interesting on its
visual merits than for its hazy, indulgent drama. As the ranting
father of the title character, Herzog goes enthusiastically over
the top. The luminous Ms. Sevigny remains Korine's secret weapon
(Maslin).

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The business of travel.
</P>
<P>
   For years now, we've been hearing that video conferencing soon
will replace a lot of business travel. Why spend dollars and time
flying somewhere to do business when you can sit in the video
conference room and meet face-to-face via television?
</P>
<P>
   So far, it hasn't happened. The airlines just keep adding
flights and hotels rooms to take care of the business traveler.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes a new survey of corporate travel managers in Business
Travel Executive. And sure enough, they say that video conferencing
is growing at their companies. However, they add, so far it has had
minimal impact on travel budgets.
</P>
<P>
   The survey found 55 percent of companies have increased use of
video conferencing, 28 percent said no change and the rest say they
don't use it at all. However, even the nonusers say this year they
plan to join the majority.
</P>
<P>
   How much can video conferencing save? One corporate travel
manager believes his company would reduce spending on air fares by
20 percent and on hotel bills by 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The companies that have video conferencing equipment available
report it's not used as much as it could be. That's probably
because of a lack of internal marketing, encouraging employees to
use it, and training on how it works.
</P>
<P>
   Video conferencing will never replace someone going out to make
a sale. However, it can easily substitute for face-to-face meetings
between employees of far-flung companies. As the Internet continues
to develop with more and more broadband connections allowing full
motion video, expect a corresponding increase in video conferences.
Instead of going to the company video conference room, we'll be
able to sit at our desks and hold a meeting with someone across the
continent or ocean.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
PRIVATE INITIATIVE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This country's travel industry has given up on the government
and decided to go after foreign tourists itself.
</P>
<P>
   Most countries spend tax dollars to lure foreign tourists to
their shores. The United States used to, until 1995 when Congress
abolished the tourism promotion budget.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign tourists are good business for this country. Last year,
47 million tourists from overseas _ excluding Canada and Mexico _
visited us. They spent $74.2 billion, and that's not counting the
cost of getting here. At the same time, U.S. tourists spent $51.2
billion overseas _ helping our balance-of-payments problem.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Travel Industry Association says it will spend $2.6
million to $3.8 million next year on an international campaign to
promote travel to the United States. The money will come from
members of the association _ an umbrella group from all sectors of
that industry.
</P>
<P>
   The association says it plans to hire 10 to 17 staff members,
depending upon the amount of donations _ and open overseas offices
in Tokyo and London, with Germany next, and some sort of presence
in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   The group will continue to lobby Congress for travel promotion
funds.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SO LONG, AMADEUS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston-based Continental Airlines has gotten out of the
computerized reservation system business. The airline has sold its
stake in the Amadeus reservation system for $408 million.
</P>
<P>
   The airline said it did so in order to concentrate on its core
business.
</P>
<P>
   That's a wise move for any company. And, there's also evidence
that the reservation system business isn't what it once was.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, the systems were in the forefront of the computer
age. They allow airline reservationists, travel agents and now you
or me to check airline seat availability and prices and book
tickets.
</P>
<P>
   The question is, how long will these systems dominate the
booking of tickets? Already, we're seeing individual airlines give
big customers access to their in-house private reservation systems
via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Direct Internet booking, bypassing the central reservation
systems, costs the airlines pennies instead of the dollars they
must pay a reservation system. It's in their interest to encourage
more of it.
</P>
<P>
   Many stock pickers lately have been selling, not buying,
equities in the computerized reservations companies.
</P>
<P>
   Sabre is the biggest player in that market. The company,
partially owned by AMR, which also owns American Airlines, is No. 1
in the global distribution of airline tickets. Yet, in a hot
Internet market, its stock is currently at 41, down from a recent
high of 72.
</P>
<P>
   The other publicly traded system, Galileo, is currently listed
at 24 euros, down from a 56 peak within the last 12 months.

COMPAQ AND DELL JOINING MP3 PARTY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At first, the MP3 craze was a grass-roots thing, something
techno-savvy music lovers discovered on their own and promoted by
word of mouth across the Internet. It made you part of the geek
chic if you knew how to create and share these digital music files.
</P>
<P>
   However, the MP3 file format is rapidly becoming mainstream. You
can see it by the high-flying initial public stock offerings of Web
sites such as MP3.com, by the proliferation of hand-held digital
music players and by the growing popularity of writable CD-ROM
drives.
</P>
<P>
   Now, personal computer makers have come to the party.
</P>
<P>
   You're starting to see PCs that are configured off-the-shelf to
make it easier to download, store and convert MP3 files. Here are
two models in this category, either of which would please MP3
aficionados:
</P>
<P>
   _ Dimension XPS T600, $2,620, Dell Computer Corp.: Round Rock,
Texas-based Dell was one of the first PC makers to hop on the MP3
train. Almost as soon as Diamond Multimedia began selling its new
Rio PMP 500 MP3 player _ which can hold more music and connects via
the friendlier Universal Serial Bus port _ Dell started offering it
as an option on the company's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Forget about the music aspect for a minute. Just the basics on
this puppy are enough to give a computer junkie the shakes. It
comes with a 600-megahertz Pentium III chip, 128 megabytes of
memory, a 13.8-gigabyte hard drive, a Diamond Multimedia Viper V770
graphics card with 32 MB of video memory, a 48X CD-ROM drive, a 56K
fax modem and a 17-inch monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that a Creative Labs SoundBlaster Live! audio card that
can support two pair of speakers and a five-speaker (four
satellites and a subwoofer) Altec-Lansing package, and you've got a
killer music machine.
</P>
<P>
   (You should note, by the way, that this system uses the older
600-MHz Pentium III chip, not the newer, so-called ``Coppermine''
version released by Intel earlier this week.)
</P>
<P>
   The satellite speakers are designed to be placed in
surround-sound fashion, so that two are in front of and two behind
the listener. The subwoofer sits under the desk.
</P>
<P>
   Listening to music this way is a real joy, and it certainly
makes gaming a more realistic experience. The SoundBlaster Live!
card uses a 3-D sound scheme called Environmental Audio, and if a
game supports it, the results can be astonishing. Hearing an
opponent in a game sneak up on you from behind, or listening to the
sound of race car engines as you zoom past competitors can be
exhilarating.
</P>
<P>
   The Rio PMP 500 player has 64 MB of memory and can hold up to 2
hours of music, depending on how tightly the files are compressed.
It plugs into the USB port for much faster transfer of files than
older MP3 players that rely on the sluggish parallel port.
</P>
<P>
   The Dimension comes with software that makes it easier to get
music into the Rio. The RioPort Manager can find music on your hard
drive, extract it from a music CD or connect you with the
RioPort.com Web site so you can download it from the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The Dell also comes with a version of MusicMatch's Jukebox 4,
which can extract music from CDs and convert it into MP3 files, as
well as organize your music collection.
</P>
<P>
   My only reservation is that this system is a bit pricey. For
this price, it should include a rewritable CD-ROM drive, too.
</P>
<P>
   _ Presario 5900Z-700, $2,357, Compaq Computer Corp.: Compaq
takes a slightly different approach to making a music machine,
choosing a rewritable CD-ROM drive rather than an MP3 player.
</P>
<P>
   This also is one of the few brand-name PCs you can buy with one
of Advanced Micro Devices' Athlon processors in it. Until Intel
released its 733-MHz Pentium III chip this week, the 700-MHz Athlon
found in this Presario was the fastest PC processor on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the Athlon chip, this system comes with 128 MB of
memory, a 20-GB hard drive, a 10X DVD-ROM drive, a 4X2X24
rewritable CD-ROM drive, a phone-line home networking card, a 16-MB
3dfx Voodoo3 video card, a 56K fax modem, a so-called ``value''
version of the SoundBlaster Live! audio card and a 17-inch monitor.
</P>
<P>
   For speakers, this system used JBL Pro Premiums, with two
satellites and a subwoofer. The value version of the SoundBlaster
Live! does not support an additional set of speakers, and Compaq
does not offer a better card than this one. Nevertheless, the sound
was more than acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   The second CD drive writes data at four times the speed of the
original CD-ROM, rewrites at two times and can read at 24 times.
This is a bit slow for CD ``burners'' _ most of the add-on kits
available these days are 4X4X24.
</P>
<P>
   It also comes with simple software from CeQuadrat for managing
CD creation. There's JustBurn for creating data and music CDs and
PacketCD for dragging and dropping files onto the rewritable drive
as though it were a standard hard drive. I prefer Adaptec's
products _ EasyCD Creator and DirectCD _ because they're more
versatile, and I wish Compaq had included them here.
</P>
<P>
   I was very impressed by the speed of this Athlon chip,
particularly when it came to playing games. While the Voodoo3 card
included here is something of a bottleneck (I prefer cards that use
Nvidia's TNT2 Ultra chips, such as the Viper V770) this machine
still soared when playing graphically intensive titles such as
Quake III Arena or Unreal Tournament. You can get a higher-end
graphics card for this model when ordering from one of Compaq's
retail kiosks or off the Web, and I'd urge you to do so if you're
into games.
</P>
<P>
   If I were to buy a top-of-the-line PC today for my own use, I'd
likely get an Athlon-based system _ I'm that impressed with them.

THROW THAT TILDE OUT THE WINDOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I love the way Windows 95 lets you have long
file names like on a Macintosh, but when I look at the files in
some of my programs, the names are shortened and have some weird
curlicue character in them.
</P>
<P>
   _ Squiggly Thing
</P>
<P>
   DEAR SQUIG: You've discovered Windows' dirty little secret: Deep
down beneath all those dancing icons and flashy sound effects,
Windows is still based on DOS, even though it hides that fact
better than your family hides the cousin they never talk about.
</P>
<P>
   And ever since the robber barons at Microsoft bamboozled some
poor schlub out of the rights to DOS back in the '80s, we've been
stuck with eight-character file names and three-letter extensions.
If you open a DOS window in Win95 or 98 and do a directory listing,
guess what you still see? Older programs, even some written for
Windows, can't read the info where the long file name is stored,
but they don't have any problem with the old DOS name.
</P>
<P>
   OK, adding long file-name capability was a nice touch, but who
in the world came up with that goofy short file-name scheme?
Windows takes the first six characters of the long name, adds a
tilde, then a number, then the extension. My Nutty Manifesto.txt
turns into MYNUTT(tilde)1.TXT. I don't know about you, but it takes
me 20 minutes just to find the tilde on my keyboard. Wouldn't it
have made more sense to just take the first eight valid characters
instead?
</P>
<P>
   I guess questions like that are why I'm not in senior management
at Microsoft with a mansion on Lake Washington, a trophy wife and
enough money to buy my own newspaper so I can write nice things
about myself. I guess I just don't see the ``Big Picture.'' If
you're having trouble seeing the picture, too, I know how you can
get rid of the tilde.
</P>
<P>
   A word of warning: We're about to mess with the Registry, the
thing that holds most of Windows' settings. If you drop a monkey
wrench in the works here, you might as well turn your PC into a
planter.
</P>
<P>
   Click your Start button and pick Run from the menu. In the Run
dialog, type in Regedit and press Enter to start the Registry
editor. Bail out now if you're getting scared, because it gets
worse.
</P>
<P>
   In the left pane of the editor, click on the following folders
to open them: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, then System, then
CurrentControlSet, then Control. Now right-click on the FileSystem
folder and select New from the menu that appears. Select Binary
Value from the next menu that pops out and a new, highlighted entry
appears in the right pane of the editor. Rename it to
NameNumericTail by typing over the highlight.
</P>
<P>
   Take a breather; there's more. Ready? OK, right-click the new
entry, select Modify and type a 0 (zero) in the box that appears,
click OK, then close down Regedit and restart Windows. No more
tildes. If only we could fix Bill Gates' haircut that easily.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: My wife wanted you to know that she likes your
column so much she named our cat after you _ Dr. Pookus (Pookie)
Bombay.
</P>
<P>
   _ Needs a Nice, Long Rest
</P>
<P>
   DEAR NEEDS: I hope your wife recovers soon. By the way, I have a
cousin named Pookie, though the family never talks about him. He
once sold the rights to DOS to some fast-talking guy in Seattle for
only $50,000.
</P>
<P>

probably considerably less. Get your bids in to

SOCIAL SECURITY TELLS CONGRESS Y2K WON'T AFFECT CHECKS. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Social Security Administration reassured
Congress on Friday that 44 million Social Security recipients will
receive their benefit checks on time in January _ even if there's a
computer or power failure on Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The agency described its elaborate planning to ensure that there
will be no disruption in benefit checks. ``We are confident the
monthly payments... will not be affected,'' John Dyer, Social
Security's principal deputy commissioner, told lawmakers on the
House Science technology subcommittee and the House government
management subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Dec. 29, the Social Security Administration will
mail out paper checks to the 11 million recipients who get their
benefit checks through the mail. They should receive the checks on
Jan. 3 or a few days later, Dyer said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Jan. 3, the Social Security Administration will
electronically deposit benefit checks to the 33 million Americans
who have their checks automatically transferred to their banks, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing focused on the contingency plans of key government
agencies in case computers were to fail on Jan. 1, 2000, because
the computer software incorrectly read the year as 1900.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to ensure that the federal government and the services
it provides will not fail, whether the date is Dec. 31, 1999, or
Jan. 1, 2000,'' said Rep. Tom Davis, R-Va., chairman of the House
government management subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   Dyer explained that the Social Security Administration's
computers will stop accepting new information at the close of
business on Thursday, Dec. 30, 1999. He said Friday, Dec. 31, will
be used to input any left-over 1999 computer data.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before midnight on New Year's Eve, Social Security's
main computers in Baltimore will be switched to a back-up generator
powered by jet fuel in case the city's power fails because of a
computer glitch.
</P>
<P>
   Once Social Security officials receive word that there was no
disruption to the regular power supply, the computers will be taken
off the generators and plugged back into the Baltimore power grid.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has enough jet fuel to run the main computers for
several weeks if necessary, he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Jan. 1, computer programmers will test the
computers and phones at Social Security headquarters as well at
hundreds of field offices across the country. Any required repairs
will be made Saturday and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Dyer said, however, he doesn't expect any major computer
failures and noted that the agency has been issuing checks for more
than a year using computers that have been fixed to overcome any
year-2000 problem.
</P>
<P>
   If a bank cannot receive electronic deposits _ which is also
unexpected _ Social Security will contact the Treasury Department
which will issue and mail paper checks within five days. If people
are unable to wait for that check, they can go to their local
Social Security office to have the check issued immediately,
according to Dyer.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Postal Service told the hearing that it expects no
problems delivering the Social Security checks or any other mail in
January.
</P>
<P>
   Norman E. Lorentz, senior vice president of the U.S. Postal
Service, said it plans to keep its larger holiday workforce on hand
through the end of January to handle any increased mail volume.
Lorentz explained that many people and businesses may opt to mail
items that would normally by sent electronically like checks and
correspondence.
</P>
<P>
   He said the agency recently ran a successful, six-week test at a
suburban Washington, D.C., mail processing center to ensure the
agency's computers would correctly interpret the Jan. 1, 2000 date
change.
</P>
<P>
   Lorentz noted that the Postal Service routinely delivers mail in
cases where there are widespread power failures after natural
disasters.

   LOS ANGELES _ WARNING: The following report makes use of
semi-graphic descriptions of provocative behavior, employing words

   Monday night, Ally McBeal (Calista Flockhart) and longtime
adversary Ling (Lucy Liu) will kiss. Not just a friendly peck, nor
even a prudent kiss of the sort Ally has planted on other gal
friends to dissuade the advances of creepy suitors, but a
full-tilt, soulful lip lock that'll no doubt inspire thousands of
locker-room conversations in the ensuing weeks. They'll enjoy it so
much that they'll do it again, but both ultimately decide the act
is unsatisfying because neither smoocher nor smoochee sports a male
organ. They use a term more straightforward than ``male organ.''
</P>
<P>
   And we're not even mentioning the spanking subplot.
</P>
<P>
   This follows, by a couple of weeks, an episode of ``Chicago
Hope'' in which Dr. McNeil (Mark Harmon) could only helplessly sum
up a disastrous incident with a monumentally unlucky patient with
the philosophical bromide, ``S--- happens,'' the first time said
scatological bon mot wittingly hit prime-time airwaves. Which
followed, by a couple of weeks, the season opener of ``The
Practice,'' which focused on a client with a sexual fetish for
women who crush insects and small animals with their feet.
</P>
<P>
   Which followedfew days, the premiere of ``Law &AMP; Order:
Special Victims Unit,'' a drama exclusively about the investigation
of largely gruesome sex crimes. Which followed the debut of
``Action,'' the Fox sitcom rife with blue humor, with only the
naughtiest of expletives bleeped out. Which followed a lot of other
things, but mainly the advent five years ago of Steven Bochco's
``NYPD Blue,'' in which characters appeared for the first time on
network television in various states of undress. An ABC affiliate
in Dallas kept the series off the air for a full year until it
became apparent that viewers seeing actors in the buff would not
cause the Republic to fall.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Dickens would say that the nation's major broadcast
networks are experiencing both the best of times and the worst of
times. They're able to charge increasingly higher advertising rates
despite their losses of audiences to cable and the Internet, yet
they're losing said audiences due in part to the inability to
present material of the sophisticated nature _ some would say the
relaxed standards _ of those other media. Which, the above examples
prove, is not to say that they're not trying. In an era that offers
scores of channels, it simply behooves broadcast execs to do
whatever it takes to call attention to their product.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the same thing when Fox (the network) came on,''
observes Henry Bromell, the ``Chicago Hope'' executive producer who
wrote the ``Happening'' episode. ``It was another network, and they
carved out an identity for themselves as being a riskier, edgier
network.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Gelbart, who executive-produced the classic TV series
``MASH'' in the '70s and more recently has written for cable
television, suggests the parallels go back even further. ``This is
what happened with the movies; it's just a replay of the '50s _ as
soon as TV came around and threatened the box office of films,
movies got bigger and raunchier,'' he says. ``Only now, TV is doing
it to itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who work for the networks aren't sure that viewers today
note any difference between cable stations and the networks. Robert
Palm, executive producer on ``Law &AMP; Order: Special Victims Unit,''
says, ``I personally think it's a totally specious differentiation.
These standards are illogical in a cable universe. Why do you hear
on Channel 21, (euphemisms for `intercourse, excrement, urine'),
while on Channel 4 it's `freaking' and `crapping'?''
</P>
<P>
   Bromell, who believes that viewers may in fact perceive a
difference, adds nonetheless that the separation of standards is
``self-imposed. It's all about standards and practices, not wanting
to offend people and lose advertising clients. They don't want to
be associated with anything controversial by definition. Networks
are in a state of confusion after years and years of a set policy.
They're in a quandary _ who knows what they're gonna do?''
</P>
<P>
   Bromell _ who frankly admits he didn't expect the word to get on
the air _ refers to the oft-cited distinction between networks and
cable: That networks are beamed into homes with TVs, while cable is
an elective choice. ``I'm not sure I buy that argument _ you don't
have to buy a TV at all, you don't have to have it on constantly.
It's not like you can't turn it off.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, what hurts network programs, he says, is, ``We're
not talking about drama, we're talking about public policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Representatives from ``The Practice'' and ``Ally McBeal''
declined to comment, but David E. Kelley, the Emmy-winning creator
of both series, recently observed in an online chat: ```Ally' has
to be different and move forward in order to stay viable, and in
daring to be different, you will necessarily see more dare in some
of the storylines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea isn't to be hot (but) to find stories that will
explore the characters. I've never really understood what that
means, to push the envelope.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Albrecht, president of HBO Original Programming, says,
``It's a mistaken premise to say that just putting sex or language
into a show makes the show the kind audiences want. There are many
bad sexy movies. That can turn off as many viewers as they turn on.
We never say, `Let's put more in.' `Sex and the City' could be an
even sexier show, but that's not the point of the show. `The
Sopranos' has less violence than `Nash Bridges.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of working at what they do best, (the networks) point
the finger at us and try to emulate us for all the wrong reasons.
No one's gonna like or not like a show because someone says `s---'
on it. But it draws attention to the advantage that we have without
pointing out that we try to present that content in a truthful and
honest context in our shows.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gelbart: ``I don't mind when they push the envelope, but I do
mind when they use the envelope to wipe my ass. It's sad that at
this historical moment, on the eve of the third millennium, we're
still talking about pee-pees and doo-doos.''
</P>
<P>
   Gelbart offers a qualification: ``If the surrounding material is
worthy of attention, one four-letter word gets the show plastered
in the newspaper, and gets people to watch, then perhaps it has
done its job. But you can't make that case if the rest of the show
isn't redemptive or entertaining. It's hard to imagine people
trying to watch a show just to hear a word they used to hear on the
playground. It doesn't say much for how far we've come.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to second-guess the people at `Chicago Hope,' but
William Shakespeare seemed to have found any number of words and
any number of situations _ critical, romantic, violent _ without
once writing, what I guess in his time, would have been `s--tte.'
Gelbart argues that such language debases the art of screenwriting.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps surprisingly, Bromell, too, fears that freer use of such
language will lead to what he calls ``degraded scriptwriting.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the practitioners in this brave new world of naughty
words do not set about their tasks glibly. Questioned about a jokey
line about oral sex in a recent ``Special Victims Unit,'' Palm
responds, ``To that I plead guilty _ it was a very churlish,
juvenile joke. To be honest, we've struggled with how to do humor
in the show. It's a new show, and it seems to be working. But in
hindsight, our attempts to force levity into the situations have
been difficult _ these crimes are so ghastly and gruesome, how do
you lighten up this universe?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Special Victims Unit'' has set forth a particularly difficult
path for itself, and Palm concedes the acclaimed series suffered
from a few ``growing pains.'' ``Homicide cops can crack wise while
standing over a dead body, and that's acceptable _ we know that
cops have a gallows humor,'' he points out. ``Yet it's unacceptable
when the victim is a woman who has been raped and killed.'' Palm
says that recently shot episodes of ``SVU'' have ``less of that
sort of locker-room banter, though someone's always going to be
offended.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to show that light can come out of dark stuff,''
he adds. ``Enough shows offer feel-good shopping-mall spirituality,
and that's fine. We're not trying to depress or gross out people,
but show that in really grim situations, something true, something
redeeming, can emerge.''
</P>
<P>
   Palm says that NBC's Standards and Practices department has
offered the show ``little interference,'' but that which does come
can be head-scratching. He points to an episode in which, as he put
it, ``Essentially, Lolita kills Humbert Humbert ... that put them
over the moon. The next week, an 8-year-old boy was assaulted and
murdered, and they didn't raise an eyebrow. So a teen-age girl
having consensual sex _ which is certainly dubious _ is more of a
hot-button topic than a dead child. I don't quite get it.''
</P>
<P>
   In another episode, a young gay man was murdered in a hate crime
_ and the network objected to the use of the word ``fag,'' but not
the crime itself. ``But the guy just smashed his head in,'' Palm
says. ``What should he say _ `Take that, you gender-specific
guy?'''
</P>
<P>
   Another episode, which featured the phrase ``semen in the
mouth,'' ``made them crazy,'' Palm says. The compromise? ``How
about, `seminal fluid in the mouth?' How is that better?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is not to be the first person to sneak a certain word
past anyone,'' Palm says, adding that NBC knew what it was getting
when it bought the show, since its original title was ``Law &AMP;
Order: Sex Crimes.'' ``That is the show they bought. So semen
(BEGIN ITAL)is(END ITAL) going to be in the mouth. Let's not
pussyfoot around. Let's do this show in an intelligent, mature
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Bromell says that with ``Chicago Hope,'' ``Every episode, you
have a discussion. Standards and Practices is its own fiefdom. You
win some and lose some. You get used to that. It's Kafka-Land, the
arguments sometimes make no sense, and you feel like an idiot
arguing the points, but you do it, because it's part of your job.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is, we're storytellers. That's a very good
story to tell. Sometimes it has ramifications that are significant.
Sometimes you just think it's cool and sexy, and that's legitimate,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: Bromell's ``s--- happens'' episode received less
than 50 complaints nationwide, fewer than some featuring
controversial medical procedures. ``And the few I saw or heard
about were just grumpy lunatics who didn't watch the episode _ they
had just heard about this, and considered it one more nail in the
coffin of civilization. There's not much room for debate with those
kind of people.''
</P>
<P>
   The question persists: Does this language coarsen society or
make it more honest?
</P>
<P>
   Bromell offers, ``When I think of my long departed, sweet
grandmother, if she saw the stuff on TV and saw naked people and
violent people and heard all the language and watched the local
news, she'd think the whole world had gone crazy.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when I'm at home and the kids are in bed and I'm telling
my wife about my day at work, all sorts of words are coming out.
But, if I hear my 11-year-old say (a bad word), he's gonna hear
about it. That's part of my job as a parent, to point out that
we're not supposed to say that in public, to get us to be better
than what we really are sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Gelbart suggests, ``When we grow accustomed to certain words,
new words will appear on the forbidden list. And then, once we get
those into the mainstream, those replacement words will be replaced
as well. It used to be, you couldn't say `son of a b----' and
'a--.' Now, we've moved on to bl-- j-- and fetishism. (Even worse
language) can't be far behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just keep checking what words the thesaurus has for cavities
or extensions or droppings.'' &QL;

A THREAT TO PEACE IN THE CAUCASUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This week Armenians watched on television as their country's
prime minister, the speaker of their Parliament, and six others
were mowed down with Kalashnikovs by killers shouting paranoid
slogans. Even if the killers were acting on their own and had no
supporters to back up their claim to be conducting a coup, the
assassinations inevitably induce anxiety about stability within
Armenia and the entire Caucasus region.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the murders could not have been more opportune for
forces opposed to a peaceful outcome in the disputed territory of
Nagorno-Karabakh. There has been a cease-fire since 1994, but the
800,000 Azeri refugees who fled their homes and Armenian de facto
control of what had been Azerbaijan's territory have created a
cycle of resentment and vengefulness, perfect fodder for extremist
demagogues in both camps.
</P>
<P>
   Just an hour or so before the shootings in Parliament, US Deputy
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott left Yerevan, Armenia's capital.
He had been holding high-level talks aimed at reaching a settlement
of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and was seen off at the airport by
Prime Minister Vazgen Sarkisian, a passionate nationalist who was
rumored to be engaged in discussions about Nagorno-Karabakh. Within
hours Sarkisian was dead.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not the assassins were acting to prevent a diplomatic
breakthrough on Nagorno-Karabakh, their action has made such a
breakthrough more difficult. Hence the de facto blockade of Armenia
will continue. The harsh economic conditions lamented by the
killers will not be alleviated. And there will be no relief from
the labyrinthine vendettas and power struggles that have kept the
Caucasus from creating the stability required to exploit its oil
and gas resources and stimulate economic development.
</P>
<P>
   It is very much in Armenia's interest to reach a negotiated
resolution of the Karabakh conflict with Azerbaijan. After the
assassinations, leaders in Yerevan and Washington should renew
their efforts to bring peace and stability to the Caucasus.

THEY'RE OFF, OFFICIALLY: ONE YEAR TO GO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, October 31, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTSMOUTH, N.H. _ It's too soon to relax, folks, but you can
see the light at the end of the tunnel: The presidential campaign
will be over a year from Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Halloween is always the appropriate signpost launching the gun
lap for the presidency. The ghosts and goblins of campaigns past
crop up like conifers in the Granite State. Quarrying for building
stone declined as an industry with the mixing of concrete, but
quarrying for primary votes is an industry all in itself. Gulling
the visitors, candidates and all their camp followers, as well as
feeding, watering, and roofing them, is not a cottage industry, but
a full-blown rip-roaring tourist industry.
</P>
<P>
   If you build it, concluded the architects of New Hampshire's
first primary, they will come _ and pay through the nose for the
privilege. We're indebted to Thursday's New York Times for gossippy
detail about the $54 million of his dough lavished on his
presidential ambition since 1966 by Steve Forbes, the magazine
publisher.
</P>
<P>
   He's taken the rubber band off his bankroll to the tune of $19
million this year already. His television ads come on more
frequently than the weather or the lottery number. Since his net
worth is pegged at $440 million, he can dig even deeper. In the '96
primary, he dumped a ton of boodle on negative ads castigating Bob
Dole. That, plus the Union Leader's lusty embrace, gave Pat
Buchanan the GOP victory here.
</P>
<P>
   For his troubles _ some estimate Steve poured $3 million into or
around New Hampshire last time _ the Forbes lad got 25,505 votes in
the Republican primary. Let's say this time, for argument's sake,
his outlay is closer to $5 million in and around New Hampshire
(e.g., commercial roadblocks and saturation ratings points on
costly Boston TV).
</P>
<P>
   And let's say Steve doubles his total vote from last time, say
to 50,000. That would still be only around 20 percent of the likely
turnout, a showing two or three times greater than what he
registers in polls today. If Steve snags 50,000 votes for his $5
million outlay hereabouts, that's $100 per vote. You might think
that's high. You might think a canny New Hampshire cynic might just
wonder, ``Hmm. If I promise to vote for Steve, would he just give
me the C-note?''
</P>
<P>
   I happen to think the vast majority of people would not sell
their vote for $100, or twice that. Now, three times that, I begin
to wonder. That's a car payment, after all. But $100 a vote is a
bargain price to what Steve dropped in the Ames, Iowa, straw poll
last summer. There he had to shell out $300 a vote.
</P>
<P>
   But Steve is not going to be president no matter if he spends
$1,000 a vote. Do you remember when the Nixon crowd dumped all over
George McGovern in the 1972 campaign? Because George had an
income-redistribution scheme that would have given every American
an extra $1,000 in some complicated fashion? Why was McGovern a
laughingstock for that but Forbes is treated seriously?
</P>
<P>
   Beats me. I know there is too much Big Money sluicing through
the sewers of American politics and turning Washington into a
septic tank. But we are not auctioning off the White House to the
highest bidder _ yet. Ross Perot tried it twice. For his $64
million, Ross got a lot of air time, some votes, and his footnote
in history.
</P>
<P>
   Not even the most pro-business Republican with any gravitas
believes deep down that a Steve Forbes could win a national
election, and it is hard to see a place for him anywhere near the
ticket. So one year from Tuesday, a president will be elected by
the name of Bush, Gore, Bradley, or McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Gore and Bill Bradley had their hour in the
artificial sun of kleig lights Wednesday in Hanover, and McCain,
Forbes, and three also-ran Republicans did their thing the next
night. Texas Governor George W. Bush skipped out, as is the
front-runner's privilege, with a lame excuse about needing to be in
Dallas for some ceremony involving his wife.
</P>
<P>
   That was the last big event Bush can skip up here without paying
a price. George Dubbbayew just used up his final get-out-of-jail
card as he tries to play Granite State Monopoly. Because just as
New Hampshire is not ready to fork over its troth to the richest
suitor, neither is it ready to roll over for an inexperienced
national politician who takes the state for granite, er, granted.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP dropout list is long: Elizabeth Dole, Dan Quayle, Lamar
Alexander, after Bush's lead froze their money supply, quit the
race. Pat Buchanan and Senator Bob Smith quit the GOP. Smith's
slithering back toward Republican ranks in the wake of Senator John
Chafee's death, so as to cop Chafee's chairmanship of the Senate
committee on the environment, is one of the more oafishly cynical
and crass moves we've seen in a long time. Senator Orrin Hatch,
abortion foe Gary Bauer and Alan Keyes, a crank who has blended the
decibel level of the talk show circus with the fevered political
notions of a sidewalk haranguer, are not factors, though they got
the same airtime in Hanover (``Hangover, N.H.'' in the words of one
wag) as did McCain and Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   At week's end, we can say this: Bradley is serious, articulate,
thematic; Gore is energized and, of necessity, much more aggressive
than he has been; McCain is the principal mainstream alternative to
Bush, who may have trouble handling the pressure of confrontations.
And Forbes has the potential to detonate a nuclear attack of
negative advertising upon the head of George Dubbayew, the
reluctant warrior.
</P>
<P>
   Cui bono? as the Jesuits say. Who benefits from a megaton of
Forbes ads savaging Bush? McCain, probably. The Arizonan is the
hero not only of the Hanoi Hilton and the Vietnam War but of the
campaign finance scandal and the Big Money War. I also think McCain
may win the third primary in New Hampshire, the one between McCain
and Bradley for the independent voters, those unenrolled in either
party, who'll decide late which race they want to affect.
</P>
<P>
   If McCain continues to emerge as the honest Old Soldier chasing
the moneychangers from the temple of government, he may draw enough
independents off Bradley to enable Gore to prevail. Hey, it's a
theory.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Imitation, they say, is the sincerest form of flattery.
</P>
<P>
   But the question is: Who is imitating whom?
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the 2000 Toyota Echo side-by-side with the 2000 Ford
Focus, it appears that these two remarkable all-new small cars were
cut from the same cloth.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know which one came first. But not only are these cars
nearly identical in style and size, they also both embrace a new
concept in small-car design that each manufacturer claims as
original.
</P>
<P>
   I wrote about the Focus last month. I told you it is a
subcompact that seems to be as roomy as a midsize sedan inside,
thanks partly to a high roof that makes the vehicle more like a
small sport-utility than a car.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the Toyota Echo with the same high roof and roomy
interior, with enormous leg room for three rear-seat passengers.
</P>
<P>
   The question of whose design this is might best be answered by
looking at the Toyota Prius, a gasoline-electric hybrid subcompact
sedan that has been on sale in Japan since late 1997.
</P>
<P>
   When I saw the new Echo for the first time, my initial reaction
was: Hey, that's just a Prius with a conventional engine. Toyota
officials say that isn't so. Even though the Prius and Echo look
remarkably similar, they don't have common parts and they aren't
built on the same vehicle platform.
</P>
<P>
   Yet looking at the Echo, it's obvious that Toyota took its
design and most of its dimensions straight from the Prius.
</P>
<P>
   For consumers, this is good news: the Echo is an eminently
better car than the cramped and underpowered Tercel it replaced,
just as the Focus is hugely better than the Escort, which it
eventually will replace.
</P>
<P>
   For just over $11,000, you can buy a base model Echo. And for a
bit over $14,000, you can put a well-equipped Echo in your
driveway, use it daily as your family/commuting/all-purpose
vehicle, and never feel you're giving up something just to get a
low car payment and cheap operating costs.
</P>
<P>
   There really are no major trade-offs. I felt more comfortable in
the Echo than I did in the Infiniti QX4 luxury sport-utility, and
there was even more power in the Echo when I needed it to pass
other vehicles on a two-lane road.
</P>
<P>
   Although the exterior styling might not be the most
scintillating design on the market, it does make for a handsome
car.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the sheer roominess of the Echo should be enough to win
most people over, even if the interior design weren't remarkable.
But it is. I fell in love with this car when I sat in the driver's
seat for the first time, looked at the instrument panel with its
modular gauge pod sitting in the center of the deep, flat
dashboard, and then realized I would have to stretch my arm to
reach the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   That was before I even started the little 1.5-liter,
105-horsepower engine, put the four-speed automatic transmission
into drive and started down the road. Then I fell in love all over
again.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the peppiest little sedans I've ever driven.
Without even realizing it, I was over the speed limit on the
freeway, and I had to rein in the little Echo to keep from getting
a ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, with 105 horsepower that's really going to happen, you
think to yourself. Yes, it will, and it's probably partly due to
the Echo's light weight: just over 2,000 pounds. That's several
hundred pounds lighter than most of the subcompact and compact
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Helping to make the Echo lighter is an alloy engine with a
composite (think plastic) intake manifold.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the air-conditioning on, the Echo perked up from a
standstill to 60 mph in less than 10 seconds. Top speed is
electronically limited to just over 100 mph, but I'll guarantee you
that it will get to that point rather quickly, so you'd better have
bail money ready if you attempt it.
</P>
<P>
   The trunk is also very roomy, with 13.6 cubic feet of cargo
space. The rear seat can be folded down (half or full) to create an
even bigger cargo area. The trunk opening is somewhat small,
however, so it would be difficult to get bulky items into it. The
average suitcase goes through fine.
</P>
<P>
   The speedometer's placement in that pod in the top middle of the
dash took a bit of getting used to. The first few times I looked
for the speedometer behind the steering wheel, I was a bit
surprised, because there is nothing there. Obviously, the
instrument pod in the center of the dash is meant to accommodate
Toyota's switch between left- and right-hand-drive versions of the
Echo on the assembly line. Just swivel the pod around toward the
right side, and it is in place for the Japanese market, where
everyone drives on the ``wrong'' side of the street.
</P>
<P>
   Road handling is remarkably precise, with solid steering control
and a firm enough suspension to hold the vehicle to the road in
tight turns. No, it's no sports car, but it does handle very well
for an economy sedan. Ride is smooth, if not cushy, and I don't
think you would get many complaints from your car-pool riders in
the back seat.
</P>
<P>
   Although we tested the four-door model, the Echo also comes in a
two-door coupe. Base price is $9,995, making the Echo the first
Toyota vehicle in more than 10 years with a list price under
$10,000.
</P>
<P>
   A five-speed manual transmission is standard on the Echo; the
automatic, which shifts smoothly, costs a few dollars extra (but it
was included in the $11,095 base price of our test car).
</P>
<P>
   The Echo would be a great commuter car because of its
outstanding fuel economy and what should be virtually trouble-free
operation (it is a Toyota, after all). With the manual
transmission, the Echo's EPA mileage ratings are 34 miles per
gallon in the city and 41 mpg on the highway. The automatic model
is rated at 32 mpg city/39 highway.
</P>
<P>
   Range is excellent _ more than 400 miles on the highway _ with
the Echo's 11.9-gallon fuel tank. The engine operates on unleaded
regular gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   Total price of our test car was $14,631, which included such
options as power door locks, power steering, manual remote outside
mirrors, air-conditioning, rear spoiler, AM/FM/cassette/compact
disc stereo with six speakers, and more. Power windows were not
included; I would have liked to have had them.

GORE AND BRADLEY SHOW THE WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rarely has a political debate showcased two candidates so
similar in substance but divergent in style as Vice President Al
Gore and former senator Bill Bradley Wednesday night at Dartmouth
College.
</P>
<P>
   If Gore was determined, as he seemed to be, to shake his
reputation for woodenness, he succeeded. Lively, animated,
connecting with the questioners, even telling an old joke, Gore was
a bundle of energy for more than two hours. Of getting government
to take mental health more seriously, he essentially pleaded for
votes, saying, ``This one I will fix for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore deftly inserted in nearly every answer a jab at Bradley _
for advocating a health care plan that is ``way excessive,'' for
supporting a pilot school voucher program, for opposing a US
military role in East Timor. As the debate progressed, Gore aides
in the press room distributed five ``reality checks'' that
questioned Bradley's consistency. This is standard stuff in
high-level politics, and Gore did it well.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise was that Bradley refused to engage. He acted as if
he were not involved in a two-person contest for the Democratic
nomination but in a conversation directly with the voting public,
trying to persuade citizens that he is offering himself and his
vision at the right time.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley defended his health plan cost estimate but ignored open
invitations to be critical of Gore or his record. Instead he said
of health care: ``It is a big problem; it needs a big solution.''
And he concluded: ``America's about dreaming and about being able
to fulfill those dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a significant departure from the prizefight model of
campaigns, and we hope it keeps up. Bradley will have to add more
specifics to his agenda. And Gore will not be denied a role. But
Bradley showed, at least in Dartmouth's town meeting format, that
he can speak above the fray.
</P>
<P>
   In Thursday night's similar town meeting for Republicans,
Governor George W. Bush of Texas, instead of absenting himself,
would have done well to try a similar tack.

<P>
   HAUNTED-HOUSES (Plattsburgh, N.Y.) _ Across the country, as the
veil separating the living from the dead is once again lifted
during the Halloween season, the latest fright to capture the
popular imagination is the haunted house designed not for children,
but for adults. With some costing around $1 million, and employing
Hollywood-style special effects, live rodents and dozens of actors,
the attractions are aimed at grown-ups who increasingly crave more
graphic chills. By Monique P. Yazigi. Photo. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NY-COLLEGE-STREETLIFE (New York) _ For a change, there is
collegial life on the streets down the hill from Columbia
University. People are strolling, eating at French restaurants
spilling out onto the sidewalk, lounging in cafes a few steps down
from street level, climbing to rooftops to sip beer or joining
friends at a pub. An area that was once thought of as a night-life
wasteland has become, if not exactly hip, at least pretty lively.
By Nina Siegel. Photo.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NY-STORE-PARTIES (New York) _ The party spot of the moment is
not a velvet-roped club, an unopened restaurant or an obscure
downtown gallery. It's a store. Almost every night of the week, it
seems, at one of the city's high-end retail outlets, drinks are
being dispensed in the handbag section and hors d'oeuvres being
passed over glass display cases as fluorescent-lighted guests mill
among overpriced merchandise and wonder if the people named on the
invitation as the hosts will bother to show up. By Rick Marin.

<P>
   NY-DRYCLEAN-GURU (New York) _ John Mahdessian, the owner of
Madame Paulette, charges $9 to wash and press a man's dress shirt,
far more than average cleaners, but he stands ready to go the extra
mile _ like removing all the buttons for $1 apiece to prevent them
from cracking during pressing, then sewing them back on. Day and
night, Mahdessian carries a cell phone with a special hot-line
number for clients with cleaning emergencies. By Monique P. Yazigi.

   GARDEN-COLUMN (Undated) _ Plants march to their own tune, not
the calendar's arbitrary dictates. My ``winter'' garden, for
example, started to show in late September. At least, that's when I
saw the first cream-incised leaves of the ever so elegant Italian
arum (A. italicum var. Marmoratum). By Patricia A. Taylor. &QL;

FORT WORTH FANS TRY TO SPARK INTEREST IN AVIATION HERITAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ When John Justin Jr. was a kid living in
Fort Worth during the 1930s, he dreamed of taking off with
daredevil pilot Reg Robbins in his glistening Ford tri-motor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to go so bad. I saved my lunch money until I had the
dollar he charged,'' Justin said. ``You had to kind of watch for
him; he'd only come around when he needed some money. Then, one
Sunday, here he came.''
</P>
<P>
   Justin rushed to the field, he said. ``I was standing there with
my dollar in my hand when he opened the door.''
</P>
<P>
   For Justin, the flight was magical. Robbins, seeing the joy in
his passenger's eyes, took Justin on ``hammerhead stalls,'' and
``wingovers.'' The usual five-minute flight lasted nearly a
half-hour. It deeply embedded in Justin a love of flying and an
undying appreciation for aviation.
</P>
<P>
   Justin went on to promote Fort Worth's western heritage through
his family boot company. But now, at the dusk of Fort Worth's
Sesquicentennial celebration, he and others who thrilled at Fort
Worth's early aviation believe that Cowtown has forgotten its
flying heritage.
</P>
<P>
   It was once the center of aviation growth in the United States,
producing more airplanes that any other place in the country. It
witnessed the world's first successful in-flight refueling. Its
residents waited for seven days as two tired pilots circled the
city for a world's endurance record.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years later, the Air Force made its first nonstop
round-the-world flight _ Fort Worth to Fort Worth. It took 94
hours.
</P>
<P>
   Royal Flying Corps cadets from Canada came to Fort Worth to
train during World War I; during World War II, thousands of bombers
left Fort Worth to rain terror on the Axis powers.
</P>
<P>
   One of the world's largest airlines, American, was born in Fort
Worth, and Cowtown shares in one of the world's busiest airports.
</P>
<P>
   To recognize those achievements, Mayor Kenneth Barr declared
October to be Fort Worth Aviation Heritage Month, and flying
enthusiasts hope that the proclamation will help spark a lasting
interest in the city's aviation past.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't realize how important aviation is to our economic
condition,'' said Charles Ringler, executive vice president of the
proposed Aviation Heritage Museum at Alliance Airport. ``More than
50 million people have been affected by aviation in this trade area
of North Texas. More than 165,000 people in this area are employed
in aviation. Aviation feeds a lot of families here.''
</P>
<P>
   Amon Carter Sr., former publisher of the Star-Telegram, is
credited with starting the local aviation industry. It began in
1941 when, after months of haggling, Fort Worth got the
Consolidated Aircraft Corp. ``Bomber Plant.'' It was supposed to be
built in Tulsa, Okla., but Carter wired his friend President
Franklin D. Roosevelt, calling it ``almost a crime against national
defense,'' to reject Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   The War Department decided to build two plants, one in Tulsa and
another in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one year, they built that mile-long building,'' Ringler
said. ``In 1942 they turned out about 179 B-24s a month. By 1945
they had turned out more than 3,000 aircraft. That put a shot to
our economic situation. It was our economic salvation.''
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth had an aviation history before World War II. In 1911,
three French and one Swiss pilots, known as the International
Aviators, brought their fragile aircraft to Fort Worth by train.
Carter arranged the exhibition, which took place in a park between
White Settlement Road and Seventh Street where a Montgomery Ward
store now sits.
</P>
<P>
   Roland G. Garros fought a terrifying 20-mph wind to fly his
plane 10 miles in seven minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Later that year, Cal Rodgers left New York on the first
transcontinental flight. He was sponsored by a grape drink called
Vin-Fiz, and his plane was named the Vin-Fiz Flyer. During that
flight, and after getting lost near Gainesville, Texas, he landed
in a Fort Worth pasture at 3 p.m. Oct. 17. He brought with him the
first piece of air mail ever delivered to Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   In 1917, in the midst of World War I, three Fort Worth-area air
training fields _ Hicks Field at Saginaw, Barron Field in Benbrook
and Carruthers Fields near Everman _ opened to train Royal Flying
Corps air cadets from Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Records show that 101 of the 1,504 students who trained in the
area died in training. Capt. Vernon Castle of the world-famous
Vernon and Irene Castle dance team was one of the casualties. His
plane stalled and crashed at Barron Field as he attempted to avoid
a collision.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 7, 1941, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor thrust the
United States into World War II, and Carter began his effort to
bring Consolidated to Fort Worth. By February 1942, B-24s were
being built at the rate of one a day by the facility's 38,000 local
workers.
</P>
<P>
   That assembly line has been running for 58 years, supplying B-36
Peacekeepers, B-58 Hustlers, F-111 Ardvarks and F-16 Fighting
Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   In 1950, Bell Helicopter Textron began making helicopters in
Fort Worth. First for the Korean War, and then the Vietnam War.
Today, its workers build new generations of military and commercial
helicopters and the tilt-rotor V-22 Osprey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our aviation history and heritage is very important,
but it is not at the forefront any more,'' said Walter Word, a
World War II Navy pilot who has spent his career as a corporate
pilot for major Fort Worth companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of it has been forgotten. Some of the old guys
out at Meacham Field _ Reed Pigman and Ed Ritchey _ nobody knows
who they are anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Justin agrees. ``I do think it has been forgotten. Fort Worth
has always been an aviation hub,'' he said. ``I would hope we could
get some of it back. I don't know if we can, but I would hope so.''

   SATURDAY'S KEY GAMES
</P>
<P>
   No. 22 Georgia 6-1
</P>
<P>
   at No. 6 Florida 6-1
</P>
<P>
   Florida's offense hit a dead-end at times against Auburn, and
Steve Spurrier, the Gators' difficult-to-please coach, seems ready
to dump quarterback Doug Johnson. Georgia, which ran up 577 yards
against Kentucky, will have it tougher against the nation's best
rushing defense (49.1 yards a game).
</P>
<P>
   No. 1 Penn State 8-0
</P>
<P>
   at Illinois 4-3
</P>
<P>
   After holding off Purdue, Penn State now catches a so-so
Illinois team that just upset Michigan. Penn State's quarterbacks
are banged up, and linebacker LaVar Arrington isn't feeling so
good. ``Right now,'' he said, ``my nerves are all messed up.''
</P>
<P>
   Southern Mississippi 5-2
</P>
<P>
   at No. 7 Alabama 5-2
</P>
<P>
   A disaster awaits Alabama, whose passer (Andrew Zow) and best
runner (Shaun Alexander) are doubtful because of sprained ankles.
Southern Mississippi hasn't beaten Alabama since 1990, when its
quarterback was Brett Favre.
</P>
<P>
   EAST
</P>
<P>
   No. 3 Virginia Tech (6-0)
</P>
<P>
   at Pittsburgh (4-3)
</P>
<P>
   A comfortable stop on Virginia Tech's road to an unbeaten
season.
</P>
<P>
   Boston College (5-2)
</P>
<P>
   at No. 18 Syracuse (5-2)
</P>
<P>
   Syracuse can't be as bad as it looked in a 62-0 humiliation by
Virginia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers (0-7)
</P>
<P>
   at Temple (1-6)
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers tight end L.J. Smith said, ``I think we're moving closer
to a win.'' Maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   Penn (3-3)
</P>
<P>
   at Yale (5-1)
</P>
<P>
   Yale has too much offense, and Penn's pass defense is suspect.

MEXICO POSTPONES $800 U.S. CAR DEPOSIT PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Mexican government postponed its plan to start
collecting deposits of up to $800 from motorists crossing the U.S.
border and driving into the interior of Mexico, a Mexican
spokeswoman said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The plan originally was set to start Nov. 1 but has been delayed
``a few weeks,'' according to Alicia Buenrostro, a press secretary
at the Mexican Embassy in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials still plan to implement the car-deposit plan
as a way of discouraging people from selling their U.S.-registered
cars in Mexico, depriving the Mexican government of taxes paid on
car sales, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the car-deposit policy, people crossing the border into
Mexico with plans to drive more than 15 miles into the interior
would be required to leave a deposit at a bank set up at each
checkpoint. The fee would range from $400 for cars produced in 1994
or earlier, $600 for models from 1995 to 1998 and $800 for cars
made this year or later.
</P>
<P>
   The money would be refunded once a person leaves Mexico, but
under the original plan people would have to leave the country from
the same border check point as the one they entered.
</P>
<P>
   The delay is to enable the Mexican government to study whether
motorists could pay the deposit by credit card, in addition to
cash, and how refunds should be given to drivers who leave the
country from a different location than the one they entered,
Buenrostro said.
</P>
<P>
   The postponement comes after members of Congress from along the
U.S.-Mexico border urged the Mexican government Thursday to drop
the car-deposit plan.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Mexican Ambassador Jesus Reyes Heroles, the
lawmakers from border districts in California, Arizona, New Mexico
and Texas said the new policy conflicts with the spirit of free
trade between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the motivation to implement this program is to combat
the problem of auto theft along the border and reinforce duties
paid on new vehicles sold in Mexico, we strongly believe that this
will be counterproductive to cooperation between the United States
and Mexico,'' Reps. Henry Bonilla, R-Texas, and Solomon Ortiz,
D-Texas, wrote to the ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Lubin, a spokesman for Bonilla, and Cathy Travis, a
spokeswomen for Ortiz, both said the lawmakers still want the car
deposit totally scrapped.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz agreed with Mexican officials that many cars are being
illegally imported into Mexico from the United States, or stolen
here, and then improperly sold in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had problems with cars on both sides of the border,''
Ortiz said in an interview this week. But, rather than impose a car
deposit, Ortiz said Mexican and United States law enforcement
agencies need to work together to combat the car problem.

A FISTFUL OF MUSIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(Eds: For use Sunday, Oct. 31 or thereafter) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was an unusual assignment for film composer Ennio Morricone _
recount in music the life of an imaginary piano virtuoso who never
sets foot on land.
</P>
<P>
   That describes in a nutshell ``The Legend of 1900,'' Giuseppe
Tornatore's first English-language film. The movie, which opened
Friday, is the romantic tale of a musician born at sea who lives
his life within the confines of a trans-Atlantic steamer.
</P>
<P>
   Named for the year in which he was born, 1900 (Tim Roth) is a
prodigious keyboardist who attracts the attention of jazz great
Jelly Roll Morton (Clarence Williams III), who challenges 1900 to a
piano duel.
</P>
<P>
   For the jazz- and ragtime-inspired soundtrack, Morricone _ who
first caught the attention of Hollywood with his pulsating '60s
scores for Sergio Leone's ``A Fistful of Dollars,'' ``For a Few
Dollars More'' and ``The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'' _ utilized
classical and jazz elements, building a score that culminates in an
end-title song with lyrics and vocals by ex-Pink Floyd member Roger
Waters and guitar by Eddie Van Halen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The film was not meant to have a song,'' Morricone said.
``Roger Waters did a very good job, but I had nothing to do with
it. It was something the record company wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   The acclaimed sixth collaboration between the 71-year-old
Morricone and Tornatore, who have been working together since
``Cinema Paradiso,'' which won the 1989 Academy Award for best
foreign language film and whose theme music is currently used in a
car commercial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a constant dialogue,'' Morricone said in Italian through
a translator. ``I offer my ideas and he (Tornatore) either accepts
them or sends them back _ and I try something else. We have a very
good working relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Known for incorporating rock, pop, jazz, classical, electronic
and traditional music into his work, Morricone has composed more
than 400 film scores, including the Oscar-nominated music for
``Bugsy,'' ``Days of Heaven,'' ``The Mission'' (also car-commercial
fodder) and ``The Untouchables,'' plus ``Bulworth,'' ``Lolita,''
``Wolf,'' ``In the Line of Fire'' and ``Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!''
</P>
<P>
   Because his career has been so long and rich, Morricone is a
major influence in the scoring world, says Michael Schelle,
Indianapolis-based author of ``The Score: Interviews With Film
Composers'' (Silman-James; $19.95).
</P>
<P>
   ``Ennio's been at it for over 40 years and completed hundreds of
scores. He's a major influence on the ones just starting and the
ones already established,'' Schelle said. ``He's known for quirky
little musical elements _ fragmented motifs that move in tonal and
non-tonal directions. He's also especially proud of his
orchestrations. That's why his scores always credit him with
composition and orchestration. I'm a great admirer of his craft and
imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   In composing ``Legend,'' Morricone drew inspiration from the
fact that the shipbound main character's birth certificate was
never officially registered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since he was never born, he will never die,'' the composer
explained. ``He's immortal that way. With that premise in mind, I
imagined this boy as a reincarnation of a musical genius from the
past.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Tornatore says he communicated with Morricone
through what he calls ``emotional metaphors.'' He also spent time
with the maestro on the phone while Morricone tinkered with themes
on the piano.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd play some things and I'd give him my opinion and it went
on for a while like that,'' the director recalls. ``Many of the
themes that are in the film were composed right in front of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Morricone, of course, has working methods as diverse as the
types of directors with whom he has collaborated. That list
includes Oliver Stone, Brian De Palma, John Carpenter, Roman
Polanski, Pedro Almodovar and Bernardo Bertolucci.
</P>
<P>
   But mention Morricone to average film fans and chances are
they'll quickly point to his early ``spaghetti western'' scores,
which contained an innovative mix of atonal harmonica, whistling
and ghostly choruses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got better, but the first one (`Fistful of Dollars') was the
worst music I ever wrote,'' Morricone insists. ``I refined my
writing later on, but the inspiration came from something rather
old that Leone had enjoyed, so I reworked it for the soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one predicted that first film would be a success.''
</P>
<P>
   Morricone was born in Rome and studied composition at the city's
Academy of Santa Cecilia, which will soon award him an honorary
doctorate of philosophy. His first film assignment, ``Il
Federale,'' came in 1961. In March, 1994, the Society for the
Preservation of Film Music presented him with its 11th annual
Career Achievement Award.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great honor to be recognized by that organization,
which is taken very seriously in my business,'' the composer said,
taking a break from scoring the forthcoming De Palma picture. ``I
used to always say the work itself is reward enough, but it truly
is a gift to be singled out by your peers.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet an Oscar has remained elusive.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can I possibly do?'' Morricone reflects. ``They're not
giving it to me. I've had many achievements in the movies, but I've
never seriously thought about the Oscar until lately. My only wish
is they give it to me before my death.'' &QL;

BLOOMS AND GREENERY TO STEAL A MARCH ON SPRING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Oct. 31)  
 (af)  
 By PATRICIA A. TAYLOR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Plants march to their own tune, not the calendar's arbitrary
dictates. My ``winter'' garden, for example, started to show in
late September. At least, that's when I saw the first cream-incised
leaves of the ever so elegant Italian arum (A. italicum var.
Marmoratum).
</P>
<P>
   Generally, fall _ rather than summer, as was the case this year
_ is the season when this jack-in-the-pulpit relative (both are
members of the Araceae family) displays stalks clustered with
bright-orange-to-scarlet berries. It is usually in December, when
frosts have shriveled any remaining berries and wiped out the rest
of the garden, that Italian arum's striking foliage shoots up out
of bare ground.
</P>
<P>
   The marbled leaves are shaped like isosceles triangles, with
sides as long as 12 inches and a base as wide as 8 inches. They
either arch gracefully or plane out on top of 18-inch stems.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, however, they are underskirted with the sunny flowers
of yellow corydalis (C. lutea). Since the plants are in a protected
north-facing corner, this combination will probably last into early
winter.
</P>
<P>
   Though killing frosts or heavy snows shut down the corydalis
plants until spring, they only flatten the Italian arum. This
woodland plant literally bounces back, looking as fresh as the
proverbial daisy at every warm opportunity, and does so all winter
long. New leaves quickly take the place of any that wear out from
all the exercise.
</P>
<P>
   I have always regarded these leaves as sacrosanct, because they
represent the only fresh new greenery in my central New Jersey
winter borders. My attitude changed in this fall's lushness,
however, and in a moment of what some might consider reckless
abandon, I cut three stalks for a striking indoor arrangement. This
drew rave reviews and looked marvelous for more than two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Since I've never done this before, I don't know if the overall
health of the plants will be affected. Even if they respond
unfavorably, I have an ample supply to cover any losses because the
arums have seeded nicely over the five years I've had them.
</P>
<P>
   Giant snowdrops (Galanthus elwesii) are usually the next plants
to appear. While I once saw them in late December, I usually have
to wait until mid-January to enjoy their flowers. The way things
are going this year, however, I wouldn't be surprised if I saw
their first shoots on Thanksgiving Day. They occasionally bloom
this early in the Tidewater Virginia gardens of Becky Heath of the
Brent and Becky's Bulbs mail-order concern.
</P>
<P>
   If the first silver green shoots were to appear on Thanksgiving
Day, it would mean I could use the plants over the December
holidays. Giant snowdrops, twice the 4-inch height of common
snowdrops (Galanthus nivalis), are easily dug, bulb and all, and
brought indoors, where they make exquisite floral centerpieces. I
usually put them in silver creamers or baby cups and watch the
white flowers, lightly specked with green edges, unfold and hold
for at least two weeks. Outdoors, they last as long as six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Heath doesn't need to dig up giant snowdrops for her winter
holidays because she has clumps of Rijnveld's Early Sensation in
bloom.
</P>
<P>
   These early flowering, all-yellow trumpet daffodils mock
temperatures in the teens and grow 12 to 14 inches tall. In what
has been an annual tradition for the last several years, Mrs. Heath
delights in going out on New Year's Day and picking a bouquet of
these charming flowers.
</P>
<P>
   She says that if I plant this bulb in early November, there's a
small chance that I may also be able to fill a New Year's vase with
these flowers. At the very least, I should be able to see buds by
early January if I place the bulbs in the warmest, sunniest spot on
my property.
</P>
<P>
   Because the ground is often bare in January, my floral parade
begins in earnest at month's end. In a bright, sunny front border,
carefully chosen so that both passers-by and visiting friends can
enjoy the color as much as I do, cheery yellow winter aconites
(Eranthis hyemalis), gleaming white common snowdrops and soft
violet-blue crocuses (C. tommasinianus) create a smashing display.
</P>
<P>
   This combination usually lasts for a month, not only because of
the cool temperatures that hold the flowers in place, but also
because squirrels find these bulbs unappetizing.
</P>
<P>
   Squirrels do not like dwarf irises (I. reticulata), either.
Unlike spring irises, these bulbous plants are only 4 inches tall,
and the foliage goes dormant shortly after the flowers bloom. The
flowers themselves, however, look like small versions of bearded
irises. I have Purple Gem, a rich plum-purple cultivar that looks
particularly beautiful when paired with white common snow drops.
</P>
<P>
   For the last two years, all of these flowers have decorated my
borders by midwinter at the latest. While traditional wisdom holds
that now is the season to put the garden to bed, my plants are
telling me that it is the glorious start of the party to come. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All plants mentioned will be available through early December or
until supplies run out from Brent &AMP; Becky's Bulbs, 7563 Heath
Trail, Gloucester, VA 23061, (877) 661-2852, or from McClure &AMP;
Zimmerman, P.O. Box 368, Friesland, WI 53935, (800) 883-6998. Both
have free catalogs. Italian arum is kept dormant and should be
planted immediately upon receipt.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Sunday, Oct. 31, will move Saturday.

<P>
   On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   (Moving in the `a' category)
</P>
<P>
   ETHNIC-POLITICS-REVIEW (New York) _ Ethnic politics has reached
a level of complexity that is confounding politicians across the
nation. Candidates are being forced to take positions on
complicated issues, pitting the perceived interests of one ethnic
group against the sentiment of the population at large, or dividing
members of these purportedly solid constituencies by generation,
ideology and economic class. These pressures come at time when
ethnic groups that once existed at the margins of politics have
become powerful forces. The Senate race in New York may provide an
intricate roadmap for where ethnic politics in U.S. is heading. By
Adam Nagourney.
</P>
<P>
   OBESITY-REVIEW (Undated) _ Americans are eating more than ever,
increasing their average number of calories year by year. Forty
percent of them get no physical exercise. Americans are also
getting fatter every year: more than half are overweight and fully
22 percent are obese. A look at the upsurge in obesity and the
prospects of drugs and other treatments for dealing with it. By
Gina Kolata.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   PRESCHOOL-REVIEW (Undated) _ What is the appropriate age for
children to start school? Americans instinctively say 5 or 6. In
some European countries, toddlers of 2 and 3 attend government-run
classes. And with a host of new research showing lasting impact of
education in the earliest years of life, along with the continued
push of women into the workforce _ both among upper-class
professionals and former welfare recipients _ a movement for
universal preschool in the U.S. is gaining momentum. By Jamie
Wilgoren.
</P>
<P>
   SUBSTANTIVE-POLITICS-REVIEW (Undated) _ For all the grousing
about 30-second sound bites and shallow politicians, this already
has been one of the most substantive presidential campaigns in
years _ if not decades. Candidate after candidate has issued quite
detailed position papers on a host of issues, far more and far
earlier than the last few campaigns. By Richard L. Berke.
</P>
<P>
   SIDEWALK-TV-REVIEW (New York) _ Early-morning television is
taking to the sidewalks here as never before _ sidewalks that have
become, in effect, sound stages where cameras can capture the
exuberance of nose-to-the-glass fans waving, shouting and reveling
in their 15 seconds of fame. By James Barron.
</P>
<P>
   HEALTH-FEAR-ADS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Be afraid. Be very afraid.
This is the message at the heart of public health campaigns
encouraging young people to abandon unhealthy behavior like
smoking, binge drinking or unsafe sex. From billboards to public
service ads to ``Scared Straight,'' appeals to fear endure despite
mixed reviews from public health and communications experts and
doubts about whether such entreaties can effect long-term behavior
change. By Jeff Stryker.
</P>
<P>
   DOW-ECON-REVIEW (New York) _ The Dow Jones industrial average
has long been viewed as the most prominent measure of the financial
health of Corporate America. Maybe now it should be seen as a
barometer of how fast the U.S. economy is changing. By Floyd
Norris.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Moving in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   PALESTINIAN-ECON-REVIEW (Ramallah, West Bank) _ A new route for
goods and people between the West Bank and Gaza offers the prospect
of unifying them into one integrated economy, a prerequisite for
building a viable Palestinian state. But new opening has already
exposed the stark cultural and economic contrasts between the two
regions. Now, the poorer, more religious and less educated Gazans
will compete for jobs with the more settled and secular urbanites
of the West Bank. This could mean unwelcome sacrifices for the West
Bank, and could trigger resentment and envy among the Gazans. By
William Orme.
</P>
<P>
   CENTRAL-ASIA-MUSLIMS-REVIEW (Osh, Kyrgyzstan) _ The appearance
of Islamic insurgents in this remote Central Asian country has not
only shocked regional leaders and their Russian and Chinese
neighbors. It has also awakened the world to a troubling new
phenomenon: the existence of a floating army of religious fighters
who are roaming this part of the world in search of regimes to
overthrow. By Steven Kinzer.
</P>
<P>
   PANAMA-U.S.-REVIEW (Washington) _ A delicate diplomatic question
of the moment in the Clinton administration: Who will lead the U.S.
delegation to the formal handover of the Panama Canal in December.
Volunteers are not exactly flooding the White House with calls. By
David E. Sanger.
</P>
<P>
   WORLD-CORRUPTION-REVIEW (Undated) _ Each year, Transparency
International, a non-profit group based in Berlin that specializes
in tracking global thievery, releases a list of the world's most
corrupt countries. But while Transparency's work has been lauded

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Sunday, Oct. 31, will move Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   (Moving in the `a' category)
</P>
<P>
   ETHNIC-POLITICS-REVIEW (New York) _ Ethnic politics has reached
a level of complexity that is confounding politicians across the
nation. Candidates are being forced to take positions on
complicated issues, pitting the perceived interests of one ethnic
group against the sentiment of the population at large, or dividing
members of these purportedly solid constituencies by generation,
ideology and economic class. These pressures come at time when
ethnic groups that once existed at the margins of politics have
become powerful forces. The Senate race in New York may provide an
intricate roadmap for where ethnic politics in U.S. is heading. By
Adam Nagourney.
</P>
<P>
   OBESITY-REVIEW (Undated) _ Americans are eating more than ever,
increasing their average number of calories year by year. Forty
percent of them get no physical exercise. Americans are also
getting fatter every year: more than half are overweight and fully
22 percent are obese. A look at the upsurge in obesity and the
prospects of drugs and other treatments for dealing with it. By
Gina Kolata.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   PRESCHOOL-REVIEW (Undated) _ What is the appropriate age for
children to start school? Americans instinctively say 5 or 6. In
some European countries, toddlers of 2 and 3 attend government-run
classes. And with a host of new research showing lasting impact of
education in the earliest years of life, along with the continued
push of women into the workforce _ both among upper-class
professionals and former welfare recipients _ a movement for
universal preschool in the U.S. is gaining momentum. By Jamie
Wilgoren.
</P>
<P>
   SUBSTANTIVE-POLITICS-REVIEW (Undated) _ For all the grousing
about 30-second sound bites and shallow politicians, this already
has been one of the most substantive presidential campaigns in
years _ if not decades. Candidate after candidate has issued quite
detailed position papers on a host of issues, far more and far
earlier than the last few campaigns. By Richard L. Berke.
</P>
<P>
   SIDEWALK-TV-REVIEW (New York) _ Early-morning television is
taking to the sidewalks here as never before _ sidewalks that have
become, in effect, sound stages where cameras can capture the
exuberance of nose-to-the-glass fans waving, shouting and reveling
in their 15 seconds of fame. By James Barron.
</P>
<P>
   HEALTH-FEAR-ADS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Be afraid. Be very afraid.
This is the message at the heart of public health campaigns
encouraging young people to abandon unhealthy behavior like
smoking, binge drinking or unsafe sex. From billboards to public
service ads to ``Scared Straight,'' appeals to fear endure despite
mixed reviews from public health and communications experts and
doubts about whether such entreaties can effect long-term behavior
change. By Jeff Stryker.
</P>
<P>
   DOW-ECON-REVIEW (New York) _ The Dow Jones industrial average
has long been viewed as the most prominent measure of the financial
health of Corporate America. Maybe now it should be seen as a
barometer of how fast the U.S. economy is changing. By Floyd
Norris.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Moving in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   PALESTINIAN-ECON-REVIEW (Ramallah, West Bank) _ A new route for
goods and people between the West Bank and Gaza offers the prospect
of unifying them into one integrated economy, a prerequisite for
building a viable Palestinian state. But new opening has already
exposed the stark cultural and economic contrasts between the two
regions. Now, the poorer, more religious and less educated Gazans
will compete for jobs with the more settled and secular urbanites
of the West Bank. This could mean unwelcome sacrifices for the West
Bank, and could trigger resentment and envy among the Gazans. By
William Orme.
</P>
<P>
   CENTRAL-ASIA-MUSLIMS-REVIEW (Osh, Kyrgyzstan) _ The appearance
of Islamic insurgents in this remote Central Asian country has not
only shocked regional leaders and their Russian and Chinese
neighbors. It has also awakened the world to a troubling new
phenomenon: the existence of a floating army of religious fighters
who are roaming this part of the world in search of regimes to
overthrow. By Steven Kinzer.
</P>
<P>
   PANAMA-U.S.-REVIEW (Washington) _ A delicate diplomatic question
of the moment in the Clinton administration: Who will lead the U.S.
delegation to the formal handover of the Panama Canal in December.
Volunteers are not exactly flooding the White House with calls. By
David E. Sanger.
</P>
<P>
   WORLD-CORRUPTION-REVIEW (Undated) _ Each year, Transparency
International, a non-profit group based in Berlin that specializes
in tracking global thievery, releases a list of the world's most
corrupt countries. But while Transparency's work has been lauded
for helping to make corruption a centerpiece of economic
development debates, some economists say the group's hit-list
unfairly tars countries that may be no more corrupt than those
ranked much lower. By Timothy L. O'Brien.
</P>
<P>

 By MONIQUE P. YAZIGI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PLATTSBURGH, N.Y. _ It was cold and dark in the cemetery where
Latoya Franklin stood stone still, her arms clinging to a friend
from behind. It was quiet, so quiet that the friend, Vern
Witherbee, could hear Latoya's bones shake.
</P>
<P>
   They looked straight ahead. There was a squeak. Then Latoya
jumped four feet backward, screaming bloody murder. Tears streamed
down her face as huge gray rats scampered out of a coffin and
across her feet, before disappearing into a hole.
</P>
<P>
   Latoya, 17, a high school student in this upstate town,
collapsed to the ground, shaking all over. When she regained her
composure, her party of five continued on, passing ghouls feasting
on corpses, scientists cooking bats and snakes, and blood gushing
from a patient on an operating table as he was being hacked up with
a cleaver.
</P>
<P>
   After 25 minutes and many more fits of screaming, the party
emerged dazed into the bright light of a warehouse, outside the
area where volunteer firemen had set up a house of horrors.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, as the veil separating the living from the
dead is once again lifted during the Halloween season, the latest
fright to capture the popular imagination is the haunted house
designed not for children, but for adults.
</P>
<P>
   With some costing around $1 million, and employing
Hollywood-style special effects, live rodents and dozens of actors,
the attractions are aimed at grown-ups who increasingly crave more
graphic chills. A sign near the entrance of the Plattsburgh haunted
house, which expected 4,000 visitors during its week of operation,
reads, ``Not recommended for children under 13.''
</P>
<P>
   The children who did enter invariably bailed out immediately by
a door designed for the purpose. Most were in tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made one adult gentleman go to the bathroom in his pants;
need I say more?'' said Brian Herkalo, one of the volunteers
running the attraction, whose $3 admission price went to support
local charities.
</P>
<P>
   A Web site, HauntedAmerica.com, lists 3,000 haunted houses in
operation around the country in October, up from 2,300 last
Halloween season. Ninety percent of them are aimed at adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are more adult haunted houses than there have ever been,
entertaining millions of people,'' said Joe Jensen, a co-founder of
the Web site and formerly the operator of a haunted house in
Chicago that he said drew 75,000 visitors a season. ``The haunted
houses are becoming scarier and scarier. The audiences are
demanding it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some fright factories are in basements or warehouses, with
staffs of volunteers who build sets and impersonate ghouls to raise
money for charity. But more often, they are profit-making
businesses, which charge up to $30 for admission and are as
elaborately constructed as theme parks, employing actors to ride
``headless'' on horseback through woods or a farm.
</P>
<P>
   At Spooky World in Foxboro, Mass., four haunted houses sprawl
over 60 acres behind Foxboro Stadium, home of the New England
Patriots football team. The monthlong attraction was built at a
cost of $4 million, tripling in size from last year when, at a more
residential location, it caused huge traffic snarls.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 23, 8,700 people visited Spooky World, most of them in
their 20s and 30s. Linda Blair from ``The Exorcist'' and Kane
Hodder of ``Friday the 13th'' have been celebrity guests. But the
biggest star is probably Ruth Phelps, aka the Mouse Girl, who
smears her body with peanut butter and lets 200 mice run over her.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has been bitten, but she doesn't mind,'' David Bertolino,
a co-owner of Spooky World, said. The Mouse Girl's one request is
that she be smeared with smooth, not chunky-style, peanut butter.
``The mice were eating the chunks off her face,'' Bertolino
explained. ``It wasn't an unreasonable request.''
</P>
<P>
   In Newton, Pa., a haunted house called the Dredd Funeral Home
admits visitors in groups of 10. At one point, a guest mysteriously
disappears. ``It's eerie,'' said April Woodall, 41, a dean at the
Academy of Vocal Arts, an opera training school in Philadelphia,
who has visited three times.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining ``mourners'' then enter a room to pick out a
casket for their departed friend. But all of a sudden the missing
visitor appears in a casket. ``I don't like to be jumped up from
behind and shouted `Boo' at,'' Ms. Woodall said. ``That's
predictable. The good haunted houses give you something to think
about a long time afterward.''
</P>
<P>
   Each year, owners and experienced visitors say, haunted houses
have been getting more elaborate, with gorier costumes, more
expensive special effects and scenarios that play mind games with
visitors, rather than simply startling them.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Buffs who travel far and wide to visit haunted houses, and
experts like Jensen of the Web site _ collectively known as
``haunters'' for their passion _ say that Americans have a taste
for more graphic fright because of popular entertainment like ``The
X Files'' and Doom, the video game. This summer's hit horror
movies, including ``The Mummy,'' ``The Blair Witch Project'' and
``The Sixth Sense,'' also seem to have swelled the audience this
fall for haunted houses.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis Cole, the chairman of the film division at Columbia
University, said that horror as a genre is more in demand when the
economy and politics are unroiled. ``When everything is sort of
stable, people want to see things that make them feel something,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think of the '50s and `Psycho,''' he went on, ``it was
a placid time, yet there were all sorts of elements that were about
to explode, and then you had the '60s.'' In that decade, there was
plenty of excitement in the streets and screen horror was not so
popular.
</P>
<P>
   A subgenre of haunted houses, operated by conservative Christian
churches around the country, depict scenes from hell with an
express moral lesson: here is what awaits drug users, abortionists
and homosexuals. They have sometimes stirred local controversy, and
in late October, a church in Cedar Hill, Texas that set up a Hell
House depicting the high school murders at Littleton, Colo., landed
in the national news for its perceived insensitivity.
</P>
<P>
   The great majority of haunted houses are secular, and the
frights they impart are intended to be thrilling, perhaps
cathartic, but not moralizing. One of the most popular scenarios,
duplicated by many operators, begins when visitors enter a crypt.
They see an upright coffin, which is open, and suddenly a hand
pushes them in. The floor of the coffin opens and the visitors
descend by ramp into hell, where dead souls in ragged clothes cry
out. Some have missing limbs, others have faces that look like
they've been gnawed.
</P>
<P>
   Jensen, whose Chicago haunted house was named Hades, used to
study Aztec and Mayan traditions to plan new frights. ``Their death
legends are most graphic and least known,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other popular tableaus at haunted houses around the country this
year include the following:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Black Hole, a tunnel that is spinning around you. It's
pitch black and all you can see are the stars on the tunnel,
spinning, spinning. It creates an extreme sense of vertigo.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Demon Puppets, eight-foot-tall creatures that lunge at
visitors from the darkness.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Chainsaw, as held by a seemingly crazed person. ``That
still scares people the most,'' Jensen said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Headless Horseman Hayrides and Haunted House in Ulster
Park, N.Y., the owners, Michael and Nancy Jubie, have learned to
ratchet up the frights each year. On their 45-acre farm, more than
25,000 people have visited in the five weeks preceding Halloween.
They ride by wagon through fields unveiling the works of a
fictitious Dr. Joseph Blight.
</P>
<P>
   As the story goes, Blight, after many years of research in
Madagascar, has been infected by an unknown spore, and now has
plant and human DNA. He has created a new form of life that is half
human, half plant. Participants visit his two homes, where his
species live. In one room an angry half-plant, half-man punches a
hand through a woman's chest, and it comes out the other side.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're sold out every night,'' Mrs. Jubie said. ``Demand is
greater than supply. But once Oct. 31 is over, people don't want to
be scared. They turn their heads toward Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   In the week leading up to Halloween, Oct. 31, the haunters have
been out in force. Elizabeth LaBrake, 21, a community-college
student in Plattsburgh, was waiting with two friends to visit the
firefighters' haunted house.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plattsburgh is very boring,'' she said. ``You need something
to put you on the edge, to get your heart going.''
</P>
<P>
   A friend, John Akin, 20, had a different reason. ``I just want
to watch her freak out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And Latoya, the teen-ager who had fallen to the floor shaking
when rats scampered over her feet _ they were mechanical, not real
_ was still wiping away tears. Asked after emerging from the spook
house if she would ever go through it again, she hesitated a
moment, then answered, ``Absolutely.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   A slow-moving front from the Great Lakes to the southern Plains
will separate unseasonably mild air over most of the East from
cooler air over much of the interior West. Inclement conditions
will be concentrated near the front and along the Washington coast.
Otherwise, an exceptionally dry weather pattern will dominate the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Sunshine will be abundant over a large area from the interior
Southeast to the Middle Atlantic states. Afternoon temperatures in
the 70s will be common across the region. Farther north, sun will
be mixed with some clouds, especially in northern New England where
a surge of milder air is forced to rise over the cool air near the
ground. Onshore breezes will keep temperatures near seasonal levels
along the New England coast.
</P>
<P>
   Moist air from the Gulf of Mexico will combine with a sluggish
frontal system to produce a band of clouds and showers from eastern
Texas to the central Mississippi Valley. The heaviest rain will
fall over parts of eastern Texas and Oklahoma where thunderstorms
will form as a jet stream disturbance lifts the humid air. Farther
north, a few light showers will accompany the front in the western
Great Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   Sprawling high pressure over the central Rockies will promote
chilly nights and comfortable days in the interior West. The
clockwise winds around the high will produce offshore winds which
will bring unusual heat to the southern California coast.
Meanwhile, a cold front surrounded by clouds and rain will move
gradually south from northern Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Super Cyclone
</P>
<P>
   A powerful storm that was described by the Indian Meteorological
Service as a ``super cyclone'' blew in from the Bay of Bengal on
Friday reaching the northeastern coast of India with torrential
rain and central winds near 155 mph. The tempests that are dubbed
hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean are known as tropical cyclones
when they form in the Indian Ocean. The same kind of storm is
called a typhoon in the western Pacific. The adjective ``super'' is
applied to any of these storms once the wind speed exceeds 150 mph,
twice that of a minimal hurricane.

The following chart shows how senators and representatives voted on
key bills and amendments within the last week. A ``Y'' means the
member voted for the measure; an ``N'' means the member voted

</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: SUICIDE
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday approved, 271-156, a bill to ban
doctor-assisted suicide. Although the measure includes provisions
that give physicians more flexibility in prescribing drugs to
reduce suffering among terminally ill patients, it stops short of

   The House on Thursday approved, 218-211, a $314 billion spending
bill for education, labor and health programs that includes a 1
percent across-the-board cut for all spending on government
agencies. The bill also allocates $429 million for the District of
Columbia budget. Supporters said the measure provides sufficient
funds for the programs without dipping into Social Security
surpluses. President Clinton said he will veto the measure because
of the agency budget cuts and because it does not provide funding
for hiring more teachers. A ``yes'' vote favors the measure.

   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Fort Worth was once the center of aviation
growth in the United States, producing more airplanes that any
other place in the country. It witnessed the world's first
successful in-flight refueling. Its residents waited for seven days
as two tired pilots circled the city for a world's endurance
record. Twenty years later, the Air Force made its first nonstop
round-the-world flight _ Fort Worth to Fort Worth. It took 94
hours. Royal Flying Corps air cadets from Canada came to Fort Worth
to train during World War I; in World War II, thousands of bombers
left Fort Worth to rain terror on the Axis. One of the world's
largest airlines, American, was born here, and now Fort Worth
shares in one of the world's busiest airports. To recognize these
achievements, some leading Fort Worth citizens are promoting an
Aviation Heritage Museum at Alliance Airport. By ART CHAPMAN. Story

 &HT;    CONGRESSMEN WANT TO CURB PRESIDENTIAL EXECUTIVE ORDERS
 &HT;    By Jena Heath
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON. _ Congressman Ron Paul is worried.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Republican ponders the possibility that President
Clinton or some other president could put the entire nation under
the control of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the people
you hear so much about when the floods hit.
</P>
<P>
   He figures this could happen because something called Executive
Order 12919 allows the cabinet to control the economy once the
president declares a state of emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Issued since George Washington's presidency, executive orders
irk Paul and others who fear that they give the president too much
power.
</P>
<P>
   Paul is sponsoring legislation to curb executive orders, though
he isn't optimistic that his efforts will become law. But losing a
fight doesn't daunt the 1988 Libertarian Party presidential
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Paul in the executive order fight are Rep. Bob Barr, a
Georgia Republican and Rep. Jack Metcalf, a Republican from
Washington state. They want the legislative branch to restore what
they see as as the out-of-wack balance of power between Congress
and the White House. This week, they told a House subcommittee
about their concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Barr's bill would require the president to provide Congress with
copies of executive orders and give Congress 30 days to reject or
modify them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress needs to reassert both itself and the primacy of the
Constitution,'' Barr told the House Judiciary subcommittee on
commercial and administrative law.
</P>
<P>
   Metcalf's measure would make future executive orders advisory.
</P>
<P>
   Paul's bill would suspend all national emergencies declared
since 1976 and allow anyone to sue if they believe an executive
order violated the constitution or harms their rights, property or
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Paul said his efforts aren't aimed at Clinton. But he makes no
secret that he's irritated with the administration. He quotes a
Nov. 1 U.S. News &AMP; World Report item entitled ``Project Podesta,''
in which John Podesta, White House chief of staff, announced that
Clinton plans a bunch of executive orders, including creating new
medical privacy rules and providing paid leave to parents who need
to take care of newborns. Clinton has signed 307 executive orders
since first taking office.
</P>
<P>
   Paul is also put out with former Clinton aide Paul Begala, who,
along with James Carville, helped Clinton capture the White House.
Begala summed up his feelings about executive orders last year when
he said: ``Stroke of the pen. Law of the land. Kind of cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the nearly 15,000 recorded executive orders have had
far-ranging consequences. During World War II, when President
Franklin Delano Roosevelt decided Japanese-Americans were national
security risks, he issued an executive order. More than 110,000
people were deposited in internment camps.
</P>
<P>
   President John Kennedy used an executive order to prohibit
racial discrimination in federally subsidized housing, and
President Lyndon B. Johnson used one to to create hiring rules for
minorities. President Richard Nixon signed one that allowed the FBI
to spy on Americans who didn't agree with the Vietnam War;
President Gerald Ford later revoked it.
</P>
<P>
   The use of executive orders has skyrocketed in the past four
decades. And though Congress, the courts and later presidents can
overturn the orders, that doesn't happen nearly enough to put Paul
and other critics at ease.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Gaziano, a senior policy analyst with the conservative
Heritage Foundation, also thinks Clinton has gone too far with
executive orders. Take the one he issued declaring a moratorium on
new logging roads _ a sop to environmentalists, Gaziano maintains.
But even he has trouble with Paul's plan to allow folks to sue over
executive orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Abuses like this upset those of us who support strong
executive authority because they invite this type of legislation
that's well-meaning but may create more problems than its worth,''
said Gaziano, who helped review executive orders under Presidents
George Bush and Clinton.

WHY PEOPLE LIKE TO TERRIFY THEMSELVES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DAVID BLUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Tonight, as always, the Cyclone roller coaster at
Coney Island repeats its rattling climb toward a blackened sky. The
wooden supports creak with age; as its cars rumble along the tracks
toward its terrifying, 85-foot first drop, the two dozen or so
riders start to scream. Across town, a 6-year-old boy listens with
dread and fascination to a bedtime retelling of ``Jack and the
Beanstalk,'' the story of a monster and his young nemesis. And in
the darkness of a movie theater, a teen-age girl finds her palms
sweaty and her breath shallow as the macabre final twist of ``The
Sixth Sense'' unfolds.
</P>
<P>
   Why do we keep torturing ourselves like this? Why are people so
willing to be turned into traumatized yet addicted consumers of
fear?
</P>
<P>
   The Cyclone, which Charles Lindbergh reportedly described as
more exciting than flying solo over the Atlantic Ocean, remains,
after more than seven decades, Coney Island's most popular
attraction. CBS says it has made a deal with Jim Henson Television
to make a four-hour miniseries of ``Jack and the Beanstalk'' next
season. As of this week, ``The Sixth Sense'' has passed $256
million in domestic gross revenues and is still going strong. And
of course there's Sunday night, when children and adults disguise
themselves as ghouls and demons and monsters, as they have for
hundreds of years. That can't just be for the candy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like boot camp for the psyche,'' said Wes Craven,
director of the hugely successful ``Scream'' movies (``Scream III''
is set for release in February). ``In real life human beings are
packaged in the flimsiest of packages, threatened by real and
sometimes horrifying dangers, events like Columbine. But the
narrative form puts those fears into a manageable series of events.
It gives us a way of thinking rationally about our fears.''
</P>
<P>
   Craven places his movies in a grand tradition of drama and
storytelling. ``Scary elements in drama go back all the way to
Greek mythology,'' he explained. ``As someone once said, the story
begins when the conflict starts and ends when it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Craven's view is shared by psychologists studying the phenomenon
of sensation-seeking, as academics like to call it. ``If you see a
snake in a movie or someone dressed up as a snake for Halloween,
you know the snake can't bite you,'' said Dr. Michael Otto,
associate professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School. ``It's
the anxiety that bites you. And if you're lucky, after a while you
realize that anxiety doesn't hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Psychologists and scholars have been studying fears for decades.
Some search for ways to modify or eliminate them for people who
want to fly airplanes, ride roller coasters or otherwise experience
the quotidian terrors of American life. Others are curious about
this seeming oddity of human behavior _ seeking to explain why
apparently normal human beings would elect to experience terror and
mayhem in ever growing doses. In their endeavors, scholars and
scientists as well as writers and directors have been stumbling
onto new theories for why so many people crave terror.
</P>
<P>
   ``More people experience fears because there's so much more of
it around, and it's far more frightening than ever before,'' said
Marina Warner, an English scholar whose most recent book, ``No Go
the Bogeyman,'' (Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux) examines the figures of
terror in children's fairy tales. Having observed that late
20th-century culture contains far scarier images than are found in
fairy tales, Ms. Warner says that those who can tolerate or enjoy
their fears may now experience a deeper, more primal terror than
ever before.
</P>
<P>
   ``In `Hansel and Gretel' you had a sorceress shoving children
into an oven. Today the monsters are horrible male killers, like
Jason or Freddy Krueger,'' Ms. Warner said, referring to the
indefatigable figures of evil in ``Halloween'' and ``Friday the
13th.'' ``Now you wouldn't see a woman in a role like that in a
scary story. That's because they've become the softer, innocent
characters. The male predator is a far more frightening beast.''
</P>
<P>
   Some psychologists promote a genetic basis for people's varying
thresholds of fear, arguing that individuals are born either
disposed or opposed to scary things. By that theory, the growing
audience for fear stems simply from the population explosion. Other
researchers argue that family members press each other into scary
experiences as a group activity. Thus the growth in the number of
amusement parks aimed at family vacations _ places like Disney
World and Universal Studios _ derives directly from an increased
interest in scary rides.
</P>
<P>
   But only one theory about fear gets the support of most experts:
that the more people experience fear without real danger to
themselves, the more they tame its effects on the psyche. By
knowing that the danger isn't real, people can take the experience
of fear to new levels of imagination and enjoyment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why have people, ever since the beginning of recorded history,
been going to plays?'' asked Seymour Epstein, professor of
psychology at the University of Massachusetts, who studies fear and
the psyche. ``It's a simple explanation. It's because plays are so
real _ the people are so close _ that their dramatized situations
create an emotional involvement, a feeling of fear that we desire.
I've never met anyone who wasn't afraid of something. But most of
us like the way those emotions feel, or else we'd all be staying
home with the TV off.'' Epstein argues that the dramatic experience
allows people to control their distance from danger and thus enjoy
the feeling for what it is.
</P>
<P>
   The author of the best-selling ``Goosebumps'' series, R.L.
Stine, shares Epstein's view. ``Kids love being scared,'' Stine
said in a phone interview from Columbus, Ohio, his hometown and a
stop on a promotional tour for ``Nightmare Hour'' (HarperCollins),
his latest collection of scary stories. ``I think part of the
appeal is being scared and being safe at the same time. As long as
whatever's happening in the book isn't happening to them, it's
OK.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Stine freely admits that this puts him at a much less fearsome
level than novelists like Stephen King. ``The worst thing I was
ever called was `a training bra for Stephen King,''' Stine said.
``That really hurt. But the truth is, his books have to be real. By
the time you're grown up, you can handle much higher levels of
fear. All I'm writing in my stories is the literary equivalent of a
roller coaster ride for kids.''
</P>
<P>
   The roller coaster metaphor crops up frequently in talk among
fear followers, who look upon the amusement park attraction as the
definition of sensation-seeking. In Janto of Harvard worked
with a dozen terrified customers at Universal Studios' Islands of
Adventure in Orlando, Fla., to get them to overcome their fear and
ride the Incredible Hulk roller coaster at the park. By the end of
the day _ and after a pleasant stay in a warm-up room called the
Comfort Zone _ everybody rode the Hulk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm struck by the role of family pressure in riding a roller
coaster,'' Otto said. ``People who have no desire to experience
fear end up getting on a ride they don't want to, just because
everyone else is. So ridership may be up, but that doesn't mean
more people are enjoying the sensation of fear they're getting.''
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Zuckerman, professor of psychology at the University of
Delaware, believes that differences in genetic and brain
biochemistry underlie the traits of sensation-seekers. Zuckerman
says people are subjecting themselves to fears as a way of adding
to a sensation caused by the release of neurochemicals in the
brain's pleasure center. This explanation applies directly to
people who seek out experiences others find easy to avoid, like
parachuting or bungee-jumping. Simply put, a person can experience
a craving for danger, the hunger for a sensation they can feel only
rarely in a world increasingly designed to protect human life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been observed that as cars become safer, people take more
risks driving them,'' said Zuckerman, adding that it means that
``they become confident and push their fears to the limit.''
</P>
<P>
   And so it is with fear as a narrative form. With the volume and
intensity of scary stories and movies and arranged experiences
growing so rapidly, is it getter harder to satisfy the craving for
fear?
</P>
<P>
   Craven relishes the task of finding new ways to frighten the
audience. ``They see patterns, and they try to think logically
about how to escape the lurking danger. Our job is to always stay
one or two steps ahead and keep them scared.''

`HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL': SOME PARTIES ARE WORSE THAN OTHERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the ever vigilant Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan,
is truly determined to snuff out inflation aborning, then he can do
no better than to take sharpened pencil in hand, make his way to
the nearest theater showing `House on Haunted Hill'' and strike
fearlessly until the film's feeble pulse beats no more.
</P>
<P>
   ``House on Haunted Hill'' is a sorry reincarnation of the 1950s
William Castle horror film in which an eccentric millionaire,
played by Vincent Price, offered five strangers $10,000 each to
stay the night in a spooky old mansion.
</P>
<P>
   In the new version, the ante has been raised to $1 million
apiece, which is why Greenspan may choose to become involved. Even
allowing for inflation of roughly 570 percent in the 40 years since
the original opened in New York on March 12, 1959, the reward for
foolhardy courage in 1999 should come to only $57,113.47, the
Federal Reserve Bank in Minneapolis calculated Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But some things have not become devalued over the years _ words
like junk, for example. ``House on Haunted Hill'' was pronounced
junk in these pages in 1959. And it is still junk.
</P>
<P>
   All the special effects in the world cannot compensate for an
inability to generate tension, establish and sustain pace or create
any character whose survival is worth rooting for.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by William Malone from a screenplay by Dick Beebe and
bearing such well-established names as Robert Zemeckis and Joel
Silver among its producers, ``House on Haunted Hill'' is dead on
arrival. This film wastes the talents of actors like Geoffrey Rush
and Peter Gallagher in hollow roles and relies heavily on its sets
and special effects to do the work that should have been
accomplished by its director and writer.
</P>
<P>
   The new version harks back to 1931, when the towering cliffside,
seaside premises, helpfully described in the film's publicity as
having been designed ``in the monolithic style of Albert Speer, the
infamous architect of the Third Reich,'' were home to the Vanacutt
Psychiatric Institute for the Criminally Insane.
</P>
<P>
   But one night, when the evil Dr. Vanacutt was performing surgery
without benefit of anesthesia, the inmates got loose, fire raged
out of control and death ran rampant.
</P>
<P>
   Cut to the present, when the wealthy, nasty, mischievous
theme-park magnate Steven Price, played behind a mustache by Rush
in a role tailor-made for James Woods at his malevolent best,
arranges to hold the birthday party for his not-very-beloved wife
(Famke Janssen) in the old place.
</P>
<P>
   But the guests, invited to compete for a total of $5 million if
they survive till daybreak, turn out to be a surprise, all somehow
related to the old institute or to each other. It seems that the
premises are not at rest.
</P>
<P>
   The Prices and their guests are in for a long night. But the
real ordeal is reserved for the audience.
</P>
<P>

   39 STATE FARM AGENTS ACCUSE INSUROR OF DISCRIMINATION AND ABUSES
</P>
<P>
   Moving in Washington (w) and Financial (f) categories
</P>
<P>
   By Jena Heath

</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Thirty-nine State Farm agents are asking Congress
to investigate the insurance company that calls itself a good
neighbor, alleging it discriminates against minorities and abuses
policyholders and agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion of State Farm as an honest, neighborly company no
longer exists,'' the agents wrote to the Sen. John McCain, an
Arizona Republican and chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee,
among others. ``The current management of State Farm has, instead,
repeatedly abused policyholders and its independent agents for too
long in order to gain unwarranted financial advantage for itself.''
</P>
<P>
   State Farm executives denied the allegations, saying they came
from a cadre of disgruntled current and former agents, some of whom
are involved in litigation against the Bloomington-Ill.-based
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``These wild accusations are hurtful and an outright slap in the
face,'' said Harold Gray, regional vice president for the
Washington area.
</P>
<P>
   The public airing of company woes was the latest in a series of
public relations headaches for State Farm.
</P>
<P>
   In October, an Illinois jury ordered State Farm to pay $1.2
billion to policyholders. The class-action lawsuit challenged State
Farm's practice of encouraging the use of used parts in auto body
repairs.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's largest automobile insurer has also settled other
suits this year alleging it used fraudulent medical reports to
reduce or deny claims.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, four former and two current State Farm agents held a
press conference at the National Press Building to air their
grievances. Immediately afterward, State Farm executives and
lawyers held their own press conference to rebut the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Ina De Long, a former agent from Sacramento, Calif., said the
company, which insures one in five cars in the U.S., doesn't
properly train its agents. She and others also accused the company
of forcing agents to participate in ``de facto redlining program,''
according to the letter sent to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials heatedly denied the allegation, saying State
Farm has never refused to write a policy based on race or where a
person lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely not,'' Gray said. ``It never happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim Brunner, the company's general counsel, said State Farm
handles 33,000 claims daily and 15 million claims each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big job and our people do it very well,'' he said. ``We
really try hard.''

IT'S THE END OF HOLLYWOOD AS WE KNEW IT 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(Eds: For use Monday, Nov. 1 only. Fact boxes at bottom.) &HT;    By DAVID KRONKE 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   Three of the century's top media personalities are stars of two
documentaries premiering tonight and, befitting their prestige and
talents, they make for resonant subjects of non-fiction films.
</P>
<P>
   On PBS, ``American Masters: Hitchcock, Selznick and the End of
Hollywood'' explores the unlikely alliance of Hollywood's most
hands-on mogul and his singular auteur. The documentary follows the
karmically coupled careers of David O. Selznick, the only producer
to win back-to-back best-picture Oscars _ for ``Gone With the
Wind'' and ``Rebecca'' _ and Alfred Hitchcock, the man who directed
(and subsequently disparaged) the second of those movies, only to
eclipse his boss in terms of power and prestige.
</P>
<P>
   As ``American Masters,'' written and directed by Michael Epstein
and urgently narrated by Gene Hackman, makes clear, Selznick was
born into privilege _ he was ``told to live beyond (his) means,'' _
and used his position ruthlessly.
</P>
<P>
   He married Irene Mayer, daughter of the head of MGM, yet
copulated freely with whomever he fancied. His former secretary
offers an amusing anecdote in which she rebuffed his advances, then
docilely sat to take dictation for one of the copious memos he
issued.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock _ whose 100th birthday was recently observed _ was, on
the other hand, a man of modest and conservative origins who
initially took a job designing title cards for silent films before
making his mark in England as an exemplary filmmaker. When he came
to America to work for Selznick _ their first collaboration was
``Rebecca,'' which won Selznick his second Oscar (at the tender age
of 39). However Hitchcock, as he would be throughout his career,
was snubbed for the best director award by the motion picture
academy, and the filmmaker was quickly disenchanted by his boss's
tentacles-on method of working.
</P>
<P>
   Selznick _ representative of the Hollywood executive-heavy
mind-set _ is more or less vilified, while Hitchcock's
ground-breaking methods are championed in the film: The director
emerges relatively unscathed by the studio system, free to pursue
his personal muses. In the meantime, the egomaniacal Selznick
withers away into irrelevance and obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   Their numerous clashes are compellingly and amusingly depicted,
and Richard Einhorn's music underscores the resonance of their
saga. &QL; 
____
</P>
<P>
   Howard Cosell, like Hitchcock, was a maverick, in his case in
the realm of sports broadcasting. ``Howard Cosell: Telling It Like
It Is'' depicts Cosell's rise from humble but bored union-law
attorney to play-by-play man for Little League games to announcer
for some of the major sporting events of the '60s and '70s.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most sportscasters _ and, coincidentally, like NBC's Jim
Gray, who's currently being excoriated for his pointed interview
with disgraced should-be Hall-of-Famer Pete Rose during the World
Series _ Cosell insisted on content over style in his work and at
times suffered greatly for it.
</P>
<P>
   He was a rare, major champion for racial equality in sports but
was brought down for what was perceived as a racial slur during a
``Monday Night Football'' broadcast. In his defense, Cosell is
shown using the same alleged racial epithet _ monkey, which he
insisted was a fond moniker that he used to address his own
grandchildren _ on a white athlete a decade before the
controversial incident.
</P>
<P>
   The special both celebrates and pokes fun at Cosell's unique
delivery _ Billy Crystal describes it as, `a very smart man
scolding you with a bad sinus condition''; Woody Allen imagines
being forced to make love to him when ``everything he said had that
sense of event and crisis to it.'' (In Allen's satire ``Bananas,''
the filmmaker amusingly used Cosell to do play-by-play of a coup in
a Latin American country and later during a lovemaking scene.)
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, it was Cosell's fierce intelligence, integrity and
sense of drama that made ``Monday Night Football'' must-see TV for
many viewers, including myself. The primary shortcoming of this
documentary, however, is its paucity of clips _ sans voice-over,
that is _ depicting Cosell and Muhammad Ali's inspired and
legendary comedy-team chemistry. &QL;

was dubbed ``The World's LargestOutdoor Cocktail Party'' because
the atmosphere was festive and the game competitive. The atmosphere
still is festive, but the competition isn't what it used to be.
Georgia has won only once in the 1990s after owning the Gators in
the Vince Dooley era (17-7-1). Georgia fans keep going to the game
because of the golf and parties, but the losing is getting old.
Georgia again will be the underdog against the Gators. We talk to

 By RICK MARIN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's been said that every nation has the government
it deserves. To which a corollary might be added: Every city gets
the night life it deserves. In the New York of 1999, we're getting
it in stores.
</P>
<P>
   The party spot of the moment is not a velvet-roped club, an
unopened restaurant or an obscure downtown gallery. It's a store.
Almost every night of the week, it seems, at one of the city's
high-end retail outlets, drinks are being dispensed in the handbag
section and hors d'oeuvres are being passed over glass display
cases as fluorescent-lighted guests mill among overpriced
merchandise and wonder if the people named on the invitation as the
hosts will bother to show up.
</P>
<P>
   Are we having fun yet?
</P>
<P>
   The Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center held a charity party
at the new Lalique boutique on Madison Avenue. Stream, a clothing
store and tea salon, was unveiled in SoHo. A painfully hip magazine
called Fidget was introduced on the ground floor of Henri Bendel.
Bergdorf Goodman celebrated Daniel Boulud's new cookbook, and
Manhattan File feted ``the men of Hollywood East'' at Rene Lezard.
</P>
<P>
   That was just last week.
</P>
<P>
   Some are over-the-top blowouts that announce yet another new
store's fabulous arrival; others have little to do with the store
itself, beyond its convenience as a place to have a party. Two
weeks ago, Sephora invited 10,000 close personal friends to the
cosmetics and perfume debut of its Web site and its superstore in
Rockefeller Center, and rewarded the guests who bothered to sign in
with $100 gift certificates. Coach celebrated its brand-new branch
at 57th and Madison Avenue. All three classes of Armani _ Giorgio,
Emporio, and Exchange _ opened their doors to celebrities and the
people who need to party with them.
</P>
<P>
   During Emporio's party for a music Web site called Launch.com at
its store on Fifth Avenue at 16th Street two weeks ago, a passing
youth took in the velvet rope, the security guards and the thumping
beat and said, ``What club is this?'' In the VIP section inside,
D'Angelo received his entourage and Russell Simmons demanded a
bottle of Champagne.
</P>
<P>
   You can tell the Armani people are pros at this, because they
know enough to turn the lights down. After the New York premiere of
``Mansfield Park'' on Oct. 18, Miramax held a smallish dinner party
on the second floor of Giorgio Armani's Madison Avenue store. The
clothes had been moved out and the walls draped in white.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're going to make it look like a gallery, why not just
have it in a gallery?'' asked Brian Lipton, the managing editor of
DNR, the men's-wear trade paper, and a store-party regular, as he
nibbled little chocolate things. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The reason is synergy, cross-promotion, added value, whatever
you want to call it _ no matter how tenuous the connection between
the product being celebrated and the store that provides the
setting. In the case of ``Mansfield Park,'' Alessandro Nivola, one
of the stars, is a regular wearer of Armani clothes. Which is also
how Armani was able to wrangle music stars like Wyclef Jean to its
A/X jeans auction last week and D'Angelo to Emporio.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Boulud had his book party at Bergdorf's because ``we
share a common clientele,'' said Georgette Farkas, who handles
special events for Boulud restaurant, Daniel. ``Haute couture and
haute cuisine.'' Plus Bergdorf's sells Boulud's Private Stock
caviar.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the Rene Lezard-Manhattan File party on Thursday
night, so jammed the doorkeepers were turning people away, the
store buys advertising in the magazine and the magazine was
bringing a good-looking crowd to the store.
</P>
<P>
   Manhattan File had supplied the stars on the guest list, its
``men of Hollywood East'' _ attractions like Grant Show, Woody
Harrelson and Frank Whalley's pompadour. Stars and social
luminaries are a key component of the successful store party. Their
names ``above the title,'' as they say in Hollywood West, draw
press coverage and A-list guests beyond a retailer's regular client
base of non-boldface shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   Inviting the media and masses to help inaugurate Coach's
flagship store two weeks ago were Alek Wek (model), Tiffany Dubin
(socialite), Angie Harmon (``Law and Order''), James Danziger
(gallery owner), Chilli (of TLC) and Derek Jeter (Derek Jeter).
</P>
<P>
   The party was orchestrated by the public-relations firm of
Loving &AMP; Weintraub, which also placed a premiere party for the
television show ``Spin City'' at the Brooks Brothers store on Fifth
Avenue. For Coach, the company invited 500 people and put the
paparazzi inside the front door to snap notable entrances. A bar
offering chardonnay, Champagne or Poland Spring was set up in the
Coach Pet section of the basement. (Never red wine, to protect the
merchandise from spills.) Mark Ronson, the de rigueur store-party
disk jockey, had been advertised on the invitation, but it was his
younger sister, Samantha, behind the wheels of steel, spinning
``Songs in the Key of Life,'' David Bowie and other vinyl pressed
before she was born.
</P>
<P>
   One guest pronounced the throng ``very 10021,'' referring to the
ZIP code. The tall, severely glamorous Ms. Harmon didn't seem quite
sure why she was there. ``I think it's a wonderful event!'' she
said as her handlers hustled through the throng. Jeter was
otherwise occupied, at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's not so surprising that retailers in this shopaholic
age would compete for media and consumer attention with bigger and
splashier opening ceremonies. Sephora, the Paris-based chain of
beauty emporiums, spent about $350,000 on the opening night for its
21,000 square feet of lipstick and perfume in Rockefeller Center,
said John Schwartz, whose company, EventQuest, organized the party.
They flew in stilt walkers from the Ivory Coast, Siberian throat
singers, chanting Tibetan nuns and Christie Turlington. The
basement ceiling was literally vibrating. ``That's deliberate,''
said Howard Meitiner, the president and chief executive of
Sephora's American and Asian division.
</P>
<P>
   The manager of the Mehr and Sher Ali Ensemble, a troupe of
Pakistani sufi singers and drummers, said drily, ``This is our
first retail gig.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the global-tribal theme, the hors d'oeuvres changed
with each different nationality of music and entertainment. Male
and female models wearing nothing but loincloths were posed like
statuary on every floor. John Galliano himself was body-painting
other nearly naked nymphs. ``It's got a bit of a disco
atmosphere,'' said Meitiner. The Studio 54 flavor was undercut by
the scarcity of drink trays and the fact that all the lights were
on. That, however, was deliberate.
</P>
<P>
   As Schwartz explained: ``It's all about showcasing the product.
Our focus was to accessorize and accent the store itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Liu, of ABC's ``The View,'' offered the most succinct
description of the madness around her. ``It's like Disney World!''
she exclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   Except that Disney doesn't pay guests $100 to take the ride.
</P>
<P>
   Freebies are hard currency among store partygoers.
Gift-certificate graft and goodie bags go a long way with underpaid
assistants from the worlds of fashion, the media and public
relations who crowd these events. ``Another baby T!'' exclaimed
Courtney Forrest, a publicist, on her way out of Rene Lezard.
Relaxation CDs are big; Ms. Forrest said she'd gotten them at two
different store parties in two days. An Hermes party in September
gave away a Kelly bag.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Store parties may be packed, but curiously, few revelers admit
to enjoying them. Luigi Carruba, a fashion editor from Canada,
pronounced the phenomenon ``a bit pathetic really.'' He had been at
Stream in SoHo and trekked uptown to Bendel's party for Fidget, a
fashion-design magazine filled with photos of commercial washing
machines and men's clothing superimposed on European skyscrapers.
``They all look the same, yet they're all trying to be different,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   This at a party where a very tall man was walking around in a
blue bunny suit and silver platform shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the sweating guests at Lalique _ an Upper East Side
crowd that included Alexandra Lind and Somers White, young women
about town, as well as a few surgically enhanced older socialites _
professed their boredom with or disdain for what one called the
``crass commercialism'' of retail partying. But none wanted their
names to be used; they didn't want to be cut from the guest lists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in an extremely acquisitive society,'' said a
model-tall Lauren Bacall lookalike decked out in a few major
acquisitions herself. ``People would rather look at beautiful
things than at other people.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, even the beautiful _ or at least extremely expensive _
things can seem cheapened by the party environment. Burly security
muscle wired with Secret Service-style earpieces kept an eye on
Lalique's breakable, stealable baubles.
</P>
<P>
   For all the complaining, what draws people to store parties is
the same thing that draws them to any kind of party. As Scott
Drevnig, who is finishing up his MBA at New York University,
shouted over the crush of genetically advantaged humanity at Rene
Lezard, ``I'm looking for a job and a date.''

   NEW YORK _ Bob Saks is particular about his socks. They are made
of cashmere, and when he sends them to the cleaners, he expects
them to be de-pilled, de-linted, ironed flat and folded in tissue.
If there's one fuzzy ball clinging to them, he will send them back.
The same goes for his silk and cashmere boxer shorts, and his
Wrangler jeans, which he wants to be starched so heavily they will
stand on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Saks, an entrepreneur whose family helped found Saks Fifth
Avenue, equates good dry cleaning with a perfect dinner, which in
his case would include caviar, a Kobe steak from Japan and a bottle
of Chateau Petrus. ``I was born, my dear, to be a connoisseur,''
said Saks, 59. ``Everything must be perfect. It doesn't matter if
it's steak or socks.''
</P>
<P>
   There is only one cleaner for Saks: John Mahdessian, the owner
of Madame Paulette at 1255 Second Ave., who charges $9 to wash and
press a man's dress shirt, far more than average cleaners, but
Mahdessian stands ready to go the extra mile _ like removing all
the buttons for $1 apiece to prevent them from cracking during
pressing, then sewing them back on.
</P>
<P>
   Day and night, Mahdessian carries a cell phone with a special
hot-line number for clients with cleaning emergencies. A Park
Avenue matron called recently, asking him to rush over to pick up
all her bed linens. The job: wash and iron the sheets and return
them within three hours so the housekeeper could remake the beds
before her shift ended. ``God forbid she touched the bedding,''
Mahdessian said jokingly about the lady of the house.
</P>
<P>
   For a price (generally, sky high), Mahdessian boasts that Madame
Paulette, which was founded by his father in 1959, can clean
anything: the most complicated dress (sequins, silk and velvet),
which will be taken apart, cleaned and sewn back together; men's
suits, which leave without a ripple in the lining and stuffed with
so much tissue paper they virtually walk on their own, and the
grubbiest Keds sneakers, which can be brought back to pure white.
</P>
<P>
   The monthly bills of regular customers, each of whom is assigned
a service agent to fill requests for spot removal or to deliver dry
cleaning to the airport to make a flight, run from $500 to $6,000.
</P>
<P>
   Nora Ephron, who sends items from the Upper West Side to
Mahdessian, sounded a bit embarrassed by her enthusiasm for his
services. ``It's very exciting, in the dry-cleaning end of
things,'' she said of a special slow-bleaching process, which
turned a delicate silk blouse of hers ``from that sad yellow back
to white.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to say I don't send that much there,'' she said.
``But the truth is, they sent me a baseball cap'' with a Madame
Paulette logo. ``And I thought, `Uh-oh, I must be the biggest
customer.' I must be a good enough customer to get a baseball
cap.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahdessian, 34, who wears loud silk shirts and professes not to
know the difference between Armani and Gucci, can nonetheless tell
you when Anna Wintour is back from the Paris fashion shows, as he
did a couple of weeks ago, indicating a silver-gray silk Gucci
evening dress that Ms. Wintour, Vogue's editor in chief, had sent
for cleaning. It hung at Madame Paulette's Long Island City plant,
where the actual work is done by a staff of 70. Nearby was a
custom-made suit belonging to Steven Spielberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Michael Jackson is in town this week,'' said
Mahdessian, a spirited name-dropper. ``If he is, he just got
here.'' Otherwise, Mahdessian would know of his arrival, because
the singer always has his clothes picked up from his hotel, where
he stays under a pseudonym, on his first day in the city,
Mahdessian said.
</P>
<P>
   Mahdessian, who was born in Queens, is a fast talker who can
explain precisely the chemical actions of a wide variety of
cleaning agents. Among his customers, he listed a who's who of New
Yorkers from fashion, publishing and entertainment. His own social
life has benefited from helping these people look starched and
pressed. In the past couple of weeks alone, he has been invited to
black-tie dinners at the Asia Society, the Racquet and Tennis Club
and the Rainbow Room, for the $1,000-a-plate Night of Stars
sponsored by Fashion Group International.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, Mahdessian said, customers trying to get into a co-op
or to get their children into private school ask him to introduce
them to other customers on the appropriate boards.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Seitz, the executive director of the Neighborhood Cleaners
Association International, says that of the 325 dry cleaners in
Manhattan, those at the high end, who promise specialized service,
are thriving. Other fancy cleaners with devoted customers and high
prices include Hallak at 1232 Second Ave. (65th Street) and Jeeves
of Belgravia at 39 E. 65th St., where seamstresses remove and sew
back 30,000 buttons a year, the owner said.
</P>
<P>
   The obsession of affluent New Yorkers with their cleaning knows
few bounds. Mahdessian spoke of households in which every sheet,
every pillow case and every napkin is sent out. He mentioned one
customer, a television celebrity, who had Mahdessian come to his
town house and measure his closets to determine precisely how to
fold his linens. The actor wanted his sheets, which cost $4,000 a
set, to be wrapped voluminously in tissue, so that when they were
unfolded on the bed, there would be no creases.
</P>
<P>
   David Gest, a music producer who is a Madame Paulette customer,
understands this finickiness. ``When you buy fine clothes, a Brioni
suit, sport jackets or cashmere sweaters, you don't want to see
that you wear it once and it comes back totally opposite of the way
you bought it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Saks of the cashmere socks agreed. ``I don't like anything to
look worn,'' he said. ``It has to look brand-new.'' Saks once paid
Madame Paulette $100 to clean a white Gilligan hat that he had
bought for $10 or $15. ``I said, `John, I don't care how much it
costs, you need to get this white _ not just white, but like it was
never worn,''' Saks recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Mahdessian sighed. There are times he thinks his clients'
obsessions are overboard. But he never turns down a request. ``Who
am I to say, `Why don't you buy a new one'?'' he said.

   NEW YORK _ Under a canopy of honey locusts and magnolia trees in
an amber Sunday evening glow, a bevy of young women in long skirts
and sensible shoes gather for a round-up of the weekend's events.
This collegial scene, so familiar on the Barnard College and
Columbia University campuses for decades, is now transposed against
a new one down the hill past the stately campus gates.
</P>
<P>
   For a change, there is life on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   People are strolling, eating at French restaurants spilling out
onto the sidewalk, lounging in cafes a few steps down from street
level, climbing to rooftops to sip beer or joining friends at a
pub. An area that was once thought of as a night-life wasteland has
become, if not exactly hip, at least pretty lively.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's definitely a lot more people out on the streets, just
hanging out,'' said Jessica A. Casey, 27, a Columbia student whose
curly blond hair fell over her organic chemistry textbook on a
recent evening as she sipped a soda at Nussbaum &AMP; Wu Bakery, on
Broadway at 113th Street. ``It seems a lot nicer and cleaner, and
more conducive to student life.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, the 10 blocks south of the Columbia and
Barnard campuses _ from 116th to 106th Streets, between Broadway
and Amsterdam Avenue _ have undergone a transformation. At least a
dozen new restaurants and bars have opened in the last two years
alone, some of them designed to attract undergraduates, but many
catering to an older, more sophisticated crowd of Upper West Siders
ambling north for their nights out. As a result, there's a dynamic
convergence of baby strollers and textbook-toting teen-agers,
longtime residents and bespectacled graduate students, all making
their way to a once-desolate stretch of town.
</P>
<P>
   The neighborhood, comprising a chunk of Morningside Heights,
even has a new nickname: SoHa, for South of Harlem. It's an obvious
echo of SoHo, intended to evoke hip downtown areas, but it's also
somewhat tongue-in-cheek, said Andrew Lapitsky, the owner of Nacho
Mamma's, a nouveau Mexican restaurant on Broadway near 112th
Street, with large glass doors, hip-hop and disco on the sound
system and an impressive selection of micro-brews.
</P>
<P>
   Lapitsky and his business partner, Joshua Mandel, who own a
nightclub in SoHo called 23 Watts (formerly Chaos), opened Nacho
Mamma's in May at the request of Columbia University, their
landlord, which asked them to give the restaurant a distinctly
downtown feel. (The original Nacho Mamma's, a few blocks farther
south on Broadway, burned a few years ago.)
</P>
<P>
   Columbia has ushered in many of the neighborhood's changes by
selecting new businesses for the many buildings it owns on the
basis of the character they would impart. Several new restaurants _
Nussbaum &AMP; Wu; Nacho Mamma's; Le Monde, a classical spacious French
restaurant with sidewalk seating, and Deluxe, a diner with a retro
esthetic _ were handpicked by college officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, we're not trying to make it a college town,'' said Bill
Scott, the deputy vice president for institutional real estate for
Columbia. ``We're trying to anchor it very much in the Upper West
Side of New York. We're tying to keep it along the lines of what it
was, just make it livelier.''
</P>
<P>
   The name SoHa was originally used for just one thing: a bar,
SoHa, which opened in October 1997 on Amsterdam Avenue near 108th
Street, and was one of the first indicators of change. The
Goth-inspired decor, including chandeliers, floppy couches on split
levels and a red pool table perpetually surrounded by men in
goatees, is a striking counterpoint to the brightly lighted sports
bars that have long been a mainstay of the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   SoHa is one of several businesses along Amsterdam Avenue between
108th and 110th Streets that have been opened in the last two years
by Matt Olds, an entrepreneur from the Upper East Side. Among his
holdings are Sophia's Bistro, serving inexpensive Italian fare;
Saints, an elegant gay and lesbian bar with booths and couches, and
Desperados, a takeout burrito stand painted in robust primary
colors. His latest venture, Dalia's, is a Spanish tapas restaurant
with warm decor and soft lighting.
</P>
<P>
   In a review in The New York Times in September, Eric Asimov
described it as the type of bohemian refuge that the neighborhood
has lacked.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to create a hip alternative to downtown,'' said
Susanne Cipolla, who manages all of Olds' establishments. ``Casual,
hip, young, downtown-type places.''
</P>
<P>
   Some are unconvinced by the change. ``There are good places to
go if I want to unwind,'' said Gregory Alm, 27, a graduate student
at Teachers' College at Columbia who was sipping a Guinness at SoHa
on a recent Sunday night. ``But if I was earnestly intent on going
out and having fun, I'd still go downtown.''
</P>
<P>
   Although many neighborhood residents share this sentiment, many
also concede that the array of options for their nights in is
impressive. And some of the new establishments have taken advantage
of the more homebound, erudite impulses of the uptown set. Global
Inc., a three-month-old periodical store on Broadway near 113th
Street that boasts more than 5,000 magazine titles and 250
newspapers, is one example.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street, Caffe Taci, a trattoria open for almost five
years, offers an open-mike opera night three times a week. Opera
students from neighboring music schools sing over the din of the
espresso machine and academic chatter. On a recent Wednesday night,
Scott Bearden, 32, a graduate of the Manhattan School of Music,
sang an aria from Verdi's ``Rigoletto.'' He has lived in the
neighborhood for four years. ``It used to be that Morningside
Heights was a little sketchy,'' he said. ``But now, it's kind of
like this part of town has been accepted.''

BIG YEAR FOR MARIJUANA GROWERS IN MENDOCINO COUNTY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MIKE GENIELLA   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa, Calif.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UKIAH, Calif. _ Mendocino County retains its dubious title of
being the top marijuana-producing county in California, with drug
agents and growers agreeing that this year's bumper crop is setting
records.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's growing everywhere,'' said Sgt. Rusty Noe of the
Mendocino County sheriff's office.
</P>
<P>
   As the annual harvest winds down, local and state pot-hunting
teams say they've yanked about 102,000 plants, most of them mature,
from Mendocino marijuana gardens, the most ever seized locally. The
plants represent more than one-third of the entire volume of
marijuana confiscated statewide under the state's annual Campaign
Against Marijuana Planting program.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Lockyer, the California attorney general, estimated that
the amount of pot confiscated statewide by CAMP teams was worth
nearly $1 billion wholesale, the largest amount of the illicit cash
crop ever diverted from the streets. Using the state formula,
Mendocino County's share of the confiscated pot would be valued at
more than $300 million.
</P>
<P>
   But local authorities concede, and some pot growers happily
concur, that despite the state effort there's more marijuana than
ever heading for the underground marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Noe, who heads the Mendocino marijuana eradication unit, said
this year has been the best yet in terms of the number of mature
plants seized before their prized marijuana buds could be
harvested.
</P>
<P>
   Noe said, however, that the amount pales in comparison to what
is growing in countless backwoods nooks and crannies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just a lot of dope growing out there. We couldn't
possibly get to all of it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A northern Mendocino County pot grower, just one of a cadre of
so-called backwoods ``mom and pop'' growers who rely on their cash
crops for extra income, said Thursday that the state effort
``hardly made a dent.''
</P>
<P>
   The grower, who refused to be identified, said this year's crop
would allow him to go on a winter vacation south of the border.
``We're just like any other grower. We've got the crop in, now it's
time to take a break,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Noe said it was true that small growers were seldom the focus of
eradication efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've just had too many large-scale, commercial-type
operations that have come to dominate marijuana cultivation in
recent years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said large-scale operators deliberately use public lands,
corporate timberlands or large ranch holdings in an effort to avoid
forfeiture of their own property if caught growing. At the state
level, about 60 percent of all the pot plants seized were found
growing on public lands.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say the commercial-style operations represent a
serious danger to the public because the illicit plantations often
are watched over by armed guards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have any real violent confrontations this year in
Mendocino County as we have had in the past, but the potential is
always there,'' Noe said.

 &HT;    Florida-Georgia lost its excitement? Not with SEC title on line
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ With Florida holding an 8-1 edge in games
played this decade, there have been suggestions that some of the
passion last been lost in the annual border war between Georgia and
Florida, which has been contested by the St. John's River since
1933.
</P>
<P>
   Don't tell that to Freddy Jones, the ticket manager at Georgia.
For today's nationally televised 88th meeting, Jones sold his
40,000 tickets faster than you could say ``Lindsay Scott.'' In
fact, Georgia refunded 6,000 ticket orders, a record for this
decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you kidding me?'' Jones said when asked if some of the
life had been drained from the World's Largest Outdoor Cocktail
Party. ``Our people are more excited than ever. After beating them
two years ago (37-17), we think we see the light at the end of the
tunnel. They can't wait to get down there.''
</P>
<P>
   Others have suggested that because of Florida's rivalries with
Tennessee and Florida State, which usually have national
championship implications, the Gators don't get up to play Georgia
the way they used to.
</P>
<P>
   Florida coach Steve Spurrier doesn't buy it. Georgia knocked him
out of an SEC championship as a player in 1966. Before he arrived
as coach in 1990, the Bulldogs inflicted a lot of pain on the
Gators. That's something, said Spurrier, you never forget.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe if you started following this game in 1992 you'd think
it's not that big a deal,'' Spurrier said. ``But history shows that
for us to win the SEC championship, we have to beat Georgia. That
makes it a real big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Still others say the tenor of the game has changed because the
city of Jacksonville has grown up. Mike Bianchi, a columnist for
the Florida-Times Union, points out that a decade ago Florida had
only two pro sports franchises. Now it has nine, including the
Jacksonville Jaguars of the NFL. Georgia-Florida used to be this
town's Super Bowl. Now, Jacksonvile has the muscle to bid for a
real Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   But don't tell that to the owners of all those RVs parked around
Alltel Stadium. Some of them have been here since Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can have pro football,'' said Jack Stewart of Macon as he
flipped a rack of ribs on his home-made grill. ``Our whole fall is
built around this trip. That will never change.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. Maybe not. The current contract between the schools and
the city of Jacksonville runs though the 2002 game. Next year
negotiations will begin on an extension. Florida has made it clear
that it wants to keep its home games in Jacksonville. Georgia
athletics director Vince Dooley is keeping his options open.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the renovations to the stadium and the surrounding area,
it's been a very pleasant experience except, of course, for the
wins and losses,'' said Dooley. ``But from the perspective of the
Georgia people, we want to make sure that the game remains special.
You can't ignore the pro influence. We can't allow it to become
just another event on the calendar.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the last contract renewal, Dooley conducted a large
survey of the Georgia alumni. That group was split 50-50 over
keeping the game in Jacksonville or bringing it back to campus.
That survey, however, took place during a seven-game losing streak
to Florida and before new coach Jim Donnan led the Bulldogs to 19
wins in the past two years, including Georgia's only victory over
the Gators in this decade. Dooley concedes that the results might
be different if the survey were taken now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't get a mandate then,'' said Dooley. ``Given the
excitement generated the past few years, the Georgia people might
feel differently.''
</P>
<P>
   One guy who does have a mandate, however, is Georgia coach Jim
Donnan. In three seasons he has quickly caught on to what this game
means. Beating Florida in 1997 gave his program a huge shot of
credibility with the Georgia fans, who had endured the longest
losing streak ever to the Gators.
</P>
<P>
   Donnan said it is clear what the Georgia people want when they
arrive each year in Jacksonville: A chance to win on a consistent
basis with the SEC East title on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like where our program is. In my mind, we're in the elite of
the SEC. We just haven't won the East,'' said Donnan. ``To do that,
you have to be a Top 5 team and we haven't been that. Overall,
we've got a chance to do something. But you've got to go out and do
it on the field. There comes a time when you have to get over the
hump.''

 &HT;    Pastor-ized: Minister's skills yield heavenly results
 &HT;    By Mark Fisher
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TROY, Ohio _ He's the genial pastor winemaker of Miami County,
but right now, he's standing in the middle of his back yard,
frowning, rain pelting his cap, his thumb and forefinger stroking
his chin.
</P>
<P>
   There's no deep, ecclesiastical debate going on in the mind of
this Episcopalian rector. Mel Schlachter is trying to decide
whether to put his newly crushed red wine blend into an oak barrel
or a 60-gallon plastic container. He's weighing the advantages and
disadvantages. The plastic wins. That decision behind him,
Schlachter moves on, directing a dozen friends in their various
duties.
</P>
<P>
   Twice a year, Schlachter's back yard and basement near downtown
Troy turn into winemaking heaven. He and a group of wine-enthusiast
friends gather to help with the crush of the current year's grapes
and to bottle the fermented fruits of last year's labors. The
friends take home full bottles of wine for their troubles.
</P>
<P>
   Schlachter _ who with his wife, Barbara, is co-rector of Troy's
Trinity Episcopal Church _ has been doing this for nearly a quarter
century, first in the state of New York State and for the past
dozen years in Troy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do this because I love wine and I love social occasions,''
Schlachter said.
</P>
<P>
   That becomes immediately apparent early in the festivities, when
a couple arrives and stands for a moment empty-handed while others
are holding half-full glasses. ``Hello! You need some wine to
gladden the heart and strengthen the spirit,'' Schlachter says,
directing them to glasses and opened wine bottles.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, though, the mood turns a bit more task-oriented, and
Schlachter starts giving orders, asking folks to retrieve buckets,
barrels and bags of sugar. Volunteers begin pouring containers of
fermenting grape ``must'' _ the juice, skins, stems and seeds of
crushed grapes _ into the top of a small wooden press. The
burgundy-colored liquid pours out the bottom into buckets and is
transferred to the 60-gallon plastic container for further
fermentation. The bucket brigade is halting at first, and there are
a few minor spills, but then the volunteers develop a choreographed
rhythm, and only a few drops find the garage floor.
</P>
<P>
   One of the helpers, Corie Schweser of Troy, looks at her
purple-stained hands still wet with wine and sneaks a finger into
her mouth. ``I've been doing this for six or seven years, and it's
a lot of fun,'' Schweser said. ``There's something about making
your own wine. And it makes for great conversation with the rest of
my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, when she opens a bottle of wine that she played a part
in creating, the wine tastes just a little better, Schweser said,
noting how her cuticles were stained a bit darker than the rest of
her hand.
</P>
<P>
   Schlachter, overseeing others working the press, catches some of
the partially fermented juice in a glass, tastes it and nods his
head approvingly. Then he offers it around. The liquid _ a blend of
grape varietals Chancellor, Chelois and Leyon-Maillot _ tastes
sweet and tart at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Schlachter brings in most of his grapes and juice from New York
State, but has also made wine from Ohio grapes. Contest judges
think he's doing a pretty good job of it: Schlachter has won a slew
of awards for his wines, including a blue ribbon and a red
(second-place) ribbon for two wines he entered into the 1999 Ohio
State Fair, and a third-place finish in a national American Wine
Society wine judging last November.
</P>
<P>
   On this day, the winemaker has decided against bottling last
year's cabernet sauvignon (''It needs more time in barrel to

THE CONCERTO AS A METAPHOR FOR THE INDIVIDUAL IN SOCIETY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Western classical concerto _ that symphonic confrontation
between soloist and ensemble _ is fraught with tension, even in its
origins. The word is derived from the Latin ``concertare,'' meaning
to contend, to debate; but it is also related to the identical
Italian word, meaning to arrange, to agree. The musical form itself
seems to inhabit the contested realm between these two meanings:
proclaiming contention, anticipating agreement, encompassing both.
Indeed, the concerto, as it came to be known after the 17th
century, is a musical drama about the nature of the concert in its
broadest sense. It explores what it might mean to play together _
in concert _ and what it might mean to separate oneself and become
a soloist.
</P>
<P>
   This makes the concerto a powerfully suggestive form. It focuses
on the relationship between an individual voice and its surrounding
society. What are their agreements and what are their differences?
Does the ensemble reject the renegade or lure him back? Does the
soloist battle opponents or seduce them? How is community made and
how does it survive? Although this might seem to have little to do
with Beethoven's ``Emperor'' Concerto, Schumann's Piano Concerto or
Alban Berg's Violin Concerto, these questions actually lie at their
very heart.
</P>
<P>
   The resonance of such questions may also help account for the
increasing attention being given this musical form. There has been
an epic-length anthology edited by Neal Zaslaw, ``Mozart's Piano
Concertos'' (University of Michigan Press, 1997), a suggestive and
wide-ranging study, ``Beethoven's Concertos,'' by Leon Plantinga
(Norton, 1999), and, most recently, ``Concerto Conversations,'' by
Joseph Kerman (Harvard University Press).
</P>
<P>
   Kerman, Professor Emeritus of Music at the University of
California at Berkeley, brings to the discussion of concertos his
distinctive vision of American musicology, taking account of its
adventures, its limitations and its excesses. He combines varied
styles of criticism without losing his enchantment with the music
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Though originally delivered as the Charles Eliot Norton Lectures
at Harvard University for 1997-98, these lectures have the
informality of the seminar room. Kerman is relaxed, learned and
deliberately unsystematic, probing here, redefining there,
supplementing the music _ some of which is available on an attached
CD _ with vivid analytic description that at its best (as in a
discussion of Mozart's D Minor Piano Concerto, K. 466) can change
how we hear.
</P>
<P>
   But in the midst of the unassuming temper of Kerman's lectures
(which often do call for a more systematic exposition and more
accommodation for the lay reader), there is also an attempt to
revise our understanding of the concerto and rescue it from purely
formal description. While the concerto has long been characterized
as a form dramatizing ``concertare'' _ contention and agreement _
Kerman argues that it is far more vigorous in its expressive
ambitions, and the relationships between its protagonists are far
more varied.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to suggest that there is something intricately human in
the interactions between orchestra and soloist. They may seem to
oppose each other with drastically different attitudes (as in some
Vivaldi concertos), but they can also develop a shared vision, in
which each takes material from the other (as in parts of Elgar's
Cello Concerto). The soloist might be militantly assertive
(Beethoven's ``Emperor''), but warring forces might eventually
coalesce (as in Berg's heart-rending Violin Concerto).
</P>
<P>
   The challenge, Kerman suggests, is ``to develop a criticism that
can engage with the diverse qualities of concerto relationships.''
One possibility, he argues, is to ``personify'' the soloist and
orchestra, imagining them as, for example, survivor, victim,
mourner, lover, critic, educator.
</P>
<P>
   In Saint-Saens' Cello Concerto, for example, the cello becomes
an eavesdropper; in the finale of Brahms' Second Piano Concerto,
the soloist becomes a tease; at the beginning of Berg's violin
concerto, the soloist is an acolyte and the orchestra a mentor.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the concerto becomes a piece of program music about
human relationships. This notion would have been dismissed out of
hand during previous decades, when musicology aimed for Olympian
detachment. But now that younger musicologists are dissecting
compositions to reveal political programs, gender preoccupations
and ideological declarations, Kerman is simply offering alternative
programs.
</P>
<P>
   And despite the risks of literalness, Kerman may be right. The
concerto is one of the most popular of musical forms partly because
of such programs. Consider the concerto's rivals: the symphony
presents itself as a grand system of sound, making a public
statement; the sonata is a finely wrought expression of a
particular individual's vision; the aria is an expression of
private sentiments. The concerto, though, stands at the crossroads
of the public and the private.
</P>
<P>
   The listener identifies with the soloist, and hears not an
abstract drama but a personal one: the drama of a private
individual negotiating his role in a tension-riddled public world,
a situation not unlike the listener's, sitting in the concert hall.
</P>
<P>
   And the object of contention is the relationship between each
individual and the surrounding society. This is one reason the
concerto was so central to 19th-century musical culture: the
middle-class citizen and modern public society were just taking
shape. And now, when the relationship is even more uncertain and
unsettling, so are the concertos. Elliott Carter's 1965 Piano
Concerto, for example, focuses on the impossibility of any simple
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   But Kerman's lectures serve as a reminder to pay close attention
to the ways in which soloists and ensembles interact. In the
music's confrontations, seductions and conversations an image of
the social world takes shape _ as it once was, as it now is, or as
we would wish it to be.

 &HT;    Body-snatching leads to Georgia law
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It was 35 years ago that the case of the Hapeville,
Ga., body snatcher horrified metro Atlantans, led to a revision of
Georgia's burglary law and, eventually, a statute making the theft
of a corpse a felony.
</P>
<P>
   Hapeville Police Chief Leverett Butts was a cadet in police
academy at the time. As this Halloween weekend approached, he
recalled the case with all the dark humor of a veteran cop.
</P>
<P>
   The body in question was that of a former convict named Charles
Samuel Lowe, who died at the hands of a friend who had posted his
bail on a DUI charge. When Lowe didn't show up for court, the
friend was told to bring him in or forfeit the bond. The friend had
only to drive to the home of his estranged wife, where he found
Lowe in the act of kissing her. He killed Lowe with a single
shotgun blast.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe was duly embalmed and laid out in a blue shirt and grey
trousers in a casket at the Paul T. Donehoo Funeral Home on Central
Avenue, where newspaper clippings of the event are still preserved.
</P>
<P>
   During the viewing for the deceased, Butts said, a man who was
obviously inebriated showed up in a pickup, announced he was a dear
friend of Lowe's from prison, and began wailing about how much he
``loved'' poor Charles. Lowe's family, uncomfortable over the man's
extravagant grief, called police to remove him.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime the following morning, someone cut through a screen
door on the porch of the funeral home, took Lowe out of his casket
and made off with him. The thief also made off with the registry
book from the viewing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they got up that morning the body was gone,'' said Butts.
``The poor funeral director had to call the family and tell them
that it didn't look as though Charles was going to be at his
funeral.'' The funeral, scheduled for later that day, was cancelled
and a memorial service was held the following day. When the funeral
director called police, Butts said, ``they thought he was joking.
He had a hell of a time convincing them somebody had stolen a
body.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the oddest thing ever to happen here,'' then-chief G.B.
Pearson told the Atlanta Journal. Even Lewis Slaton, Fulton County
District Attorney at the time, called it ``virtually without
precedent.''
</P>
<P>
   The body disappeared on Monday, Aug. 30, 1965. On that Friday, a
farmer found Lowe's remains, considerably the worse for wear, in a
pine thicket in Jasper County, laid out with the hands folded on
the chest. Evidence indicated the corpse had been brought there in
the bed of a pickup. Police tracked down Lowe's prison buddy, Butts
said, and then found themselves in a quandary.
</P>
<P>
   Slaton and detectives, Butts said, ``tried to figure out how
much a body was worth in real terms and, considering the chemicals
and so forth, they couldn't come up with more than $1.98, which of
course couldn't qualify under the burglary law as it stood.'' They
finally had to charge the miscreant with removing a body without a
license and cutting the screen on the porch, both misdemeanors.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, Butts said, Georgia code said ``A person commits
the offense of burglary when, without authority and with the intent
to commit a felony therein, he enters or remains within the
dwelling house of another ....'' Within a year, the words ``or
theft'' were added after the word felony.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, the Legislature passed a law flatly making it a felony
to steal a corpse.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's our little footnote to fame,'' Butts chuckled.

WHEN A MEMPHIS STATION WAS ALL-FEMALE, ALL THE TIME  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Tenn., Ala.)   By RALPH BLUMENTHAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In October 1955 Memphis woke up to a radical new
sound: not the twangy rhythm-and-blues of an awkward young singer
named Elvis Presley, who was already on his way to stardom, but the
dulcet voices of WHER, the nation's first ``all girl'' radio
station.
</P>
<P>
   For the next 16 years, in a cramped pink studio in the third of
a new chain of motor hotels called Holiday Inn, the ``jockettes''
of WHER made history. They ran the control board, sold air time,
spun platters of Patti Page, Sinatra and Henry Mancini, read the
news and interviewed celebrities, winning the hearts of listeners,
scoring high in the ratings and pointing the way to a new era of
opportunities for women in broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   Their success, however, became an often-overlooked footnote in
the celebrated legend of their founding father _ yes, a he _ Sam
Phillips, the recording pioneer whose Sun Records first put Elvis
on wax.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Phillips, 76, and 14 of the 40 or so WHER women,
including his wife, Becky, reunited at the Museum of Television and
Radio in Manhattan for the release of a two-part documentary on the
station, ``WHER: 1,000 Beautiful Watts.'' The program was produced
for National Public Radio by Davia Nelson and Nikki Silva, radio
documentarians known as the Kitchen Sisters, from recordings of the
station and hundreds of hours of interviews.
</P>
<P>
   The first 22-minute segment, part of a yearlong series called
``Lost and Found Sound,'' was broadcast Friday, the 44th
anniversary of the station's debut, during ``All Things
Considered,'' and a second part of 12 minutes is scheduled for
Friday (to be broadcast in New York City on AM 820 at 4:30 p.m.,
and on FM 93.9 at 7:30 p.m.) The programs are also available on the
NPR Web site (www.npr.org).
</P>
<P>
   Phillips, who with his wife left Muscle Shoals, Ala., in 1945
for Memphis, where he founded the Memphis Recording Service (``We
Record Anything, Anywhere, Anytime''), said that the idea of an
all-female station was born of competitive necessity in a glutted
radio market. ``My primary intention was to do something that was
different,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm crazy,'' said Phillips, whose clean-cut 1950s look has
given way to a leonine chestnut mane, Mephistophelean beard and
tinted glasses. ``I'm like a little mouse who sees a hole and jumps
in there.''
</P>
<P>
   He reached out first for Dotty Abbott, an experienced radio
woman from Memphis then working in Phoenix, to be his station
manager: `` `Dotty,' I said, `I just got a crazy idea. If you don't
want the job, swear to keep it secret or I'll punish you in some
horrible way.''' She signed on and others quickly followed. But, he
said, ``each girl thought she was the only one being hired.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Abbott died years ago, but others like Donna Barlett shared
their recollections. ``Some of us were married and some weren't,''
she said. ``Some were separated. I was not living with my husband
then. I had three girls and two boys, and I'd take them to the
lobby and say, `Sit!'''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips' early backer was the Memphis developer Kemmons Wilson,
who put up $25,000 and provided studio space in one of his new
Holiday Inns. Phillips raised $35,000 more by selling his recording
contract with Elvis to RCA, a move Wilson encouraged, saying:
``Hell, he can't even sing, man. Take the money!''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson also set out the format. ``Don't play anything but love
music,'' he advised. ``A man singing to a woman and a woman singing
to a man.''
</P>
<P>
   Denise Howard, who as a 22-year-old design graduate applied for
the job of decorating the studio, recalled cooling her heels for
six hours while Phillips remained closeted. Finally a young man
came out and, feeling sorry for her, drawled, ``Honey, can I get
you a Pepsi?'' It was Elvis.
</P>
<P>
   The women played to their image, calling the studio the Doll's
Den, hanging nylons, bras and underwear in the equipment room, and
announcing ``the news from abroad.'' There were the inevitable
gaffes, as when one announcer declared, ``Marital law has been
declared in the Congo.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1971 the station took on new call letters, WWEE, and a new
talk format, spelling the end of an era. Phillips said that he
didn't think he was part of any revolution at the time, but that it
was a revolution nevertheless. ``We were too lazy to march,'' he
said. ``But we marched through the airwaves.''

 &HT;    When an old religion meets pop culture
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Popular culture is under a spell.
</P>
<P>
   On prime-time television, hip suburban high school student
``Sabrina, the Teenage Witch'' struggles with supernatural talents.
Armed with special vampire slayer powers and a fabulous wardrobe,
``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' dispatches snarling vampires _ and
manages to go to college and have a social life, too. And the older
_ but only slightly _ Halliwell sisters are ``Charmed'' and
charming as they keep body and soul together with the aid of a
Wiccan ``Book of Shadows.''
</P>
<P>
   On the large screen, ``The Blair Witch Project,'' ``Practical
Magic'' and ``The Craft'' pull viewers into movie theaters.
</P>
<P>
   And in the bookstores, the wildly popular ``Harry Potter''
series about a wizard-in-training is practically levitating off the
shelves.
</P>
<P>
   From Shakespeare's ``Macbeth'' to the '60s TV sitcom
``Bewitched,'' writers have found audiences for tales of
witchcraft, magic and the occult. But their popularity reflects
particular currents in American culture in the '90s _ a connection
to the earth, a desire to see women empowered and a belief that
worship can be personal rather than communal _ says Thomas
Robisheaux, an associate professor of history at Duke who teaches a
course on magic and witchcraft. ``If they didn't, no one would
watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Modern witchcraft, or Wicca, has become increasingly visible for
just those reasons. A nature-based religion that claims roots in
pre-Christian Europe, Wicca sees the divine as a creative life
force in everything, and recognizes both masculine and feminine
deities. Wiccans put great store in magic and the supernatural, but
see apparently miraculous occurrences as the result of getting in
touch with the cosmic life force.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's dissonant. It's different. It's powerful. It's outside
the mainstream,'' says one of Robisheaux's colleagues, Wesley Kort,
a Duke professor whose focus is religion and modern culture. ``It's
not necessarily evil anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   On TV, witchcraft can be a force for good, says Nancy Eiesland,
an assistant professor of religion at Emory University. The sisters
of ``Charmed'' and Buffy _ like the heavenly stars of ``Touched by
an Angel'' _ often protect the weak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think of them not unlike I think of the cop shows and rescue
shows that were so popular a couple of years ago,'' she said.
``They show that somebody's watching out for us. They fill that
need for a little security.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially for teenage girls, who keep the programs near the top
of teen ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Nikki Stroub, 17, of Woodstock, is a big fan of the television
series ``Buffy'' and ``Sabrina.'' She's even read about the Salem
witch trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just seem really neat and different,'' Nikki said of the
supernatural TV characters. ``They have superpowers that we don't
have in real life. Most of it's good and sometimes they use it for
bad. But in the end, they triumph over evil.''
</P>
<P>
   At Llewellyn Publications, a New Age publishing house, the 1998
how-to manual ``Teen Witch: Wicca for a New Generation'' scored the
highest number of pre-publication orders of any Llewellyn book,
said publicity manager Lisa Braun. To date, about 80,000 copies
have been sold. The book claims to give ``practical advice for
dealing with everyday life in a magickal way ... from homework and
crabby teachers to parents and dating.''

   Because of popular demand, the Grove of the Unicorn, an Atlanta
Wiccan coven, recently began offering classes for teenagers _ with
parental consent required. Most of the six students are ``of
Catholic or Baptist background, and they're all very dedicated,''
said high priestess Lady Galadriel, whose given name is Jodi
Yokell. ``They've been doing their homework, and they show up every
week.'' The students declined to be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta now has more than 20 Wiccan _ or closely related _
groups, and many other ``solitary witches'' who construct their own
rituals. Nationally, a survey being conducted by the Covenant of
the Goddess, an international group of 200 covens, has turned up
50,000 witches, according to Galadriel, who, as of Sunday, will be
its head, or first officer. But, she said, the numbers could reach
into the millions.
</P>
<P>
   Raised Southern Baptist, solitary witch Ginger Wages, an Atlanta
technical writer, said she appreciated Wicca's reverence for the
earth. ``People who are green, who really care about the
environment _ rain forests being depleted, old woods being cut down
_ are happy to find a faith system that empowers and even hallows
those concerns,'' said Wages, who runs an online newsletter for
witches and pagans called the Magickal Cauldron
(www.magickalcauldron.com).
</P>
<P>
   Christian groups are aware of witchcraft's increasing appeal.
The October issue of Charisma, a magazine for Pentecostal and
charismatic Christians, features a report on ``Witchcraft in
America.'' It includes articles such as ``Inside the Gates of
Darkness'' and ``Going Online With the Devil,'' and suggests
readers pray for the subjects of the report, that they find their
way back to God.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rev. Rob Arp, an assistant pastor at Atlanta's Mount
Paran Church of God, said he doesn't believe most teens are
seriously interested in witchcraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it's just people acting out, people riding the wave
of something that's counterculture and crazy,'' said Arp, a former
youth pastor. He is concerned, though, about those ``few pockets''
of kids that delve into witchcraft seriously. ``They're going to
open themselves up to larger spiritual forces that will hinder
their life,'' he said, but noted parents shouldn't overreact: ``As
long as there's love and support in the family, the kids are going
to be fine.'' ``We're living in a society with more religious
options than ever before,'' says Harry Partin, associate religion
professor emeritus at Duke. ``A century or so ago, there were very
few. You were a Christian or a Jew _ or known as the town atheist.
You really didn't have any other options. Now people do.''

 &HT;    Master of Main Street kept regular hours and `never missed a
meal'
 &HT;    Eds:Embargoed for Sunday, Oct. 31.
 &HT;    By Catherine Fox
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HIS HOMETOWN
</P>
<P>
   Born poor in New York City, Norman Rockwell lived in New
Rochelle, N.Y., for 18 years before moving with his family to
Arlington, Vt., in 1939. In Arlington and in Stockbridge, Mass.,
where he lived just off Main Street for the last 25 years of his
life, he found the sweet, small-town environment that most closely
resembled the world as he wanted to see it. Living there, he could
say, ``I showed the America I knew and observed. ...''
</P>
<P>
   HIS STYLE
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell's subject matter isn't the only source of his great
appeal. People love his work because, as Atlantan Louis Siegel
said, ``I always know what it is.'' Rockwell was a master of the
telegraphic style. His message had to be immediately understood to
succeed in the world of magazines and advertising, and making it so
required not only a naturalistic style but also intense planning.
</P>
<P>
   Creating the composition was like directing a play. He had to
set the stage, pose characters with telling gesture and make sure
that all the props and details supported without overwhelming the
story. He made several studies, including a charcoal drawing, which
he transferred to canvas for the final image, which would be
reproduced at a smaller scale for magazines and calendars.
</P>
<P>
   HIS MODELS
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell drew his models from the communities in which he lived.
Claire Williams was 29 when she was invited to his studio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very nervous,'' recalled the silver-haired Stockbridge
native, who volunteers at the Norman Rockwell Museum. ``I went to
his studio at 2 p.m. A photographer was there. He asked me to pose
with different gestures. He would sketch, and the photographer
would shoot. I was done in a few minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   HIS MUSEUM
</P>
<P>
   The Rockwell Museum was built by popular demand. It began in
1969 when Rockwell lent some works for display at the Old Corner
House in Stockbridge to help raise funds to save the building.
Attendance grew by word of mouth until this de facto museum became
too small for the crowds. In 1993, the museum, which now holds more
than 570 paintings and drawings and a large archive, moved to its
own building on a bucolic 36-acre site overlooking the Housatonic
River Valley.
</P>
<P>
   HIS STUDIO
</P>
<P>
   Moved from his back yard in Stockbridge to the Rockwell Museum
grounds, the studio is an airy structure with lots of windows. The
easel sits in the center of the room, a bouquet of clean brushes at
the ready. The meticulous artist always cleaned his brushes at the
end of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell drew sustenance, even compositional motifs, from the
great artists of the past. He stocked his studio with more than 500
volumes as well as drawers of prints and reproductions of works by
artists as diverse as Michelangelo and Miro. Visitors might be
surprised to find reproductions of Picasso and Jackson Pollock
taped to the easel.
</P>
<P>
   His orderly work habits are more in keeping with his vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never missed a meal,'' he once said. ``I used to think I
painted with my stomach instead of my soul and brain. I've always
kept regular hours, eaten three meals a day. It used to worry me
something terrible.''

 &HT;    Climbing `villagers' cradled among the branches
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Oct. 31
 &HT;    By Martha Ezzard
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I never knew a giant tree could rock a baby to sleep, much less
me. But it did.
</P>
<P>
   Yep. I slept in a tree. A 125-foot-tall tulip poplar. Her name
is Rachel. Sleeping in a tree isn't something to do when you need
your rest, but it's something unforgettable.
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't alone. We were a tree ``village'' of five, each with
different reasons for being there, just as each would have
different responses to the night in Rachel's arms.
</P>
<P>
   My tree camping experience all started when
</P>
<P>
   I decided to follow Henry David Thoreau's 19th-century advice to
learn the value of a tree. Thoreau said you can't know a tree until
you have stopped to listen to it.
</P>
<P>
   I'd heard about tree climbers who spent the nights in trees, but
it wasn't until I ran into Genevieve Summers that I knew I wanted
to try it. Summers runs a North Georgia recreational and
educational tree-climbing outfit called Dancing with Trees. She
recently sold her chimney sweep business, Moonlight Sweeps, to
devote full time to her climbing program.
</P>
<P>
   On eight wooded acres in Banks County, a half-hour northeast of
Gainesville, the 48-year-old mother of two ties knots in thick
ropes with the dexterity of a seasoned sailor and swirls through
branches with the grace of a dancer.
</P>
<P>
   My first tree-climbing experience was in Tonya, a 60-year-old
white oak, who, Summers says, just named herself one evening when
Summers was sitting silently at her trunk. Whispered her name in
Summers' ear.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the heat that caused the beads of sweat to pop out on
my forehead the first time I wriggled into a harness attached to
Tonya and stepped into the foot loop secured to my ``hot rope.''
Hiking on firm ground is more my milieu.
</P>
<P>
   But Summers, who's spent as much time in trees and on rooftops
as on the ground, assured me that she had made tree climbers from
ages 4 to 76 love swinging in the trees. The only requirements are
good health and no fear of heights. I could meet those. But what I
loved was her promise that I'd never look at a tree, pick up a leaf
or listen to the wind the same way again.
</P>
<P>
   Summers can keep up with the best of male climbers, but for her,
tree climbing is more spiritual experience than sport. ``Trees,
like women, are nurturers, life givers,'' she says. She has
fashioned the country's only climbing merit badge for the northeast
Georgia Girl Scouts.
</P>
<P>
   After my initial lesson, she declared that I was ready for a
night in the trees. We agreed to put together a ``tree village,''
inviting Tom Watson, an experienced climber and arborist, and
Journal-Constitution photographer W.A. Bridges Jr., a novice
climber like me.
</P>
<P>
   The date was set for the end of September, a Sunday night when
the harvest moon would be glowing.
</P>
<P>
   But when we arrived, clouds loomed in the sky. We tried not to
notice. Before the climb, Summers insisted that we share our
expectations for the night _ with one another and with the tree.
Watson talked about being a carefree boy again. Bridges said he
already felt that Tonya was his soul mate. I recalled a professor
who said that we give trees attributes that are too large for our
minds to grasp. I wanted to try to understand that.
</P>
<P>
   Then, up we went, each at our own speed with our own thoughts. I
was wet with sweat when I finally sank into my tree boat. It's an
insecure feeling at first. We'd all seen a few flashes of lightning
on our way up and told one another that the storm was far away. I
settled in, feeling snug and cozy as a soft wind made the leaves
swish against one another with rippling sounds you can't hear from
below.
</P>
<P>
   I adjusted my headlight and pulled out a book of poems I'd
stashed in my stuff-sack, ``A Timbered Choir'' by Wendell Berry.
There was a low roll of thunder in the distance. A light rain began
to fall. Summers said we should put our air mattresses on top of us
to keep from getting wet _ warning that we'd have to bail out if
the thunder got any louder.
</P>
<P>
   For a while I felt like a snail, listening to the raindrops fall
on my shell. Then, a loud thunderclap and a driving rain, and
Summers gave the call to evacuate.
</P>
<P>
   I was grateful for two things _ that I hadn't taken off my shoes
and that I knew where my gloves were. Without rubber-ribbed gloves,
rope burn is inevitable. I already had a blister from not wearing
them when I started up. In minutes, my tree boat felt like a
leaking boat.
</P>
<P>
   I was sitting in a puddle, feet dangling over the side, tossing
my air mattress, sleeping bag and pillow to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leave everything else,'' Summers yelled. ``Get down fast and
get away from the tree.'' Lightning flashed. Rain pounded. We
obeyed.
</P>
<P>
   I made the inevitable beginner's mistake, clutching the moving
knot as I descended, whizzing past Summers like George of the
Jungle. Fortunately, her safety loop stopped me, so that I had only
a bruised arm to show for my mistake.
</P>
<P>
   It was midnight when we gathered for hot tea in Summers'
kitchen, vowing to try it again. Watson said it was the first time
he'd ever had to bail out in a rainstorm in his 12 years of
climbing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next time,'' Summers said, looking at Bridges and me, ``I
think you're ready for Rachel.'' Rachel, Summers' 150-year-old
friend, was named for environmentalist Rachel Carson, author of
``Silent Spring.''
</P>
<P>
   Yikes, I thought. Rachel's lowest branch is higher than we'd
just climbed.
</P>
<P>
   We gathered again on a clear October night more than a week
later. We were joined by Summers' neighbor, 24-year-old Melissa
Parham, an experienced climber eager to spend her first night in a
tree.
</P>
<P>
   Summers offered me ``the penthouse,'' but I deferred to Bridges,
knowing that photos from Rachel's crown would be important. I knew
it was the right decision for other reasons when I tackled the
single-rope technique, necessary because Rachel is too tall for
Summers' double ropes to reach the ground. Shinning up and moving
plastic ascenders seemed to require more upper-body strength. As I
struggled upward, wondering why my aerobics and weightlifting
rituals weren't paying off, I thought about my South Georgia
grandmother who decreed that girls weren't supposed to perspire.
</P>
<P>
   I stopped to rest along the way and to admire the ``resurrection
fern'' growing in Rachel's tree ``forks.'' This delicate plant can
look totally brown and dead, then spring to life in vibrant green
with the least bit of moisture.
</P>
<P>
   Once we settled in, the evening light accentuated Rachel's
angular black limbs, forming dark borders around the leaf patterns
that seemed pasted onto the sky.
</P>
<P>
   We all stopped talking, awed by the night's wonders. Summers
heard a pileated woodpecker. Her scarf, hung to one side of her
tree boat, reminded me of the prayer cloths I'd once seen tied to
trees in Soviet Georgia. An old Soviet woman told me in broken
English that the wind sent their messages to heaven.
</P>
<P>
   I read the Wendell Berry poem I'd started when the storm hit us
in Tonya:
</P>
<P>
   What do the tall trees say
</P>
<P>
   to the late havocs in the sky? They sigh.
</P>
<P>
   The air moves and they sway.
</P>
<P>
   When the breeze on the hill
</P>
<P>
   Is still, then they stand still.
</P>
<P>
   They wait.
</P>
<P>
   They have no fear.
</P>
<P>
   Their fate
</P>
<P>
   is faith. Birdsong
</P>
<P>
   Is all they've wanted all along.
</P>
<P>
   I dozed off for a while and awoke chilled. There's no way to zip
a sleeping bag in the tree, because of the rope attached to the
harness belt. I pulled the corners of the sleeping bag around me
until I was cozy again and gazed up at the autumn sky, hiding all
but a sliver of the moon. I decided to write my granddaughters a
letter about sleeping in a tree boat. Adults might think I was
crazy. But little children wouldn't. The girls, ages 5 and 6, would
squeal appropriately about my new friend, Rachel, and my adventure.
</P>
<P>
   Then I wrote a poem of my own.
</P>
<P>
   You cannot know the sky until you have seen it from a leafy
branch.
</P>
<P>
   You cannot know the night until you have listened to the leaves.
</P>
<P>
   You cannot know acorns until they have rained softly around you.
</P>
<P>
   You cannot be free until you have slept where birds take flight.
</P>
<P>
   You cannot know a tree until you have trusted your life to her
arms.
</P>
<P>
   When morning came, Summers' friend Parham was up first. She said
she'd never slept better, descended 80 feet in record time and
headed through the woods for her red pickup truck and a regular
workday at the Clarkesville Florist.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of us laid back for a leisurely breakfast: snack boxes
with cloth napkins, a bottle of orange juice made with spring
water, a fresh croissant with slices of cheese and, naturally, a
banana.
</P>
<P>
   Bridges swung around with his camera, taking pictures of all of
us stretching and eating in the morning sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   Then Summers put one last challenge to me. ``Wanna climb up to
that black cord?'' she asked, pointing to a marker about 35 feet
above. ``That's the 100-foot mark.''
</P>
<P>
   Why not, I thought, forgetting for a moment that my thighs and
arms were already sore.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a great climb and a spectacular view of the horizon.
The tree understory below, splotched with early fall reds and
yellows, was accented by the tip of an old persimmon tree laden
with orange fruit.
</P>
<P>
   When we finally descended, Summers had us share our thoughts as
we stood around Rachel's 13-foot trunk. Our comments reflected the
diverse life experiences we brought to the tree climb. Summers
talked about trees as equal partners in her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we climb a tree, we climb into ourselves,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bridges said Rachel connected him with African spiritual symbols
of peace. In the branches of the tree, he said, we were all
balanced and equal, and when we descended, we could do it only by
way of a single trunk.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the unity of the human race,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   I said the night was being a child again_a magical, unspoiled
adventure.
</P>
<P>
   Watson talked about the scientific miracle of fall, the way the
trees are silent on the outside but operating like giant fountains
on the inside, taking nutrients and water from root to branches. He
talked about how Rachel is shutting down the food supply to each
leaf now and storing it for spring.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Watson made a simple, eloquent observation: ``The strength
of Rachel just reminds me of faith. Faith in God.''

 &HT;    A better `View' of American opera
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Oct. 31.
 &HT;    By Judith Green
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ In the century that American composers have been
writing opera, only ``Porgy and Bess,'' the self-described American
folk opera, has broken the American opera jinx _ by doing an end
run around the opera house.
</P>
<P>
   But this month, Lyric Opera of Chicago may have found a work,
written as grand opera, to make the case for American opera without
apologies.
</P>
<P>
   It's ``A View From the Bridge,'' by William Bolcom, based on
Arthur Miller's tragedy set in the Italian immigrant community
around the Brooklyn docks in the 1950s. ``View'' opened Oct. 9 and
runs through Friday. (If you're traveling that way, call
312-332-2244 for tickets.)
</P>
<P>
   There are, of course, American operas aplenty. But after ``Porgy
and Bess,'' how many spring to the mind of the average operagoer,
reared on a diet of Verdi, Puccini, Strauss and Bizet? Even
``Porgy'' doesn't get performed as often as it ought, because of
the gigantic cast and budget it requires. At least, though, its
music has made its way into our cultural consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   The forgotten works
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a melodic and quintessentially American work such as
``Susannah'' (1955) got its first Metropolitan Opera production
only last season. Other companies, though more committed to
recognizing their country's music, produce American opera almost as
a special event. Though some, such as Chicago Lyric, have a proud
track record of new American work, one still thinks of American
operas as the exception rather than the rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vanessa'' (Samuel Barber) and ``Regina'' (Marc Blitzstein) and
``The Crucible'' (Robert Ward) get produced with some regularity.
But whatever happened to ``Harriet, the Woman Called Moses'' after
its premiere by Virginia Opera in 1983? Or Barber's ``Antony and
Cleopatra,'' which opened the new Met house in Lincoln Center in
1966? Or Anthony Davis' ``Amistad,'' premiered the same year (1997)
as Steven Spielberg's film? Or Bolcom's own ``McTeague,'' premiered
in 1992 in Chicago? The New Orleans Opera will produce ``A
Streetcar Named Desire'' by Andre Previn (premiered by San
Francisco Opera in 1998) later this season, but you'd expect that,
with its French Quarter setting and history. It's not high on any
other company's list.
</P>
<P>
   This happens to a lot of very good operas: They're produced
once, to great fanfare, and then relegated to the shelf. This is
partly because hoopla, grant money and press attention go with the
words ``world premiere,'' after which the opera is ... just another
opera. And it's partly because new works need first-class singers
willing to commit the time and labor to learn unfamiliar and often
difficult music.
</P>
<P>
   Renee Fleming, for instance, was willing to sing ``Streetcar''
in San Francisco and for the premiere cast recording, but the role
of Blanche DuBois (and many others like it) is too complex for many
singers to tackle without a guarantee that it'll enhance their
careers.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds for success
</P>
<P>
   ``View'' may change that. Bolcom _ who has enormous composing
credits but is best known as the accompanist for his wife, Joan
Morris, in her delightful explorations of American
turn-of-the-century popular song _ has written an accessible and
moving work.
</P>
<P>
   There is probably too much in it of the swoopy alleged
``melodic'' lines that infest contemporary opera, but it also has
wonderful sections of lyric display. He plays with the tune ``Paper
Doll,'' giving it a Neapolitan flavor as an immigrant, fresh off
the boat, sings it to prove his love for things American. There are
blues and jazz colorations in the musical lines and the
orchestration. And there's at least one gloriously singable song,
``New York Lights,'' that any tenor will be happy to add to a
recital or use as an encore.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago Lyric's splendid production has a set of the Red Hook
community dwarfed by the iron stanchions of the Brooklyn Bridge. It
looks like the carceri (prison) etchings made by Piranesi in 1750,
and it's backed by gritty black-and-white photographs from the
1950s by the queen of projections, Tony Award winner Wendall K.
Harrington.
</P>
<P>
   The exceptional cast includes baritone Kim Josephson as Eddie
Carbone, the longshoreman in love with his niece; soprano Catherine
Malfitano as his wife; tenor Gregory Turay and bass Mark McCrory as
the illegal immigrant Sicilian cousins they take in; and baritone
Dale Travis as Eddie's friend Louie. But while they're good,
they're not so celestial that you can't envision anyone else
singing these parts.
</P>
<P>
   The opera needs some revision, which I suspect it won't get, but
at its heart it has most of what good opera needs right from the
get-go: drama and music of equal strength, and a level of vocal
artistry that's not out of the reach of all but the most expensive
houses. It may not be the great American opera that everyone's been
waiting for, but it ought to have a life after the premiere.

 &HT;    NEA program has design on community
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Oct. 31
 &HT;    By Catherine Fox
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The National Endowment for the Arts has been a lightning rod in
the culture wars for the past decade. But even as sparks flew, it
has been sponsoring programs with which any side would be hard
pressed to take issue.
</P>
<P>
   Its design program, for instance, organizes the Mayors'
Institute for City Design, which brings together government leaders
and professionals to discuss such things as how schools can be
catalysts for community development. Your Town, the rural-oriented
initiative, helps smaller communities deal with such issues as
sprawl, historic preservation and land use. The NEA will host a
colloquium in February to discuss how to recycle old, failing
suburban malls.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Robbins, the new director of design, has taken to the road
to increase awareness of the NEA programs and design in general.
</P>
<P>
   ``Design is not just a coat of paint, but a problem-solving
process,'' says the New York native, on leave from Ohio State
University, where he teaches architecture. ``I want to develop
awareness about design and its centrality in culture.''
</P>

   Robbins was in Atlanta recently to promote the design programs
and get the word out about one called New Public Works. This
program has a $500,000 budget to fund design competitions for
projects _ public buildings and planning as well as graphic,
landscape and industrial design. The hope is that the projects will
not only help individual communities but also serve as role models
for others.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins plans to use his position to broker design talent with
federal agencies such as Housing and Urban Development,
Environmental Protection Agency and General Services
Administration, which are, he says, among the largest consumers of
design in the country. This work enhances the environment and
supports the design profession as well. He knows personally what
NEA support can mean.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NEA gave me one of my first grants,'' says the
artist-architect. ``In a way, I feel by taking this job, I'm giving
back.''

   &QR;  LANDSCAPE AWARDS: The landscape architecture firm Hughes,
Good, O'Leary &AMP; Ryan won a merit award from the American Society of
Landscape Architects for the way it integrated building and wooded
site for the United Parcel Services corporate headquarters in Sandy
Springs. A 10-mile stretch of the Chattahoochee River is the
subject of a CD-ROM that won a merit award, too. Sponsored by the
Atlanta Urban Resources Partnership, a consortium of federal
agencies, it includes numerous proposals for reclamation of the
land along the river. For a free copy of the CD-ROM, call
404-364-4242. Copies are limited.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Frustrated by Clinton administration end runs
around Congress via executive orders, House Republicans are
exploring ways to stifle what they believe is an improper writing
of laws via presidential directive.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the House Rules Committee recently summoned a panel
of experts to give their views on how Congress can best contend
with this presidential exercise of authority. Two GOP conservatives
are already proposing legislative limits.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the reliance on presidential declarations seems more
pronounced during periods like the current one, when the White
House is controlled by one party and Congress by the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears to me that we have encountered significant
creativity and ingenuity on the part of presidents to use executive
orders to advance their agendas when the legislative process has
proven unwilling or unable to yield the desired results,'' said
Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla., a senior member of the Rules Committee.

<P>
   President Clinton drives his GOP critics mad by achieving with
executive action what he could never accomplish through the
GOP-controlled Congress. His recent push to ban logging in some
national forests by the executive route is one example, as was his
controversial establishment of the American Heritage Rivers program
_ two initiatives despised by conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   To better control executive orders, Republican Reps. Ron Paul of
Texas and Jack Metcalf of Washington are pushing legislation that
would make it easier for Congress to legally challenge orders and
more carefully define what power the president has to issue such
edicts.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is hardly the first president to use this authority.
President Reagan frequently issued executive orders and FDR is the
all-time leader. The Emancipation Proclamation was a presidential
directive.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration chose not to testify at the Rules
Committee meeting, but Goss quoted one top White House adviser's
published thoughts on the subject: ``Stroke of the pen, law of the
land, kind of cool.''
</P>
<P>
   LOSING A FRIEND AND POLITICAL ALLY
</P>
<P>
   Moderate Southern Senate Democrats lost their best link to
bipartisan legislative solutions with the death of Sen. John
Chafee, R-R.I.
</P>
<P>
   Chafee consistently figured in attempts by Democrats like John
Breaux of Louisiana and Bob Graham of Florida to find middle-ground
solutions to vexing budget and health care issues while the more
extreme wings of both parties chose to battle it out.
</P>
<P>
   Chafee, who died Oct. 24 of heart failure, and Breaux even had a
name for their group: the centrist coalition. And Graham and Chafee
were gearing up to push the Senate to adopt the recently passed
House version of the patient bill of rights after the Senate
rejected their bipartisan version this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Many lawmakers and analysts expect the Senate to become more
polarized in Chafee's absence. ``He will be sorely missed,'' said
Graham.
</P>
<P>
   GIRL TROUBLE
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jesse Helms, that courtly and conservative Republican from
North Carolina, keeps landing in hot water lately. And it's all
because of the ladies.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Helms raised eyebrows when he made a
gratuitous reference to Monica Lewinsky during what had been a
serious Senate debate about an arms control treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Then he offended many Democrats and black lawmakers when he
cited an old dispute over the Confederate flag as one reason he
would block the ambassadorial nomination of Carol Moseley-Braun, a
former senator and black woman.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Helms angered female House members a few days ago when
he had Capitol police evict them from a hearing. The Democratic
women crashed his Foreign Relations Committee meeting to protest
his opposition to a treaty promoting women's rights.
</P>
<P>
   When Rep. Lynn Woolsey, D-Calif., who led the protest, spoke up,
Helms advised her to ``be a lady.''
</P>
<P>
   CANAL TRANSFER
</P>
<P>
   As the year-end transfer of the Panama Canal approaches, the
concerns of conservatives who have always opposed relinquishing
U.S. control are mounting.
</P>
<P>
   Their newest worry is a company with ties to the Chinese
government that has obtained leases for control of port facilities
at both ends of the canal. With backing from colleagues like
Republican Sens. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina and Jesse Helms
of North Carolina, Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., is calling on the
Clinton administration to negotiate new canal security arrangements
with the Panamanian government.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big mistake to lose control of the Panama Canal,''
said Sessions.

DILBERT AND THE GURU 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, October 31, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   `We aren't knocking Dilbert. Who would dare? But we do believe
that work can be cool. THAT WORK MATTERS.'' So begins each of the
three pocket-sized $15 books that are the latest in the oeuvre of
management guru Tom Peters.
</P>
<P>
   Each of Peters's books is organized into 50 little inspirational
chapters. All deal with the dream of escaping the powerlessness of
daily life in large organizations:
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifty ways to transform yourself from an `employee' into a
brand that shouts distinction, commitment, and passion!
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifty ways to transform your `department' into a professional
service firm whose trademarks are passion and innovation!
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifty ways to transform every `task' into a project that
matters!''
</P>
<P>
   This is indeed the polar opposite of the point of view to be
found in Dilbert, the comic strip that appears elsewhere in this
newspaper. His tie askew as a badge of inability to control even
his personal environment, Dilbert's adventures unfold each week in
a world of bureaucratic alienation. Everybody else in the strip has
a mouth, but not Dilbert _ or his cynical sidekick, Dogbert,
forever ready to deflate his master's optimism.
</P>
<P>
   Read a little closer, however, and it is possible to see Dilbert
as something of an undercover agent, a critic of widespread bad
management practices that are otherwise hard to excavate. There is
Catbert, the wicked director of human resources; Mordac, the
preventer of informations services; Manuel Delegator, who never
does anything himself; and, of course, The Boss, in thrall to the
latest corporate fad, as when he sought to use humor to defuse
mounting workplace tension over reductions in force. ``Knock,
knock,'' said The Boss. ``Who's there?'' said the hapless worker.
``Not you anymore'' came the snappy reply.
</P>
<P>
   (The Web site, www.dilbert.com, is even better. It features a
panic button. ``Panicked? Stay calm. Just select a letter, budget,
or memo and pretend you're working. This will launch a new browser
window to fool the boss. Close it and return to the Dilbert Zone.''
Read it first; the fake documents are great.)
</P>
<P>
   Dilbert has enjoyed a meteoric rise, from fewer than 100 papers
for several years after its launch in 1989 to more than 1,900 today
_ in 57 countries. Its creator, Scott Adams, born in 1957 in
Windham, N.Y., is a Berkeley MBA; he earned the degree at night
while working as a bank teller. Then he worked for Pacific Bell
until long after the strip had become a success. ``I was in a cube
at corporations for 17 years,'' he has said, ``and I'll never
forget the mornings when I'd be in a good mood, but as I approached
my cubicle I could feel my life force being drained out of my
body.''
</P>
<P>
   William Isaacs, an MIT lecturer and author of the book
``Dialogue and the Art of Thinking Together,'' says that Dilbert is
very helpful, ``in the sense that it is an outlet for cynicism. It
creates some room for people to be honest. It is a little like what
psychotherapists call `prescribing the symptom.' Once you authorize
behaving in a certain way, you make it possible not to behave that
way.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, longtime guru Tom Peters believes in going
high-diddle-diddle-up-the-middle. His books are full of CAPITAL
LETTERS, bold typefaces, and inks of many colors. Are they
relentlessly constructive? Hell yes! Do they read like a spiel by a
revival preacher? You bet! But both Peters and Dilbert are making
the same point in their very different ways. The workplace is best
when it is cooperative. Businesses cannot long flourish without the
consent of the governed.

 &HT;    Flag dispute puts S.C. governor in crossfire
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ Hoping Friday to begin dialogue on removing the
Confederate flag from the Statehouse dome, Gov. Jim Hodges instead
unfurled angry debate amid the NAACP's national tourism boycott of
South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Hodges met privately Friday with legislative, business and
university leaders at the urging of business officials who, worried
by the boycott, favor the removal of the Rebel battle flag.
</P>
<P>
   James Gallman, president of the South Carolina NAACP, said the
governor snubbed the organization by not including it in the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   But Hodges, who had earlier talked with NAACP officials, said he
plans further meetings ''with all parties concerned about the
Confederate flag.''
</P>
<P>
   Describing the flag debate as ''a complicated issue with a
number of different layers to it,'' Hodges said he came out of
Friday's meeting ''feeling that we had a very positive discussion.
. . . It's very clear to all of us that any resolution would have
to be accompanied by a sense of mutual respect from both sides on
the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   But some foes in the flag flap criticized Hodges, a first-term
Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's clearly in campaign mode,'' said Luke Byars, spokesman
for Republican Lt. Gov. Bob Peeler, a flag supporter.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina is the only state that still flies the
Confederate flag atop its Statehouse, a distinction that has
polarized Confederate heritage groups and civil rights activists in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Hodges pulled off a political upset, defeating
Republican Gov. David Beasley, who had flip-flopped on the flag
issue to the chagrin of voters on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Hodges has done little to broach the issue, sticking
by his campaign pledge that he would not actively try to bring down
the flag. Rather, he said he would sign a compromise if enacted by
the legislature.
</P>
<P>
   By convening Friday's meeting, Hodges broke the campaign
promise, said Chris Sullivan, executive director of the Southern
Heritage Association. That group worked to defeat Beasley, and it
now intends to reorganize to fight the latest initiative to bring
down the flag.
</P>
<P>
   The flag has flown from the Capitol dome since 1962. In recent
years, several legislative efforts to remove it have failed.
</P>
<P>
   As long as Republicans control the state House of
Representatives, Sullivan said he doubts flag opponents will be
able to win legislative support to bring it down. He added he
believes the NAACP's boycott will hurt those chances.
</P>
<P>
   ''If voters perceive that they are submitting to blackmail like
a boycott, they will be in a lot of trouble at the ballot box,''
Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
   Some black legislators said Hodges has dragged his feet on the
flag issue. They urged him to act forcefully, or risk black
backlash on next year's referendum on a Georgia-style education
lottery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely it's in trouble,'' said state Sen. Darrell Jackson
(D-Columbia), explaining that black ministers could urge voters to
oppose the lottery.
</P>
<P>
   ''He can't go in timidly and do a tap dance around this,''
Gallman said.
</P>
<P>
   James Bennett, a First Citizens Bank division director who has
led anti-flag efforts in the business community, expressed
confidence that the legislature will bring the flag down. ''With
the muscle of the business community behind it, I think we can get
the votes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Bob Jones III, president of Bob Jones
University, a fundamentalist school in Greenville, S.C., that
forbids interracial dating, also said it was time to consider
taking down the flag if it offended some groups.
</P>
<P>
   But in a letter published Friday in The Greenville News, Jones
said the NAACP should end its tourism boycott of the state,
scheduled to begin Jan. 1 but already prompting groups to cancel
meetings and conventions in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bible speaks against giving unnecessary offense. If the
flag, where it is, is an offense to some, their feelings should be
addressed,'' Jones wrote. ``However, first let the NAACP forego its
demands and thus unshackle the legislators to do what they should
do.''

 &HT;    A Rockwellian life: Model recalls childhood in small-town
America
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Oct. 31
 &HT;    By Catherine Fox
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``Look, Mom _ no cavities!''
</P>
<P>
   The freckled, red-haired girl with the mile-wide smile peering
out from the 1958 Crest toothpaste ad is now a fashionable
professional. Her hair, streaked just a tad with gray, is pulled
tightly away from her face. The freckles are gone. But Anne Morgan
still flashes that sparkly grin, and she fondly remembers posing
for Norman Rockwell as a grade-school student in Stockbridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time he had a studio above the grocery store on Main
Street,'' says Morgan, former High Museum of Art development
director and current development director at the Fernbank Museum of
Natural History. ``It was really fun. He always had stuff to eat.
But it seemed pretty ordinary. Practically every kid in my class
modeled for him.''
</P>
<P>
   As did the whole town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can go through the books and name all the models,'' says
Morgan, 49. ``The doctor was my doctor. My friend Scott Ingram was
the boy who discovers the Santa Claus costume in a dresser
drawer.''
</P>
<P>
   She looks back on her childhood in Stockbridge as idyllic, just
as Rockwell depicted it. ``There were some wild times there,'' she
admits, ``and it was a very unusual place, very cultured. It was
135 miles from both New York and Boston and attracted artists,
writers and musicians. But I think of that time as precious and
unreal.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell, whom she remembers as humble, self-effacing and
pigeon-toed, was a family friend. Her father, an opera singer, and
her mother, a pianist, borrowed Rockwell's white Lincoln
Continental when they toured.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ford (Motor Co.) had given Norman the car. It had these big
fins, and it was so long it didn't fit in his garage. He never
drove it,'' says Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan, who is divorced with two grown sons, moved to Atlanta in
1972. Her parents and one of her sisters live in metro Atlanta as
well. But they love to return to Stockbridge in the summers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That place has a magnetic hold on me,'' she says.

 &HT;    Once dismissed, `great narrator of American art' wins critics'
praise with national exhibit organized by Atlanta's High
 &HT;    Ed: Embargoed for Sunday, Oct. 31
 &HT;    By Catherine Fox
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ever since his first Saturday Evening Post cover appeared in
1916, Norman Rockwell has been a hit with the American public.
Despite _ or perhaps because of _ his great popularity, the art
cognoscenti dismissed him for decades, banishing the famous
illustrator to the basement of art history.
</P>
<P>
   When the High Museum of Art and the Norman Rockwell Museum at
Stockbridge, Mass., joined forces in 1994 to begin planning the
exhibit ``Norman Rockwell: Pictures for the American People,'' they
figured they had a hit in the making, but who would have imagined
that it would be au courant as well?
</P>
<P>
   Instead of brickbats, the exhibition has been showered with
nosegays _ a mention in The New York Times Magazine, an Art News
magazine cover story and a crowd at the 1998 press announcement
that included influential critics.
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell the illustrator is on the cusp of anointment as an
honest-to-goodness artist.
</P>
<P>
   The bandwagon is sagging with converts. In 1998, art historian
Robert Rosenblum wrote a mash note in Artforum, an avant-garde art
magazine. He practically asked to contribute to the show's catalog,
and he persuaded the Guggenheim Museum, where he is adjunct
curator, to book the show. When the Guggenheim deputy director Lisa
Dennison made the announcement that Rockwell was coming, she joked,
``The heavens must be falling.''
</P>
<P>
   The last stop on the two-year tour, the Manhattan venue is
preceded by the Chicago Historical Society, the Corcoran Gallery of
Art in Washington, the San Diego Museum of Art, the Phoenix Art
Museum and the Normal Rockwell Museum.
</P>
<P>
   In the exhibit's catalog, Dave Hickey, a professor at the
University of Nevada at Las Vegas, described the artist in super-
</P>
<P>
   latives. ``Rockwell is the last, best practitioner of a
tradition of social painting that began in the 17th century,'' he
wrote. ``He is the great narrator of American art.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell would have appreciated the turnabout.
</P>
<P>
   ``A student once accosted my father, and told him, `My teacher
thinks you stink,''' said son Peter Rockwell. ``Lots of people
would tell him, `I don't know much about art, but I love your
work.' He used to say, `For once, I'd like to hear that from
someone who knows about art.' He had a yearning to be recognized
with the seriousness he felt about what he was doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1894, Rockwell became an illustrator when the term was
not an art-world insult. His talent was apparent immediately: He
drew his first cover for The Saturday Evening Post at age 22. Soon
people stood in line at the newsstand to buy a copy of the Post
with a Rockwell cover, which happened 322 times over the course of
47 years.
</P>
<P>
   A mass media giant before the term was invented, Rockwell had
such an impact that, 21 years after his death, he remains more than
a household word. He is an adjective. ``Rockwell'' is shorthand for
the ``Leave It to Beaver'' innocence of small-town America, where
moms bake cookies, shopkeepers are kindly father figures and the
bluest collar workers radiate pride and dignity. Or as the
self-deprecating artist described his subjects: ``... The best
possible world, Santa down the chimney, lovely kids adoring their
kindly grandpa sort of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell is also synonymous with bedrock American values. In
1943, 25 million people ordered sets of his ``Four Freedoms,'' a
series based on a speech by President Franklin D. Roosevelt.
Rockwell sent his message in subtler ways as well. In ``Saying
Grace,'' the bustle of a diner quiets as an older woman and a young
boy bow their heads in prayer _ an image that, according to Hickey,
celebrates tolerance. Not surprisingly, Ross Perot wanted to
announce his presidential candidacy at the Norman Rockwell Museum.
(The museum declined the request.)
</P>
<P>
   Some 200,000 people annually crowd the Rockwell Museum in the
Berkshires. The visitors encompass families that like the wholesome
fare, international visitors seeking Americana and nostalgic fans
like Alvin Silva.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always liked Rockwell, even though I don't like
small-town America,'' says Silva, 47, as he took in the paintings
on view recently at the Massachusetts museum. ``At least, I didn't
like mine (Byron, Calif.). I like the sense of history, the
quaintness of New England. He draws me back to simpler times.''
</P>
<P>
   The populace and the art world parted ways on Rockwell during
the 1950s. His narrative approach seemed retrograde in the context
of the rise of abstract art. His rosy worldview seemed impossibly
naive in an increasingly dyspeptic culture, where mealtime might
resemble the tense dinners in the acerbic film ``American Beauty,''
more than the smiling clan gathered to partake of a huge
Thanksgiving turkey in ``Freedom From Want.''
</P>
<P>
   The very things that made him popular were held against him.
</P>
<P>
   The return of figurative and narrative art, as well as the
broadening of art's purview and awareness of the role of the media
in our culture, set the stage for a reappraisal. This comprehensive
exhibition, which explores both his artistry and his role in
reflecting and articulating his century, may be a timely vehicle,
and sure to arouse antithetical views.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Laurie Norton Moffat, director of the Norman
Rockwell Museum, sees him as a good-hearted version of
writer-humorist James Thurber. ``Rockwell is a painter not just of
small-town life but also of human character and foibles,'' she
said. ``His work is undergirded by his basic belief in human
decency.''
</P>
<P>
   Director Steven Spielberg, who owns 25 paintings and sits on the
museum board, told The New York Times Magazine: ``Aside from being
an astonishingly good storyteller, Rockwell spoke volumes about a
certain kind of American morality.''
</P>
<P>
   Others see it differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Norman Rockwell fits our particular moment of global
capitalism triumphant,'' Emory University history professor Michael
Bellesiles said. ``His `capitalist realism' is ... a kind of
propaganda _ images of the good life in an idealized America.''
</P>
<P>
   We are likely to discover that Rockwell is Thurber and Uncle Sam
and more. During the last decades of his career, for instance, he
plumbed the darkest side of human nature. Even a man who, as his
son said, ``liked to see the positive side of things,'' could not
avoid the ugliness of the civil rights struggles of the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he dealt with it in a Rockwellian manner.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Problem We All Live With,'' little Ruby Bridges walks
between the marshals who ensure her safety to integrate her
Louisiana school. The wall is spattered with a tomato and ugly
graffiti. But, true to form, Rockwell focuses not on the faces
distorted with hate but on the brave little heroine, the hope of
the future in pigtails, a white dress and sneakers.

 &HT;    Teens lack information about sex
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The idea of a syphilis outbreak among teenagers in
Rockdale County (GA.) shocked many Atlantans, but it came as little
surprise to teens like 15-year-old Katie Monaghan.
</P>
<P>
   A high school sophomore in Forsyth County (GA.), Katie has spent
the past year and a half as a peer educator for the AIDS service
organization AID Atlanta. She can tell you stories about classmates
who can't remember how many people they've slept with, who can't
get the birth control pill but have unprotected sex anyway, who
don't know what to do about a rash on their genitals. They come to
her because they don't know where else to go for even the most
basic information on sexual health.
</P>
<P>
   They have alternatives, but most aren't taking advantage of
them.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors can and will provide confidential services such as birth
control, pregnancy testing and treatment for sexually transmitted
diseases. So will public health clinics, and often at a lower cost.
</P>
<P>
   But many teenagers don't know about these resources. They're
having sex anyway, and getting pregnant or infected with HIV and
other STDs.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half of all high school students have had sex, and 14
percent already have had sex with four or more partners, according
to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Every year, 3
million cases of STDs and 1 million pregnancies occur among teens.
HIV/AIDS is one of the leading causes of death among teens and
young adults.
</P>
<P>
   CDC studies show that between 1991 and 1997, the number of teens
who had sex fell slightly from 54 percent to 48 percent, while the
prevalence of condom use rose from 46 percent to 57 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the studies say the number of children having sex is
going down,'' Katie said. ``But I don't believe that. There are a
lot of kids having sex. With a lot of different people.''
</P>
<P>
   A major part of the problem is teens' lack of access to health
care. Many teenagers don't know they need medical care relating to
their sexual health; those who do are worried about confidentiality
and cost.
</P>
<P>
   Many teenage girls mistakenly believe they don't yet need
gynecological exams. In truth, girls need to begin having regular
pelvic exams and Pap tests for cervical cancer as soon as they
become sexually active or when they turn 18 _ whichever comes
first.
</P>
<P>
   Girls don't necessarily have to visit a gynecologist;
pediatricians are trained to perform such services. But teenagers
often are leery.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of barriers to getting (teenage) kids to come
in to the office,'' said Dr. Karen Dewling, chief of pediatrics for
the Emory Clinic. ``They don't perceive that they need to go to a
pediatrician anymore. They feel uncomfortable in a waiting room
full of babies.''
</P>
<P>
   Pediatricians are the best health care providers for teens,
however, because of their special training in developmental issues,
Dewling emphasized.
</P>
<P>
   Many teens worry that if they ask a physician for birth control
or need treatment for an STD, the doctor will tell their parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of kids I go to school with don't feel like going to
their doctor for birth control,'' Monaghan said. ``They think their
pediatrician would turn right around and tell their parents. That
causes a lot of girls to just risk having sex without protection.''
</P>
<P>
   Physicians may legally prescribe birth control to underage
girls, and many will do so without notifying their patients'
parents, if requested. But doctors say they generally urge teens to
talk frankly with their parents.
</P>
<P>
   Cost is another barrier for kids seeking contraceptives. If
teenagers on their parents' medical insurance plans don't want
their parents to find out, they have to pay for doctors' visits and
prescriptions _ a considerable expense.
</P>
<P>
   Most public health clinics provide confidential and inexpensive
teen health services, including birth control. Many teens don't
learn this, however, until they have to visit the clinic for other
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still haven't gotten to the point where we can get young
people to take advantage of services before they become sexually
active,'' said Marie Mitchell, program manager of Teen Services at
Grady Health System. ``What brings them in for services is that
they think they're pregnant or have an STD.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent survey by the Henry J. Kaiser Family
Foundation, which researches national health care issues, nearly
half of all high school students _ including 40 percent who have
had sex _ don't know they can obtain birth control pills without a
parent's permission. Even more astonishing: 15 percent of high
schoolers who have had sex do not know they can buy condoms without
a parent's permission.
</P>
<P>
   Nor do many teens realize that the laws in many states,
including Georgia, allow minors to obtain treatment for STDs
without parental notification.
</P>
<P>
   Teenagers and doctors alike agree it's a shame that
confidentiality is such a huge issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the societal attitude toward sex, there's still a
barrier for young people to acknowledge they're going to be
sexually active and get services before they run into problems,''
Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
   While Dewling respects her patients' privacy, she does encourage
sexually active teens to tell their parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I have a teen seeking contraceptive services or STD
treatment, the first thing I say is, `How are we going to talk
about this with your parents?''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time, the kids get upset. Some cry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes them admit what they're doing,'' Dewling said. ``I'll
say, `I really think this would be a good time to tell your mom.'
We figure out what to say. They're just so relieved they're not
keeping a secret.''
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, however, sexually active teens truly can't tell
their parents, for fear of being kicked out of the house. In such
cases, Dewling recommends counseling.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Nobles, 17, of Atlanta says she's lucky to have
open-minded parents with whom she can talk about important issues.
The high school senior is angered by the thought of parents
concerned more about their children's chastity than their health.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if you can't accept that your child is having sex, you at
least should want to help them be healthy,'' Nobles said. ``Parents
should ask their children, `Are you healthy? Not just physically,
but are you emotionally healthy in this relationship?'''
</P>
<P>
   One thing parents can do is to help their children become
comfortable talking with a doctor, through regular checkups. During
such well-child visits, pediatricians try to educate adolescents
about issues ranging from puberty to smoking to sexual activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always talk to the teen one-on-one, and I tell the parents
that we talk about things that are private,'' Dewling said. ``It's
dangerous for them to feel they have no place to turn. The message
has to go to parents: Teens need to have access to their
pediatrician with a no-questions-asked mentality.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot has to be put on the parents, and I know that's hard,''
Nobles said. ``But in order to keep something like Rockdale from
happening again, parents have to be willing to do that.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Would a spoiler spoil the Bauhaus look of the Audi TT? The
designers thought so, according to a German magazine, and that is
why the sporty TT, which went on sale in the United States in May,
did not get a spoiler although Audi's own test drivers are said to
have recommended one.
</P>
<P>
   Now the auto maker has begun a voluntary safety recall of the
car, which made its debut to glowing reviews, to fix high-speed
handling problems. One of the fixes: A rear spoiler is being added.
</P>
<P>
   Dealers will install the spoilers _ which look like small,
upside-down airplan wings, and redirect the air flowing over the
car's body to force the rear end down _ on the 3,825 TTs sold in
North American since May.
</P>
<P>
   Suspension changes include new components: a larger-diameter
front stabilizer; different front and rear stabilizers on
all-wheel-drive models; a modified fron control arm, and firmer
shock absorbers.
</P>
<P>
   The company said that dealers would be able to make the changes
in mid-January except for the spoilers, which will be available
about a month later.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Clark, a spokesman for Audi of America, said the upgrades
should provide ``greater dynamic stability at the uppermost range
of the performance envelope.''
</P>
<P>
   The recall announcement on Friday by Audi of America follows an
earlier move in Germany, where two weeks ago the parent company
recalled all 40,000 TTs sold outside America for the same fixes.
</P>
<P>
   In news releases and on its Web site (www.audi.com), the company
said that ``the TT will retain its satisfying agility, while the
limits of stability will be spread over a broader range.'' It also
said, ``drivers will find the car easier to keep under control.''
</P>
<P>
   A report in the Oct. 18 issue of Der Spiegel, the German news
magazine, cited 18 accidents, including at least one fatality,
involving TTs. Der Spiegel also reported that Audi test drivers had
complained that the rear axle lifted and the car unpredictably
oversteered _ with the back end swinging out _ at speeds of about
200 kilometers an hour, or nearly 125 miles an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Der Spiegel reported that the drivers had recommended a rear
spoiler to control the lift but that designers rejected the idea,
saying the spoiler would detract from the car's look.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about that assertion, Clark said: ``During the design
process, many alternatives are considered. Some of these make it
into production and some do not, for myriad reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the recall, he said, ``There have been no reported
accidents, injuries or fatalities in North America linked to this
issue.'' The German recall was ``in response to unique driving
conditions'' of autobahns, he added, where very high speeds are
common. Also, wide disparities in traffic speeds mean that drivers
may have to swerve or change lanes while moving very fast.

 &HT;    Coca-Cola reshuffles senior management hierarchy
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Coca-Cola Co. announced Friday its first major
reorganization since M. Douglas Ivester became chairman and chief
executive officer two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Three senior executives of the Atlanta-based beverage company
were given additional responsibilities in a move to streamline the
top management and reduce the number of people reporting directly
to Ivester from 16 to six.
</P>
<P>
   While Ivester did not appoint a president and chief operating
officer, as some on Wall Street would like him to do, the new
structure is likely to please many company observers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hugely positive move for Coke,'' said John Sicher,
editor and publisher of Beverage Digest. ``It shows the depth of
their management... If I were a large Coke shareholder, I'd be
happy with this new structure.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Conway, an analyst with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said
Friday's moves indicate the company's business is stablizing around
the globe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Doug would have made the changes if it wasn't
that way,'' Conway said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the clear winners in the reorganization is Jack Stahl,
who was given overall responsibility for the company's Latin
America and Minute Maid businesses. That comes on top of his
present responsibility for Coke's North American operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives Stahl management oversight of one of the company's
biggest and most important international markets _ Latin America,''
Sicher said. Combined with North America, Stahl will oversee about
55 percent of the company's case sales of soft drinks.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts had speculated that Stahl, 46, needed more
international experience before Ivester would consider naming him
president.
</P>
<P>
   But Sicher and several other company observers said it is too
early to tell who might become the No. 2 executive, if Ivester ever
decides to have one.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Daft is another big winner, getting additional
responsibilities for Africa and the company's new Schweppes
division. Daft, 56, also will maintain his current overall
responsibility for the Middle East and Far East operations.
</P>
<P>
   The third winner is James Chestnut, the company's 49-year-old
chief financial officer. He will now oversee a number of other
non-operating areas, including global communications, human
resources, government relations, product integrity and technical
operations.
</P>
<P>
   The other three senior managers who will continue to report to
Ivester are William Casey, president of Greater Europe Group;
Charlie Frenette, chief marketing officer; and Joe Gladden, general
counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives a small collection of senior people even better
control over managing the business,'' said Marc Cohen, an analyst
with Goldman, Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   With Stahl now overseeing all of the Americas, Ralph Cooper will
become the president of the company's North American business,
reporting to Stahl. Cooper, the former head of the company's Minute
Maid operation, will be replaced by Steve Jones, who also will
report to Stahl.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Haas, current president of the Latin American operations,
also will now report to Stahl, instead of directly to Ivester.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Ware, president of the company's African business, will now
report to Daft, instead of directly to Ivester.
</P>
<P>
   Also reporting to Daft will be Sandy Allan, who was named
president of the Middle East and Far East business, and John
Farrell, head of the company's recently created Schweppes division.
Coca-Cola recently paid nearly $1 billion to buy the rights to
Cadbury Schweppes brands in 161 countries outside the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Ivester will recommend to the board that Gary
Fayard, currently vice president and controller, be appointed chief
financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   Fayard would still report to Chestnut, as he does now.
Chestnut's new title is senior vice president of operations
support.
</P>
<P>
   This was the second major management reorganization in the Coke
system in 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Schimberg, president and chief executive officer of
Coca-Cola Enterprises, the system's largest bottler, announced that
he would retire at the end of the year _ four months earlier than
expected. John Alm, the Atlanta-based company's chief operating
officer, will become president on Jan. 1. The company's chairman,
Summerfield Johnston Jr., will temporarily reassume the chief
executive spot.
</P>
<P>
   Coke shares rose 18 3/4 cents Friday to close at $59. CCE gained
43 3/4 cents to close at $25.56 1/4.

TEXAS BAPTISTS REACHING OUT TO HISPANICS
</HEADLINE>

By JAIME JORDAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The face of Texas Baptist leadership is changing.
</P>
<P>
   The Baptist General Convention of Texas made history last month
when it voted in the first Hispanic chairman of the executive board
of the 2.5 million-member organization.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hispanics have held seats on the board and have headed
committees and filled staff positions, Rudy Sanchez, pastor of
First Mexican Baptist Church of Dallas, is the first Hispanic to
assume the second most important position in the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Many Hispanic Baptist leaders say his appointment is a symbol of
the progress Baptist organizations in Texas are making in terms of
reaching Hispanics and drafting Hispanics for leadership positions.
</P>
<P>
   Before merging with the Baptist General Convention in 1960,
Hispanic Baptists operated independently under the Mexican Baptist
Convention. In 1960, the organizations joined together, Sanchez
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Sanchez can remember a time when Hispanic Baptist churches
were denied membership in some Baptist organizations.
</P>
<P>
   In 1946, Sanchez, at only 11, watched as the church he belonged
to, Antioch Baptist Church in San Antonio, was denied membership in
the Southern Baptist Convention through the San Antonio Baptist
Association, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were denied,'' Sanchez said. ``They said then was not the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez's appointment is but one sign that Texas is changing, he
said. Other recent upward moves by Hispanics chronicle the changes.
</P>
<P>
   Mateo Rendon Jr. is the first Hispanic to have led the BGCT's
administrative committee, one of the convention's most important
committees because it puts together the budget. And three Hispanics
served on the search committee for a new executive director of the
BGCT, Sanchez said.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the Baptist General Convention hired its first
full-time Hispanic female consultant, Patricia Villarreal, who
consults on community and Hispanic ministries. Altogether, about
1,000 people are affiliated with the boards of the BGCT, said Dan
Martin, religion writer for the state organization.
</P>
<P>
   And just last Sunday, pastor Ellis Orozco, a BGCT executive
board member, made another stride for Hispanic Baptists when he
accepted a call to a predominantly Anglo church in McAllen.
</P>
<P>
   Although there have been Hispanics who have pastored Anglo
churches, usually they have been called when the church is in
transition, with a growing Hispanic population around the church,
Orozco said.
</P>
<P>
   That isn't the case with Calvary Baptist, a 1,000-member church
with a $1 million budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wonderful opportunity, and I've really seen the hand of
the Lord working in that they weren't looking for a Hispanic,'' he
said. ``They just called God's man and he just happens to be
Hispanic ... and that's secondary. One of the things I feel called
to be a part of is to help erase those lines.''
</P>
<P>
   The push for more Hispanic leadership can be traced back to
1992, when a group of more than 30 Hispanic Baptist leaders formed
a task force and came up with a report, Vision 2000, calling for
eight initiatives the task force wanted the BGCT to accomplish by
2000, said Jim Garcia, coordinator of ethnic missions for the state
organization.
</P>
<P>
   The report called for evangelism leading to the baptism of
40,000 new Hispanic believers, the establishment of 600 new
Hispanic churches and the training of 800 Hispanic ministers,
Garcia said.
</P>
<P>
   Other goals called for initiatives in Christian education,
denominational life and intercultural awareness, Garcia said.
</P>
<P>
   The initiatives are working. In 1960, Texas had between 200 and
250 Hispanic Baptist churches. Today, there are roughly 966, with
641 of them started since the initiative began, Garcia said.
</P>
<P>
   Now the challenges are in staffing the rapidly developing
Hispanic Baptist churches.
</P>
<P>
   Although it's hard to gauge the number of Hispanic Baptists in
Texas because some attend predominantly Anglo and other churches,
the BGCT estimates there are about 200,000 Hispanic Baptists who
are members of its Hispanic churches, Garcia said.
</P>
<P>
   That number is expected to rise, especially in rural areas, said
Albert L. Reyes, president of the Hispanic Baptist Theological
School in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   During the past 50 years, the school has been the place many
Hispanics have gone to get training in the Baptist ministries,
Reyes said.
</P>
<P>
   Now 75 percent of Hispanic Baptist churches are pastored by one
of the 1,100 alumni, Reyes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 21st-century Texas ... what we will need is cross-cultural
leaders who can bring everything into context so it relates to the
culture and the context we're in,'' Reyes said. ``Anybody who wants
to be effective in 21st-century Texas is going to change.''

EUROPEAN COMMISSION, OVERULING FRANCE, SAYS BRITISH BEEF IS SAFE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Germany)   By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Britain won a major victory over France Friday when a
panel of European Commission scientists ruled that British beef was
safe to eat despite French arguments for a continued ban to guard
against so-called mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling comes after weeks of growing tension between the two
countries over France's continuing refusal to permit imports of
British beef even though the commission decided last August to
relax a ban imposed in 1996, when the beef was linked to bovine
spongiform encephalapathy, or mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
   France's non-compliance had prompted many supermarkets in
Britain to remove French food products from their shelves and,
British farmers had demonstrated urging consumers to ``Buy British,
Eat British.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the Channel, French farmers had threatened
to block British products coming into France.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to justify its position, three weeks ago France submitted
a 600-page report asserting to have new scientific evidence of the
risks associated with the meat.
</P>
<P>
   But after two days of deliberations, the panel of 16 European
Commission scientists found that British exports ``are as safe as
those in other European member states.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the commission's Scientific Steering Committee
said it had ``concluded unanimously that it does not share the
concerns expressed by the French food safety agency about the
safety'' of British beef.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists said that if the special safety precautions they
had recommended were followed, ``the safety of these U.K.-meat and
meat products is comparable to these foods coming from elsewhere''
in the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, Prime Minister Tony Blair said he was pleased with
the commission's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is exactly what we had hoped for and worked hard to
achieve,'' Blair said. ``We said throughout that we had the law on
our side, science on our side.''
</P>
<P>
   The French g did not immediately comment on ruling. In the past
few weeks, various officials had said that no matter what the
commission decided, France would continue to ban the beef. The
French public has become ultra-sensitive about food safety in
recent years after a spate of health scares, not only over mad cow
disease but such issues as dioxin-laced chickens, eggs and pork.
</P>
<P>
   Under European Union regulations, if France continues to refuse
to import the beef it could face action at the European Court of
Justice.
</P>
<P>
   But at a news conference in Brussels shortly after the
scientific panel issued its ruling, the European Commission's
Health Commissioner, David Byrne, said that he would meet next week
with the French and British agriculture ministers to try to resolve
the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am optimistic,'' Byrne said. ``I am confident that a rapid
solution is in sight.''
</P>
<P>
   But in recent weeks the dispute had seemed to be spinning out of
control, stirred up by a attacks of France in the British popular
press and thin skins on both sides of the Channel. In Britain,
Blair faced a chorus of calls from conservative members of
Parliament to retaliate against the French by boycotting all French
products.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's fury was further fueled when the European Commission
criticized the French for feeding their own livestock human sewage.
</P>
<P>
   Britain was not only concerned about the loss of a market in
France, which accounted for 40 percent of Britain's European beef
sales before the discovery of mad cow disease.) France is also a
gateway to many other markets in the Mediterranean and its
resistance to British beef has made marketing the meat that much
harder.
</P>
<P>
   But it is France that could have the most to lose if the food
feud becomes a full-blown agricultural war. Britain bought about $4
billion worth of food from France last year, while selling only
about half that amount to France.
</P>
<P>
   Until their current difficulties, relations between Britain and
France had been on ane upswing, as the countries were relatively
united in their stands on Kosovo, Bosnia and other foreign policy
issues.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to France, Germany has also not yet accepted British
beef. But it has said it continued to ban it on legal grounds and
has indicated that it would soon bring the matter before Parliament
to solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Byrne called France's ban ``more serious, in that it constituted
a challenge'' to scientific opinion. But he urged both countries to
take steps to begin importing British Beef. Mad cow disease, which
has been linked to a similar brain wasting malady in humans called
Creutzfeld-Jakob disease, affected some 180,000 head of cattle in
Britain when the ban was first imposed in March 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Under the eased rules set by the commission two months ago,
limited exports of British beef are permitted subject to stringent
health checks. The beef initially will be channeled through a few
dedicated meat-handling facilities. Cattle histories must be
traceable and all meat must be deboned.
</P>
<P>
   But these measures do not satisfy the French, who note that the
number of new cases of mad cow disease detected in Britain this
year _ 1,700 _ is more than seven times the total found in the 14
other European Union nations.

PROPAGANDA, THE SLY ART THAT MAKES OPPOSITES LOOK ALIKE

 (ATTN: Calif., Ala.)   (bl)  
 By SARAH BOXER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

   Compare and contrast. They had Five-Year plans. We had the New
Deal. They had the White Sea Canal. We had the Boulder Dam. They
had forced collectivization. We had dust bowls. They had
state-sponsored Socialist Realist photography. We had the
photographic realism of the Farm Security Administration. They had
Alexander Rodchenko, Boris Ignatovich, Elizar Langman and Arkady
Shaikhet. We had Dorothea Lange, Russell Lee, Ben Shahn and Walker
Evans.
</P>
<P>
   How different could they be?
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, Leah Bendavid-Val, a senior editor for National
Geographic Books, was riffling through an old anthology in the
Novosti Press Agency in Moscow when she saw an image from the 1930s
that stopped her in her tracks. It was a picture of a farm woman
nursing her infant in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the rough conditions, writes Ms. Bendavid-Val in the
catalog for ``Propaganda and Dreams: Photographing the 1930s in the
U.S.S.R. and the U.S.,'' an exhibition at the International Center
of Photography in New York, the woman ``still managed to appear
confident and purposeful, somehow enlarged by her gritty work.''
Remind you of anyone?
</P>
<P>
   How about Dorothea Lange's ``Migrant Mother,'' that worried but
resolute farm woman from Nipoma, Calif., who sits outside her tent,
planted insecurely in the dust-bitten world before her, and nurses
her infant?
</P>
<P>
   After spending four years digging in Russia's archives and
galleries and studying the collection of Farm Security
Administration photographs at the Library of Congress, Ms.
Bendavid-Val found a striking pattern: a lot of the pictures taken
as propaganda shots for the Soviet Union under Josef Stalin
resemble the photographs taken for the Farm Security Administration
during the Great Depression.
</P>
<P>
   In 1936, Walker Evans photographed a cabin's kitchen in Hale
County, Ala., that could almost pass _ right down to its oilcloth
and oil lamp _ for a communal kitchen in Leningrad captured in 1937
by an unknown Soviet photographer. A dramatic, gushing shot of the
Boulder Dam might be briefly mistaken for a photo of the Dnyeproges
hydroelectric power station. In 1933, Dorothea Lange took a shot of
Filipino farm workers cutting lettuce in Salinas, Calif., that
resembles Arkady Shishkin's 1931 photo of farmers in a commune in
the Karelia Region: both show the same bent figures breaking the
cracked soil and the horizon line at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the only way you can tell the Soviet shots from the
American ones is by their angles. The Americans tended to be
straight-shooters, looking at their subjects at eye level. The
Soviets often shot on the diagonal, from underneath or from above.
In 1936, Carl Mydans caught a line of identical houses in Manville,
N.J., by shooting straight through one porch to another and
another, producing a set of concentric squares. In 1933, Boris
Ignatovich shot the balconies around a Moscow atrium from above and
at an angle, producing a vertiginous repeating triangle.
</P>
<P>
   But this rule of thumb has exceptions. Not all Soviets loved the
diagonal and not all Americans hewed to the straight line.
</P>
<P>
   While the Russian filmmakers, designers, architects and artists
who formed the avant-garde group October loved the diagonal as an
exciting, forward-looking mark, Stalin condemned it as a formalist
affectation, art for art's sake. He tried to ban all odd angles in
1932. Mark Markov-Grinberg, who was a photographer for the Union of
Russian Proletarian Photographers, explains why in the catalog:
``Usually their strange angles did not appeal to us realists; how
can you walk on a diagonal horizon?''
</P>
<P>
   Americans, for their part, occasionally embraced the diagonal as
a heroic device. If you look at Lange's 1940 portrait of a
migratory cotton picker covering his mouth with his long, dusty
hand, smiling at the photographer, you can imagine the influence of
Georgy Petrusov's ``Field Worker,'' a 1935 portrait of a smiling,
brave-looking girl. They are both shot from below, with an uneasy
result: the subject is looking both straight at the camera and down
at it.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the photographic parallels, the Soviet Union and the
United States were worlds apart and their documentarians were
making vastly different points. In the Soviet Union, where millions
died because of government-induced famine, disastrous construction
projects and political purges, the 1930s photographs were intended
to show ``that socialism was succeeding,'' Ms. Bendavid-Val writes.
In the United States, where the government was trying to measure
poverty and famine rather than hide it, the 1930s pictures were
used to show that even though ``something had gone badly wrong with
the American way of life,'' the individual spirit survived.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the Soviet icons were individuals happily laboring for the
nation: Pasha Angelina, smiling on her tractor, and Aleksei
Stakhanov, the tireless miner. The American icons were individuals
struggling against all odds to make their own way.
</P>
<P>
   What accounts for the similarities? In both cases, the
photographers were looking for the most persuasive images. In both
nations, editors were determining, to some degree, the form and
content of the photographs. And they were keenly aware that no
matter what the message was, certain subjects and forms were more
persuasive.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Roy Stryker, the head of the Farm Security Administration's
documentarians, who was known for making his photographers turn
over all their negatives to him and for punching holes in the ones
he didn't like, once wrote to Arthur Rothstein, a photographer
working in Iowa, suggesting that it was ``very important'' that he
hunt ``good pictures of corn uncut in the field.'' He said, ``These
pictures should give some sense of corn as a lush crop'' and should
tell of ``the good life that is built around this good land.'' It
sounds almost Soviet, doesn't it?
</P>
<P>
   ``Emphasize the state fair as a farmer's fair,'' Stryker told
Rothstein, adding a note that suggested he was asking Rothstein to
bend the truth: ``I am under no illusion about the state fairs.
They have become very smart and have a decided urban tinge. . . .
Keep your camera pointed at the rural side of it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Soviet Union, no one leader was quite like Stryker. The
closest, Ms. Bendavid-Val suggests, was Leonid Mezhericher, the
manager of SoyuzFoto's foreign department. And he, like Stryker,
knew the power of certain kinds of shots. Although he found ``the
strange angles and diagonals of the photographs taken by Elizar
Langman and Rodchenko'' too concerned with form at the expense of
content, he loved the formal techniques used in American
advertising photographs: the ``sharp resolution,'' the ``colorful,
contrasting and energetic treatment of tones'' and the ``active,
concentrated, directed'' lighting. He liked the use of close-ups,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Mezhericher ``wasn't the only Soviet official who saw Socialist
Realist applications for Western advertising techniques,'' Ms.
Bendavid-Val notes. The fact was, many Socialist Realists ``thought
much more of advertising than of American documentary photographs
of the day.''
</P>
<P>
   The influence worked the other way, too. The editors of American
magazines and newspapers noticed Soviet-sponsored picture essays
like ``Twenty-Four Hours in the Life of the Filippov Family'' in
1931 and Rodchenko's famous propaganda work on the White Sea Canal
in 1933. ``The impact of the approach inspired the editors of Life
magazine when they started up in 1936,'' Ms. Bendavid-Val writes.
By 1940 many American magazines, once ``skittish about using
government pictures,'' began running Farm Security Administration
photographs and even photo essays. In 1937, for example, The New
York Times Magazine assigned someone to write a story to accompany
Rothstein's pictures of Gee's Bend, Ala. And, of course, in 1941
there was Walker Evans' and James Agee's book about the rural
South, ``Let Us Now Praise Famous Men.''
</P>
<P>
   What finally came out of this strange era of propaganda
photography? Ultimately, Ms. Bendavid-Val writes, ``the glow of
idealism dimmed'' on both sides. America's attention had turned to
war and so did the photographers. Some of the best Soviet
photographers and editors _ particularly those with an interest in
experimental photography _ had more tragic ends. Mezhericher was
fired as a ``saboteur and a Trotskyite.''
</P>
<P>
   And by 1945, Rodchenko, despite his serious concessions to
Stalin's socialism, had been marginalized. ``I'm already as good as
dead,'' he wrote in his diary. ``I'm an invisible man.''
</P>
<P>
   What remained of that decade in photography was a detailed
knowledge of the ways photographs can both serve and bend the
truth. As Lincoln Kirstein said in 1938, ``The candid camera is the
greatest liar in the photographic family.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With its great pretensions to accuracy, its promise of
sensational truth,'' he added, it presents ``an inversion of truth,
a kind of accidental revelation which does far more to hide the
real face of what is going on than to explode it.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a busy week in Washington for politics and policy on
economic and financial issues. Imagine that you could take a peek
at the e-mail traffic among the big players. You might, or might
not, have seen something like this. (And no, the addresses are not
real.)
</P>
<P>
   To: billc(AT)whitehouse.gov
</P>
<P>
   From: greenspan(AT)fed.gov
</P>
<P>
   Thank you, Mr. President, for letting me know privately that you
will reappoint me to a fourth term as Fed chairman when the time
comes next year. It will be a privilege to continue in public
service and to seek to maintain the vibrancy of the Greenspan
Economy _ I mean, Clinton Economy.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, and I probably should have mentioned this earlier:
We may have a situation developing here. This darned economy of
yours is just tooting along like a freight train.
</P>
<P>
   Though I've tapped the brakes a few times, I may have to apply a
bit more force to slow things down. In fact, this baby may be so
resilient that I have to keep raising rates into next year.
</P>
<P>
   With your legacy already secure, I know this is of little matter
to you personally. But your sidekick there is counting on strong
growth, low unemployment and a fizzy stock market to carry him into
the White House. So you might want to pass on to the Gore folks a
heads-up that by next October or so, joblessness is likely to be
rising and confidence sinking, and an opportunistic opponent might
then be able to capitalize on one little economic pothole to
suggest it's time for a change. But then, I guess you already know
how that works.
</P>
<P>
   To: lott(AT)senate.gov
</P>
<P>
   From: billc(AT)whitehouse.gov
</P>
<P>
   Trent, I wanted to congratulate you for your part in our mutual
effort to put aside the temptations of short-term partisan
advantage and set the nation on a course of fiscal responsibility
and prudent debt reduction.
</P>
<P>
   You had me going there with that $792 billion tax cut for a
while. What a jokester!
</P>
<P>
   And I'm sure you understand that I was just having a little fun
with those pesky liberal Democrats in the House when I proposed
using the budget surplus to subsidize prescription drugs for
everyone 65 and older. Big spending programs have never been my
priority.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, the American people will reward both of us for our
farsightedness in leaving the surplus largely untouched and
improving the government's long-term economic strength.
</P>
<P>
   Because of our courageous decisions, we have given the country
confidence that it will be able to deal with the problems that
threaten the prosperity of voters not yet born.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, I also look forward to working with you on the
international issues that face us, you isolationist, nativist,
never-had-a-passport hick who doesn't know his WTO from his CTBT!
:-)
</P>
<P>
   To: gates(AT)microsoft.com
</P>
<P>
   From: reno(AT)justice.gov
</P>
<P>
   Congratulations on your company's stock becoming a component of
the Dow Jones industrial average. Now every triumph on your part
will lift the single most widely quoted indicator of the country's
economic vibrancy to new heights.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, I suppose, it also means that more than ever,
every piece of bad news about Microsoft will send investors into
spasms of panic, undermining the economy and eroding the political
support that has permitted the Clinton administration to survive
all the late unpleasantness.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings me to this little misunderstanding about your Web
browser and the exuberance with which you seek to share the fruits
of your product development with consumers. Just because that judge
is about to rule that you are a heartless monopolist intent on
atomizing the competition _ I have no idea why my antitrust
division put such ideas in his head _ doesn't mean that we can't
quietly come to some agreement to keep Microsoft from being chopped
up into 1,000 pieces.
</P>
<P>
   As a sign of my sincerity, I have instructed the FBI to purge
all Netscape products from Justice Department computers. I would
hope that your counteroffer would include options on a few hundred
thousand shares for the charity of my choice.
</P>
<P>
   To: rubin(AT)citigroup.com
</P>
<P>
   From: summers(AT)treasury.gov
</P>
<P>
   I knew there was a reason I spent countless hours locked in a
room with Phil Gramm getting a deal on updating the laws governing
the financial services industry.
</P>
<P>
   It must have been to assure your employment with a financial
services mega-conglomerate that can use the freedom granted to it
under the new legislation to gain control over every aspect of
personal and corporate finance in the United States and throughout
the industrialized world.
</P>
<P>
   Glad to be of assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Just remember, though, that you're not going to be dealing with
regular guys like me and Greenspan anymore. Unlike Washington,
Citigroup is a viper's nest of competing egos and agendas, and it's
pretty clear that you're there to play referee.
</P>
<P>
   So if things don't work out for you at Citigroup, the latest
polls suggest that I will be available to replace you once again,
anytime after Jan. 20, 2001.

   RUNAWAY-PRODUCTION (Los Angeles) _ Grasping for ways to keep
Hollywood film and TV production in Los Angeles, the City Council
asked Friday for a report on what the city can do to create a fund
to provide financing for producers. Councilman Mike Hernandez
proposed that the city create a revolving loan fund to make
low-interest loans to productions with budgets under $5 million.
Borrowers would provide a bond to protect the city against loss.
The size of the loan fund wasn't specified. The money would come
from a community development block grant. By Rick Orlov (Will move

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ If George W. Bush can thank his father for a
well-known name, for much of his wealth he can thank Richard E.
Rainwater, a billionaire investor from Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   The vast bulk of the $18.4 million Bush and his wife reported in
1998 income came from the sale of the Texas Rangers and other
investments in which Rainwater, a man not widely known outside of
Wall Street, played a major role.
</P>
<P>
   Rainwater, at age 55, is considered a master investor and has
built fortunes for others as well as for himself.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a grocer and a J.C. Penney sales clerk, Rainwater
gained his reputation skillfully marshaling the assets of the
legendary Bass family of Fort Worth, whose original holdings were
in oil. He soon created his own fortune, recently estimated by
Forbes magazine at $1.2 billion, by building a real-estate empire
and helping to found the nation's largest chain of hospitals,
Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the financial ties between Bush and Rainwater, their
relationship has long been a target for the governor's political
opponents in Texas. In Bush's first campaign for governor, in 1994,
a spokesman for his Democratic opponent, Gov. Ann W. Richards,
declared that Rainwater ``owned'' Bush.
</P>
<P>
   A review of Bush's relationship with Rainwater did not produce
evidence that Bush, as governor, has sought to aid the businessman,
though there would be more potential for conflict if he became
president. Rainwater is involved in companies that are heavily
regulated and have hundreds of millions of dollars in government
contracts. One of those companies, which operates psychiatric
hospitals, is the subject of federal and state investigations into
patient abuse and Medicare fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said in a statement: ``Richard Rainwater is a friend and a
former business partner who is very successful. Some of my
investments in his companies have been successful as well. Richard
has never sought a favor for any of his companies nor would I have
offered any.''
</P>
<P>
   Rainwater declined to comment on the relationship, saying
through a spokesman that it would be inappropriate during Bush's
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in 1994, Rainwater said, ``George Bush happens
to be one of about 100 people that can make the statement that
their involvement with Richard Rainwater has had a very positive''
effect on their wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, as he prepared to run for the Republican presidential
nomination, Bush liquidated a blind trust created to hold his
assets when he was elected governor. One reason for doing so, said
the accountant who managed the trust, Robert A. McCleskey, was to
eliminate the appearance of any conflicts of interest, including
any investments with Rainwater.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get people inquiring about the Rainwater interests _ is
there a conflict?'' McCleskey said. ``So it was decided that the
best thing was to get rid of it.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the wealth of many politicians has been shaped by
others, and many national figures have had close friendships with
people heavily regulated by the government. In 1976, for example,
Hillary Rodham Clinton quickly turned a $1,000 investment in
commodities futures into a gain of nearly $100,000 with advice from
a friend who was then the top lawyer for Tyson Foods, the nation's
biggest poultry producer.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, for his part, invested $385 in 1991 in a ``consulting''
group set up by Rainwater as part of a deal with Americredit Corp.,
the car loan company. Three years later, when the investment paid
off, Bush received $45,512.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Bush, Dan Bartlett, said that the investment was
``passive'' and that Bush did no consulting.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Bush, Rainwater was not born into a world of connections.
He went to public schools in Fort Worth, where his father operated
a family grocery and where he regularly won races at a local drag
strip in a souped-up Buick. He attended the University of Texas and
then the Stanford University Graduate School of Business.
</P>
<P>
   At Stanford, he was a classmate of Sid R. Bass, the eldest of
the four Bass brothers, and it was Bass who soon hired him to help
direct the investments of Bass Brothers Enterprises. Rainwater so
aggressively invested the family's oil wealth in languishing
companies like Walt Disney that by the time he left in 1986, $50
million had grown to $5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after going out on his own in 1986, Rainwater connected
with another Texan, Richard L. Scott, a lawyer who believed that
investor-owned hospitals could be efficient and highly profitable.
They soon joined forces, and the result was Columbia/HCA, the
nation's biggest chain of for-profit hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   His current holdings also include energy, oil rigs, office
buildings and the sumptuous Canyon Ranch resorts. So sprawling are
his interests that gamblers can bet in casinos operated by one of
his companies or seek treatment for their gambling compulsion at
another.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a mega-deal guy who is extremely intelligent,'' said J.
Thomas Schieffer, who was a partner with Bush and Rainwater in the
Texas Rangers. ``He has a Midas touch.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While Bush and Rainwater have described themselves as friends,
people who know them said they are not particularly close. And they
did not know each other before Bush approached the businessman in
1989 for help in putting together an investment group to buy the
Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   In their first conversation, Bush was rebuffed. Only after the
baseball commissioner, Peter V. Ueberroth, intervened, intent on
having Bush include Texas investors, did Rainwater agree to take
part. He and a group of associates eventually put up half of the
$46 million purchase price.
</P>
<P>
   Rainwater's role in the Texas Rangers is well known. But not
long after, he began offering Bush investment opportunities in oil
and gas, real estate and a car loan company, which together yielded
at least $650,000 and possibly hundreds of thousands more. Then in
1994, he contributed $100,000 when Bush successfully ran for
governor.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, in a comment made through his spokesman, Bartlett, said
that those investments naturally followed from the Texas Rangers
deal. Other team investors with long ties to Rainwater took part in
them, though three large investors brought in by Bush _ Schieffer,
Mercer Reynolds and William O. DeWitt Jr. _ each said that the Fort
Worth businessman never approached them with similar opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically he allowed George to invest in some of the stuff
that he invested in,'' said Schieffer, who was the team's president
before its sale.
</P>
<P>
   Within the high-stakes financial world inhabited by Rainwater,
Bush's investments were very small, and how much he made from them
is unclear. McCleskey said the terms of Bush's trust prevented him
from disclosing the annual returns on the investments between 1995
and 1998, the time they were in trust.
</P>
<P>
   But between 1991, the first year that Bush publicly released his
tax filings, and 1994, he earned about $270,000 from investments
involving Rainwater, according to data provided by McCleskey. And
in 1998, when all remaining Rainwater-related investments were
sold, Bush made from $355,000 to $415,000, public filings show.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Rangers provided Bush his biggest payday from deals
involving Rainwater, some $14.9 million based on a total investment
of $606,000.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's investments with Rainwater were questioned during his
1994 race against Gov. Richards and after, as Texas newspapers and
other news organizations scrutinized their ties.
</P>
<P>
   One issue was whether Bush's proposal to privatize state
psychiatric hospitals could benefit Magellan Health Services Inc.,
a company in which Rainwater is the largest shareholder.
</P>
<P>
   Had the plan gone forward, which it did not, Magellan Health
would have been a prime contender for such a contract. But in fact,
the privatization proposal did not originate with Bush. It was part
of a 1994 report by the state's Democratic comptroller, John Sharp.
</P>
<P>
   Questions were also raised about the state teacher retirement
system's sale of several buildings to a publicly traded company
headed by Rainwater, Crescent Real Estate Equities Co. Bush said he
had no role in the sales, and reviews of the sales by appraisers
hired by the retirement system found the prices paid by Crescent
Real Estate to be fair.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, however, did not divorce himself completely from the
concerns of companies tied to Rainwater. In early 1995, Scott, the
chief executive of Columbia/HCA, met with the governor to express
his concerns about a Medicaid bill in the Texas Legislature,
documents obtained under the state open-records law by The New York
Times show. The bill was intended to expand the number of children
and adults covered by the state's health-insurance program for the
poor.
</P>
<P>
   People involved in the ensuing debate said they did not see any
evidence that Bush had tried to influence the final bill, though
Rainwater's interests in the matter were well known.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that went around was the affiliation between
the governor and Mr. Rainwater, that anything being done was a
favor to him,'' said Hugo Berlanga, a former state representative
from Corpus Christi who was involved with the bill. ``I thought it
was a far reach.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, some of Rainwater's investments have lost their
luster. In 1997, for example, Columbia/HCA became the subject of a
wide-ranging federal investigation into Medicare fraud.
(Rainwater's wife, Darla D. Moore, a former investment banker with
Chemical Bank who took over his seat on the Columbia/HCA board in
1994, was widely credited with removing Scott as its chief
executive.)
</P>
<P>
   Charter Behavioral Health Systems, another Rainwater-related
company in which Bush was invested through his blind trust, is now
the subject of regulatory scrutiny. Until recently, it was a unit
of Magellan Health, a company that Ms. Moore joined as a director
in 1996 after resigning her post at Columbia/HCA.
</P>
<P>
   Rainwater came to invest in Charter Behavioral through his ties
to Magellan Health and Crescent Real Estate, a publicly traded real
estate investment trust, or REIT, that he founded.
</P>
<P>
   REITs typically invest in commercial real estate. But in 1997,
Rainwater turned Crescent in an unusual direction, the psychiatric
industry, paying Magellan Health $400 million for a 50 percent
stake in Charter Behavioral, which operates a chain of psychiatric
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was structured to provide the REIT with rent from the
hospitals. But since operating the hospitals would jeopardize the
REIT's tax status, Rainwater and his associates created a new
company, Crescent Operating, to operate the hospitals with
Magellan. Shareholders in Crescent Real Estate, including Bush,
received stock in Crescent Operating as a dividend.
</P>
<P>
   Charter Behavioral, which runs about 80 hospitals nationwide,
already had financial problems as private and public insurers cut
back on in-patient psychiatric stays. But the terms of the Crescent
deal added two new costs, calling on Charter to pay the REIT at
least $40 million a year in rents and to pay Magellan Health $81
million in annual franchise fees.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two years, federal and state regulators have found
a growing list of problems at Charter Behavioral hospitals, which
receive tens of millions of dollars from programs like Medicare and
Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   Recently Charter agreed to close the adolescent unit of its
hospital in Nashua, N.H., after failing to remedy conditions there,
said Donald Shumway, commissioner of the New Hampshire department
of Health and Human Services. Regulators had found untrained staff,
unsanitary conditions, improper use of restraints, record-keeping
violations and sexual abuse of teen-agers and children.
</P>
<P>
   In August, the federal Health Care Finance Administration
announced that it was ending payments to a Charter Behavioral
hospital in Pembroke, Mass., after the company failed to submit an
acceptable plan to correct deficiencies.
</P>
<P>
   Shumway said Magellan Health had told him that Charter
Behavioral had dismissed most corporate-level officials involved in
reviewing the quality of medical care sometime in the past two
years as part of a cost-cutting move.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Jenkins, a spokeswoman for Charter Behavioral, which has
headquarters in Alpharetta, Ga., said patient care at company sites
had never suffered. ``We have strict standards of quality
assurance,'' she said. ``If there was a reduction, the functions
would not stop.'' She would not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Crescent Operating, which is also headed by Rainwater, recently
took Magellan Health's remaining stake in Charter Behavioral. Bush
is no longer an investor in either Crescent or Crescent Operating
because the stocks were sold when his trust was liquidated.

POOR PAKISTANIS FEEL COUP MERELY TOPPLED A SHAM DEMOCRACY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CELIA W. DUGGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan _ An answer to the mystery of why so many
ordinary Pakistanis rejoiced when the military smashed their
democracy can be found right here within the city limits of the
nation's capital, in a small, centuries-old village nestled into
the Margalla Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Here, just hours before the armed forces seized power Oct. 12,
government bulldozers demolished more than 500 houses and reduced
most of the impoverished village of Saidpur to a dusty pile of
rubble where weeping children wandered in the chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Saidpur was largely destroyed because politicians and their
bureaucratic appointees decided that it was an eyesore and a
nuisance on what one official called ``the VVIP route,'' the road
where very, very important people like Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
roared past in shiny black Mercedes-Benzes.
</P>
<P>
   And its residents say they now must live with the bitter
knowledge that they were unable to stop the destruction because
they had no money or political pull like the rich and powerful
people of Bani Gala, another village only 15 minutes away. They
faced the gnawing power of the bulldozers for other reasons earlier
in the decade but managed to save most of their grand mansions.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the poor, there is no democracy,'' said Nisar Ahmad, whose
house and shop in Saidpur were destroyed and who is now penniless
and unemployed. ``For us it has only meant trouble and
oppression.''
</P>
<P>
   The different fates of Saidpur and Bani Gala, two rural villages
on the city's outskirts, could serve as a metaphor for the failings
of Pakistan's democracy.
</P>
<P>
   In both places, the residents were accused by the authorities of
inhabiting their villages illegally, but poor Saidpur was destroyed
and rich Bani Gala was saved.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmad explained the ways of the system: ``You bribe people, it
works. You don't bribe them, it doesn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   It is that corrosive belief _ that the law cannot touch the high
and mighty, while it is wantonly used to crush the poor and
powerless _ that has done so much to discredit the idea of
democracy in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Saidpur was obliterated without even a whisper of notice in the
English-language newspapers read by the elite. Its young men were
jailed for stoning the machines that came to knock down their huts.
Its people, who scrape by on incomes or $40 or $50 a month, are
homeless now as the cold winter rains approach, with no place to go
and no one to turn to.
</P>
<P>
   But in Bani Gala, stately villas and elegant houses, with rose
gardens and crystal chandeliers, still command sweeping views of
Rawal Lake and the Kurang River seven years after the government
tried to bulldoze them out of existence, fearful that sewage from
the houses was polluting the water supply of Rawalpindi and
Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A.Q. Khan, the scientist generally known as the father of
Pakistan's atomic bomb, still has his imposing brick house in Bani
Gala, with a fountain on the front lawn, topped by a playful stone
fish, though his chowkidar, or watchman, Tariq Zulfi, said Khan
rarely visits. When a visitor came knocking, seven servants
clustered at the iron gates that guard the grounds.
</P>
<P>
   In was in 1992, after the bulldozers had destroyed the homes of
many poor villagers in Bani Gala and drew ever closer to some of
Bani Gala's most impressive houses that a retired army colonel rang
up the head of the army's secret service, who called the president,
said several residents, who said he then phoned Sharif, who ordered
the destruction of Bani Gala to halt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within seconds they were gone,'' said Mrs. Mahmood Ali, a
wealthy businesswoman. ``They got in their jeeps and went away.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Politics in Pakistan is very much an elite affair, with the
military and political establishments intricately woven together,
as they were in Bani Gala. Sharif was the protege of Pakistan's
previous dictator, Gen. Mohammad Zia ul-Haq, and named the new
military ruler, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, chief of the army a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan has produced only two elected leaders with national
appeal in the last decade of democracy _ Sharif, from a family of
businessmen who became extremely rich industrialists after he
entered politics, and Benazir Bhutto, from a wealthy family of
feudal landowners. She was convicted this year of taking kickbacks
on a government contract.
</P>
<P>
   Many political analysts say that both seem to have viewed their
stints as prime minister mainly as a license to enrich themselves,
their families and their cronies.
</P>
<P>
   The impunity with which powerful politicians and bureaucrats
have served their self-interest seems to have sapped the
willingness of many other people, from the top to the bottom of
society, to follow the rules. Why, the people of Saidpur ask,
should they leave their village, even though the authorities say
they are there illegally, when the rich are able to pull strings?
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The poor of Pakistan, handicapped by staggering levels of
illiteracy and consumed by the daily tasks of survival, have yet to
produce their own crop of political leaders. In India, by contrast,
the most oppressed sections of society were given preferences in
university admissions and public employment and have produced a
small middle class of leaders who have risen to power.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, one of the most striking differences between India and
Pakistan, carved from the same British empire in 1947, is that so
many of the poor of Pakistan seem to have an ebbing faith in
democracy, while surveys have documented a rising belief in the
power of the vote among India's poor.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That faith is all gone in Saidpur ever since the bulldozers and
hundreds of police officers and employees of the Capital
Development Authority arrived on the morning of Oct. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Hazran Bibi, a gaunt 95-year-old, said she hobbled over to the
bureaucrat in charge that day, gripped his chin in her gnarled hand
and begged him to spare the home where she has lived all her life.
But she said he told her: ``I can't do anything for you. Prepare to
remove your things.''
</P>
<P>
   Saidpur is just one of the many ``encroachments'' that have been
``removed'' in the last year since the prime minister installed one
of his close allies to head the Capital Development Authority, a
man who was quickly removed after the military toppled Sharif and
began installing its own people in the bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   About 6,000 houses in Islamabad have been destroyed and tens of
thousands of mostly poor people displaced in the removal
operations, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Faiz Muhammad, assistant director of enforcement at the
development authority, said the old villages and towns of mud huts
had been demolished because they had been illegal and unsightly and
had posed a nuisance and ``security'' problem along what he called
the VVIP routes.
</P>
<P>
   People's cows and dogs kept wandering onto the road that
connects Rawalpindi, where the army is headquartered, to the
capital, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Once the rubble is cleared, Saidpur will be planted with trees
and will become part of the city's greenbelt, he said. The people
there _ or their relatives _ sold the authority their land about
the time that Islamabad was founded in 1960 and have no legal right
to live there, he said.
</P>
<P>
   So the people of Saidpur have been uprooted to make way for
trees, but they have not given up hope that somehow the new regime
will be their salvation. In the two and a half weeks since the
coup, no bulldozers have returned to the village to finish off the
job. And the residents have begun piling up huge mounds of bricks
and wood in hopes of rebuilding.
</P>
<P>
   By day children play in the ruins. Little girls in dingy dresses
walk on the craggy, broken walls like dainty gymnasts on the
balance beam. Boys aimlessly toss the chunks of hay, mud and stone
that once enclosed their families.
</P>
<P>
   And the grown-ups nurse their hatred of the former prime
minister. A handbill bearing his photograph was tacked to a tree in
the village. ``Look at this man,'' it said in Urdu. ``He is the
result of betraying his own people.''
</P>
<P>
   As people walked past the poster, they cursed Sharif. ``He
destroyed us,'' said one. ``May God destroy him.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, to the people of Saidpur, the prime minister's overthrow
seems to be divine retribution. ``We are happy,'' said Parveen
Bano, 30, a mother of three. ``He brought our houses down, and he
fell down.''

 By CAROLE GOULD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For managers of most small-capitalization value funds, it has
been a brutal few years. But Rudolph K. Kluiber, portfolio manager
of the $393.2 million State Street Research Aurora Fund, has had
little trouble maintaining an upbeat attitude, even as investors
have shunned the kinds of stocks he likes and flocked to large
growth equities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe the negativity on our stocks is warranted,''
he said from his office, overlooking Boston Harbor. ``Or it's
already built into the price of the stock. And we think good things
will help propel the stock prices upward in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, looking at his fund's performance, you would expect
Kluiber (pronounced KLOO-Ber) to fairly radiate optimism. Aurora
returned 14.7 percent a year, on average, for the three years
through Oct. 22, compared with 6.4 percent for its small-value
peers, according to Morningstar Inc., the Chicago financial
publisher. (That compares with 24.9 percent for the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 Index over that period, with dividends reinvested
weekly.)
</P>
<P>
   Aurora returned 23 percent in the 12 months through Oct. 22,
more than double its peer group's 5.5 percent return, Morningstar
said. (The S.&AMP;P. 500 Index returned 22.3 percent annually over that
time.)
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many money managers, Kluiber, 40, doesn't rely on
computer programs to identify his small-cap picks. He reads a lot
of quarterly 10-Qs, annual reports, Wall Street research and the
usual range of business periodicals like Forbes and Business Week.
And he listens to investment ideas floated by the two analysts
working on the fund as well as the 24 stock analysts employed by
State Street Research and Management, among others. He's the first
to admit that his selection contains no neat formulaic discipline.
``It's a constant peeling of the onion,'' he said, ``an iterative
process.''
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of ways, Kluiber said, in which companies can
increase shareholder value: new products, new management,
revampings, mergers or acquisitions, stock buybacks or paying down
debt. So, in general, he looks for inexpensive stocks, he said,
``with a number of different ways to win,'' adding that ``ideally,
you'd like to have a number of these variables.''
</P>
<P>
   Kluiber identifies cheap stocks using some traditional measures
of value such as ratios of price to earnings and price to book. In
September, the fund's 224 stocks sold for an average of 17.2 times
1999 earnings and a price to book ratio of 1.7.
</P>
<P>
   But he pays special attention to a company's cash: ``Cash flow
is king,'' he said, ``and free cash flow is even better.'' Strong
cash flow gives management flexibility to build the business and
provide good returns to company shareholders, Kluiber explained.
</P>
<P>
   He defines free cash flow as earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization, minus working capital, capital
spending and cash taxes. Sometimes, he'll look at a company's
enterprise value _ the market value of a company's equity and debt
_ in relationship to its free cash flow. There's no firm multiple
that he looks for, but the lower the better.
</P>
<P>
   The companies he says he tends to buy are industry leaders,
companies that usually have more pricing power and are often the
lowest-cost producers. That means they often weather downturns
better than their rivals, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He recently added to an existing position in Transportation
Technologies Industries, a leading Chicago manufacturer of truck
parts. The company's enterprise value is just about four times its
free cash flow, an historically low ratio that resulted from a
slowdown in the truck manufacturing business. But the multiple is
also below those of its rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the company should have $30 million in free cash flow
this year, or $3 a share, he said, adding that the money is being
used to make acquisitions and to pay down its debt of about $180
million.
</P>
<P>
   The company also has been improving profit margins by
restructuring some of its operations, he said. It has made several
acquisitions, most recently buying a foundry in Kentucky to add
capacity, he added.
</P>
<P>
   He first bought shares in October 1996, at $3.28 a share. The
stock closed Friday at $14.75, or 8.7 times his earnings estimate
for 1999 of $1.70 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Kluiber also likes Agrium, a fertilizer maker in Calgary,
Alberta. ``I'd characterize it as a cyclical company, hopefully at
the bottom of the cycle,'' he said. Agrium is the low-cost producer
of its mostly nitrogen-based products, and nitrogen prices are near
a 20-year low, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the company still earns money, 88 cents a share in
1998 versus $1.43 in 1997, generates plenty of cash flow and is
buying back shares. ``It's the type of company that I buy with the
idea that when supply and demand get more in balance, and as
earnings increase, the stock price will follow,'' he said. ``In the
meantime, they continued to improve their plants and business to
position the company for a potential rebound in the nitrogen
market.''
</P>
<P>
   He originally bought shares on the New York Stock Exchange in
October 1997 for $11.75 each, and expects per share earnings to
rise as high as $3 when the nitrogen cycle peaks. The stock closed
Friday at $8.4375.
</P>
<P>
   Kluiber added recently to Specialty Equipment, in Aurora, Ill.,
which makes food service equipment like milkshake machines and
grills for McDonald's. The company generates ``a fair amount of
free cash flow, which it is using to buy back shares and make
judicious acquisitions that are accretive to earnings,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Specialty Equipment is the industry leader in a relatively
mature industry, he said. Its stock price is down by more than 20
percent this year, Kluiber said, because one of the company's
biggest customers recently reduced its order.
</P>
<P>
   He began buying shares in February 1995 for $10.25 each. He
forecasts a three-year earnings growth rate of 10 percent to 15
percent. The stock closed Friday at $20.875, or 10.4 times his 1999
earnings forecast of $2 a share.

 By RALPH BLUMENTHAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In October 1955 Memphis woke up to a radical new
sound: not the twangy rhythm-and-blues of an awkward young singer
named Elvis Presley, who was already on his way to stardom, but the
dulcet voices of WHER, the nation's first ``all girl'' radio
station.
</P>
<P>
   For the next 16 years, in a cramped pink studio in the third of
a new chain of motor hotels called Holiday Inn, the ``jockettes''
of WHER made history. They ran the control board, sold air time,
spun platters of Patti Page, Sinatra and Henry Mancini, read the
news and interviewed celebrities, winning the hearts of listeners,
scoring high in the ratings and pointing the way to a new era of
opportunities for women in broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   Their success, however, became an often-overlooked footnote in
the celebrated legend of their founding father _ yes, a he _ Sam
Phillips, the recording pioneer whose Sun Records first put Elvis
on wax.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Phillips, 76, and 14 of the 40 or so WHER women,
including his wife, Becky, reunited at the Museum of Television and
Radio in Manhattan for the release of a two-part documentary on the
station, ``WHER: 1,000 Beautiful Watts.'' The program was produced
for National Public Radio by Davia Nelson and Nikki Silva, radio
documentarians known as the Kitchen Sisters, from recordings of the
station and hundreds of hours of interviews.
</P>
<P>
   The first 22-minute segment, part of a yearlong series called
``Lost and Found Sound,'' was broadcast Friday, the 44th
anniversary of the station's debut, during ``All Things
Considered,'' and a second part of 12 minutes is scheduled for
Friday (to be broadcast in New York City on AM 820 at 4:30 p.m.,
and on FM 93.9 at 7:30 p.m.) The programs are also available on the
NPR Web site (www.npr.org).
</P>
<P>
   Phillips, who with his wife left Muscle Shoals, Ala., in 1945
for Memphis, where he founded the Memphis Recording Service (``We
Record Anything, Anywhere, Anytime''), said that the idea of an
all-female station was born of competitive necessity in a glutted
radio market. ``My primary intention was to do something that was
different,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm crazy,'' said Phillips, whose clean-cut 1950s look has
given way to a leonine chestnut mane, Mephistophelean beard and
tinted glasses. ``I'm like a little mouse who sees a hole and jumps
in there.''
</P>
<P>
   He reached out first for Dotty Abbott, an experienced radio
woman from Memphis then working in Phoenix, to be his station
manager: `` `Dotty,' I said, `I just got a crazy idea. If you don't
want the job, swear to keep it secret or I'll punish you in some
horrible way.''' She signed on and others quickly followed. But, he
said, ``each girl thought she was the only one being hired.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Abbott died years ago, but others like Donna Barlett shared
their recollections. ``Some of us were married and some weren't,''
she said. ``Some were separated. I was not living with my husband
then. I had three girls and two boys, and I'd take them to the
lobby and say, `Sit!'''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips' early backer was the Memphis developer Kemmons Wilson,
who put up $25,000 and provided studio space in one of his new
Holiday Inns. Phillips raised $35,000 more by selling his recording
contract with Elvis to RCA, a move Wilson encouraged, saying:
``Hell, he can't even sing, man. Take the money!''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson also set out the format. ``Don't play anything but love
music,'' he advised. ``A man singing to a woman and a woman singing
to a man.''
</P>
<P>
   Denise Howard, who as a 22-year-old design graduate applied for
the job of decorating the studio, recalled cooling her heels for
six hours while Phillips remained closeted. Finally a young man
came out and, feeling sorry for her, drawled, ``Honey, can I get
you a Pepsi?'' It was Elvis.
</P>
<P>
   The women played to their image, calling the studio the Doll's
Den, hanging nylons, bras and underwear in the equipment room, and
announcing ``the news from abroad.'' There were the inevitable
gaffes, as when one announcer declared, ``Marital law has been
declared in the Congo.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1971 the station took on new call letters, WWEE, and a new
talk format, spelling the end of an era. Phillips said that he
didn't think he was part of any revolution at the time, but that it
was a revolution nevertheless. ``We were too lazy to march,'' he
said. ``But we marched through the airwaves.''

   No, that's not a lock combination, a partial lottery entry or a
quarterback's signals. Through Friday, those numbers are the gains,
in percentage points, that the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500, the NASDAQ
composite index and the Dow Jones industrial average have recorded
over the last 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   For those who own the so-called average stock, which has
declined over the last year, the performance of the market's major
indexes probably doesn't mean very much. Nor is it likely to matter
for those who worry about rising interest rates, inflation and Year
2000 issues.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with stocks bobbing as much as they have recently, it is
worth remembering where we were a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Smith, chief investment strategist at Prudential
Securities, talked last week about the crosscurrents pulling on
investors just now, and why he doesn't expect much from the market
for some time to come, even though he likes stocks. Here are
excerpts from the conversation: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Stocks have been range-bound for awhile now. What is the
market trying to sort out? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Essentially, we have come to an important crossroads.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand is the thought that the inflation cycle is
kicking in, and the Fed will have to fight it. In the process of
doing that, the central bank will ultimately wind up clobbering the
economy and push it into recession. If you think that is going on,
you see higher interest rates, lower stock multiples and eventually
lower earnings. That sounds a lot like a bear market.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative view is that while prices are rising, inflation
has to be higher than it was last year, because a year ago we were
looking at deflation.
</P>
<P>
   Could inflation come back to pre-financial-crisis levels of
around 2.5 percent, which is the level we were at before 1997? You
either believe that is normal, or that we are going to go through
that level to some cyclically ugly high number.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, uncertainty prevails about which view is right, and
that is not good for the stock market. We are in big trouble when
we waffle.
</P>
<P>
   We are probably going to need a couple of more quarters to sort
this out. Either the inflation trend will keep going up, or it will
flatten out. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Where does the Y2K issue fit into all of this? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Y2K is a bravado issue. No one admits to changing their
investment strategy because of Y2K. But underneath you have to
think it is another dose of uncertainty, another reason to be
nervous. No one is really nervous themselves, but they are all
nervous someone else will get nervous. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. So how will this all get sorted out? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I am persuaded by the pre-1997 case that we are merely going
back to levels of inflation and interest rates that existed before
the onset of the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say that oil prices can't go up or some other act
of God can't happen.
</P>
<P>
   If we are all battened down and worried and get into January and
see the world is working, I think there will be a relief rally that
could be quite substantial. Even so, I would not be surprised at
all if major market averages are within 5 percent to 10 percent of
where they are right now in six months. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. But based on your asset allocation model, you far prefer
stocks over anything else. Why? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Since July, the model has been 10 percent cash, 10 percent
bonds, 5 percent in real estate investment trusts and 75 percent in
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   I am optimistic about stocks. Even if the market stays in a
trading range, it will still be a market in which you can make
money. It is a market of stocks as opposed to being in the stock
market. It comes down to finding good earnings stories and keeping
your wits about you, particularly now. There are a number of
sectors that have been battered that next March will have stocks
that have come way up from the previous fall. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What sectors do you like most? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I think an opportunity has just been created in oil service
stocks, which have been absolutely hammered, from Nabors Industries
to Schlumberger.
</P>
<P>
   That is also true with some of the retailers, like Gap, which
have been knocked down a good bit on the theory that the Internet
and interest rates will kill them.
</P>
<P>
   Even in technology, there has been a lot of controversy about
Y2K creating a significant slowdown in software.
</P>
<P>
   This is a big story for next year, because as well as technology
has done, demand could actually accelerate next year. Everyone has
to have an Internet strategy, which means some infrastructure for
the Internet, not just here but globally.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks like Compuware and Oracle are selling at low multiples
comparable to their growth rates. This is an area where next March
you will be looking and will be sorry you didn't move into in late
October.

   Sam Zell is hoping that investors are as keen on surf and turf
as he is.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in March 1997, a partnership controlled by the real
estate mogul and value investor began building a position in Chart
House Enterprises, which owns a chain of 52 steak and seafood
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   As of Sept. 30, Zell _ known as ``Grave Dancer'' for his ability
to resurrect damaged properties _ owned 29.9 percent of the
company.
</P>
<P>
   There seems little to get potential investors excited about the
38-year-old company, whose stock closed at $5 on Friday. Since
1995, sales have fallen 19 percent, to $145.2 million last year, as
diners shunned the chain's dated interiors and equally dated menu,
which until recently included such 1970s favorites as teriyaki
steak. It had an operating loss of $190,000 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But Chart House has something that Zell is well versed in _ real
estate. From Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., to Maui, Hawaii, the restaurants
are situated on expensive waterfront property. The company owns
only around 15 percent of its restaurant locations, but the
long-term leases it holds on the others are valuable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's assume we have a great Chart House Restaurant, and it's
doing well,'' Zell said in a telephone interview from Chicago. ``If
two years from now _ hypothetically _ someone wanted to build a
high-rise condo, they have to go to Chart House, which holds the
economic value of the property.''
</P>
<P>
   Zell declined to estimate the liquidation value of the real
estate, but said, ``I think it's probably true if you went out to
liquidation, it would be worth more than the stock price.''
Analysts have said that the Chart House's property may be worth as
much as $8 a share.
</P>
<P>
   But Zell said Chart House's business was even more compelling.
In October 1997, Chart House hired Richard Melman, chief executive
of Lettuce Entertain You Enterprises, the Chicago restaurant group,
to freshen the chain's concept. He has been refitting the
restaurants' interiors with new chairs, lighting, carpeting and
art. Trimming fat from the chain's operations has allowed Chart
House to cut the prices of its a la carte selections by up to 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
   He is also completing an overhaul of the menu. The food has been
upgraded, more seafood selections have been added, and presentation
has been improved. Salmon, formerly baked and served with a scoop
of white rice and butter, is now oven-roasted and served with
sesame sauce and coconut ginger rice. And there is a new stress on
high quality _ and high margin _ desserts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a remake of a tired old company of the past,'' said
Thomas Kully, manager of the WHI Select Fund, which holds 3.4
percent of Chart House's stock. He expects double-digit sales
growth over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   The menu overhaul has taken two years, and Thomas J. Walters,
chief executive of Chart House, who was hired in early 1998, said
he now wants to open new restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Customers seem to like the changes. The average sales for a
Chart House restaurant have risen to $2.38 million in 1998 from
$2.29 million in 1997. Walters thinks they can hit $3 million by
2001. To do that, he is shuttering poorly performing restaurants,
like those in New Orleans and St. Thomas, Virgin Islands. And he
will not open restaurants that cannot post sales of $3.5 million to
$4 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Chart House also bought Angelo &AMP; Maxie's, a steakhouse
in the Flatiron District of Manhattan, which makes money on high
volume and low costs.
</P>
<P>
   The company plans to transform some poorly performing Chart
Houses into Angelo &AMP; Maxie's, and to open five to eight more of
them in the next year.

CATHOLICS AND LUTHERANS EXPLORE COMMON GROUND 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By PETER STEINFELS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Oct. 31, 1517, Martin Luther, a 34-year-old priest, theology
professor and popular preacher, posted a Latin document on the door
of the Castle Church of Wittenberg, Germany. Within weeks, copies
of the document, containing 95 theses about church teachings on
indulgences, were being passed from hand to hand throughout
Germany, and a movement was under way that would radically alter
the world.
</P>
<P>
   The yearly anniversary of that event, celebrated in many
Protestant churches as Reformation Sunday, will be different this
Sunday. In Augsburg, Germany, Lutheran representatives from around
the world and a Roman Catholic cardinal with the blessing of the
pope will sign a Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of
Justification.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of justification triggered the Reformation when some
people began to believe that people were justified _ that is, saved
and brought into a right relationship with God _ strictly by God's
free gift of grace and of faith in Christ and not by anything that
humans might do or earn on their own.
</P>
<P>
   And for Luther and other reformers, the peddling of indulgences
was only one of many ways that the church fostered the illusion
that people could be saved by their own works or merits. The
reformers' passion on this point led to other deep disagreements
with Rome, and eventually with one another, about the use of
Scripture, the nature of church authority, the meaning of
priesthood and ministry, the understanding of sacraments and the
place of good works in pursuing holiness.
</P>
<P>
   But this Sunday, Lutheran and Catholic officials will declare
that, after four and a half centuries, they can affirm a consensus
on the basic truths about justification, and that the solemn
condemnations of one another's positions issued in the 16th century
no longer apply to the teachings of the churches as currently
understood.
</P>
<P>
   The joint declaration announces a ``common understanding'' of
justification: ``By grace alone, in faith in Christ's work and not
because of any merit on our part, we are accepted by God and
receive the Holy Spirit, who renews our hearts while equipping and
calling us to good words.''
</P>
<P>
   But the declaration also recognizes that Lutherans and Catholics
explicate this common understanding in different ways, regarding,
for example, whether people can be said to ``cooperate'' with God's
justifying grace, or in what sense the justified person should
still be thought of as a sinner, as in the famous Lutheran formula
``simul justus et peccator'' (``at once justified and sinner''), or
whether God will judge and reward people on the basis of their good
works.
</P>
<P>
   In each case, the declaration presents the common ground and
then examines the different Lutheran and Catholic formulations,
spelling out exactly what they are intended to emphasize and what
they are not trying to deny. By carefully paring away the more
polarized interpretations that may have arisen from past
theological polemics, the declaration proposes that, in some cases,
the differences are largely a matter of language and emphasis,
while in other cases, although real differences remain, they can
coexist within the framework of the common belief and do not merit
the 16th-century condemnations.
</P>
<P>
   This is subtle stuff, and not everyone agrees with it. The 2.6
million-member Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod, the largest American
Lutheran body outside the 5.1 million-member Evangelical Lutheran
Church in America and the 58.1 million-member Lutheran World
Federation, has called the joint declaration ``woefully inadequate
and misleading'' and ``a betrayal of the Gospel.''
</P>
<P>
   Some prominent Lutheran theologians in Germany seem to agree,
and in June 1998, when the Vatican announced that it would sign the
declaration, the announcement was accompanied by an ``Official
Response'' that appeared to challenge some of the agreement's
central claims and even cast doubt on the legitimacy of the
Lutheran World Federation as a partner that could represent
Lutherans in signing the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   This came as a considerable shock because the Vatican had been
intimately involved in the years of dialogue and drafting that
produced the joint declaration. Indeed, it took a burst of
ecumenical diplomacy to keep the whole process from shipwreck.
</P>
<P>
   What will it mean, then, when Cardinal Edward Idris Cassidy,
president of the Vatican's Pontifical Coucil for Promoting
Christian Unity, and the Rev. Ishmael Noko, general secretary of
the Lutheran World Federation, along with Bishop Christian Krause,
the Federation's president, and five vice presidents from the
United States, Slovakia, Nigeria, Brazil and India, walk in
procession from the Cathedral of Augsburg to the Church of St. Anne
and there sign the declaration?
</P>
<P>
   If the declaration achieves greater unity between Lutherans and
Catholics, it will be spiritual and not yet structural. Although
the declaration finds that the remaining differences about
justification are not ``church-dividing,'' it recognizes other
basic questions that remain unresolved. The declaration simply
clears the path so that those topics can be addressed.
</P>
<P>
   It also provides ``a vehicle and a procedure'' for addressing
those topics, said Margaret O'Gara, a Catholic theologian from the
University of St. Michael's College in Toronto, a way for thinking
that has been developed in theological circles to get official
affirmation and wider reception.
</P>
<P>
   One immediate effect, said the Rev. Michael Root, a professor of
systematic theology at Trinity Lutheran Seminary in Columbus, Ohio,
and a scholar who helped draft the declaration when he was director
of the Institute for Ecumenical Research in Strasbourg, France,
should be to destroy stereotypes that many Catholics and Lutherans
still entertain about one another's beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Not a few Lutherans still think that the Catholic Church teaches
that people are saved by their own power and good works rather than
by unmerited grace, Root pointed out, and Catholics often suppose
that the Lutheran insistence on salvation by grace and faith make
Lutherans unconcerned about how they live out the Christian life in
deeds. Noko said the declaration could produce ``a further
reduction of `enemy images.'''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, by drawing attention to what Catholics and Lutherans
hold in common, the declaration not only forces both groups back to
Christian basics, but may encourage believers in each tradition to
explore more deeply the spiritual riches of their own theological
heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stated in simple terms,'' Noko said, ``the doctrine of
justification refers to the faith that we are accepted by God as
persons, not because we are good, but because God is good.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we claim to be self-made,'' he added, ``we deceive
ourselves and will easily lack the love and generosity to other
which are characteristic of the Christian life.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a doctrine, in other words, that raises profound
questions about an American culture exalting independence and
self-reliance. But for Ms. O'Gara, ``In an achievement-based
culture, this teaching is good news _ it says God does it for us;
God empowers us to transform the world, and we don't have to rely
on our own paltry resources.''

BUSH REBUFFS CRITICISM OVER NO-SHOW IN NEW HAMPSHIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PEGGY FIKAC  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush on Friday shrugged off barbs
from his Republican presidential rivals after attending a ceremony
honoring his wife instead of appearing at a New Hampshire political
forum the night before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you married? Then you know why I wasn't there,'' Bush told
one reporter when asked about his criticized decision to skip
Thursday's forum for candidates seeking the GOP presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the most important thing is I won my wife's affection.
I think the people of New Hampshire understand a husband supporting
his wife,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP front-runner, however, was more serious when asked about
a poll showing that a rival, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, is
gaining ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a lot of work to do. And we've got a strategy and a
plan, and I think it's going to yield good results,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I recognize there's a long way between now and Election
Day, and I feel good about our organization. I feel great about the
size of the crowds that are showing up. And our ads are beginning
to run. We'll see what happens,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Welcoming costumed children with his wife, Laura, for
pre-Halloween trick-or-treating and photos in front of the
Governor's Mansion, Bush said he had not yet watched Thursday's
televised forum in Hanover.
</P>
<P>
   He cited his schedule as governor and the ceremony in Dallas
honoring Mrs. Bush as a distinguished alumna of Southern Methodist
University.
</P>
<P>
   Four of Bush's five GOP challengers faulted the governor for
failing to join the second candidates' forum in six days in the
state with the nation's first presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's ample time for debates,'' Bush said Friday. ``I'm
going to be up there in December.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's forum came after Bush last week attended a Vermont
fund-raiser rather than a forum for GOP candidates at the
University of New Hampshire. Bush has agreed, however, to face his
rivals in Manchester, N.H., on Dec. 2.
</P>
<P>
   After a man who accompanied a child to the Governor's Mansion
told the governor he agreed with his decision to be with his wife
Thursday, Bush summoned a reporter to spread the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``I rest my case,'' Bush said.

STOCKS RALLY AGAIN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stocks extended their powerful rally Friday, the 70th
anniversary of Black Tuesday, as the Nasdaq composite index moved
into record territory and blue-chip stocks pulled to within 5
percent of the record they set in August.
</P>
<P>
   Trading was heavy, surpassing a billion shares on the New York
Stock Exchange for the second consecutive day, and analysts were
also cheered by another session, rare for much of this year, in
which far more issues rose than fell. Long-term interest rates
eased again, as much as one-tenth of a percentage point for many
Treasury securities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a follow through from the euphoria'' produced by
Thursday's economic data and reassuring words by Alan Greenspan,
the Federal Reserve chairman, said Andrew M. Brooks, chief trader
at T. Rowe Price in Baltimore. ``What a difference a couple weeks
make.''
</P>
<P>
   At mid-month, the Dow Jones industrial average was more than 11
percent below the peak it reached on Aug. 25, qualifying as a
correction, and seemed destined to slip below the 10,000 mark and
possibly deteriorate by 20 percent into a bear market.
</P>
<P>
   But the index, which rose 107.33 points Friday, or 1 percent, to
10,731.76, has posted seven hefty advances in the last 10 sessions
as investors and traders acted on a round of generally buoyant
profit reports, government statistics suggesting that inflation
remains subdued and a growing belief that Greenspan will decide
only one more increase in short-term rates is needed to slow
unsustainably fast growth of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan told top corporate officials on Thursday evening that
the rise in rates this year has clearly begun to work, and his
comments seemed to nudge market sentiment closer to a toss-up about
whether the Fed will raise rates at its policy meeting on Nov. 16.
</P>
<P>
   A poll by Reuters Friday found 18 economists expecting a
quarter-point increase and 12 predicting the central bank will
leave rates alone. Confirming the Greenspan view, the Commerce
Department said Friday that new homes were sold in September at the
slowest pace in nearly two years.
</P>
<P>
   Other positive developments have been the agreement in
Washington to lift Depression-era barriers on the banking,
securities and insurance industries and the drying up of
tax-motivated selling by mutual funds as they approached the end of
their bookkeeping year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing a number of things that undercut or at least
mitigate the inflation fears,'' said Clare W. Zempel, chief
investment strategist at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee, citing among
other things the government report on Thursday showing lower than
expected upward pressure on wages and benefits over the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury prices also responded favorably to the data and
Greenspan's comments. The price of the benchmark 30-year bond rose
1 5/32, to 99 16/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite
direction from the price, fell to 6.16 percent from 6.25 percent on
Thursday. The price climbed 2{ points during the week, the biggest
weekly gain since Oct. 2, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In another good weekly performance, the gain in the Dow amounted
to 260 points after a 450-point surge last week. The record for the
index, which will add Microsoft, Intel, Home Depot and SBC
Communications and remove Goodyear Tire and Rubber, Sears &AMP;
Roebuck, Chevron and Union Carbide on Monday, is 11,326.04 on Aug.
25.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq's surge Friday was even more impressive, 91.21 points, or
3.17 percent, to 2,966.43, handily surpassing the record of
2,915.95 set Oct. 11. Intel set the pace, rising 5\, to 77 7/16,
after it said it could satisfy demand for computer chips.
Microsoft, Cisco and Sun Microsystems were also big contributors.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index gained 20.49 points, or
1.53 percent, to 1,362.93, 4 percent below its July 16 peak.
</P>
<P>
   The resurgent optimism was reflected in a spectacular market
debut by Akamai Technologies. The company, based in Cambridge,
Mass., provides a service that speeds delivery of Web pages but had
no revenue, much less profits, in 1998. Its shares, offered by
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter at 26, began trading at 110 and traded
as high as 166 before closing at 145 3/16.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks mostly took a breather after a string of gains
_ American Express, down 7, to 154, was the biggest drag on the Dow
_ and Lockheed was battered after announcing a 50 percent reduction
in likely earnings next year and the departure of its president.
Its shares dropped 2 15/16, to 20, after trading as low as 16].
</P>
<P>
   Paper stocks were outstanding, with International Paper jumping
4 3/16, to 52|, to make the biggest positive contribution to the
Dow. Bowater and Champion also spurted more than 4 points each
while Georgia-Pacific rose more than 3.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas market were also sharply higher, with major indexes up
3.03 percent in Tokyo, 3.9 percent in Hong Kong, 2.95 percent in
Paris, 1.73 percent in London, 2.29 percent in Mexico City and 1.99
percent in Toronto. Frankfurt was 0.85 percent higher while Sao
Paulo finished unchanged. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   _ Watch your cholesterol levels. Tests show that a high level of
cholesterol in the blood speeds up hardening of the arteries. Ideal
levels currently are believed to be 200 (milligrams per deciliter
of blood) or under, but that may be declining even further. A diet
high in saturated fat and cholesterol is a main cause of high blood
cholesterol and high LDL levels, the ``bad'' cholesterol. A blood
test is used to detect levels and is recommended at least once
every five years for people over 20.
</P>
<P>
   _ Maintain a healthy weight. Obesity tends to increase the risk
of heart attack, especially in those with an ``apple'' shape -
having a pot belly. Losing even a few pounds can lower your levels
of ``bad'' cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   _ Be more physically active. Lack of exercise is a major risk
factor for heart disease. Studies show that people who get regular
aerobic exercise have better cardiovascular fitness.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't smoke. Scientists believe that smoking speeds up
hardening of the arteries, possibly by damaging the artery walls
and allowing cholesterol to deposit. Smoking doubles your risk of
heart attack and increases the risk of sudden cardiac death to two
to four times that of nonsmokers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Watch your blood pressure. High blood pressure is a major risk
factor. Cutting back on salt and losing weight can help lower
levels. Check at least every two years.
</P>
<P>
   _ Try to reduce stress, and don't drink more than one or two
alcoholic beverages daily, if you drink at all. Programs such as
biofeedback, or a new stress reducer called Freeze Frame offered by
Boca Raton, Fla., cardiologist Dr. Seth Baum, aim to promote
relaxation without medication.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you take contraceptives, get regular checkups. The Pill can
sometimes cause high blood pressure, blood clots, or abnormal blood
fats, particularly if you smoke.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't disregard leg pain. Pain or cramps in the legs, hips,
thighs or calves could be a sign of vascular disease, which can
show up along with coronary artery disease.
</P>
<P>
   _ Consider new tests such as cardiac scoring that measure the
levels of calcium buildup in your arteries. A controversial,
noninvasive procedure, the heart scan isn't covered by insurance
and can cost about $350. However, proponents believe it's 98
percent accurate in evaluating your risk for heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a new technology that's very interesting. People without
symptoms may be at some very high risk,'' said Dr. Barry Horowitz,
on the board of the Florida affiliate of the Heart Association.
``Some of the preliminary data seems to show a good correlation
between the amount of calcium in the arteries and blockage.''

 &HT;    A heart to heart about angioplasty
 &HT;    (ATTENTION: Florida editors.)
 &HT;    By Carolyn Susman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ It was a hot August Monday and TV
newsman Jim Sackett was mowing the lawn of his Wellington home when
he felt that pain.
</P>
<P>
   The scary kind. The kind that sits in your chest, and shoots up
your arms, and attacks your neck and jaw.
</P>
<P>
   It was a familiar pain, more intense than the last time he felt
it, but it had always gone away before.
</P>
<P>
   Not this time. Not even after nearly two hours of waiting, and
pacing his living room, and trying to keep his fear from his wife,
Paula.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he asked the question that saved his life: ``God,'' he
said, ``what should I do?''
</P>
<P>
   ``And a voice said, 'Go to the hospital,' `` recalled Sackett, a
practicing Catholic. ``It wasn't mine. It was very quick and very
fleeting, and I don't think it was my imagination. Otherwise, I
don't think I would have gone.''
</P>
<P>
   The 54-year-old news anchor was having a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years of smoking _ along with a lack of physical
activity, high cholesterol, and being overweight _ had clogged his
arteries sufficiently to disrupt the blood flow to his heart.
</P>
<P>
   Sackett was able to drive himself to Wellington Regional
Hospital, where he was evaluated and transferred to JFK Medical
Center in Atlantis. Along with Delray Medical Center and Palm Beach
Gardens Medical Center, JFK is one of three facilities in Palm
Beach County offering specialized cardiac care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two of his vessels were completely (diseased) and a third was
moderately,'' said Dr. Michael Lakow, a cardiologist at JFK, who
performed an angioplasty on Sackett the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Introduced in the United States 20 years ago, angioplasty is an
increasingly common nonsurgical procedure used to widen narrowed
coronary arteries. It usually involves using a thin, plastic tube
or catheter to deliver a balloon into the artery to open it,
although sometimes lasers are used.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, we only had (the choice of) a handful of catheters,
and they were stiff and dangerous to deliver balloons,'' said Dr.
Alan Zelcer, medical director of the cardiac catherization
laboratory at Delray Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still had reasonable results, but we worked on patients who
were relatively well. Generally, we chose low-risk cases and we
would have to make sure the blockages were in relatively good-sized
vessels in relatively good-sized areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``With advances in technology for construction of balloons and
catheters, we now can work in vessels of almost any size or
location, and we've been able to work in vessels with multiple
blockages and sometimes with very poor situations.''
</P>
<P>
   And with the recent introduction of stents, tiny spring-like
coils that are used like scaffolding to hold open arteries, there
is less chance that a vessel will collapse after it's been opened,
which had been a problem.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the last year statistics were provided by the American
Heart Association, 660,000 angioplasties were performed in the U.S.
on both men and women.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably the most common interventional procedure in
cardiology,'' said Dr. Jay Midwall, director of the cardiovascular
laboratory at JFK. ``Initially, the success rate was approximately
50 percent of all patients. Now, it's more like 99 percent. That's
probably because it's done more frequently, and we know who to do
it on.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a risk of heart attack, and even death, with the
procedure, but it's considered relatively safe, with about 1
percent to 3 percent of patients needing an emergency coronary
bypass operation when the procedure fails to open the artery.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Howard Bush, an interventional cardiologist with the
Cleveland Clinic in Fort Lauderdale, said that nationally, the
average heart patient is in the mid-60s. But whatever age, quality
of life and survival are key to evaluating whether the angioplasty
should be done.
</P>
<P>
   ``A blockage doesn't necessarily need to be fixed unless it
impacts the quality of life or survival. Physicians should be
honest and ethical. If you're shoveling snow for a living, and
you've got a side street that doesn't need to be cleared, you
wouldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Sackett was a good candidate for angioplasty because of his
relative youth and good heart function.
</P>
<P>
   He remembers little about it, although it takes less than an
hour and is performed while the patient is awake.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had some sort of amnesiac effect,'' Sackett said of the
drug he was given to relax him. ``I don't remember a thing, but
supposedly I was answering questions, like, did I feel any pain?''
Doctors say it's not uncommon for angioplasty patients, who are
always mildly sedated, to be unable to recall the procedure
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   The procedure was successful in opening his clogged arteries,
but in up to 30 percent of patients, the widened part of the artery
re-narrows within six months. Then, the angioplasty might be
performed again, a stent may be added, or bypass surgery might be
done, depending on the progress of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Sackett doesn't want any further problems. He's had his wakeup
call.
</P>
<P>
   ``My diet's going to change, and the smoking has stopped. And
I'm going to go buy a bike. I've heard horror stories about people
who have gone back (for procedures) three or four times. I don't
want that to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   He's even given up drinking the whole milk he loves and eating
the six to seven tacos he used to gobble at a time. His daily
routine now includes cholesterol-lowering medication and aspirin.
</P>
<P>
   But he worries, still.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there a point I could put too much stress on my heart?'' he
asks. ``Is this eventually gonna kill me? It's in the back of my
mind. Or if I get a twinge in my chest, I think, 'Oh, God, what's
that?' ``
</P>
<P>
   Ken Sherman of Delray Beach understands the self-doubt, the fear
that heart disease can engender.
</P>
<P>
   The 64-year-old has been battling heart disease for five years
and had angioplasties in 1996 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before I had heart disease, I was a little reckless and
overweight,'' he said. ``When I got sick, it slowed me down. I know
I'm not 100 percent well. I was a little frail in the beginning.
Psychologically, I felt incompetent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still coming to terms with myself. I know that life is
more attitude than anything else. The angioplasty has given me a
lot more strength and endurance, but I still don't like to be too
far from home base.''
</P>
<P>
   His physician, Dr. Edward Mostel of Palm Beach Gardens,
recommended he read books by ultra low-fat diet advocate Dr. Dean
Ornish, whose program is now being studied by Medicare as an
alternative to heart surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman said he has changed his eating habits and is trying to
reduce stress in his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to change to accommodate the problem. You have to
fight. If you don't, you don't make it.''
</P>
<P>
   Reckless and overweight. How many people can say that about
themselves?
</P>
<P>
   Too many, say doctors, who would like to see Americans tame
their lifestyles before they have any outward signs of heart
disease, America's No. 1 killer of both sexes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to be very involved and look at risk factors and
control at an early age,'' says Dr. Barry Horowitz, a West Palm
Beach endocrinologist and a member of the board of the Florida
affiliate of the American Heart Association in West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heart disease takes years to develop. There are seven and
eight year olds who have died of accidents and other causes who
were found (during autopsies) to have, on a typical American diet,
blockages built up in the body.''
</P>
<P>
   So, forget about thinking you don't have to be concerned with
diet until a certain age.
</P>
<P>
   Sackett, for example, should not have been drinking whole milk,
the Heart Association says. Adults don't need all that fat. He is
grudgingly mixing 1 percent and 2 percent fat milk with skim milk
to adjust. He used to slather his baked potatoes with butter and
eat his chicken with the skin on, habits he now is breaking.
</P>
<P>
   It's also important to know the signs of heart attack. Sackett
had felt symptoms for about a year but never sought treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Pain or pressure in the chest, shoulders, arms, and neck are
common signs, and so is a feeling of nausea, feeling faint or out
of breath, and sweating.
</P>
<P>
   The Heart Association urges people to seek help immediately when
these symptoms show up. Not all symptoms occur with every attack,
and they can subside and return, as they did with Sackett. But
waiting can be fatal.
</P>
<P>
   It took a couple weeks for Sackett to get the nerve to ask his
physician just how close he came to dying.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very, very serious,'' Sackett said. ``If I hadn't taken
action, we wouldn't be talking now.''

DORLING-KINDERSLEY, AN EMPIRE BUILT ON COLLEGIALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, October 31) 
 &HT;    (DW) 
 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Eter Kindersley bicycles from his home across the River
Thames every morning, slicing through traffic to his office in
Covent Garden, his suit pants bound with steel clips to avoid
catching in the sprockets. Kindersley, chairman and former chief
executive of the British publisher Dorling Kindersley, then marches
up four flights of stairs, dismissing the lift as simply a modern
excuse for laziness.
</P>
<P>
   Kindersley, 58, admits upfront that he is not exactly in the
mainstream of a business now dominated by global conglomerates. ``I
was trained as a painter and not a business person at all,'' he
said, sitting in the office that he shares with James Middlehurst,
who took over as chief executive in August 1998 to supply the
financial skills that Kindersley admittedly lacks. ``I run the
company as much more a workshop session rather than as a
hierarchical business.''
</P>
<P>
   Kindersley is a publishing throwback _ one whose old-fashioned
independence of mind is such that he and his partner in the
company's 1974 founding have largely ceased speaking to each other
over Kindersley's resistance to selling out.
</P>
<P>
   Kindersley has changed little since he toiled away on the
company's first book, illustrating photography techniques for
tradesmen.
</P>
<P>
   But the company has.
</P>
<P>
   Though modest by the standards of the industry's giants, Dorling
Kindersley now publishes more than 300 titles a year. This year,
capitalizing on its reputation for distinctive illustration, the
company has reached deals to publish licensed books _ tied to
brands or products _ for Mattel's Barbie line, for the National
Football League and for the Star Wars series (an exclusive,
seven-year deal initiated by George Lucas).
</P>
<P>
   Yet in a consolidating industry, the company has remained
stubbornly independent. Kindersley, whose gentle demeanor belies a
determination to chart his own course, would not have it any other
way. Walt Disney, W.H. Smith of Britain and Microsoft are among the
suitors who have approached him, but he has rebuffed every offer.
</P>
<P>
   Kindersley began Dorling Kindersley with no grand ambitions. ``I
set up the company because I had a wife and two children to feed,
and I had fallen out with my previous company in a fairly serious
way,'' he said. The issue was what Kindersley calls the failure of
that company, also a publisher, to make good on the promise of a 5
percent stake for becoming art director.
</P>
<P>
   His old experience and his new predicament inspired him to start
a new kind of publisher. ``I was so horrified by how boring it was
because it was so word-based _ there was no interest in what a book
looked like,'' he said. ``It was just this sort of university
mentality where every shred of aesthetic had been pressed out of
them. I thought I must do something about this or I'll never
survive.''
</P>
<P>
   After that first photography book, he moved into children's and
reference books. Since 1991, the company has also sold more than 40
million of its Eyewitness Guides travel series.
</P>
<P>
   All these books have made Kindersley rich. He holds a 7.8
percent stake in a company worth $348 million.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he still feels poor. ``It was strictly survival then and it
is still survival today,'' he said. ``I begin to feel poor if the
company doesn't do well.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorling Kindersley has always been a family affair. His wife,
Juliet, an artist, has been a board member since the company's
founding. His son, Barnabas, took the photographs for Dorling
Kindersley's 1995 children's best seller, ``Children Just Like
Me.'' His daughter, Rosie, is the company's food editor.
</P>
<P>
   Though Kindersley treats most of the staff like family, his
refusal to sell out has alienated his original partner, Christopher
Dorling. Dorling, who retired in 1987 but remains a board member,
could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   With trademark elements like the DK logo on every cover and
spine ``You can spot a Dorling book a mile off,'' said Lorna
Tilbian, an analyst at West LB Panmure in London. But Kindersley's
business acumen does not match his flair for design, Ms. Tilbian
added, saying, ``There is nobody in this industry who can combine
creative skills with financial skills.''
</P>
<P>
   It was wobbly financial performance that helped prompt
Kindersley to hand day-to-day operations over to Middlehurst, a
former entertainment executive. The company lost 77 percent of its
stock market value from 1996 to 1998 as it struggled to introduce a
line of CD-ROM's and manage its investments in emerging markets.
The shares have since rebounded, closing Friday at $4.83.
</P>
<P>
   But Kindersley would much rather talk about books than finance.
</P>
<P>
   After much prodding, he explains why Kindersley remains second
in the company name. It is for esthetic, not business reasons. ``KD
doesn't work so well, does it?'' he said. ``DK sounds better.''

<P>
   ORDZHONIKIDZEVSKAYA, Russia _ An early autumn chill has
descended on the border regions around Chechnya, fast on the heels
of fighting that has forced almost 200,000 Chechens to flee their
homes as Russian troops bomb and strafe their breakaway republic.
</P>
<P>
   For Haji Zubarev and his extended family of 25 people, who fled
the Chechen town of Sernovodsk two weeks ago, home is now an empty
field here about a mile inside the Ingushetia side of the border.
At night, when the temperatures drop, the men huddle for warmth on
the back of an open truck; while the women gather in a beat-up van,
bundling up their infants in layers of clothes.
</P>
<P>
   The creeping cold is a major worry of the few international aid
agencies working to help refugees. Chechens have been fleeing their
homes in droves since late September, when Moscow began its
military campaign against guerrillas whom it blames for attacks
neighboring regions and for masterminding bombings in Russian
cities.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Chechen refugees have come here to Ingushetia, and
found lodging with the local population, in some cases paying
exorbitant rents. About 15,000 are housed in railway carriages and
tent cities set up by Russian authorities. But another 12,000
people are still sleeping in bus and rail stations, in sheds and
warehouse or, like the Zubarev family, inside their own vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shelter and winter, these are very important and serious
worries,'' said Viktor Andreyev, a Moscow-based policy adviser for
the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, which has delivered
$600,000 worth of food, tents and other assistance to refugees from
Chechnya since the fighting began in late September.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian government, which initially was slow to react to the
flow of refugees from Chechnya, resists calling it a crisis, or
even asking foreign organizations for help.
</P>
<P>
   But international agencies have another concern in the North
Caucasus, and that is kidnapping and violence, which over the last
several years, have driven nearly all foreign aid and human rights
workers out of Chechnya and its surrounding regions, including
Ingushetia.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the 1994-96 war here, when Russian troops tried
unsuccessfully to put down a secessionist movement in Chechnya, the
region was swept with a wave of lawlessness, as Chechen warlords _
some of them former war heroes _ turned to hostage-taking as a way
of stocking their warchests.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most shocking cases of violence was the murder in
December 1996 of six foreign hospital workers of the International
Committee of the Red Cross, who were killed by armed assailants in
their dormitory in the Chechen town of Novye Atagi. In January
1998, the director of the U.N. refugee agency's office for the
North Caucasus, in northern Ossetia, was kidnapped and held hostage
for 11 months.
</P>
<P>
   All told, Russian security officials say that more than 2,000
people _ including Chechens, Russians as well as foreigners _ have
been taken hostage in and around Chechnya since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was one case after another,'' said Mamar Melzouk, who
heads the Moscow-based mission of the Doctors Without Borders, the
French organization that recently was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize
for its heroic work in war zones around the world. ``The
humanitarian world became a target. It is obvious that the risk is
very, very high.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors Without Borders maintained a large and visible mission
in the region during the 1994-96 war, in which tens of thousands of
civilians were killed. But in 1996, when the war ended with a
victory for the Chechen rebels, the organization withdrew from the
region, soon after two of its employees were kidnapped.
</P>
<P>
   So far in the current conflict, Doctors Without Borders has not
returned. ``The security and access to beneficiaries are not
assured, and because of those criteria, we are not planning to
intervene for the moment,'' said Melzouk. ``We know problems are
arising, especially with the oncoming winter. But it is a very
complicated issue.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Ingush security forces, no kidnappings are known to
have taken place in the region in the last two months, although a
reporter for the newspaper Moscow News, who has been missing for
two weeks, was last seen in Ingushtia. But local authorities
concede that the situation is dangerous, and provide armed guards
to journalists and aid workers who come in for short trips to the
border regions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can go for a few days but not longer, and it is better to
go without warning,'' said Samuel Marie-Sanon, general coordinator
for Doctors of the World, another French medical aid organization,
who made his last trip to Ingushetia two weeks ago. ``You make the
opportunities rare, so as to limit the risks.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   (Doctors of the World, the last foreign aid agency to maintain a
presence in the Chechen capital, Grozny, withdrew its Chechen staff
on Thursday as Russian warplanes and artillery stepped their
attacks on the city. Thousands of residents were fleeing the city
on Friday, news agencies reported.)
</P>
<P>
   According to Marie-Sanon, Chechen doctors _ left in charge when
his group's French doctors left Grozny in 1998 _ continue to
monitor the estimated 4,000 refugees living in camps inside
Chechnya, where he said medicine is in critically short supply,
especially for people suffering from chronic conditions like
diabetes or heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   The International Committee of the Red Cross, in cooperation
with the Russian Red Cross, has brought in 60 tons of food and
other aid supplies to the border region from its stockpiles in
Nalchik.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest burden has fallen on Ingushetia itself, a region
with a population of about 300,000 that is still coping with
refugees from the previous Chechen conflict, in addition to the
65,000 Ingush refugees who arrived here in the early 1990s from
North Ossetia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to feed an entire city,'' said the Ingush president,
Ruslan Aushev, who has continually pressed the Russian government
to step up assistance for a ``catastrophe'' that Moscow refuses to
recognize. ``I keep telling them, this is not my problem, it is
your problem, one that you created, not me.''
</P>
<P>
   At a newss conference in Moscow on Thursday, Aushev said that
more than 10,000 refugees have received medical care, and 1,500
have been hospitalized, including 50 who were wounded in the
fighting, according to Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
   According to Marie-Sanon, the cold weather has compounded health
problems among the refugees, with cases of respiratory diseases
rising sharply among young children and the elderly. He said the
current fighting has also sparked a rise in mental health problems,
especially among children. ``We are seeing children who can't
sleep, who have nightmares, and show aggressive behavior,'' he
said. ``For them, the sight of an airplane can be a real trauma.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Zubarev family, the latest war is merely a continuation
of the first. When the Russian planes started attacking the Chechen
town of Sernovodsk, Zubarev, a 42-year-old chauffeur, drove his
family into nearby Ingushetia, leaving them near the border so he
could go back and forth to check on his house and his livestock.
</P>
<P>
   When he went back the last time, he said, Russian troops had
intensified their attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be sorry if they were going after the guerrillas,
but they are attacking the civilian population,'' he said. ``I
don't know if there were any guerrillas in Sernovodsk, but if there
were, they are gone now, and the only ones left are old people.''
</P>
<P>
   As Zubarev talked to reporters, one of his relatives, a young
woman with her black scarf tied around her hair, stepped into the
middle of the conversation. ``For eight years now, we have been
giving interviews,'' she said, her voice shifting to a shout.
``Talking isn't enough. When is somebody going to come and help
us?''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For Bob Aylward, vice president of the Seattle Mariners baseball
team for business and sales, having a wireless phone in the office
is just as vital as having one on the road.
</P>
<P>
   In its three-month-old home stadium, Safeco Field, the team has
installed an AT&AMP;T phone system that gives 150 office and operations
employees wireless phones that share a number with the phones on
their desks.
</P>
<P>
   Both phones ring on every call _ an especially helpful feature
on game days, when Aylward could be anywhere in the stadium,
escorting visitors or dealing with one minor crisis or another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our office is not just the four walls where our phone is, but
really the whole facility,'' he said. ``Being able to have the
calls follow you is a great way to cut down on missed calls.''
</P>
<P>
   Safeco Field is among hundreds of workplaces that have been
early adopters of so-called wireless office technology, seeking
more freedom for executives and employees whose jobs often take
them away from their desks. Beyond addressing the needs of frequent
travelers and telecommuters, companies that switch to wireless
systems are recognizing that many people can be mobile workers
within their own offices.
</P>
<P>
   At a Sony compact disk manufacturing plant in Springfield, Ore.,
Sandy McCallen is one of about 80 managers and technicians who have
wireless phones linked to their desk phones, freeing them to roam
the 400-employee plant. Ms. McCallen, the plant's
telecommunications specialist, said that during a particularly busy
period last year she was getting 300 calls a week that otherwise
would have wound up on her voice mail and taken hours to return.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Nelson, president of K.C. Hopps, a chain of eight
microbrewery-restaurants in Kansas and Missouri, said all 10 of the
company's top managers had Sprint PCS wireless phones. He said he
hoped to have them all equipped with wireless data access soon.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said the company spent an extra $50 to $220 a month for
each wireless phone, depending on individual use. But those added
costs are balanced with savings on long-distance calls, because
Sprint bills the company for all calls at local rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the long run, we're probably just about break-even, with
the long-distance credit and the extra cost of being mobile,''
Nelson said. ``But the amount of value I get by the key people
having a phone with them at all times is huge.''
</P>
<P>
   Having the office phone follow you day and night can seem as
much a curse as a blessing to employees who resent the intrusion of
work into their personal lives. But many managers using wireless
phones say they'd prefer to hear right away when important issues
arise at night or on a weekend, rather than having to catch up
later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can conduct business as usual pretty much 24 hours a day,
which is important, being in a start-up,'' said Thomas Lazay,
president of Voice Signal Technologies, a speech-recognition
software company based in Cambridge, Mass., which he helped found
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, Lazay began using an Omnipoint wireless phone
for about half of his work calls and all of his personal calls, and
to gain data access through a laptop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now at least I can deal with things and not have to worry
about them when I'm away from work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, there are times when even he prefers to be out of
touch: ``Certainly, when I'm going out to a nice dinner or
something, I just leave my phone at home.''
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of workplaces are introducing wireless phones
even when round-the-clock accessibility isn't an issue. Aylward of
the Mariners said that just having the members of his staff
immediately reachable throughout the work day, whether they were in
the next room or out in left field, helped him prioritize his
instructions to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's something that's not urgent, you can do it through
e-mail,'' he said. ``If it's a more urgent matter, then you know
you can reach the person.''
</P>
<P>
   Wireless phone companies are promoting a vision of workplaces
without any traditional ``land line'' phones. But Robert Egan,
research director for mobile and wireless communication at the
Gartner Group, a consulting firm, said he didn't expect a
significant trend toward companies abandoning traditional phones
and desktop computers for wireless phones and laptops for six years
or so: the technology simply has not caught up with the vision.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, while a few individuals here and there may go
all-wireless, companies are generally using wireless networks to
augment rather than replace existing voice systems. AT&AMP;T's Wireless
Services unit, which equipped both Safeco Field and the Sony plant
with dual wireless and traditional voice systems, has sold similar
systems to 355 of the Fortune 500 companies, according to Kenneth
Woo, an AT&AMP;T spokesman.

<P>
   Widespread adoption of all-wireless data networks, linking
employees' laptop computers to one another and to the Internet, is
probably even farther away because of limitations on transmission
speed and reliability, though manufacturers are racing to address
those problems with new products.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, wireless data networking ``is very well suited as an
occasional alternative,'' said Egan, who is experimenting with an
all-wireless work environment in his home office in North
Smithfield, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, you're sitting at an airport where there's no
data port available. Your choices are do nothing or use a slow link
to get some kind of access and increase your productivity,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Lazay of Voice Signal Technologies said the convenience of
wireless data access, even in its early stages, often outweighed
its lack of speed. Last month, with Hurricane Floyd racing toward
the Northeast, Lazay was hurrying from his home in Boston to help
his parents close up their summer house in Branford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   He spent most of the three-hour drive on his wireless phone,
talking to his office and joining a conference call with a client.
Halfway across Rhode Island, Lazay pulled over on the side of the
road and dispatched several urgent e-mails from his laptop.
</P>
<P>
   Without the wireless data connection, he said, ``I would have
had to knock on someone's door and borrow their phone line.''

TYCO INTERNATIONAL'S SHARES DROP AFTER REPORT ON DUBIOUS
ACCOUNTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID LEONHARDT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shares of Tyco International fell almost 9 percent Friday after
a report raised more questions about the company's accounting
practices.
</P>
<P>
   The report, a column by Floyd Norris in The New York Times on
Friday, said that Tyco had failed to inform investors about charges
taken by two companies shortly before Tyco acquired them, thus
inflating Tyco's earnings. Tyco's shares fell $3.875, to $40.125,
in very heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock has
fallen about 25 percent in the last three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Friday afternoon, Tyco released a letter from its chief
financial officer, Mark Swartz, to Norris, criticizing his
analysis. In his letter, Swartz said that Tyco's income statements
did include the losses for the two acquired companies, AMP Inc. and
United States Surgical, but that the charges did not warrant a
separate entry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tyco's accounting adheres to the letter and spirit'' of
generally accepted accounting practices and to regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission, he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   About the charges taken on the acquisitions, Swartz wrote:
``What I said is that what may not be clear to some investors are
the various components of these losses.''
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the issue is whether the company's accounting
methods during a $30 billion acquisition spree over the last three
years have been too aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 10, a Dallas investment manager, David Tice, sent a
letter to his clients saying that Tyco had taken big charges
associated with its acquisitions and that its cash flow was not as
strong as many believed. Until then, shares of Tyco, a
manufacturing conglomerate, had easily outpaced the major stock
indexes during the bull market of the 1990's.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 14, responding to the stock's fall, Tyco chief executive
L. Dennis Kozlowski told Wall Street analysts that Tice's report
lacked merit and that Tyco was in excellent condition. Tice has
stood by his analysis.

 -1stLD &HT;    AUTHORITARIAN POLITICAL TRADITION SURVIVES ON EVE OF FIRST
MEXICAN PRIMARY ELECTION
 &HT;    EDS: Restores dropped lines at end of story.
 &HT;    1,100&AMP;add
 &HT;    NOTE: Ecatepec is in the state of Mexico about five miles north
of Mexico City.
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ECATEPEC, Mexico Gabriel Medina says he recently got his job
peddling a bicycle taxi by agreeing to join Mexico's ruling
Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
</P>
<P>
   Because he has little education and few marketable skills,
Medina intends to keep that $10-a-day job by doing exactly what a
local PRI-affiliated leader tells him to do. That's why he
dutifully accepted his leader's instruction about a month ago to
put campaign bumper stickers for PRI presidential hopeful Francisco
Labastida on his cab.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida, the leader told Medina and about 70 other workers,
was the best man to vote for in Mexico's historic Nov. 7
presidential primary _ the first ever held by the powerful PRI,
which has controlled Mexico's highest office for seven decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's true that Mr. Labastida will help us, I don't mind
voting for him,'' shrugged Medina, 21, who has to pay his leader $1
a week for the right to drive his bicycle taxi around this
sprawling working-class city just
</P>
<P>
   outside Mexico's capital. ``Me, I just want to work and live
without any problems. The truth is I don't think our lives will
change much no matter which of these politicians is elected.''
</P>
<P>
   Medina's compliance _ and his party leader's pressure _
represent the street-level version of a system deeply ingrained in
Mexico's political life. It's known here by the nickname ``la
cargada.'' And it means, loosely, that PRI-affiliated state
governors down to the lowest party functionary will ``carry'' a
candidate's campaign by using subtle to extreme coercion as well as
public resources to garner votes.
</P>
<P>
   Allegations of a widespread ``cargada'' in favor of Labastida
have become a flash point in the PRI's Nov. 7 primary election.
Labastida, who was most recently Mexico's interior minister, and
another candidate, Roberto Madrazo, the former Tabasco state
governor, are locked in a close race that has them fighting for the
endorsement of PRI sympathizers.
</P>
<P>
   For decades the PRI has dominated Mexican politics in large part
by mustering to the polls its vast network of PRI-affiliated
unions, neighborhoods, farmers and business associations. These are
groups that have long held the keys to jobs, contracts and simple
services like water, drainage, electricity and food subsidies in
this country where half the population lives in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, candidates for all elections here have been
selected by party leaders without primaries. For the 70 years that
the PRI has controlled the presidency, the sitting president of the
republic has always
</P>
<P>
   picked the party's nominee in an autocratic process known
jokingly as the ``dedazo,'' the ``big finger.''
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 7, however, the PRI is trying to break with that
tradition and construct a more democratic image by holding a
self-supervised primary. The balloting will be open to all Mexican
voters, but PRI loyalists are expected to be the majority of those
who turn out.
</P>
<P>
   Competition has appeared fierce among four candidates,
particularly between Labastida and Madrazo, who have been running
close in opinion polls for most of the three-month campaign.
Madrazo's television ads and his rhetoric, especially, have been
unusually bold in their attacks on Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, Mexican society thought this process was a show and
would end up with a designation as things used to be done. But as
days, weeks and months passed, people realized this was for real,''
PRI primary organizer Fernando Gutierrez Barrios told foreign
reporters on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But the primary's democratic blush has been marred by the
perception that Labastida alone is benefiting from the PRI's
traditional well-oiled political machine. Indeed, at least one
state governor _ Roberto Albores of Chiapas _ has been verbally
reprimanded by the PRI for using his position to support Labastida
in his state, acknowledged Gutierrez Barrios.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, those complaining the loudest about Labastida's
alleged advantage are Madrazo and two other contenders, Manuel
Bartlett and Humberto Roque Villanueva. Like Labastida, all are
party insiders who in the past have advanced in their careers with
the help of the same system they are now attacking.
</P>
<P>
   But others are also casting a jaundiced eye toward campaign
methods employed during the primary, which could be a dress
rehearsal for Mexico's July 2000 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PRI is using the same tactics it always has,'' said
Rogelio Gomez, a national representative of Civic Alliance, an
independent organization monitoring election fraud and questionable
campaign activities here. ``There is a culture of doing politics in
Mexico where people with low incomes and little education give
their votes in exchange for government services that should just be
given to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Vicente Fox, who is mounting a strong opposition campaign as the
presidential candidate for Mexico's National Action Party, or PAN,
said that ``only a blind person'' couldn't see that ``the
unconditional support of the whole state apparatus and the PRI's
party apparatus is behind Labastida.''
</P>
<P>
   Joel Estudillo, an analyst with the Mexican Institute for
Political Studies, said that many PRI affiliates, especially those
in very poor urban and rural areas, appear to still be locked into
the habit of waiting to be
</P>
<P>
   told for whom they should vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the principle dilemma of the PRI and of Mexico as both
try to make a transition to democracy,'' Estudillo said. ``The PRI
member is asking: Do I respond to that tradition of 70 years, which
may be serving me in some way, or do I dare to rebel? ``
</P>
<P>
   During the campaign, Labastida workers have reportedly been
observed handing out T-shirts, hats, shopping bags, free breakfasts
and free medical exams and legal advice at a greater pace than
Labastida's opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to a meeting with (Labastida) not long ago,'' recalled
Medina. ``They gave us our sandwich, a dessert and a banana. The
truth is it was fun. Our leader didn't really force us to go, but
she suggested we go to support him so he'll support us later.''
</P>
<P>
   As long as such services and gifts are not paid for by
government funds, their provision to would-be voters at campaign
rallies does not violate the PRI's internal primary rules or
Mexican law. Other parties hand
</P>
<P>
   out gifts, too, but the PRI is considered the king of such
practices after 70 years of power.
</P>
<P>
   What is strictly prohibited, however, is using public money,
services or the influence of government or high-ranking party
officials to buy votes. In the primary, the PRI has also required
that governors and other officials refrain from even expressing a
preference for a candidate.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Although the party did not publicize it, Gutierrez Barrios
revealed this week that the PRI verbally sanctioned Gov. Roberto
Albores of Chiapas early in the campaign. But according to
newspaper reports here, some state congressmen in Chiapas accused
Albores of recently trying to force them into delivering votes for
Labastida. The accuracy of the charges is in dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo has complained about other governors using their clout
on behalf of Labastida. The PRI is supposed to investigate the
complaints. So far, no other governors have been reprimanded. But
about a dozen lower-ranking PRI figures have been sanctioned for
using their positions to support certain candidates, not just
Labastida, Gutierrez Barrios said.
</P>
<P>
   For many Mexicans, the mere fact that Labastida has many former
cabinet secretaries and other powerful PRI figures working in his
campaign is a sign that he has the stamp of approval of President
Ernesto Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
   And during a trip to Europe, newspapers here reported, a group
of the PRI representatives reportedly praised Labastida in a
meeting with German officials and spoke harshly about Madrazo,
characterizing him as a corrupt figure.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida has tried to fight the notion that he is considered
the party elite's preferred candidate. His campaign touts his
experience as governor of Sinaloa state, agriculture minister and
interior secretary in Zedillo's cabinet. He also has the benefit of
some new polls showing that voters believe he is more honest and
more of a leader than Madrazo.
</P>
<P>
   But the fuss inside the PRI over the alleged ``cargada'' has
dogged Labastida as well as Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida's three rivals recently implored Zedillo to speak out
against governors and other public officials taking sides during
the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Zedillo met with PRI functionaries and governors
last week, reiterating that he had no preferred candidate. He also
warned: ``In a democratic and open election . . . attempts at
manipulation, coercion or fraud will not only not work, they will
come back to hurt those who attempt to commit them.''
</P>
<P>
   But after decades of authoritarian politicking, the public
response to Zedillo was skeptical. The Mexican newspaper La Jornada
published a cartoon with Zedillo's finger telling him, ``You don't
have a favorite, but what about me?''

   MEXICO-LACARGADA _ MEXICO CITY _ As the campaign begins to
close, some Mexicans are wondering whether things really have
changed so much in this new democracy. Charges of old-fashioned
vote-buying and official coercion are cropping up against
frontrunner Francisco Labastida from all three of his rivals for
the PRI's presidential nomination. They're complaining about the
``la cargada,'' which means, roughly, having local governments and
officials (all PRI members) send people to pack events, and
otherwise send messages that one should vote for a specific
candidate. It also means distributing goods _ like building
materials _ or offering free breakfasts for medical exams for the
poor. Ironically, Labastida's rivals find themselves complaining
about the same tactics that the opposition here has denounced for

 &HT;    Stewart remembered for many kindnesses, unique style
 &HT;    By Craig Dolch
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ Before Paul Azinger said a word Friday, he knew
the best way to remember Payne Stewart. As Azinger walked to the
pulpit to deliver his eulogy, he pulled a tam o'shanter hat out of
his coat pocket and put it on his head, then rolled up his pants to
reveal a pair of argyle socks.
</P>
<P>
   About 3,000 people at First Baptist Church burst into applause
at Azinger's imitation of his late best friend's tradition of
wearing knickers. The scene was one of the most memorable of a
gripping, two-hour memorial service that included the first public
words from Stewart's widow, Tracey.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, the reigning U.S. Open champion, was among six people
killed Monday when a Learjet flew uncontrolled for four hours until
running out of fuel and crashing into a field in South Dakota. Also
on the plane was Jupiter, Fla., resident Bruce Borland, a golf
course designer who worked for Jack Nicklaus.
</P>
<P>
   For four days, the golf world has mourned the death of Stewart,
42. Friday, with virtually every top American golfer in attendance
_ the PGA Tour had postponed both of its tournaments for the day _
it was an emotional time to remember the man beyond his 18
victories, three majors and passion for the Ryder Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Payne Stewart loved life,'' Azinger said. ``He was the life of
every party. He was a man who was as interested in people as he was
in golf.''
</P>
<P>
   And everyone was just as interested in Stewart, judging by a
turnout that included most of the game's greats such as Tiger
Woods, Greg Norman, Nicklaus, David Duval, Fred Couples, Nick Price
and Ernie Els. Nicklaus, who attended Borland's funeral on
Thursday, said he connected with Stewart because both relied on a
dry sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always had the needle out a little bit, and some people
didn't know how to take that,'' Nicklaus said. ``I was the same
way. I liked to tease people and I don't think they knew what to
make of me. Payne had fun when he played golf and he had fun when
he was serious.''
</P>
<P>
   The most heart-wrenching scene came when Tracey, with her
brother at her side, talked about her husband's life. The
Australian native remembered how they had met at the 1980 Malaysian
Open and they immediately fell in love.
</P>
<P>
   She talked about how devoted Payne had been to their two
children, Chelsea, 13, and Aaron, 10. In the last week he had
refereed a volleyball game for Chelsea and played in a father-son
golf tournament with Aaron.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are the light of my life and my tower of strength and you
will be in my heart forever,'' she said, crying. ``After 18 years
of marriage, you are still the most beautiful man I've ever seen.
Not because of the way you looked on the outside anymore. But
because of what was inside of you.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will always be my soulmate and my best friend. We love
you. Let the party in heaven begin.''
</P>
<P>
   In front of where the Stewart family sat, there was a memorial
table that included the three most significant trophies he won _
the Ryder Cup, the U.S. Open (which he won for the second time in
June) and the PGA Championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now Payne's gone for the big trophy, and he won't have to give
that one back after a year,'' said pastor J.B. Collinsworth.
</P>
<P>
   Also at the memorial table were one of Stewart's trademark
plus-fours outfits, the harmonica he used when he played in the
group Jake Flounder and the Troutfish, pictures with his family and
mother Bea, and a set of fake buck teeth donated by his children.
Stewart used to put the teeth in and kid people he had been hit by
another golfer's swing or gotten beaten up.
</P>
<P>
   Azinger was one of Stewart's best friends, which meant he was
subject to even more of Stewart's good-natured ribbing. Not
surprisingly, a lot of the barbs were directed at Azinger's choice
of fashion, which made his look Friday even more poignant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Payne was the fashion police,'' Azinger said. ``I can't tell
you how many times Payne asked me if I got a free bowl of soup with
that hat.''
</P>
<P>
   Azinger talked of Stewart being a ``vicious competitor who hated
to lose.'' But he also noted how Stewart had changed his life in
recent years as he found religion and became more comfortable with
who he was.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many years it seems Payne Stewart was first in his life,
but he had changed,'' Azinger said. ``Only God can change hearts.''
</P>
<P>
   A tearful Azinger finished by saying: ``Goodbye, Payne. We loved
you and we miss you, but we know we will see you again.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart's teacher, Chuck Cook, who had the enviable task of
working with one of the game's most rhythmic swings, spoke of the
time they went to Pebble Beach to defend Stewart's U.S. Open title
in 1992. They had a bottle of Cristal champagne and drank and
talked next to the Pacific Ocean until early in the morning. Cook
plans on returning there in June when Stewart will be defending
both titles he won this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There won't be a U.S. Open trophy, but there will be a bottle
of Cristal,'' Cook said. ``I'm going to go to the wall and talk to
my friend about life. I love Payne Stewart and I miss him.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the service, a television clip was shown of an
interview Stewart had done recently. He was asked about how Azinger
surviving cancer in 1993 had helped him change his priorities in
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to a special place when I die, but I'm going to make
sure my life is special while I'm here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As Tracey and the rest of the Stewart left the church, all of
the PGA Tour professionals in attendance lined both sides of the
aisle where she walked out. They provided her protection as well as
strength.

RICKY MARTIN WORKS HARD SO THE FANS CAN PARTY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JON PARELES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's not every pop heartthrob who arrives onstage at
Madison Square Garden, as Ricky Martin did on Thursday night,
citing the Venezuelan revolutionary Simon Bolivar and telling the
crowd, ``We are uniting the Americas.'' Now that he has taught his
fellow Americans what ``la vida loca'' means, Martin has moved on
to greater ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   With his hips wiggling, his arms in the air and a toothy,
exultant smile of show business triumph, Martin emerged after a
long entertainer's apprenticeship including Puerto Rican pop,
``General Hospital'' and Broadway. ``Livin' La Vida Loca'' added
millions of English-speaking fans to his Spanish-speaking
constituency; it made him the face of the party, circa 1999. But he
knows that parties don't last forever, and he is determined not to
be dismissed as shallow. When he urged the audience to dance, he
described it as a cultural exchange.
</P>
<P>
   In English or Spanish, Martin's messages are simple: enjoy life,
fall in love, fight for your dreams, ``shake your bon-bon.'' He
flatters women by insisting they drive him loco; they're Juliets
and Mata Haris, dangerously seductive but irresistible, leaving him
charmingly vulnerable. Martin has an adequate baritone voice and
the handsome, boyish presence of a longtime teen idol, while he
comes across as diligent and earnest, anything but a frivolous
party animal. He works hard so his fans can have fun.
</P>
<P>
   His concert poured on the showmanship. Martin brought dancers, a
large band, an Armani wardrobe and a stage set with lifts, video
screens and confetti cannons. Instead of working up to his giant
hit, he started out with ``Livin' la Vida Loca,'' standing atop a
white Mustang convertible on a rotating platform; a dancer popped
out of the trunk. Video clips interspersed through the set showed
Martin as a pop star pursued by fans and photographers: Michael
Jackson's old fantasy, although Martin ended up taking refuge in a
salsa club.
</P>
<P>
   Between songs, he declared that all his new fame and adulation
were ``fascinating,'' ``beautiful'' and ``completely addictive,''
adding that if he didn't remember his beginnings, ``it could be
fatal.'' At the end of the concert, he sang a medley of Puerto
Rican plenas, and every so often the band moved into a mambo,
sometimes topped with guitar power chords. But Martin never
pretended to be a salsa singer; he's closer to Tom Jones than to
Hector Lavoe.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Martin's cultural exchange is a jumble with a North
American accent. ``Livin' la Vida Loca,'' despite its Spanish catch
phrase, rides on a ska rhythm from Jamaica by way of California and
a surf guitar lick; ``She's All I Ever Had,'' his new single, uses
Indian sitar and tabla to distinguish an ordinary power ballad. The
lyrics of ``Spanish Eyes'' assume that everything south of the
border is interchangeable: he meets a girl at Carnaval in Rio de
Janeiro (in Brazil) and dances a tango (from Argentina) with her
``in the summer rain'' (Carnaval is usually in February). His band
does know the Brazilian samba beat; it showed up in ``Maria,''
topped with a keyboard line fit for a techno track.
</P>
<P>
   His Americas are united under the flag of commercial success:
whatever it takes to hold the attention of the buying public. For
the moment, Latin flavors are prized, and Martin _ with his
songwriters and producers _ uses them to texture a persona that's
friendly, attractive and vague. Aiming for nothing beyond
catchiness, the musical hybrids are sometimes obvious but often
ingenious. Yet to become anything more than pop's latest pretty
face, sooner or later Martin will have to commit himself to
something beyond the next potential hit.
</P>
<P>
   Jessica Simpson, the opening act, experienced the real-life
version of a classic nightmare. As she was stepping through one of
her dance-pop tunes, her pants split, exposing her to part of the
audience. Her recorded backup, complete with supplementary vocals,
played on as she fled. She returned, in jeans borrowed from her
mother, to belt a melodramatic ballad, and she was applauded as a
trouper.

   Held Accountable &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's a tradition that must date back almost to Gutenberg:
Book-jacket blurbs, those boldface nuggets of puffery and
flattering quotes meant to entice browsers to pick the book up off
the store shelf and carry it to the cashier.
</P>
<P>
   Until last week, it was taken for granted that the public took
blurbs, like any kind of promotional copy, with several grains of
salt, and that blurbists would be forgiven a little hyperbole in
the cause.
</P>
<P>
   No more, perhaps. A California court ruled on Wednesday that
blurbs were not entitled to unlimited First Amendment protection,
and publishers could be sued over their veracity.
</P>
<P>
   The case involved the ``Beardstown Ladies' Investment Club''
books published by Buena Vista Books, a unit of Walt Disney. The
books, and an accompanying video, were based on investment advice
from a women's club in Beardstown, Ill., that had become famous for
apparently achieving much better returns than most professional
money managers. Naturally, the books' blurbs played up the figures.
</P>
<P>
   After the books became bestsellers, auditors discovered that the
club had blundered in its calculations, and the prodigious gains
were largely illusory. But according to Russell Keimer, who sued
Buena Vista last year, the company kept promoting the books with
the erroneous blurbs after the truth was known.
</P>
<P>
   His suit, filed under California's Unfair Trade Practices Act,
was thrown out in August 1998 on the ground that a book's jacket
shares the book's free-speech protection. But Keimer won
reinstatement of his case last week when an appellate court found
that in a blurb, it is the publisher, not the author, who is
speaking, putting blurbs in the category of commercial speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``When false or misleading,'' the court said, such statements
are ``entitled to no First Amendment protection at all and may be
entirely prohibited.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Landers, a spokeswoman for Buena Vista Books, told The
Associated Press she could not comment on the case because it
remains pending. &QL;

   MACAU _ In less than two months, Portugal will give up this
vest-pocket colony to China. Like well-mannered guests in a summer
rental, the Portuguese are spending their last days tidying up
after themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Sidewalks are being repaved, lush gardens planted and a boxy
glass pavilion is rising on the waterfront. Designed to resemble a
giant Chinese lantern, the building is to be the site of the
hand-over ceremony. There, at midnight on Dec. 19, China will claim
sovereignty over Macau, ending 442 years of colonial rule.
</P>
<P>
   Over at the courthouse, Portuguese authorities are busy with
another kind of house-cleaning. They are prosecuting a 45-year-old
Chinese man on charges that he is the most powerful organized crime
leader in Macau.
</P>
<P>
   The man, Wan Kuok-koi, is accused of masterminding a string of
shootings and bombings that have frustrated police, scared off
tourists, and turned this normally drowsy enclave into an Asian
replica of the Wild West.
</P>
<P>
   Wan, who goes by the nickname Broken Tooth Koi, has become the
colony's most celebrated resident _ and Exhibit A for those who say
Portugal has allowed Macau to decay from merely seedy to scary.
Fears of violence during the trial have prompted the government to
import security troops from Portugal, who patrol the courthouse
with submachine guns.
</P>
<P>
   To say that Portugal would like to resolve Wan's case before the
hand-over understates its sense of urgency. The presiding judge,
Fernando Estrela, holds hearings every day from 9:30 a.m. to 7:30
p.m. When Wan's lawyers ask windy questions, the judge cuts them
off in an impatient tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are rushing because hundreds of foreign journalists are
coming to Macau for the hand-over,'' said Ricardo Pinto, the editor
of Ponto Final, a Portuguese-language newspaper here. ``From an
image point of view, it would be terrible for Portugal to have this
business unfinished.''
</P>
<P>
   Government officials say that Wan's trial is not being rushed to
avoid bad publicity. But they acknowledge that the Portuguese
administration would prefer not to punt the case to Macau's new
rulers.
</P>
<P>
   ``People said we were just going to wait for the hand-over, but
we have confronted our problem,'' said Lt. Col. Manuel Geraldes, a
Portuguese army officer who is a spokesman for Macau's Security
Department. ``One of the legacies we will leave Macau is respect
for the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Resolving Wan's case is a top priority because last week,
Portugal and China removed one of the few remaining hurdles to a
smooth transition. Earlier this year, Portugal protested China's
decision to send troops to Macau before the hand-over. President
Jorge Sampaio of Portugal even threatened to boycott the ceremony
unless Beijing reversed itself.
</P>
<P>
   But during the visit of President Jiang Zemin of China to
Lisbon, Portugal, on Tuesday, the two sides agreed on a compromise:
China will dispatch a ``technical delegation'' to Macau before the
hand-over to make preparations for a military garrison. But it will
delay sending troops until after Dec. 19.
</P>
<P>
   For Joao Manuel Costa Antunes, the Portuguese official who is
coordinating the hand-over, it was deeply welcome news.
</P>
<P>
   Antunes has designed Macau's hand-over events to emphasize the
continuity between Portuguese and Chinese rule. He noted that,
unlike Hong Kong, which was confiscated by the British in 1842
after the Opium War, Macau was settled by Portuguese seafarers in
1557 with the consent of China.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never had a war with China, so for Macau, the hand-over
should be a very smooth process,'' Antunes said.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's hand-over was a brittle affair. After the transfer
of power, the head of the British delegation, Prince Charles, left
abruptly on the royal yacht, Britannia. In Macau, by contrast, the
Portuguese delegation _ including Sampaio _ will stay on to watch
Jiang swear in the new government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't feel like we're losing something and China is gaining
something,'' Antunes said. ``We're coming to the end of a long
period of historical involvement, and we want to go out with
dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   With China and Portugal no longer squabbling over troops, the
only hurdle to a dignified hand-over is the man known as Broken
Tooth. Normally under Portuguese law, criminal trials last about a
month _ meaning that Wan's trial could be wrapped up by
mid-November.
</P>
<P>
   But his lawyers are looking for ways to delay the proceedings.
Most recently, they filed an unsuccessful petition to have Estrala
replaced because they said he was prejudiced against Wan. Their
goal is to delay the trial until after the hand-over, when it would
be heard by a Chinese court.
</P>
<P>
   Such a strategy carries high risks. China's legal system can be
brutal to gangsters. Cheung Tze-keung, a Hong Kong crime boss known
as Big Spender, was executed last December after being convicted of
kidnapping and arms trafficking. The crimes Wan is accused of carry
a penalty of five to 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   But Wan's lawyers said they had no reason to believe that he
would fare worse in a Chinese court.
</P>
<P>
   One of the lawyers noted that Portugal, as one of its last
contributions to Macau, was building a maximum-security prison with
only 12 cells. He believes the jail is being built with only one
occupant in mind: his client.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are facing great difficulties,'' said the lawyer, who spoke
on condition of anonymity. ``I have lost all my faith in the
Portuguese legal system in Macau.''

 &HT;    COLUMN: Halloween-phobes give devil more than his due
 &HT;    By Steve Gushee
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Protestant churches may be their own
worst enemy.
</P>
<P>
   Many of them condemn Halloween as a tool of Satan. Yet for
centuries, Halloween has been a raucous celebration of the victory
of Christ over the devil they seem to fear.
</P>
<P>
   Bizarrely, otherwise rational people see kids dressed up as
devils and demons trawling for candy as unsuspecting agents of the
Evil One.
</P>
<P>
   But when they condemn Halloween, they lose a wonderful
opportunity to proclaim the Gospel with joy to those youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the influence of dour Christians with little imagination
or understanding of their own festivals is frightening. They have
persuaded Publix Super Markets to avoid calling attention to
Halloween, which takes place on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The ubiquitous food store chain will not use the word Halloween
in advertising in many parts of Florida. Publix will substitute
``Octoberfest'' and ``fall festival'' for the scary word.
</P>
<P>
   The store does not want to offend religious groups that object
to Halloween as a pagan attempt to promote the devil. Some churches
never learn.
</P>
<P>
   Halloween has long been a vibrantly happy celebration of God's
conquest of the very forces those Christians fear. The word
Halloween is a contraction of hallow's eve, the night before All
Hallows Day on Nov. 1 _ now more commonly known as All Saints Day.
</P>
<P>
   That great feast has been kept since the fourth century as a
celebration of Christ's victory over death and over the power of
evil and the ghosties, goblins and things that go bump in the
night.
</P>
<P>
   St. Paul urged the faithful to make fun of the spiritual forces
they once feared. Laugh in the face of such evil and mock death, he
wrote in a New Testament letter to the Corinthians. He insists
that, in Christ, God has broken the power of the Evil One.
</P>
<P>
   So, the faithful used Halloween, admittedly borrowed from
pre-Christian pagan rites, to make fun of any evil spirits that
might helplessly challenge God or his children.
</P>
<P>
   The night before All Saints Day became an informal, frivolous
occasion to celebrate Christ's victory _ very much like victory
rallies many schools have the night before a football game.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Halloween is rooted in pagan practice. So is
Christmas. The occasion for the celebration of the birth of Jesus
was borrowed from Roman winter festivals and ``baptized'' to serve
the church.
</P>
<P>
   Winners get to change things. Christianity won the first-century
struggle for the hearts and minds of the people. The faith is
filled with pagan ceremonies adapted to glorify Christ and proclaim
the Gospel.
</P>
<P>
   Christianity may be losing the 21st-century struggle. One reason
for that could be that the faithful are afraid of the holiday that
makes a fool of the devil.
</P>
<P>
   That makes a fool of the church.

   MEXICO CITY _ A Mexican government plan to charge travelers who
drive cars with American plates into Mexico a deposit of up to $800
has provoked expressions of dismay from critics who say it could
persuade hundreds of thousands of tourists to cancel plans for
travel to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The new regulation was written to crack down on illegal car
imports, but experts estimated that half or more of the 800,000
people who receive car permits for Mexico each year would make
other travel plans rather than pay the large deposits.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new rules, the deposit required to drive into Mexico
is to rise from the current $11 to $400 for a U.S.-registered car
manufactured before 1994, to $600 for cars made from 1994 to 1998,
and to $800 for a 1999 or later model. The deposit, which is
refunded on the car's return to the United States, applies only to
cars used to drive beyond the 15-mile border zone.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican Customs officers were originally instructed to begin
collecting the new deposits in cash on Nov. 1. But after the plan
drew fire from residents along the border and from politicians in
Washington and Mexico City, officials postponed it late Thursday
and amended it to allow for credit card payment. A statement issued
Friday afternoon by the Mexican Embassy in Washington said the new
rules would be in place for the Christmas holiday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our problem with illegal vehicles is serious,'' said Marco
Provencio, a Treasury Ministry spokesman. ``We understand the
complaints about this program, but the law is the law and we have
the right to enforce it.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those criticizing the plan were several American
congressmen and hundreds of Mexican-Americans who have been calling
television and radio stations from Texas to California.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who are going to suffer most are from the
Mexican-American community, because when you have to pay $600 or
$800, people just don't have the money,'' said Rep. Solomon Ortiz,
D-Texas. ``This will affect businesses, families, tourism. There
are meetings all up and down the border, people are getting
together and there will be demonstrations because this is unfair. I
hope they rethink this or there's going to be chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   Even several Mexican officials have criticized the program as
unfair to the 2 million Mexican workers who drive home from the
United States for Christmas and Easter. The plan, authored by
Mexican Treasury officials, has unleashed a slugfest inside the
government, with special opposition coming from Mexican consular
officials based in the United States, one Mexican official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a horrifying error,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Carla Felsted, a co-editor of Mexico Meanderings, an Austin,
Texas, newsletter about vacationing by car in Mexico, said half her
readers would probably cancel plans to vacation in Mexico rather
than pay the deposits.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're going to charge that much to your credit card, even
with the promise of cash back on leaving, that's going to keep at
least 50 percent of Americans from going,'' Ms. Felsted said. ``If
they charge $11 to your credit card, that's OK. But $800, now
that'll really get your attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Because used cars often cost less than half as much in the
United States as in Mexico, 1.5 million used cars are currently
circulating in Mexico illegally, with no Mexican plates. The
illegal cars are often used by criminals, and since their owners
pay no taxes, the situation represents a serious drain on
government revenues, said Provencio. The 14 million legally
registered cars in Mexico provide $800 million in tax revenues each
year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under current rules, travelers who wish to drive cars with
American plates into Mexico at any of the 23 legal crossing points
along the 2,000-mile border can receive a six-month permit by
paying an $11 deposit with their credit card. Two other cash-based
options are far more expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new rules originally proposed by the Treasury
Ministry, travelers' were to pay the new $400 to $800 deposits only
in cash, and the deposits were to be redeemable only at the same
border crossing through which travelers had entered Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   After a flood of criticism, officials amended the new rules to
allow for payment by credit card and to allow the redemption of the
deposits at any border crossing, Carlos Bandala Serrano, the
central administrator of the Mexican customs agency, said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Customs officials and Banjercito, the army-owned bank that
handles the border deposits, will need several weeks to
``fine-tune'' computer communications among the 23 border stations
to allow officials to process the credit card deposits and cash
redemptions at any point along the border, Bandala said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A Mexican official who criticized the new plan said it would
force the government to keep large amounts of cash stockpiled at
each border station, inviting robbery or graft.
</P>
<P>
   The new regulation reflects a hardened determination to crack
down on the illegal auto imports, which have posed an increasingly
ticklish political problem. For several decades, successive
governments did little to enforce Mexico's vehicle importation
laws. Instead, police allowed the cars to accumulate on the streets
until, every six years during the presidential election campaign,
successive candidates of the governing party would promise to
legalize the vehicles, thus buying votes from hundreds of thousands
of illegal car owners.
</P>
<P>
   But this year a consensus has emerged within the establishment
of the governing party, known as the PRI, that the cars pose too
serious a problem to play politics. Francisco Labastida Ochoa, the
PRI's leading presidential candidate, has refused several times
this year to promise to legalize them.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the PRI governor of Chihuahua took a different stand
when he began selling authorization stickers for illegal cars there
for $300, brushing aside protests from federal officials. The
Treasury Ministry retaliated by withholding federal funds from
Chihuahua, and the case ended in court. A district judge has sided
with the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   This political background, as well as the increasing use made of
the illegal vehicles by drug traffickers and others to commit
crimes, appears to have persuaded the government that it must
prevent further illegal importation of cars at all costs.
</P>
<P>
   The new deposits are part of a broader package of new rules
governing cross-border travel, some of which are already being
implemented at the border. And there are signs that confusion
surrounding the new program is being aggravated by the traditional
communications problems between Mexico City and the border.
</P>
<P>
   Juani Martinez, a Mexican woman with legal American residency in
Corpus Christi, Texas, said that for 15 years she has renewed her
Mexican car permit every six months. But earlier this month,
customs officials refused to renew her permit, saying she was now
eligible for only one six-month permit each year.
</P>
<P>
   Bandala said that there has been no change in the frequency with
which car owners can apply to renew their permits. But Ms. Martinez
said customs officials at the border were emphatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked, `Why are you denying me this permit?' and they said,
`People in the capital city told us this is the new law,''' Ms.
Martinez said. On Wednesday, Ms. Martinez organized a meeting in
Corpus Christi to develop protests of the new rules.

U.S. FIGHTS WORLD TRADE GROUP OVER TAX BREAKS FOR OVERSEAS
SUBSIDIARIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ The United States filed an appeal Friday against a
World Trade Organization ruling that invalidated $2.5 billion in
tax breaks to U.S. companies with overseas subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   The Foreign Sales Corporation provisions of the U.S. tax code,
which give income tax relief to corporations that export through
offshore subsidiaries, were challenged by the European Union as
illegal subsidies to U.S. companies.
</P>
<P>
   Trade officials of the 15-nation European Union were jubilant
over the victory, partly because of reverses they suffered when the
United States successfully challenged Europe's banana import limits
and its ban on hormone-fed beef, which have led to punitive tariffs
on $300 million of European products.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are much higher in the tax case both because of the
amount of money involved and because, if upheld, the ruling, which
was made on Oct. 8, opens up a new area of conflict _ a country's
control over its domestic tax laws.
</P>
<P>
   The tax provisions at issue benefit major corporations like
Boeing, Microsoft and General Motors.
</P>
<P>
   In filing an appeal, U.S. Trade Representative Charlene
Barshefsky stated that the trade panel ``committed multiple legal
errors on both substantive and procedural issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Current U.S. law allows domestic companies to establish
corporations in offshore tax havens, allowing manufacturers to get
the tax exemption on products that generally are made in the United
States. There are 3,600 such companies in the U.S. Virgin Islands.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union argued that this law violates trade rules
that goods sold for export may not be treated differently from
those sold on the domestic market. Such distinctions are considered
export subsidies, which are illegal under WTO rules.
</P>
<P>
   In a 294-page ruling, the trade panel agreed. Such subsidies
``are prohibited,'' concluded the panel, made up of Crawford
Falconer of New Zealand, Didier Chambovey of Switzerland and Prof.
Seung Wha Chang of South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The trade body's appellate review will take up to 90 days,
delaying enforcement of the ruling until at least the end of
January.
</P>
<P>
   Under the ruling, the trade panel had given the United States
until Oct. 1, 2000, to change its law, concluding that was adequate
time for Congress to act. It agreed with U.S. arguments that global
trade agreements were not meant to dictate member-country tax
systems but said that ``certain WTO rules do have implications for
specific tax practices of members.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   This is the second time such U.S. tax provisions have been
challenged in the global trading system. Similar provisions were
found to be an illegal subsidy under the trade organization's
predecessor body, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, in
1981. They were replaced by the Foreign Sales Corporation rules in
the early 1980s to comply with the objections.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union argued that the economic effects of the new
provisions remained the same.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barshefsky maintained that existing tax breaks do not give
U.S. companies an unfair advantage. ``A careful review of the
history of this issue, the fact of record and the applicable WTO
legal rules concerning income tax measures should result in a
reversal of the panel's decision,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   To qualify for tax relief under the provisions, a U.S. company
must meet a number of criteria, including a minimum level of direct
costs abroad for certain sales activities, including advertising
and order processing.

PROPOSAL FOR BRAZIL'S AIRLINES TO MERGE GETS COOL RECEPTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ Three of Brazil's leading airlines have
dismissed a proposal from a competitor that they all merge into a
company to be called Air Latina.
</P>
<P>
   The suggestion of creating one Brazilian mega-airline by Wagner
Canhedo, the owner of Vasp, the country's second-largest carrier,
was batted down Friday by Varig Brazilian Airlines, Brazils largest
carrier, as well as by TAM, an up-and-coming airline that recently
began offering international routes, and by Transbrasil.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement that hinted at some irritation with the proposal,
the companies said they had been involuntarily involved in an
effort by Canhedo to reshape the nation's airline business.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the idea behind Air Latina is not new, and has
stirred a wider discussion over the future of Brazil's passenger
and cargo aviation industries.
</P>
<P>
   Wobbly finances at some companies and signals from the
government that public funds could be made available to finance
consolidation have led some analysts to predict that a thinning of
airline ranks is inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is only a matter of time,'' said Irineu Correa Filho, the
aviation sector analyst at Lopes Filho Associados in Rio de
Janeiro. ``Reality is knocking on airline doors and its message is
that only the strongest and the biggest will survive.''
</P>
<P>
   The possibility that Varig and TAM, the two companies that are
considered the best-managed of Brazil's airlines, acquire two of
their counterparts is held to be one of the likeliest outcomes.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Still, consolidation efforts in other parts of Latin America
suggest an alternative similar to that forwarded by Canhedo of
Vasp. In Mexico, for instance, AeroMexico and Mexicana de Aviacion
are grouped under Cintra, a holding company. And in Central
America, airlines from El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua
and Costa Rica are grouped under another holding company, Grupo
TACA.
</P>
<P>
   Consolidation in the airline business is a hot subject of
discussion in the northern neighbor of the United States as well.
Air Canada, that country's largest airline, is resisting a hostile
attempt by Onex Corp. to merge it with the No. 2 airline in Canada,
Canadian Airlines, and is instead proposing to buy Canadian
Airlines itself.

<P>
   A 24-year-old farm machinery salesman, Garfield Gilmour, was
sentenced to three life terms in Belfast Crown Court for the
murders of three Catholic brothers who died after their home in a
largely Protestant housing estate in Ballymoney was firebombed in
July 1998. Lord Justice McCollum called the sectarian killings of

WORLD CONFERENCE AGREES IN PRINCIPLE ON NEED TO CONTROL TOBACCO
SALES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ELIZABETH OLSON   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ More than 100 nations agreed this week on the need for
a global treaty to control tobacco sales, but some of the big
hurdles to such a pact quickly became evident.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials meeting here over the last five days outlined
their ideas about what topics a treaty should deal with. The
initiating agency, the World Health Organization, says tobacco
kills 4 million people a year from cancer, bronchitis, emphysema
and cardiovascular diseases.
</P>
<P>
   At the closed-door meetings, two of the largest tobacco
exporting countries, the United States and Japan, supported general
guidelines instead of specific and enforceable provisions,
according to activists who sat in on the sessions. A request for a
copy of the U.S. position did not receive a response.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Japanese started their presentation by reminding the
meeting that two-thirds of their industry is owned by the
government,'' said Lucinda Wykle-Rosenberg, of Infact, a
Boston-based group.
</P>
<P>
   At a news briefing, representatives of the watchdog groups said
tobacco-exporting nations had not joined together to block the
treaty. But several representatives said they feared that the
tobacco industry would insert itself once full-fledged negotiations
got under way.
</P>
<P>
   Activists are campaigning for a tough document that would
include a global ban on advertising, a crackdown on cigarette
smuggling and elimination of subsidies for growers. They also want
strong labeling requirements and strict protection for young
people.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, said nongovernmental groups, indicated that
it would not support a comprehensive ban on tobacco industry
advertising because of constitutional protections for free speech.
``The U.S. delegation's opening salvo was that the notion of an
advertising ban was not on the table,'' said Judith Glanz of the
National Center for Tobacco-Free Kids in Washington. WHO has
spearheaded the negotiations. This week's meeting was the first
round to examine what issues could be included in the treaty, which
produced a list of 13, including such areas as advertising, tax,
labeling and subsidies. These deliberations will be followed by a
second round in March to winnow the list.
</P>
<P>
   Mapping out the treaty will take place among the 191 WHO member
governments in May. ``Everybody who has taken part in the
deliberations here has spoken strongly for the idea of a Framework
Convention,'' said chairman Kimmo Leppo, director of Finland's
Health and Social Affairs Ministry, at a final news briefing.
``There was not a single dissenting opinion in this respect.''
</P>
<P>
   But others at the meeting said that health ministry officials
were prominent at this meeting but that as negotiations progressed,
officials from ministries with competing interests, like economics
and trade, would get involved. And that could disrupt the progress
of the talks.

 FRANK DeVOL, 88, COMPOSER FOR MOVIES AND TV SITCOMS  
 (bl)  
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Frank DeVol, the composer of more than 50 film scores along with
such familiar television tunes as ``The Brady Bunch'' song, died
Oct. 27 at a nursing home in Lafayette, Calif. He was 88.
</P>
<P>
   De Vol was one of Hollywood's most prodigious
composer-arranger-conductors, winning recognition with nominations
for five Academy Awards and five Emmys, among them a nomination for
the ``Brady Bunch'' theme, written for that sitcom of the 1970s.
The nominated movie scores were for ``Hush ... Hush, Sweet
Charlotte,'' ``Pillow Talk'' and ``Guess Who's Coming to Dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   He also composed the music for the television series ``My Three
Sons'' and ``Family Affair.''
</P>
<P>
   DeVol occasionally appeared on screen as a character actor. In
the late 1970s he played ``Happy Kyne,'' the band leader in the
offbeat Norman Lear lampoon of a small-town talk-variety show,
``Fernwood 2-night''.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Moundsville, W.Va., he grew up in Canton, Ohio, and
joined the musicians' union at age 14. He was playing violin and
piano with his father's band in a vaudeville theater where silent
movies were shown.
</P>
<P>
   He also played at a Chinese restaurant in Cleveland and saved
his money to buy a saxophone, which he taught himself to play. By
the late 1930s he played and arranged for the Horace Heidt
Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Moving to California, he took a night job at Lockheed, but a
Mutual Network radio station asked him to lead the band for one of
its music programs.
</P>
<P>
   Through radio he advanced to engagements as musical director for
such luminaries as Rudi Vallee, Dinah Shaw and Jack Carson.
</P>
<P>
   It was the era of the big bands, and DeVol next found himself at
Capitol Records doing arrangements for Doris Day, Kay Starr, Tony
Bennett, Vic Damone and the like.
</P>
<P>
   He broke into pictures and television in 1954 when he worked on
a low-budget Robert Aldrich film, ``World for Ransom.'' It gained
him his first Oscar nomination and a reputation as a Hollywood
composer. He went on to write the music for several more Aldrich
films, including ``The Dirty Dozen,'' a hit at the box office in
1967.
</P>
<P>
   Twice widowed, DeVol is survived by two daughters, Linda
Morehouse of Lafayette and Donna Copeland of Denver; and two
grandsons.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Suddenly, over the last two weeks, the long-suffering bank
stocks have roared to life, bid higher by investors with renewed
confidence that inflation will remain in check despite
irrepressible economic strength. The Standard &AMP; Poor's Banks
Composite index jumped an astonishing 22.4 percent during the
fortnight ended Friday.
</P>
<P>
   So is the future really that rosy for banks? The majority view
is, yes. ``These stocks are very significantly undervalued,'' said
Robert Albertson, president of Pilot Financial, a money manager.
``They've got enormous upside.''
</P>
<P>
   And his optimism is shared by many money managers and analysts.
They point to, among other things, banks' record profitability and
price-to-earnings multiples that are well under 60 percent of those
of the general market, rather than the usual 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the prospect of revived industry consolidation and
benefits from a long-delayed scrapping of Glass-Steagall
restrictions that prevented them from expanding into other
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   And there is a widespread conviction that banks could handle,
even benefit from, a further rise in interest rates and that there
will be no year-end Year 2000 disaster. Indeed, recommendations to
buy bank stocks outnumber sells by about 2 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   But not so fast. One prominent analyst, who was virtually alone
in predicting the selloff in bank stocks last spring, insists this
newfound ebullience is misguided.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technically, these things look great _ you've got low
inflation _ but fundamentally our concerns still hold,'' said the
bank bear, Michael L. Mayo of Credit Suisse First Boston. For
various reasons, including the fact that prices have rebounded
enough to approach record levels, he said, the smart investor will
be contrary. ``Take profits, sell into the strength,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Repeating a warning he first issued in March, Mayo bucked the
Street's traditionally bullish inclination in mid-September when he
advised in ``Ten Reasons to Sell Bank Stocks,'' a Donaldson, Lufkin
&AMP; Jenrette report, that investors steer clear.
</P>
<P>
   Until mid-October, Mayo's counsel was largely on the money, with
bank stocks down about 25 percent from their April peak and Bank
One of Chicago, whose shares he singled out as particularly
vulnerable, suffering most spectacularly, down from as high as
$63.5625 in mid-May to a low of $32.0625 on Oct. 20.
</P>
<P>
   That might be only half the damage, said Mayo, whose list of
outright sells currently consists of surging stocks like Citigroup,
Chase Manhattan and J.P. Morgan as well as Bank One.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, banks have already made the easiest fixes to
improve efficiency and must spend increasing amounts to maintain
market shares, Mayo contended. Y2K issues have sidetracked
productivity improvements, and exposes banks to the risk of
defaults by borrowers and third parties. A fresh round of mergers
prompted by removal of Depression-era barriers, he reasons, could
depress shares of acquirers.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Mayo cited banks' decelerating earnings growth,
reduced asset quality and increasingly unpredictable earnings
because of their reliance on unsustainable income sources, like
venture capital. And Mayo said he believed that bank earnings are
in many cases suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Persuasive or not, he is distinctly in the minority. ``We think
there are some good values out there,'' said David S. Berry,
director of research at Keefe, Bruyette &AMP; Woods. Except for a small
increase in problem loans following three or four years of bank
``Nirvana,'' Berry said, ``there's nothing not to like'' about the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   His favorites include Washington Mutual, a Seattle-based savings
and loan; U.S. Bancorp of Minneapolis; First Tennessee National and
Cullen/Frost Bankers of San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Another bull is James K. Schmidt, portfolio manager at Hancock
Funds in Boston, who said that until very recently bank stocks were
relatively less expensive than they have been since 1990 and that
``thousands'' more mergers lie ahead in an industry already
winnowed to 8,600 from a peak of more than 14,000 banks.
</P>
<P>
   He also likes First Tennessee, which has a big securities
business.
</P>
<P>
   And all the analysts agree that rising interest rates, which
once were poison for bank profits, no longer represent as much of a
threat, in part because banks have learned sophisticated hedging
techniques.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was not a single year in the last decade in which rising
interest rates hurt bank earnings,'' Albertson said.
</P>
<P>
   There are few analysts, other than Mayo, who consider Y2K much
of a threat despite the fact that banks are exposed to more sources
of computer malfunction that other industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is that the banks are very well prepared for Y2K,''
said Ruchi Madan, national bank analyst at Paine Webber, whose
overall approach to the group's stocks is ``pretty neutral.'' She
recommends Chase Manhattan and the Bank of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, she added, banks are heavily dependent on technology and
could suffer from the failures of others, especially Third World
borrowers. ``But you have to make a bet,'' she said, ``that the
world isn't going to blow up.''

GEORGE E. VALLEY JR., WHO HELPED BUILD NATION'S RADAR DEFENSES,
DIES AT 86  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Calif., Wis.)   By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. George Edward Valley Jr., an emeritus professor of physics
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who helped build the
country's radar defenses and was Chief Scientist of the Air Force,
died on Oct. 16 at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston. He was 86 and
lived in Concord, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   In World War II, while he was at the MIT Radiation Laboratory,
Valley developed an aspect of radar that allowed the Allies to bomb
their targets in all weather conditions. He was a member of the Air
Force's Scientific Advisory Board from 1946 to 1964, and that
involvement led to the creation in 1949 of MIT's Lincoln
Laboratory, of which he was a founder and an associate director.
</P>
<P>
   Valley helped design equipment for the Distant Early Warning
radar line across the Arctic. He was Chief Scientist of the Air
Force in 1957-58.
</P>
<P>
   At the Lincoln Laboratory, in Lexington, Mass., he was involved
in advanced computer technology, including the magnetic core memory
and the transmission of digital data by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Born in New York, he graduated from MIT in 1935 and earned a
doctorate at the University of Rochester in 1939. He started as an
optical engineer at Bausch &AMP; Lomb, taught briefly at Rochester and
Harvard and joined the staff at the MIT radiation laboratory in
1941 as a project supervisor. He attained emeritus status in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Valley is survived by his wife of 39 years, Shea Alice LaBonte
Valley; two sons and a daughter from an earlier marriage, Dr.
George C., of Los Angeles, Dr. John W., of Madison, Wis., and
Katharine V. Nakamoto of Winchester, Mass., and four grandchildren.
His previous marriage, to Louisa King Williams, ended in divorce.

'98 FIRST-ROUNDER JONES STILL HAS TO PROVE HIMSELF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Fridays with Tebucky.
</P>
<P>
   It's the end of the week, nothing more to ask about Sunday's
Arizona game _ so the subject turns back to the progress of Tebucky
Jones, taken in the first round (No. 22) of the '98 draft out of
Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   The topic becomes more curious now since the Patriots have
flourished this season, and top picks Damien Woody, Andy
Katzenmoyer, and Kevin Faulk have made significant contributions in
their rookie seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, a nickel corner and a top special teams player, will
return Sunday against the Cardinals after spending the past three
weeks nursing a pulled hamstring. In training camp, he missed
serious time with a sprained ankle. Jones simply hasn't been able
to make it to the next level.
</P>
<P>
   With Robert Edwards also gone, the Patriots haven't received
full value for their first-round picks of two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Is it talent or opportunity?
</P>
<P>
   Where Woody, Katzenmoyer, and Faulk have been forced into duty,
they can experience being starters in the league for the first time
and ``see whether they're going to make the jump to being very good
NFL players,'' according to head coach Pete Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, in his second year, hasn't been able to beat out Steve
Israel for the starting job.
</P>
<P>
   There have been those who want Carroll to convert Jones to
safety, but he has rejected that idea and now won't even consider
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time we drafted him, the rationale was you had Israel,
so you could take the time to develop him and we knew he'd be an
impact player on special teams,'' said Carroll. ``Fortunately,
we're OK. We're not dying at that spot, so we can take the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, we could afford to do that. Otherwise you would
have waited another six or seven picks. I didn't have a problem
with that at all and I don't right now, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll thinks if Jones stays healthy, he can slip into Israel's
right corner spot next season if Israel, an unrestricted free
agent, is not retained.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we're not going to start a new project with him,''
said Carroll. ``He's already had success playing. He's not been a
problem for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots will always be under scrutiny for the pick until
Jones plays, however. He might be a great athlete. He might have
the greatest potential of any player on the team. In the NFL, where
coaches and personnel people are under great pressure to produce
young players quickly because of free agency and salary cap
restrictions, rookies need to learn quickly and be ready to play.
</P>
<P>
   In the event of an injury, Carroll would have no problem
throwing Jones into the mix. Right now, though, he needs to get
back to his current role.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as he's full speed he's back in there (on nickel
situations),'' said Carroll. ``Tebucky is a big factor on special
teams, one of our most productive guys. He can make a big
difference. He fills a spot and can be a playmaker. He'll be a big
boost to the team.''
</P>
<P>
   First-rounders are supposed to be more than special-teamers.
That's reserved for third-rounders and beyond. A first-rounder in
today's NFL should be an impact player. The Patriots could have
taken Donovin Darius, who went 25th to Jacksonville and who Carroll
acknowledges was a ``sure bet'' as a free safety. But at the time,
the Patriots didn't need a free safety because they had Willie
Clay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought about it a number of times, when we had the
opportunities to make him a safety candidate, but we'd have to
start over again for a guy who has only one year of work as a
college safety and none as a corner,'' said Carroll. ``It's like
he's a sophomore right now. It's going to take longer than people
would hope. When he really gets comfortable and gets confident,
that's when you see what people can do. It's just like Chris
(Carter), he's either gonna get better or he isn't. Are they going
to be real good football players in the NFL?''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll knew he was making a controversial pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't care,'' he said. ``I still don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Couple that with taking Chris Canty over Sam Madison in the
first round in 1997, and that spot on the field has left many
scratching their heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``The things we do at the line of scrimmage, (Jones) is a
factor,'' said Carroll. ``He's fast down the field. Because of the
length of his arms and his size, he can be disruptive down the
field. When the ball comes he hasn't had the opportunities but he's
won more than he hasn't. He looks different in that spot. He's a
bigger, larger body you're not used to seeing. That's why a lot of
coaches weren't willing to take a shot. That's why we went for it,
because he was unique.''

 &HT;    Buyers beware: Home's hallowed halls may be haunted by 'passed'
residents By R. Michelle Breyer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Diane Bradshaw knew that an old woman had died
in the house on Kinney Avenue. The postman had found her after
weeks of mail had piled up outside.
</P>
<P>
   Bradshaw bought the house anyway. She planned to remodel and
resell it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then things started happening,'' Bradshaw recalled.
</P>
<P>
   The floors began creaking. The pipes began leaking. Lights began
flickering.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed that Miss Crider, the former owner, never actually
left.
</P>
<P>
   Prospective buyers would walk in and walk back out. ``It just
felt like there was a spirit there,'' Bradshaw said. ``It was too
eerie for them.''
</P>
<P>
   So she did what any good real estate broker would do: She held a
seance and encouraged Miss Crider's spirit to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Buying a house can be frightening enough on its own. Just
imagine if your dream home has poltergeists.
</P>
<P>
   We're not talking about blood dripping from walls or
chain-rattling ghouls tramping around the attic. These are houses
with spirits _ real or imagined _ and real estate brokers say there
are more of them than one might think.
</P>
<P>
   There was the woman who abandoned a Lost Creek, Texas, mansion
she was building because she claimed she saw Satan there. The bank
foreclosed on the house, and real estate brokers joked that ``the
devil made her default.''
</P>
<P>
   The buyer of a South Austin home was regularly visited in the
middle of the night by an apparition shortly after moving in. The
family had the house blessed twice by a Catholic priest, which
seemed to take care of their unwanted guest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've walked into houses I've felt very eerie about, and I
left,'' said Austin broker Tom Amiss of the Amiss Group. ``It was
an unsettling feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Ghosts and spirits probably won't be listed among a home's
amenities. In fact, there's nothing on a disclosure statement that
addresses haunted houses directly. No state or federal law requires
either the seller or the real estate broker to disclose if a house
is haunted.
</P>
<P>
   Sellers and brokers do have an obligation to disclose
``stigmatized'' properties. These are properties associated with an
unusual, emotionally distressing nonphysical feature or history,
such as a murder or suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Haunted houses don't necessarily fall under that category _
unless their sellers promote stories about ghosts and spirits.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1991 New York lawsuit, a buyer contracted to purchase a
house on Long Island, only to learn before the sale closed that the
house was supposedly possessed by poltergeists. The home's
paranormal activity was featured in Reader's Digest and the local
press. So the buyer sued the seller for not disclosing it.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, Stambovsky vs. Ackley, the New York appellate
division found that the seller deliberately fostered the belief
that the house was possessed. If she told the public about
supernatural occurrences on the property, the court determined she
owed the buyer the same courtesy. But the real estate broker had no
duty to disclose the ``phantasmal reputation of the premises,'' the
court found. The buyer could pull out of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   It does, however, make good business sense to let a buyer know
potential areas of concern, including alleged ghosts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might be prudent for an agent to mention that,'' said Kirby
Parsons, president of the Austin Board of Realtors. ``Because the
neighbors certainly will.''
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, brokers don't need to mention anything. Many say
their clients seem to sense it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can tell when something weird and creepy has gone on _ you
can just feel it,'' said Carrie Bills, a real estate broker w-- th
Wilson &AMP; Goldrick. ``Houses are living. They take on the
personality of the inhabitants.''
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio parapsychologist Martin Leal, a former real estate
broker who investigates psychic phenomena, said home buyers often
don't discover their house is haunted until they begin remodeling.
When they start breaking down walls and moving things around, it
seems to stir up ghost activity, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are different reasons for the ghosts to stick around,''
Leal said. ``One reason is that they were so attached to a place
that they didn't want to leave when they died. So then someone else
comes along and starts changing it. The ghost wants to let the
person know that it does not appreciate the changes.'' Those
concerned about the prospect of living in a haunted house can
follow the lead of a Barton Hills homeowner.
</P>
<P>
   The man, who asked that his name not be used, was told by the
seller that a spirit of a former owner lived in the 100-year-old
house. The sellers said they regularly heard things rattling
around.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told us it was a good spirit,'' the home buyer said.
</P>
<P>
   But he wanted to decide for himself. He asked the owner whether
he could spend one night in the large three-story house before he
committed to buying it. Although it was a long night spent jumping
at every little bump and rustle, he deemed the house safe and
bought it.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the nine years we've been here, we've never noticed
anything out of the ordinary,'' said the buyer, who doesn't want
his two young children knowing they might be sharing their bedroom
with a spirit.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are those who intentionally buy _ or build _
haunted houses.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Garriott, co-founder of Origin Systems Inc., is wiring a
haunted spirit into his new castle via an elaborate home automation
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can say, `Spirit, haunt the guest room,' '' Garriott said
with relish.
</P>
<P>
   The lucky guest will be treated to the sounds of rattling
chains, creaks and groans. The house will be cloaked in a spooky
red light; smoke will rise from a moat.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Farwell, president of the Capital City Ghost Research
Society, hopes to buy a house this fall, and the presence of a
spirit would be a big selling point, she said. But Farwell would
prefer a mellow spirit to a rowdy ghost. ``It's not like I'd like
to be kept up every night,'' Farwell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Water faucets going on and off, doors opening and closing,
lights flickering every now and then _ that would be neat,'' she
said. ``It's like having a roommate that's not there.''
</P>
<P>
   For Bradshaw, who now lives in Mountainair, N.M., the experience
with Miss Crider was a positive one.
</P>
<P>
   She recalled an October day seven years ago when she got
together with a friend to exorcise the house on Kinney. They lit
candles and played New Age music.
</P>
<P>
   Using a Ouija board, they talked with Miss Crider.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you like to leave?'' they asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' she responded.
</P>
<P>
   They were patient, gently coaxing her out of the house.
</P>
<P>
   A big gust of wind blew through the windows and dogs started
barking. Then everything got quiet.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was gone,'' said Bradshaw, adding that the sound of
traffic on nearby South Lamar Boulevard slowly returned to the
house.
</P>

 &HT;    Halloween: Bewitched, bothered, banned
 &HT;    By Douglas Belkin
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Troy Temple spent most of the last
decade trying to make Halloween a nauseating experience.
</P>
<P>
   In his museum of the macabre, guillotines severed heads, caskets
dropped from the ceiling dumping corpses to the ground and cars
crashed, hurling drivers to their deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The point wasn't fear for fear's sake. It was fear for God's
sake.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to confront people with their own mortality,''
Temple said. ``We wanted to turn around the whole idea of
celebrating Halloween and confront people with the reality that
everyone is going to die and come to judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Temple, the former director of ``ScareMare'' at the evangelical
Liberty University in Lynchburg, Va., and the new youth minister at
First Baptist Church in West Palm Beach, is on the cutting edge of
a battle over the ownership of All Hallow's Eve that has been
picking up fervor as the millennium approaches.
</P>
<P>
   Long the property of secular horror fanatics and kids, Halloween
has become a turf war between the religious right and the secular
left and has caught just about everybody else somewhere in between.
</P>
<P>
   Public schools, terrified of offending anyone, run ``fall
festival'' pageants that ban scary costumes and promote G-rated
television and book characters. Businesses, especially in the Bible
Belt, steer clear of references to witches and goblins to promote
their sales.
</P>
<P>
   But it's the Christian churches that have really taken up the
fight against Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   Even liberal congregations organize Hallelujah Hoedowns and
carnivals where children dress up as ``heroes of the Bible'' or
animals from Noah's Ark.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end are ``Judgment Houses'' like ScareMare, run by
evangelical Christian groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, 22,000 people went through the house and 4,200 made
decisions for Christ,'' Temple said. ``That's more than you see in
most churches in a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Christians say Halloween is not harmless fun and
that the recent spate of school shootings points to a need for
spiritual guidance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where do you think all the violence comes from?'' asks the
Rev. Herb Dickinson, director of missions for the Palm Lake Baptist
Association. ``Our children are soaking in the devil. Exposing
children to that sort of thinking, to mysticism and reading
different kinds of books and Ouija boards, that's the sort of thing
that prompted all these killings.''
</P>
<P>
   Celebrating Halloween, Dickinson says, is akin to glorifying
Satan. And as the ``end times'' close in, as many millennialists
believe, the veil that separates this world from the next is
fraying.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, that's exactly what Halloween celebrated. In
pre-Christian times, it was widely believed that there was a world
of the living and a world of the dead. Halloween, observed at the
beginning of winter _ a season associated with cold and death _ was
believed to be a night during which the dead could slip through the
barrier that separated those two worlds.
</P>
<P>
   That transition wasn't always a cause for fear. In ancient
times, the dead were not unambiguously bad. In the Celtic tradition
dating back 2,000 years, the dead could be fed and led out of town
before they became mischievous (trick or treat). But in the Middle
Ages, as the Christian church spread a campaign of disinformation
against nonbelievers, pagans were demonized and in many cases
tortured and murdered, said University of Miami religion professor
Christine Gudorf.
</P>
<P>
   The modern caricature of a witch as old, decrepit and brewing up
a caldron of magic potion can be traced to elderly women who were
skilled in the not-well-understood art of herbal healing. In a book
commissioned by the pope in 1486 called ``The Hammer of the
Witches,'' the church's fear and loathing of the occult was
canonized, Gudorf said. The book stated that, among other things,
witches had sex with the devil.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of those stories were recycled and used to write the
satanic bible centuries later, Gudorf said. ``It all gets very
convoluted, but the absurd satanic fantasies of those persecutors
are actually what a lot of (people) are reacting to today.''
</P>
<P>
   Which isn't to say those reactions lack sincerity. And though
most people see Halloween as kitschy costumes and sugar-saturation,
the religious right sees no reason to take chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Christians are aware of a lot of things spiritually because
they realize the power of God's spirit and also of the devil,''
said Robert Simonds, the president and founder of the
California-based National Association of Christian Educators.
``When we poke fun at the spirit world, we are deceiving ourselves
and our children into believing it doesn't really exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickinson cites passages from the Old Testament warning against
idolatry and witchcraft. He is also quick to point to contemporary
examples of the occult, like the medium who recently tried to get
in touch with Babe Ruth to ask him to lift the ``Curse of the
Bambino'' so the Red Sox could finally beat the Yankees this year
in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That absolutely sounds satanic to me,'' Dickinson said.
``You're dealing with the spirit world, and I'm sorry, but God
himself exposed that for what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   This crusade to marginalize Halloween has, to a certain extent,
succeeded. Richard Hughes, principal of Highland Elementary School
in Lake Worth, said costumes at his school have been limited for
the past six years to characters from books approved by the school.
The limitations avoid any confrontations between goblins and ghouls
and the parents who might not like them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess you could say we're getting around it,'' Hughes said.
``To some people the holiday is satanic, and that amounts to
bringing religion into the school, which we stay away from.''
Though Simonds of NACE urges Christians to act as ``prayer
warriors'' to fight ``covens of witches and other pagan religions
as they call forth their demon spirits,'' the idea that Halloween
is a day to glorify Satan is insulting to many modern-day Pagans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very spiritual time of the year, and for some people
that's going to seem very scary and haunting but it can be very
beautiful experience,'' said Erin Weston, a self-described
third-generation witch and a graduate student studying religion at
Florida International University. ``The first rule of witchcraft is
to do what you want as long as you don't harm anybody else. There
is nothing to be afraid of.''
</P>
<P>
   Temple, of the First Baptist Church, disagrees. The
Spook-a-Delic event he is planning this year won't be as
frightening as ScareMare. He hasn't had that much time to put into
it. But the tactics will be similar, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest element to scaring someone is the unknown,''
Temple said. ``We will use that fear as much as we can.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Pay no attention to those losses behind the curtain.
</P>
<P>
   Thus spake management at Amazon.com, the great and powerful, the
Internet sweetheart stock. And for years, investors obeyed,
focusing instead on Amazon's impressive revenue growth as a reason
to pay dearly for the stock. The more money the company lost, the
higher its stock seemed to go.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, however, things appeared to change in the Land of
Internet Oz. Investors appear to be looking closer at Amazon.com
and they do not like what they see. For example, cumulative losses
at the five-year-old Internet retailer now exceed $550 million.
</P>
<P>
   Attitudes started changing late last Wednesday when Amazon.com,
perhaps the most beloved of Internet stocks, reported its
third-quarter earnings and fourth-quarter outlook in a conference
call with shareholders. The company said that while its revenues
more than doubled, its net loss in the period was $197 million, up
more than fourfold from the $45 million it lost in the same quarter
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon also warned that it would not be profitable until 2002,
well beyond analysts' hopes, and said it would spend $250 million
to promote its Web site this Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, euphoric investors would have propelled the stock
on a doubling in sales. But on Thursday, the shares plunged 6.5
percent on the news, wiping out $1.6 billion of Amazon's market
value. And on Friday, the stock slipped again, to 70.625.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, Wall Street analysts, who had been schooling
investors in the ``ignore losses'' view, expressed frustration with
Amazon management over the company's ballooning losses. Five
analysts lowered their ratings on the stock, including Henry
Blodget, Merrill Lynch's Internet guru who said in a report that
investors would soon become ``as tired as we are of endless
postponement of gratification.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Amazon's numbers don't paint a pretty picture. Customer
growth has slowed from 60 percent in the fourth quarter of 1997 to
22 percent in the most recent quarter. Revenues per customer have
declined from $40.32 in the third quarter of 1997 to $27.16.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon has long said that a decline in revenues per customer is
to be expected since not all shoppers buy each quarter. The company
instead points to growing repeat orders as an indication of brand
loyalty. The most recent period had a 72 percent repeat order rate
compared with 55 percent two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, revenues per new customer have declined almost 20
percent from $51.68 in 1997 to $41.51 today. At the same time, cost
per new customer has risen 10.2 percent, from $32.73 to $36.08.
This is not the kind of progress most shareholders want to see.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com is not the only Internet company experiencing
increasing costs to acquire new customers. In the most recent
quarter, Ameritrade, one of the nation's largest Internet
brokerages, greatly increased its costs associated with signing up
new clients. These costs almost tripled from $157 per customer in
the third quarter of 1999 to $451 in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Irritation with Amazon's continued unprofitability among
brokerage analysts, some of the very same folks who helped push
Amazon's stock to a split-adjusted $105.0625 a share last April may
indicate that Wall Street will be less inclined to help the company
feed the beast with the proceeds from fresh stock and bond
offerings.
</P>
<P>
   This is worrisome. In the last year and a half, Amazon has
collected $1.75 billion from investors, money that it is now
breezily spending on marketing and acquisitions. If this flow of
funds is cut off, then the party is really over.

INTERNET START-UP'S STOCK TAKES OFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   An expected red hot market for Friday's initial public offering
of Akamai Technologies Inc. quickly became a financial volcano as
the Internet-based startup firm's stock price soared from a morning
price of 26 to close the day at 145 3/16.
</P>
<P>
   The fivefold increase made Akamai's opening-day gain the
fourth-biggest gain for a U.S. stock in a single day of trading.
The first trade of the day set the pace, at 110, and the high for
the afternoon was 166.
</P>
<P>
   When the smoking-hot ashes finally settled after the
9-million-share offering, the 14-month-old Cambridge, Mass.,
company had raised $234 million and achieved an end-of-day market
valuation of $13.13 billion.
</P>
<P>
   This made Akamai, which has devised a way to speed delivery of
Web pages, worth more on paper than Apple Computer Corp. and
constituted the nation's second IPO eruption of the month.
</P>
<P>
   Only a week earlier, Sycamore Networks inc. of Chelmsford,
Mass., a developer of next-generation optical communications
equipment, saw its first-day IPO climb 486 percent, from 38 to 184
3/4.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing to see how new business models like Akamai and
Sycamore have caught on with investors, both institutional and
individuals,'' said Ullas Naik, senior vice president of First
Albany Corp. in Boston. ``Akamai is making the existing Internet
infrastructure more efficient and, given how this company in just
over a year has become a leader, is amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Akamai, which takes its name from the Hawaiian word for
``clever'' or ``cool,'' was expected to have a highly successful
IPO because of its advanced software technology, its big-name
customers, and early positioning as a leader in delivering vast
amounts of information more quickly from major Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The company's FreeFlow service links 1,475 computer servers in
24 countries through 55 telecommunications networks, using
proprietary software to keep thousands of Web pages updated almost
instantly and available without delay to viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Akamai's early customers include Yahoo! Inc., CNN.com, and Apple
Computer, the latter an early corporate investor, along with Cisco
Systems and Microsoft Corp. The combined investments of $76.5
million made between June and September by Apple, Cisco, and
Microsoft now have a market value of $784 million. Cisco's share
alone is worth $541.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Among all Akamai investors, Battery Ventures, a venture-capital
firm in Wellesley, Mass., was by far the biggest financial winner.
Battery invested $4.85 million early in the company's formation and
owns 11.1 percent of the stock, now worth about $1.46 billion, a
300-fold gain on its investments.
</P>
<P>
   Akamai's cofounders, F. Thomson Leighton, 42, and Daniel M.
Lewin, 29, are also billionaires on paper, each with shares worth
nearly $1.4 billion at the end of trading Friday. Leighton, on
leave from a mathematics professorship he has held since 1982 at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is the company's chief
scientific officer. Lewin, who was one of Leighton's graduate
students, is chief technology officer.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, George H. Conrades, 60, Akamai's chairman and chief
executive, now owns stock valued at $952 million. Conrades formerly
was chief executive of the former BBN Corp., which is now GTE
Internetworking, a national Internet service company.
</P>
<P>
   Akamai, like Sycamore, gained its stratospheric stock valuation
because Wall Street investors see value in the next generation of
Internet and communication infrastructures, several Wall Street
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Akamai's roots go back to last year's MIT student business-plan
competition. Lewin and Leighton placed second and immediately
attracted attention from Battery Ventures, which specializes in
Internet and telecommunications ventures and provided about
$500,000 in startup funding.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were three main ingredients that this team had,''
recalled Todd A. Dagres, a general partner at Battery. ``These guys
(Lewin and Leighton) were off-the-charts smart; they had incredible
drive; and they had the `secret sauce' for how to make the Internet
work better.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on Friday's financial return, Akamai is by far Battery
Ventures' biggest investment success, eclipsing a 30-fold return it
received when Level 3 Communications Inc. acquired XCom Corp. of
Cambridge last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Akamai investment also beats Battery's triumph earlier this
year, when a $4 million investment in Redstone Communications Inc.
of Westford yielded $30 million five months later when Redstone was
bought by Siemens AG of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Akamai's IPO came after rival Sandpiper Networks Inc. of
Thousand Oaks, Calif., was considering an initial public offering
but chose to be acquired by Digital Island Inc., a San Francisco
company that runs a public communications network.
</P>
<P>
   Digital acquired privately-held Sandpiper for about $1.1 billion
in Digital stock last Monday, shares that traded at 38 11/16 and
soared, as investors waited for Akamai's IPO, to 67 1/2 at the end
of trading Friday. That price makes Sandpiper's value $1.85
billion. ``Looking at Akamai, Digital got a phenomenal bargain in
Sandpiper,'' Naik said.

MEXICAN PLAN TO CHARGE DRIVERS MUCH MORE AT BORDER DRAWS FIRE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (REPEATING to DELETE photo note)  
 (ATTN: Texas, Calif.)  (mk) 
 By SAM DILLON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ A Mexican government plan to charge travelers who
drive cars with American plates into Mexico a deposit of up to $800
has provoked expressions of dismay from critics who say it could
persuade hundreds of thousands of tourists to cancel plans for
travel to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The new regulation was written to crack down on illegal car
imports, but experts estimated that half or more of the 800,000
people who receive car permits for Mexico each year would make
other travel plans rather than pay the large deposits.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new rules, the deposit required to drive into Mexico
is to rise from the current $11 to $400 for a U.S.-registered car
manufactured before 1994, to $600 for cars made from 1994 to 1998,
and to $800 for a 1999 or later model. The deposit, which is
refunded on the car's return to the United States, applies only to
cars used to drive beyond the 15-mile border zone.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican Customs officers were originally instructed to begin
collecting the new deposits in cash on Nov. 1. But after the plan
drew fire from residents along the border and from politicians in
Washington and Mexico City, officials postponed it late Thursday
and amended it to allow for credit card payment. A statement issued
Friday afternoon by the Mexican Embassy in Washington said the new
rules would be in place for the Christmas holiday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our problem with illegal vehicles is serious,'' said Marco
Provencio, a Treasury Ministry spokesman. ``We understand the
complaints about this program, but the law is the law and we have
the right to enforce it.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those criticizing the plan were several American
congressmen and hundreds of Mexican-Americans who have been calling
television and radio stations from Texas to California.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who are going to suffer most are from the
Mexican-American community, because when you have to pay $600 or
$800, people just don't have the money,'' said Rep. Solomon Ortiz,
D-Texas. ``This will affect businesses, families, tourism. There
are meetings all up and down the border, people are getting
together and there will be demonstrations because this is unfair. I
hope they rethink this or there's going to be chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   Even several Mexican officials have criticized the program as
unfair to the 2 million Mexican workers who drive home from the
United States for Christmas and Easter. The plan, authored by
Mexican Treasury officials, has unleashed a slugfest inside the
government, with special opposition coming from Mexican consular
officials based in the United States, one Mexican official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a horrifying error,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Carla Felsted, a co-editor of Mexico Meanderings, an Austin,
Texas, newsletter about vacationing by car in Mexico, said half her
readers would probably cancel plans to vacation in Mexico rather
than pay the deposits.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're going to charge that much to your credit card, even
with the promise of cash back on leaving, that's going to keep at
least 50 percent of Americans from going,'' Ms. Felsted said. ``If
they charge $11 to your credit card, that's OK. But $800, now
that'll really get your attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Because used cars often cost less than half as much in the
United States as in Mexico, 1.5 million used cars are currently
circulating in Mexico illegally, with no Mexican plates. The
illegal cars are often used by criminals, and since their owners
pay no taxes, the situation represents a serious drain on
government revenues, said Provencio. The 14 million legally
registered cars in Mexico provide $800 million in tax revenues each
year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under current rules, travelers who wish to drive cars with
American plates into Mexico at any of the 23 legal crossing points
along the 2,000-mile border can receive a six-month permit by
paying an $11 deposit with their credit card. Two other cash-based
options are far more expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new rules originally proposed by the Treasury
Ministry, travelers' were to pay the new $400 to $800 deposits only
in cash, and the deposits were to be redeemable only at the same
border crossing through which travelers had entered Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   After a flood of criticism, officials amended the new rules to
allow for payment by credit card and to allow the redemption of the
deposits at any border crossing, Carlos Bandala Serrano, the
central administrator of the Mexican customs agency, said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Customs officials and Banjercito, the army-owned bank that
handles the border deposits, will need several weeks to
``fine-tune'' computer communications among the 23 border stations
to allow officials to process the credit card deposits and cash
redemptions at any point along the border, Bandala said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A Mexican official who criticized the new plan said it would
force the government to keep large amounts of cash stockpiled at
each border station, inviting robbery or graft.
</P>
<P>
   The new regulation reflects a hardened determination to crack
down on the illegal auto imports, which have posed an increasingly
ticklish political problem. For several decades, successive
governments did little to enforce Mexico's vehicle importation
laws. Instead, police allowed the cars to accumulate on the streets
until, every six years during the presidential election campaign,
successive candidates of the governing party would promise to
legalize the vehicles, thus buying votes from hundreds of thousands
of illegal car owners.
</P>
<P>
   But this year a consensus has emerged within the establishment
of the governing party, known as the PRI, that the cars pose too
serious a problem to play politics. Francisco Labastida Ochoa, the
PRI's leading presidential candidate, has refused several times
this year to promise to legalize them.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the PRI governor of Chihuahua took a different stand
when he began selling authorization stickers for illegal cars there
for $300, brushing aside protests from federal officials. The
Treasury Ministry retaliated by withholding federal funds from
Chihuahua, and the case ended in court. A district judge has sided
with the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   This political background, as well as the increasing use made of
the illegal vehicles by drug traffickers and others to commit
crimes, appears to have persuaded the government that it must
prevent further illegal importation of cars at all costs.
</P>
<P>
   The new deposits are part of a broader package of new rules
governing cross-border travel, some of which are already being
implemented at the border. And there are signs that confusion
surrounding the new program is being aggravated by the traditional
communications problems between Mexico City and the border.
</P>
<P>
   Juani Martinez, a Mexican woman with legal American residency in
Corpus Christi, Texas, said that for 15 years she has renewed her
Mexican car permit every six months. But earlier this month,
customs officials refused to renew her permit, saying she was now
eligible for only one six-month permit each year.
</P>
<P>
   Bandala said that there has been no change in the frequency with
which car owners can apply to renew their permits. But Ms. Martinez
said customs officials at the border were emphatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked, `Why are you denying me this permit?' and they said,
`People in the capital city told us this is the new law,''' Ms.
Martinez said. On Wednesday, Ms. Martinez organized a meeting in
Corpus Christi to develop protests of the new rules.

NEWS ANALYSIS: COURT NOT LIKELY TO ALTER STAND ON CAPITAL
PUNISHMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Va.)  (js) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The death penalty kept the Supreme Court working
late this week. Twice the justices responded to the pleas of death
row inmates, hours away from execution, not only by granting
last-minute stays of execution but also by accepting their cases
for full argument and decision.
</P>
<P>
   One case, which quickly generated national attention, posed the
question of whether Florida's unreliable electric chair presented
such a risk of ``physical violence, disfigurement and torment'' as
to amount to unconstitutionally cruel and unusual punishment. The
other case, less soundbite-worthy but likely to affect considerably
more people, raised the question of whether the new federal habeas
corpus law eliminated federal judges' discretion to consider issues
the inmate failed to present at the state court level _ even if the
state itself, by suppressing relevant evidence, had made it all but
impossible for the inmate to do so.
</P>
<P>
   This was an unusual flurry of after-hours activity, especially
for a week when the court had no public business scheduled and was
technically in recess. It brought to four the number of death
penalty appeals the court will hear this term, with the other two
also having been granted in the context of last-minute stays of
execution, and led some death penalty opponents to raise the
question of whether the court might be about to shift course on
capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   The answer to that question is almost certainly no. No current
member of the court adheres to the view long held by Justices
Thurgood Marshall and William J. Brennan, Jr. that the death
penalty was an affront to a civilized society, let alone the
position adopted by Justice Harry A. Blackmun at the end of his
career that the ``machinery of death,'' as he called it, was simply
not as fair in practice as the court had deemed it to be in theory
by upholding new state death penalty laws in 1976 and permitting
the states to resume executions.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, there are at least two other explanations for the sudden
visibility of death penalty cases on the Supreme Court's docket.
One is the record pace of executions, which is channeling to the
court ever more petitions from inmates who have run through their
final round of appeals. While it took 12 years after 1976 for the
states to carry out 100 executions, there have been 82 executions
in the first 10 months of this year alone, a pace unequaled since
the early 1950s. There are more than 3,500 people on death row, up
from 3,000 five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The second explanation is the enactment of the Antiterrorism and
Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, a law aimed in part at curbing
the ability of federal judges to second-guess state courts and the
ability of state prisoners to file one petition for a writ of
habeas corpus after another, challenging the constitutionality of
their convictions or sentences. While the goal of Congress was
clear, the language and structure of the bill it passed, as the
result of last-minute compromises and with little public scrutiny,
was much less so, and the lower federal courts are in considerable
disarray over how to interpret central provisions of the law.
Conflicts among the federal appeals courts _ on any subject _
present the strongest possible case for Supreme Court intervention.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the four death penalty cases raise questions under the
1996 law, including the case the court granted Thursday night
barely an hour before Virginia was scheduled to execute Michael W.
Williams, convicted of a double murder. The question in that case,
Williams vs. Taylor, No. 99-6615, is the meaning of a provision
that strips the federal courts of the power even to hold a hearing
to determine the facts of any issue that an inmate seeking habeas
corpus ``failed to develop'' in prior state court proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of Williams' case was an undisclosed plea agreement
that the prosecution had made with his co-defendant, who testified
against him, along with an undisclosed psychiatric report that
might have impeached the co-defendant's credibility. A federal
district judge in Alexandria granted a hearing on these issues,
reasoning that the state's failure to disclose the information
excused the defendant's earlier failure to ``develop'' the issue,
but the 4th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, in Richmond, rejected
that analysis and directed the district court to dismiss the
petition.
</P>
<P>
   The 4th Circuit's interpretation of other provisions of the 1996
law is at issue in a second Supreme Court appeal that was argued
Oct. 4. That case, confusingly, is also called Williams vs. Taylor
(No. 98-8384); the two inmates happen to share the last name
Williams, while the Taylor is John B. Taylor, warden of the state
prison in Waverly, Va.
</P>
<P>
   A third death penalty case, Weeks vs. Angelone, No. 99-5746, is
also from Virginia, raising a question of whether the trial judge
was obliged to clarify a sentencing instruction that, while
constitutional, evidently left the jury confused.
</P>
<P>
   Of the four cases, the reason for the court's willingness to
hear the Eighth Amendment challenge to Florida's electric chair, in
Bryan v. Moore, No. 99-6723, is the least obvious. The justices had
recently turned down several nearly identical cases. But this case
had several distinctive factors: a well-written petition, the
strong dissent from the 4-3 decision by the Florida Supreme Court
that upheld continued use of the chair, the inclusion in that
dissent of graphic photographs from the last electrocution (also
posted on the Florida Supreme Court's Web site) and the fact that
two other, identical cases had recently been filed. Any or all of
these might have persuaded the justices that the issue would not go
away and that the time for a final, authoritative decision one way
or the other had arrived.

 DAFOE ENDS HOLDOUT, REACHES 3-YEAR DEAL WORTH $9.3 million  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GREENIDGE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Bruins net minder who wears No. 34 will be in goal shortly.
Byron Dafoe on Friday ended his two-month holdout when he reached
agreement with president/general manager Harry Sinden on a
three-year, $9.3 million deal.
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe went into Sinden's office at the FleetCenter, and in 40
minutes, an agreement was reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no factors, this just happened,'' said Sinden. ``I
knew this would happen one day and today was the day. We don't
discuss terms, but when you make a compromise, that's what happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have our No. 1 goalie in the fold, which gives all of us,
including his teammates, a great deal of comfort. We're looking
forward to Byron continuing his great play that we've seen here the
last two years over the next three years. This turned out to be an
ordeal for both of us, and we're glad it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Dafoe was selected a second-team all-star and was a
finalist for the Vezina Trophy as the league's top goaltender. He
had his second consecutive 30-win season (32-23-11) and had a 1.99
goals against average, both career bests. He also had a
league-leading 10 shutouts in 68 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went into the battle with Harry and we both agree it was
tough on us as individuals and an organization,'' said Dafoe, who
has already lost about $400,000 in salary. ``We both felt we had to
do what we had to do. I can honestly say I'm satisfied, and I'm
ready to put my sweater on and start playing again for the Boston
Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of days ago, it was almost do it or don't do it, and
I was at a point where I felt it wasn't going to get done in the
next day or two, so I was going to go elsewhere, as much as I
wanted to stay here in Boston. If I wasn't going to be a Boston
Bruin, I'd go somwehere else via a trade.''
</P>
<P>
   But only one team telephoned Sinden about Dafoe. ``We never
initiated any trade talks,'' Sinden said. ``We did have what turned
out to be a serious inquiry from one club that didn't get very far.
We were biding our time before we ever reached that conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   The negotiation with Sinden was simply between Dafoe and Sinden.
Ron Salcer, Dafoe's agent, did not participate. He is now, most
likely, Dafoe's former agent. ``I have no comment on that,'' Dafoe
said. ``I don't want to comment on that whole situation.'' Efforts
to reach Salcer were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe has been working out on his own. ``Obviously, I can't
compare it to an NHL full-fledged practice, but I feel I'm in very
good shape, especially for being on the ice. I think four or five
practices and I should be ready to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to play as soon as possible and I want to make sure I'm
at the highest level and ready to go before I enter a game. If it's
New Jersey Thursday that's great, and if it's a game later,
whenever I'm ready and (coach) Pat (Burns) thinks I'm ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns was called about an hour after Dafoe agreed to terms.
``He's very excited, very happy,'' Sinden said. ``He's got his No.
1 goalie back, and I think he realizes he's got pretty good depth
in goal.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins (3-5-4), who have gone 3-0-1 their last four games,
have been playing in front of Rob Tallas (2-2-2, 2.60 GAA), Dafoe's
backup last season, and John Grahame (1-3-2, 2.12 GAA), who guided
the Bruins' American Hockey League affiliate, Providence, to the
Calder Cup last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know John Grahame's ability but I knew Robbie Tallas,
and I knew what type of team we have,'' Dafoe said. `I knew we had
a tough start (0-5-4). It wasn't so much what the team did, but how
Harry and I got together to get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the first items taken care of when Sinden and Dafoe met
Friday was to discuss the numerous interviews, some contentious,
the two have given the last couple of months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cleared the air of everything that was said, some of it
scripted, some of it personal, some of it to make things happen,
some of it said in haste,'' Dafoe said. ``We put our differences
aside. What's done in the past doesn't matter, and we're both
moving forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe indicated he simply didn't give in to the need to get back
to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't sign a deal if I wasn't going to be happy with
it,'' he stated. ``I wasn't just doing it so I could get a
paycheck. We both moved on the subject and we're both happy. I felt
it had to come to an end sooner or later, and I wanted to get it
done sooner.''
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe, in his ninth pro season after being acquired from the Los
Angeles Kings July 8, 1995, has watched every Bruins game, and he
has spoken to four or five players during his holdout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just looking forward to getting back and playing with
them,'' he said. ``It's a family, and you're not there and the days
are pretty lonely. (Saturday's) going to be probably the most
excited I'll be about going on the ice with Pat Burns in a long
time.''

   Am-development (for Sunday 10-31-99 florence, gadsden,
tuscaloosa) headline By Dana Beyerle Montgomery Bureau
</P>
<P>
   MONTGOMERY - While Gov. Don Siegelman was in Japan last week
seeking premiere jobs for Alabama, a group back home was debating a
controversial two-tiered economic development strategy that
proponents hope will land jobs in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   The group under the auspices of the Alabama Commerce Commission
created by Siegelman seeks to change state law so industry hunters
can offer incentives even to minimum wage industries.
</P>
<P>
   Auburn University history professor Wayne Flynt, author of a
book about Alabama's poor whites, said that Alabama's economic
development strategy doesn't make sense because it ignores economic
differences in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a third-world set of counties and we have some
first-world counties,'' Flynt said. ``To get where we need to be we
have to have a transitional economic development strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the state's 67 counties, 20 had an unemployment rate smaller
than the state average of 4.6 percent, including DeKalb, Blount,
St. Clair and Tuscaloosa.
</P>
<P>
   High unemployment exists in 47 of 67 counties. A total of 34
counties had a rate between 4.6 percent and 10 percent, including
Lauderdale, Colbert, Lawrence, Franklin, Marshall, Etowah,
Cherokee, Bibb, Hale, Sumter and Marengo. And 13 counties had
unemployment rates over 10 percent, including Butler County with
the highest rate of 17.3 percent, and Fayette, Pickens and Greene.
</P>
<P>
   A two-tiered economic development approach is controversial
because not everyone in the economic development community agrees
with it.
</P>
<P>
   And the Alabama Education Association, which killed the last
economic development experiment - a job creation tax credit - also
may oppose it.
</P>
<P>
   John Hansen, executive director of the Economic Development
Association of Alabama who has been working with Alabama
Development Office Director Ken Funderburk, notes that Georgia has
a three-tiered economic development package to offer prospective
clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're going to project to Ken Funderburk is to allow for
a job tax credit so if you create a job in an opportunity area or
some area that has more chronic development needs than other areas
of the state, based on per capita income, unemployment over periods
of time, and some other factors, it would give those areas of the
state that have not yet shared in full prosperity of Alabama the
opportunity to do so,'' Hansen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to enhance rural economic development while
keeping the metropolitan engine going along,'' Hansen said.
</P>
<P>
   Current state law authorizes a 5 percent income tax credit to a
prospect with a minimum investment of $2 million creating at least
20 jobs paying at least $8 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``That applies whether you live in Covington County or in
Madison County,'' said Larry Lee, executive director of the
Covington County Economic Development Commission, and a critic of
the current incentive package.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make any sense we're ignoring local market forces
and market conditions and telling each person to hit that $8 per
hour,'' Lee said. ``Our wage is two-thirds of Madison County's ...
but you still got to hit the same benchmark to access the incentive
program.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Covington County lost a company that was considering
Florala.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had this guy in Michigan looking at an existing building,''
Lee said. ``He's going to be okay on wages and on job numbers but
on the investment he's only going to spend $400,000 to buy a
building and $200,000 to refurbish it. This guy from Michigan said
to me 'I'm coming to a little community and bringing good paying
jobs and I can't avail myself of that incentive?' I said, Don,
under current Alabama law you can't.''
</P>
<P>
   He said under a tiered approach minimum investment shouldn't
matter.
</P>
<P>
   Keivan Deravi, an economist at Auburn University in Montgomery
believes that certain low paying jobs aren't worth attracting.
</P>
<P>
   ``My perspective is you have to recruit based on a strategic
recruitment policy,'' Deravi said. ``We have to target industry
that benefits in the long term and actively pursue and get them no
matter the cost.''
</P>
<P>
   He said assume you attract an industry that pays $8 an hour but
its workers are all immigrants from Central America, immigrants who
bring children that are in school systems at $5,000 each. ``The net
cost is cost is $20,000 plus a social infrastructure cost,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My point was let's not bring chicken processing factories
in,'' he said. ``We are saying that some jobs are worse jobs.
Personally I don't think by going after obsolete and labor
intensive and low skilled types of industry, you are going to gain
anything.
</P>
<P>
   Lee said that Deravi has a job and would change his tune if he
was starving.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're unemployed in Covington County, $8 an hour looks
good,'' Lee said. ``It just kind of whose ox is being gored.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it's cold hearted but in this state we have to worry
about the next generation,'' Deravi said.
</P>
<P>
   The Public Affairs Research Council in a study last year
concluded that what counts in economic development is attracting
high paying jobs because the lower the wage rate the higher the
investment has to be for a payback.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you spend all your incentives on $5-an-hour jobs you're not
going to make money,'' said PARCA's Jim Williams. ``But the rural
people make the argument if you limit it like we do they never get
the benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Poorer counties are paying taxes to subsidize counties like
Tuscaloosa,'' Auburn's Flynt said, mentioning where the state's
biggest economic prize, Mercedes-Benz, located in 1993. Hence the
challenge to change the law to allow flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of rural interests in this state are looking for some
solution to this from the Legislature,'' said the EDAA's Hansen,
who said the commission will issue a report on Nov. 15.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to present bills in the regular legislative session
in February.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of our competitors in the Southeast and other areas have
tiered systems that have worked to their benefit,'' Hansen said.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin Lassiter, current president of the EDAA, said minimum
wage and incentive benchmarks haven't been decided, nor has a
definition of an economically depressed area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working on it right now,'' he said. ``It involves menu
of taxes a company may be able to take credit against.''
</P>
<P>
   Locating in a developed county would result in a different job
tax credit per employee than locating in a less-developed county,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a sense out there maybe the smaller or less
developed counties are at a competitive disadvantage and this
tiering idea would help them,'' Lassiter said. ``Rural communities
offer good land and great quality of life and it's a matter of
attracting them.''
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Frank McDaniel, D-Albertville, chairman of the House
Commerce Committee, and Sen. Charles Steele, D-Tuscaloosa, chairman
of the Senate Industrial Development and Recruitment Committee, are
members of Siegelman's commerce commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to look at incentives that will have some impact on
some of the undeveloped areas of the state,'' McDaniel said.
``We've got to keep the whole thing in perspective to represent the
state as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he believes the Legislature will be receptive to a
tiered industrial incentive policy. ``We've got to be careful of
what we do but a two-tiered concept makes sense,'' McDaniel said.
</P>
<P>
   Steele could not be reached for comment but he has advocated
more economic development opportunities for his district, which
includes economically depressed areas.
</P>
<P>
   Dara Longgrear, executive director of the Tuscaloosa County
Industrial Development Authority, is an advocate of attracting
higher paying jobs although he admits there is ``a lot of political
momentum on this tiered effect.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a study by PARCA that says there clearly is a payback
to the state of Alabama when we offer incentives to companies that
will pay $8 an hour or better,'' he said. ``In my mind we shouldn't
have a strategy below that.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the economic development community should place more
emphasis on returns to local tax coffers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to be aware how we negotiate our incentive package,''
he said. ``We have both the responsibility for recruiting the
industry and abating the taxes. What it has done is made us more
cautious what we're getting and what we're giving up.''
</P>
<P>
   He believes the state can create a tiered policy without
penalizing successful areas.
</P>
<P>
   Forrest Wright, executive director the Shoals Economic
Development Authority, said most states use a tiered system. ``I
think that a tiered system would help spread development throughout
all parts of the state,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mike McCain, executive director of the Gadsden-Etowah County
Industrial Development Authority, said it's common practice for
states to approve greater financial incentives for projects in
geographical areas where the level of economic distress is highest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may not make sense to offer such substantial incentives to
create low-level jobs in a metropolitan area with a low
unemployment rate but it may make sense to create those jobs in
areas where the unemployment is two or three times the national
average,'' he said. ``The condition of the state can be no better
than the condition of the level of distress in the worst of its
counties.''
</P>
<P>
   However, on each project ``no matter the size and no matter the
area, it's incumbent on all state and local official to ensure that
the benefits exceed the cost,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all in this business to improve the economies in our
areas, to create new taxes, to improve the economic vitality of our
constituent areas,'' he said. ``Therefore it makes absolutely no
sense to do a deal that would result in the lessening of the
economic vitality of the area.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Wright and McCain also are advocates of providing up front
money for many projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Granting a tax exemption or providing tax credits over 10 or
20 years exceeds the amount of time most companies measure return
on invested capital,'' McCain said. ``In general companies place a
much higher premium on those mechanisms that reduce initial project
costs than they do reduce annual operating expenses. The greater
return in the shortest period of time is the objective.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a business deal,'' Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also likes a job development income tax credit, which the
AEA's Paul Hubbert killed several years ago because income taxes go
to the education budget which funds teacher salaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now the state of Mississippi can offer what we used to
call a job development fee under the old Mercedes act,'' McCain
said. ``If a project is looking at a geographic area that
encompasses eastern Mississippi and western Alabama, unless there
are some very unusual offsetting reasons, they're going to locate
in Mississippi.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Paul Hubbert, the executive secretary of the AEA, is
keeping an eye on developments.
</P>
<P>
   He said Alabama doesn't need to attract cut-and-sew operations
that will take advantage of incentives and ``cut out as soon as
that's over because we will be doing that at the peril of education
funding.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll reserve judgment but it would be one of those things that
a good idea taken to extreme is a bad idea,'' Hubbert said. ``The
whole purpose of an incentive program is to attract quality
industries and not to pay for minimum wage jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless we just want to cut education funding out at the
expense of cut-and-sew shops, we can't just give them away,'' he
said. ``As bad as things may be in some locations they're a heck of
a lot better than they were 10 years ago.''

<P>
   TORONTO _ In the early 1990s, Barbara G. Stymiest, a partner at
the accounting firm Ernst &AMP; Young here, was irritated to discover
that her Toronto golf club reserved Saturday morning tee times for
men, on the assumption that wives could play all week long.
</P>
<P>
   That golf rule has long since been changed, and Ms. Stymiest has
just become president of the Toronto Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade, as social and economic changes have swept
the country, women have suddenly begun appearing at the pinnacles
of corporate Canada.
</P>
<P>
   By some measures, they have been more successful than their U.S.
counterparts. Women now run two of the three largest companies on
Canada's Financial Post 500 list: General Motors of Canada and Ford
Motor Co. of Canada. Overall, women now run 10 of the largest
companies in Canada. By comparison, just three of the companies on
the Fortune 500 list _ and none of the top three _ are run by
women.
</P>
<P>
   As Canadian women have moved from minority to majority status on
college campuses, the trend seems likely to continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a matter of time _ women have not been in business as
long,'' Ms. Stymiest said. ``It does take time for women to
progress in their careers.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite these gains, waves of businesswomen are still bumping
against certain Canadian glass ceilings as thick as the ice on a
hockey rink. Disillusioned in part with a stodgy corporate culture
here, the number of Canadian women entrepreneurs tripled over the
last two decades, to 777,000 in 1997. With only 6 percent of
boardroom seats occupied by women, Canada lags behind the 11
percent rate in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the big fish/little pond phenomenon. The Canadian
economy is about one-twelfth that of the United States. Some people
say that Canada's ``branch plant economy'' is responsible for the
relatively high number of women running major companies here. Of
the 13 largest Canadian companies with women as chief executives,
nine are subsidiaries of U.S. companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Canada is seen as a good training ground that is relatively
safe,'' said Ronald J. Burke, a professor at the York University
School of Business here. ``The norms in our country are modestly
supportive of women. Our culture is not that different from
American culture, so it is not a risky transition.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans working in Canada are startled by the prominence
of women in business in a country sometimes equated with social
conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have had more dealings with women at very senior levels,
including president and CEO, here in Canada than I had when I was
working in the United States,'' said Bobbie A. Gaunt, a
Pennsylvania native who 18 months ago left her post as general
marketing manager for Ford in Detroit to become president and chief
executive of Ford Canada. ``I never felt my gender surprised
anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The president of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce is Nancy
Hughes Anthony. The Quebec Securities Commission has a chairwoman,
Carmen Crepin. Margaret J. Barrett is president of the Bank of
Montreal Mortgage Corp., a financial company with a $33 billion
portfolio, or 10 percent of the Canadian market.
</P>
<P>
   This has not escaped the notice of some southern neighbors.
``Canada is among the leaders in the world in having such a high
representation of women in high CEO jobs,'' said Sheila W.
Wellington, president of Catalyst, a New York-based nonprofit
organization that seeks to help women advance in the business
world. Noting that Catalyst appointed a representative to Toronto
this summer, she said, ``We are impressed with the number of women
in business leadership in Canada.''
</P>
<P>
   If the college pipeline is any indicator, Canadian women will
continue to advance in business in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   Women, who earned 38 percent of all Canadian college degrees in
1972, earned 58 percent in 1997. A similar transformation _ with
women now accounting for the majority of college students _ has
taken place in much of the industrialized world, including the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   In the area of ``business, management and commerce,'' Statistics
Canada, a government agency, reports that 51 percent of full-time
and part-time undergraduate students in the 1996-97 school year,
the most recent data available, were women. (The relative
enrollment of American women in comparable programs was slightly
lower.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are the numbers that will predict the nature of the
future managerial professional work force,'' Ms. Wellington, a
former Yale University vice president, said of the surge of women
into higher education. ``Because of the dramatic changes in the
nature of work, where brain power is more of a premium, it
certainly does position women to have a disproportionate place in
managerial and executive positions.''
</P>
<P>
   But Canadian women lag behind men in some fields that promise
high earnings in the economy of the future. Women account for only
one-quarter of Canada's computer programmers and computer science
students. But by 1997-98 women made up 38 percent of all those
pursuing Masters of Business degrees in Canada. By contrast, the
American figure was 29 percent.
</P>
<P>
   As the pressure of women in the pipeline builds at companies in
Canada, many women have been bailing out and becoming
entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   Annette Verschuren, for example, a native of Canada's
hardscrabble Cape Breton region, left a Canadian company, Imasco
Ltd., when she felt that she was not going to reach the top. She
persuaded an American arts and crafts retailer, Michael's, to enter
the Canadian market. After running the Canadian operations of
Michael's for three years, she was hired away to become president
of another subsidiary of an new American chain, Home Depot Canada,
now with 44 stores.
</P>
<P>
   Carol M. Stephenson left her job as chief executive of BCE
Media, a satellite communications unit of Bell Canada's parent,
last summer to became president and chief of Lucent Technologies
Canada Inc., a subsidiary of a U.S. company. ``The old boys'
network,'' she said, ``is alive and well _ it has not disappeared.
The new phenomenon is that women are doing more networking. Most of
us who are leading companies in Canada know each other; we talk
with one another.''
</P>
<P>
   In the spring, the Women's Executive Network, a group that
promotes contacts among women across Canada, surveyed 350 senior
level women in Canada's five largest cities: Toronto; Montreal;
Ottawa; Vancouver, British Columbia, and Calgary, Alberta. Just
over half of the respondents said that men had better networking
opportunities, but 74 percent said they had not taken up
activities, like golf or squash, to make more contacts. The reason
in part was a lack of time: six in 10 said they earned more money
than their husbands, but, on average, estimated that they did 53
percent of the housework.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the networking happens spontaneously.
</P>
<P>
   ``The moment I arrived in Canada, Maureen Kempston Darkes hosted
a party to welcome me to Canada,'' Ms. Gaunt, the Ford president,
said of the local General Motors president. ``It struck me as
unusual in two ways: we are major competitors, and the 35 to 40
women there were university presidents, CEOs of companies, judges,
senior partners in law firms, accounting firms.''
</P>
<P>
   Canada, a country sometimes called America Lite, is seen as a
safe place for a corporate career climber to punch an overseas
ticket. Americans head four of the nine largest American
subsidiaries in Canada that are run by women.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   U.S. women executives here bridled when asked whether Canada was
a softer assignment than elsewhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked to come to Canada,'' Ms. Gaunt said, noting that the
Ford operation here, which employs 17,000 people, is the
automaker's third-largest foreign subsidiary, after those in
Britain and Germany. The significance of her post is reflected back
at world headquarters: after a year of running the Canadian
operations, Ms. Gaunt also became a Ford corporate vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Country-hopping can eventually result in a top job in the big
pond. Cynthia M. Trudell, for example, a Canadian chemist for
General Motors, worked her way from Ontario to Michigan to England
before landing in Tennessee this year to become president of Saturn
Corp., the first woman to run a major American auto division.
</P>
<P>
   Some executives say that working in Canada requires _ and offers
_ significant versatility.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the U.S., the scale is so much bigger, I would get stuck at
the top of the sales silo or the marketing silo,'' said Sheelagh D.
Whittaker, chief executive of EDS Systemhouse, the Canadian
subsidiary of the Electronic Data Systems Corp. ``Here, I deal with
treasury issues, human resources issues, policy issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The difference in scale is also one reason women have made
slower advances into corporate boardrooms than in the United
States, according to two surveys by Catalyst.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bigger boards tend to have more women on them,'' said Burke of
York University, who worked on the survey. ``Canadian companies are
small and have smaller boards.''
</P>
<P>
   In Canada, only 36 of the 500 largest companies had women on
their boards; in the United States, 86 percent did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Canada also still has more of its major companies in
traditional areas _ mining, oil and gas, wood products,'' he
continued. ``They tend to be more male dominated, old boys'
dinosaurs not used to capable women.''
</P>
<P>
   Most respondents in the Women's Network survey of executive
women said that various forms of discrimination prevent women from
winning fuller representation on corporate boards.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Canada, there have been a lot of appointments of female
CEOs as the heads of very large corporations,'' Micheline Bouchard,
president of Motorola Canada Ltd., said. ``I don't know if we have
reached a critical point where we are no longer an oddity.''
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting the new trend, The National Post, a national
newspaper, recently published a six-page advertising supplement
sponsored by Canadian companies eager to showcase the women
executives in their ranks. The theme was: ``Performance, not
gender, counts.''
</P>
<P>
   But old habits and stereotypes die hard. Ms. Whittaker, the EDS
president, sometimes finds it convenient to screen her calls by
pretending to be her secretary. If the caller is someone she wants
to talk to, she puts the person on hold, waits a moment, then picks
up with her ``executive'' voice.

CLINTON ANNOUNCES NEW RULES TO PROTECT PRIVACY OF MEDICAL RECORDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton kicked off an intense debate on
Friday on how to protect the privacy of medical records in an era
when doctors can test their patients for genetic defects and send
the information round the world with the click of a computer mouse.
</P>
<P>
   In unveiling new rules to safeguard such information, Clinton
said, ``These standards represent an unprecedented step toward
putting Americans back in control of their own medical records.''
</P>
<P>
   But doctors said the rules were inadequate and could actually
erode some protections that patients now have. Several physician
groups said they had been invited to Friday's White House ceremony,
but stayed away because in many cases the proposal does not require
that patients give consent before their records are shared, only
that they be notified. Such rules, they said, does not give
patients enough control over the use and disclosure of their
medical records.
</P>
<P>
   While the administration estimated that compliance would cost
the health care industry $3.8 billion over five years, the
insurance industry says the costs could be 10 times that amount.
With both sides saying they support the goals of the standards, a
central point in the debate will be: What is privacy worth in
dollars and cents?
</P>
<P>
   Health insurance plans object, in particular, to a provision
that would make them responsible for privacy lapses by companies
that collaborate in the care of a patient. For example, an HMO that
sends a patient to a pharmacy could be liable if the pharmacy
improperly uses the patient's records.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposed rules, patients would gain a new federal
right to inspect, copy and suggest corrections in medical records
that have been kept or transmitted electronically.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials estimated that it would cost doctors,
hospitals and health maintenance organizations more than $400
million to issue notices informing patients of their privacy
rights, as required by the rules. In addition, the officials
predicted, thousands of patients will try to correct their medical
records, and it will cost the health care industry more than $2
billion to deal with these requests over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   The rules would permit the use and disclosure of medical
information without the patient's consent for treatment, payment
and a wide range of loosely defined ``health care operations,''
including many common business practices of HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Donald J. Palmisano, a trustee of the American Medical
Association, said: ``The AMA believes that mere notice of a health
plan's intended use is inadequate.''
</P>
<P>
   Many doctors contend that health plans and insurance companies
should have to obtain consent from patients before using
information from their files to monitor the patients' compliance
with recommendations for medical treatment and testing. Too often,
they say, HMOs interfere in the doctor-patient relationship by
suggesting a cheaper drug or a different course of treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration would allow health plans to use
personal health information, without the patient's consent, for
these ``health care operations'': assessing the quality of care and
the performance of doctors and nurses; developing clinical
guidelines; setting premiums for the renewal of insurance
contracts, and investigating fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard K. Harding, vice president of the American
Psychiatric Association, said the proposed rules ``give the federal
good housekeeping seal of approval to practices that could
undermine privacy.'' William Bruno, a lobbyist for the psychiatric
association, said ``patients could lose some protections they now
have'' undercourt decisions that have allowed the disclosure of
certain information only with the patient's consent.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials insisted that the rules would create
protections in areas where none now exist. Doctors, hospitals and
HMOs would, for example, have to keep logs documenting who received
access to patients' records for various purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The rules would greatly expand the role of the federal
government in regulating the practices of the health care industry.
It would set hundreds of detailed federal standards, with civil and
criminal penalties for violations.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Nell Lehnhard, senior vice president of the Blue Cross and
Blue Shield Association, described the rules as costly, complex and
confusing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that all patients should have the peace of mind
that comes from knowing their personal records are secure, and we
are outraged when breaches of this trust occur,'' Ms. Lehnhard
said. ``But why do we need 600 pages of regulations to protect
medical records when the Bill of Rights takes only one page to
provide Americans with all their basic rights? Why didn't the
administration just simply spell out what activities are illegal?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Janlori Goldman, director of the health privacy project at
Georgetown University, said: ``This is a historic day. These
regulations will be the first enforceable federal rules protecting
health privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   But, she said, the proposal falls short because ``there is no
requirement that a judge or a magistrate approve or deny access to
medical records sought by laws enforcement agencies.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the rules, most health care providers would have to
designate ``privacy officials'' to develop privacy policies and
procedures. This rule would apply even to a small office with three
doctors, who could designate the office manager as privacy
coordinator. Health care providers would also have to designate a
``contact person'' to handle patients' complaints about violations
of privacy.
</P>
<P>
   The rules make doctors, HMOs and insurance companies responsible
for any violation of a patient's privacy by their ``business
partners.''
</P>
<P>
   Kristin A. Bass, director of legislative affairs at the American
Association of Health Plans, a trade group, said that an HMO would
have little power over a drug store that improperly sells
information about the patient to a drug manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would hold us responsible for the pharmacy's
misbehavior,'' said Ms. Bass.
</P>
<P>
   Health insurance plans could also be held accountable for the
misuse of medical records by their other ``business partners,''
including their lawyers, auditors, billing firms and consultants.
</P>
<P>
   Under the rules, health care providers and health plans would
have to get the patient's consent for certain types of disclosures
_ if, for example, the information was to be used in marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors and insurers could not insist that people surrender
their privacy rights as a condition of getting treatment or
insurance. In other words, they could not coerce patients into
giving consent.
</P>
<P>
   The administration acknowledged that the rules would create
substantial costs for health care providers and health plans. But,
it said, the rules are necessary because computer technology makes
it possible to ``breach the security and privacy of health
information on a scale that was previously inconceivable.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, doctors have many new clues to their patients'
destiny. Scientists have developed more than 450 genetic tests that
may help identify people with an increased risk of developing
breast cancer, prostate cancer, cystic fibrosis and other diseases.
</P>
<P>
   In a preface to the rules, the administration said they would
have ``major social benefits'' that could not be quantified.
Privacy concerns now discourage people from being tested for
certain types of cancer and for some sexually transmitted diseases,
the administration said. The new rules will allay these concerns,
so more people will receive effective treatments, according to the
administration.
</P>
<P>
   The public will have two months to comment on the proposals,
which are to be published in the Federal Register on Nov. 3. The
secretary of Health and Human Services is supposed to issue final
rules, with the force of law, by Feb. 21, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said he was acting because Congress failed to
meet its goal of adopting comprehensive privacy standards by Aug.
21.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am taking this action today because Congress has failed to
act and because, a few years ago, Congress explicitly gave me the
authority to step in if they were unable to deal with this issue,''
Clinton said.

TOSHIBA TO SPEND $1 BILLION TO SETTLE LAPTOP LAWSUIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Calif., JAPAN)  (Eds: 2ndtake to move by 9 p.m.) 
(js) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Toshiba Corp. said Friday that it will spend about
$1 billion to settle a class action lawsuit brought by two people
charging that the world's leading maker of laptop computers sold 5
million defective machines in the United States since 1987.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise settlement covers virtually all owners of Toshiba
notebook computers purchased in this country. It was considered all
the more extraordinary because nobody had ever complained about the
defect until March, when the suit was filed.
</P>
<P>
   Owners will be entitled to discount coupons for buying Toshiba
computer products and, in some cases, cash payments worth up to
several hundred dollars. The size of the overall settlement is $2.1
billion, but the company thinks its ultimate cost will be lower
because not all customers will claim their awards.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers who handle computer-related litigation said this is an
extremely large settlement. This is especially so given that
Toshiba maintains that the flaw _ which can cause errors when
recording data on floppy disks _ is so inconsequential that the
company itself could not duplicate the problem in its laboratory
under normal operating conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just baffled by it,'' said Charles L. Kerr, a lawyer for
Morrison &AMP; Foerster in New York who works on computer liability
cases, adding that he had never heard of such a large settlement in
a case of this type. ``It's a substantial hit and they must have
had pretty good reasons for taking a substantial hit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Toshiba executives said that had the company lost a jury trial,
it could have had to pay up to $9.5 billion. ``That would have
endangered the very existence of the company,'' Taizo Nishimuro,
the president of Toshiba, said at a news conference in Tokyo.
``That's why we made the tough decision to settle.''
</P>
<P>
   Japanese companies in general have tended to be wary of U.S.
lawsuits, and especially of the unpredictability of juries, which
are not used in Japan. One factor that could have scared Toshiba
about the size of a possible jury award is that the company was
aware of the defect for many years, though it did not fix the
problem because it did not think customers were being affected,
according to people knowledgeable about the case.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the parent company's U.S. subsidiary, Toshiba
America Information Systems in Irvine, Calif., said the company
also thought the settlement would reassure customers of Toshiba's
commitment to quality. ``This was so important to us to maintain
our position and our reputation and our integrity,'' said Joseph
Formichelli, executive vice president of the computer systems
group.
</P>
<P>
   The suit was filed in March in federal court in Beaumont, Texas,
by two owners of Toshiba laptops _ Ethan Shaw, an attorney in that
city, and Clive D. Moon, who lives in Plano, a Dallas suburb.
According to Toshiba, the two men did not claim to have actually
suffered any lost data or other damage from the flaw in the PC, but
rather that they had been sold a defective product. Neither the
plaintiffs nor their attorneys returned calls seeking comment.

RUSSIAN AGENTS RANSACK U.S. RESEARCHER'S HOME 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russian security agents have searched the Moscow
apartment of American researcher and Boston native Josh Handler,
who is in Russia researching a doctoral thesis on nuclear
disarmament issues.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 agents from Russia's Federal Security Service, the
successor agency to the Soviet KGB, showed up at Handler's
apartment with a search warrant Wednesday afternoon and went
through his belongings for seven hours, leaving at 11:30 p.m. They
seized notebooks, a laptop computer, an address book, papers, maps,
newspaper clippings, photographs, and tapes from his answering
machine, Handler said Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am deeply concerned that the Russian security services have
harassed Josh Handler and confiscated his property. This behavior
is unacceptable,'' Senator Edward M. Kennedy said in a statement
Friday night. Kennedy's spokesman, Will Keyser, said the senator
has contacted the State Department about Handler's situation. The
US Embassy here has complained about Handler's treatment to Russian
officials, a U.S. official in Washington said.
</P>
<P>
   A doctoral candidate at Princeton University, Handler, 39, has
been in Russia since February as a guest of the Russian Academy of
Sciences' prestigious USA and Canada Institute. He is researching a
dissertation on Russian-American disarmament issues. He said he has
made about a dozen trips to Russia since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   A former Greenpeace antinuclear campaign coordinator, Handler
also has published research on the environmental hazards caused by
nuclear facilities in Russia. He recently wrote an article on the
subject of how Russia stores nuclear warheads once they are removed
from decommissioned missiles. The article, which appeared on the
Web site of the Federation of American Scientists, pointed out
safety hazards in the process due to a lack of storage space.
</P>
<P>
   Alexei Yablokov, a Russian environmentalist and director of the
USA and Canada Institute, said the search was part of a wave of
harassment against researchers working in the area of nuclear
safety.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past several years, the Federal Security Service has
repeatedly searched, interrogated, and occasionally jailed nuclear
researchers. In the most famous case, retired navy captain
Alexander Nikitin was arrested in 1996 and charged with espionage
over a report he wrote exposing the slipshod handling of nuclear
waste by Russia's North Sea Fleet. Nikitin spent 10 months in
prison and, although he is free on bond, his case is still not
resolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``In none of my work have I ever intended to harm the national
security of Russia. I have nothing to hide,'' Handler said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get a bit spooked after something like this, but it is
very important for me to stay here and explain to people why I
think the work I do is important,'' Handler said.

   Minding His Own Business And Watching Israel's &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Netanyahu, technology financier? ``I'm looking at the
possibility of something with starting a venture capital
operation,'' possibly by combining existing Israeli firms,
Netanyahu said in an brief interview after speaking to Columbia
Business School executive MBA students on Friday. He already
advises BATM Advanced Communications, an Israeli maker of switches
for fiber optic cable whose stock market value has gone from
roughly $100 million to $1.6 billion in a year _ ``with no relation
to my activities at all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu is by no means new to business. After graduating from
MIT's Sloan School of Management, he went to work for Boston
Consulting Group. ``He could have been one of you,'' the Columbia
dean, Meyer Feldberg, told the students in introducing him.
</P>
<P>
   In Netanyahu's talk _ sponsored by Ira Rennert, the Long Island
industrialist of mega-mansion fame, who sat in the front row _ he
boasted that his free-market measures had given rise to Israel's
high-tech boom. Then he asked himself the obvious question: ``If
things are so good, why are you here?'' He answered that the
unemployment temporarily resulting from his measures cost him his
job as prime minister in the election this May. &QL;

   After management at Amazon.com announced its third-quarter
results, Wall Street analysts issued downgrades. Profits appear to
be much further off than had been thought.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Ehrens, an analyst at Bear, Stearns, was one of those
voicing caution on Amazon. He told Bloomberg News on Thursday that
Ftd.com, the E-florist that Bear, Stearns took public Sept. 29, was
more attractive.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so. But according to the Bloomberg reporters, he did not
mention that James E. Cayne, chief executive officer of Bear,
Stearns, holds an undisclosed stake in a partnership that owns 48.6
percent of Ftd.com's stock. The stock, which reached $12.5625 the
day it was issued, closed at $6.125 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Ehrens said he did not recall his comments, but that even if he
didn't point out Cayne's interest, the stake is covered by
disclaimers in his Ftd.com reports.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Levitt, chairman of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, has recently decried analysts' overall lack of

   Larry Ellison, a collector of jets, including military fighters,
has declared war city of San Jose, Calif. His target: an
airport regulation that he says unfairly restricts the nighttime
use of his $38.7 million Gulfstream GV.
</P>
<P>
   ``San Jose has no right to tell me when I can land my
airplane,'' he said last week. ``It's like saying people who weigh
more than 200 pounds can't go into a store after 6 p.m.'' He has
threatened to ask a court to overturn the regulation.
</P>
<P>
   The rule, which keeps large jets from landing after 11:30 p.m.,
was meant to assure nearby homeowners a good night's sleep. Ellison
says his jet has an unusually quiet engine.
</P>
<P>
   The city's lawyers, saying he violated the curfew three times
this year, sent him a letter asking him to cool his jet. No

   Thanks for your two cents, Santayana, but just now those who
remember the past are doomed to miss out on Internet stocks. Such
was the sentiment among some supporters of the Museum of American
Financial History at a party last Thursday celebrating _ well,
observing _ what invitations called ``this century's final look
back on the Great Crash of 1929.''
</P>
<P>
   Waiters serving canapes wore yellow construction helmets _
``crash protection,'' one said. John E. Herzog, chairman of the
Herzog Heine Geldud securities firm and of the museum's board,
talked about the benefits of a history museum just steps from Wall
Street, saying, ``People can't achieve perspective if all they know
is a bull market.''
</P>
<P>
   But Robert H. Stovall, president of Stovall/21st Advisers,
lingering near an exhibit including a Black Friday ticker tape and
the front page of The New York Times from the next day, said that
his own 44 years of analyzing the markets had made him too cautious
about buying the Ebays and Amazon.coms of today.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the markets of the last few years, having experience and a
memory can be a handicap,'' he said. He now bets on indexes of
Internet stocks.

 SENATE IMPASSE DELAYS ACTION ON AFRICA-CARIBBEAN TRADE BILLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate on Friday temporarily set aside a
package of trade bills for African and Caribbean nations while
Republican and Democratic leaders tried to break a partisan impasse
over several unrelated amendments.
</P>
<P>
   The bills would reduce or eliminate duties on a wide range of
goods made in sub-Saharan Africa, Central America and the
Caribbean, mostly those assembled with U.S.-produced fabrics.
President Clinton and a large majority of legislators support the
measures.
</P>
<P>
   But Senate Republicans who back the legislation fell 15 votes
short of the 60 needed to cut off a filibuster led by Sen. Ernest
Hollings, D-S.C., who fears that African imports would hurt his
state's textile industry.
</P>
<P>
   The vote could doom the measure for the year, just a day after
Clinton stood beside Nigeria's president at a White House news
conference and renewed his call for its passage.
</P>
<P>
   The measure's supporters, who include a wide array of religious,
international and business groups, expressed alarm that political
wrangling jeopardized trade bills that could give a badly needed
lift to lagging economies in Africa and the Caribbean region.
</P>
<P>
   All 40 Democrats present Friday, most of whom endorse the trade
bills, voted against ending the filibuster. They were protesting a
parliamentary move by Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott to bar
amendments, like raising the minimum wage, that Democrats want to
attach to the package.
</P>
<P>
   After the vote, Lott sidetracked the trade package until next
week while he and Minority Leader Tom Daschle negotiate a
compromise to allow the contested amendments to be considered
elsewhere _ on a bill that seeks to change the nation's bankruptcy
laws. This would leave the trade package relatively unfettered.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said compromise must be reached by Tuesday, when the Senate
is to vote again on whether to end the filibuster, a process called
cloture. If the divisive amendments are not attached to another
bill by then, he said, the trade package will be sacrificed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't get cloture on Tuesday, then it's dead,'' Lott
said of the legislation. ``We just don't have the time to grind
down the Hollings filibuster.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott warned that if the Democrats did not change their votes, he
would blame them for killing the trade bills. ``They've got to live
with that anti-free-trade, isolationist vote,'' Lott told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, his top national security aides and Senate Democrats
have accused Republicans of isolationism in light of the Senate's
rejection two weeks ago of a treaty to ban underground nuclear
testing. On Friday, Republicans seemed only too happy to throw the
charge back at the Democrats on the trade issue.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the House, which approved a version of the Africa
trade bill, 234-163, in July, urged the senators to strike a deal.
``This bill is too important to let partisan politics stand in the
way,'' said Rep. Edward Royce, R-Calif., a sponsor of the House
bill.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats said Lott's maneuvering has denied them a
fundamental senatorial privilege, the right to offer amendments.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Daschle angrily criticized Lott's tactics and vowed
to the hold the trade bill hostage: ``We will never let this
legislation pass if we can't offer an amendment, not because we
don't support it _ I strongly support it _ but because I even more
strongly support the right of every single senator to be partners
in the legislative process.''

 &HT;    Carolina: That's life in the `dead zone'
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Carolina coach George Seifert can relate to the
Falcons' red-zone problems in Monday night's 13-9 loss at
Pittsburgh. Like the Falcons, the Panthers have had plenty of
problems near the goal line this season.
</P>
<P>
   In a 24-9 loss to Detroit last week, the Panthers had
first-and-goal inside Detroit's 5-yard line five times. Carolina
not only failed to score a touchdown _ the possessions produced
three field goals and two turnovers _ but the Panthers didn't gain
a yard on any of the 12 plays they ran.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina's only positive yardage near the goal line was a 2-yard
penalty against the Lions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We moved up and down the field, and then we got in what is
traditionally called the red zone,'' said Seifert, in his first
season with the Panthers. ``People around here are now calling it
the `dead zone.' Maybe we were zigging when we should have been
zagging.''
</P>
<P>
   Carolina quarterback Steve Beuerlein completed 26 of 47 passes
for 299 yards, but his streak of 11 games in a row with a touchdown
ended. Beuerlein threw an interception in the end zone and also
fumbled on a sack.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just didn't execute very well,'' Beuerlein said. ``We've
been very efficient in the red zone most of the season, but that is
one area, right there inside the 5-yard line, where we have
struggled this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Seifert, who won two Super Bowls with the 49ers before resigning
after the 1996 season, had been impressed with his offense the
previous two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as the progress of our team, I felt pretty good about
it,'' Seifert said. ``But last week, we just flat laid an egg. We
were rudely awakened, maybe distracted too much by what happened
the week before.''
</P>
<P>
   Seifert was referring to his return to San Francisco on Oct. 17,
when his Panthers beat the 49ers 31-29 and piled up 383 total
yards. In a 38-36 loss at Washington in Week 4, the Panthers had
483 total yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got in the situation and we misfired,'' Seifert said of
last week's home loss. ``We didn't handle it properly. We were
feeling too good about ourselves, probably. I've got to say that's
got to be part of it. I can't say it's the whole reason.''
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers will have plenty of motivation when they face the
Falcons on the road Sunday. Atlanta swept both games last season,
including a 51-23 blowout in the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a toughness and a thickness of skin you've got to
have,'' Seifert said. ``In doing this, it would be nice to think
the sequence would be, `We get better, we get better, we get
better,' and we take off. That's where we thought we were. It
doesn't always work out that way. Now, we're back down having to
climb up the hill again.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With toilet paper streaming from office buildings and
cheers roaring up from teeming sidewalks, New York threw yet
another ticker-tape parade for its world champion Yankees on Friday
that was by turns jubilant and somber, but at times surprisingly
rowdy.
</P>
<P>
   The clear skies above lower Broadway were a shimmering blizzard
of shredded spreadsheets and endless printouts, the streets below
athunder with the cheers of truant schoolchildren and their
compliant parents, as the Bronx Bombers rolled by in what threatens
to become an annual rite.
</P>
<P>
   But the long wait for those who rose at dawn to claim a decent
vista along the parade route seemed to have exhausted the patience
and civility of a number of people, who hurled refuse at each
other, at police, and at the riders of open flatbed trucks and
double-decker buses whose names they did not know. At least35
people were injured and police arrested at least six people on
charges ranging from sexual abuse and indecent exposure to inciting
a riot and assaulting a police officer, the authorities said late
Friday afternoon, though the number of arrests was expected to grow
as reports filtered in.
</P>
<P>
   The parade once again culminated in an afternoon rally for the
25-time champions at City Hall, where pure politics was the order
of the day in ways seen and unseen. As the players waited to be
introduced, the banner of a police department band draped
momentarily over a larger banner, briefly obscuring the name of the
celebration's host, ``Mayor Rudy Giuliani.'' But only briefly.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the crowd of dignitaries who had been allowed beyond
locked gates to within sight of the stage included dozens of local
politicians eager to soak up a little Yankee glory and electoral
goodwill. But some Democratic members of the state Assembly were
officially barred from the day's events because they had voted to
repeal New York City's commuter tax, aides to Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   Any suggestion that the third such celebration in four years
might produce a blase response in a city legendary for its
been-there, done-that affectations was rendered ridiculous long
before the parade began at 12:10 p.m. By 10:30, the sidewalks along
Broadway between Battery Place and Chambers Street were crammed
full _ police, who are given to generous estimates of ticker-tape
crowds, estimated this year's attendance at slightly more than last
year's figure of 3.5 million _ and the more athletic fans had
clambered atop telephones and traffic lights and bus-stop signs and
even the old bell tower in the Trinity Church graveyard. Everything
and everyone was covered in paper; the gargoyles that adorned
dignified office buildings could have been wearing Yankee hats
underneath, for all anyone knew.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A block off the parade route, vendors near the Municipal
Building and along Church Street did a brisk business in Yankee
T-shirts and hats, while dime stores and hardware shops sold out of
mops, scrub-brushes and anything else that could pass for a broom,
to signify the Yankees' second consecutive sweep in the World
Series. Sanitation crews, walking behind mounted police in
performance of perhaps the least-desired job in New York, were
greeted as enthusiastically as Yankee Stadium's groundskeepers
dancing to ``YMCA,'' as fans giddily chanted ``Sweep! Sweep!
Sweep!'' _ and no one mistook the shouting for a directive.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Though Wall Street did manage to function Friday, it seemed
likely that businesses and government agencies all over the
metropolitan area were operating at less than full strength,
judging from the number of prison janitors, elevator mechanics,
teachers and software developers who left work to be at the parade,
with permission or without. Rose Minoughan, 34, a police officer in
Newark, N.J., who held a bright-pink sign saying ``Torre for
Pope,'' said she had called in sick with a ``migraine'' _ just like
last year. ``You're going to get me in trouble!'' she joked.
</P>
<P>
   But children, tens of thousands of them pressed against police
barriers, seemed to outnumber the grown-ups. If these ticker-tape
parades continue much longer, school officials may want to think
about writing them into the official calendar. As it was, public
high school students were given a half-day off for afternoon
parent-teacher conferences, but many youngsters _ and their
parents, too _ seemed to have borrowed a lesson from math class and
rounded up.

<P>
   Diane Carusalle, who shepherded her sons Dean, 13, and Lenny,
10, and their three cousins from Staten Island, said she would fess
up on Tuesday in her note to the nuns at her boys' parochial school
explaining their absence. ``I'll take my chances admitting we went
to the Yankee parade,'' she said, as the boys stared down Broadway
for a glimpse of the first float. ``I pay them enough every year.
They'll have to get over it. Plus, Friday was a teacher conference,
and Monday they're off for All Saints' Day. So we'll call it a
five-day weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   As the parade slowly lurched up from Bowling Green, which was
declared by one fan's poster as ``Yankee Stadium South,'' many in
the crowd showed off the swagger that visiting players said made a
trip to the Bronx a foray into truly hostile territory,
bad-mouthing the nowhere-to-be-found Boston Red Sox and Atlanta
Braves, the last two victims of the Yankees' postseason juggernaut.
</P>
<P>
   There were, too, the usual hordes of girls and young women
waiting to swoon for Derek Jeter, the Yankees' star shortstop and
reigning heartthrob. And this year, for the first time, there were
nearly as many young and not-so-young women holding signs declaring
their love for Chuck Knoblauch, the second baseman of the errant
throws; it seemed as if some wanted to take care of him more than
to adore him, as if all he needed was some TLC to clear his head.
</P>
<P>
   But many less boisterous parade-goers seemed deeply affected by
the human travails that this year's Yankee players were forced to
overcome, to tell from the dozens of carefully lettered banners
held aloft memorializing the fathers of Paul O'Neill, Luis Sojo and
Scott Brosius.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Ana Jordan, 19, of Staten Island, who had scrawled O'Neill's
name on her right cheek, and his number, 21, on her left, said she
had gotten the day off from her job at a supermarket to come to the
parade to show her admiration for the right-fielder, who lost his
father early Wednesday but still played in the series clincher that
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was really brave of him to play through the last
game after his father died,'' Ms. Jordan said. ``He also played
with a broken rib, that's how into the team he is. Jeter cares more
about looking good on the field. O'Neill is just concerned about
playing well.''
</P>
<P>
   That humanity came pouring out later on the platform in front of
City Hall, when Darryl Strawberry followed a number of teammates to
the podium to say a few words. After a short speech, the
oft-troubled Yankee designated hitter, who recovered from a battle
with colon cancer last fall only to be arrested for solicitation
and drug possession early this year, began to thank his manager,
Joe Torre, when he broke down and doubled over, sobbing
uncontrollably.
</P>
<P>
   As he cried for a full minute, Torre walked to Strawberry and
put his arms around him, and the crowd began to applaud, louder and
louder, until even the Yankee players were clapping in a standing
ovation of moral support. Finally, Strawberry lifted his head, his
eyes hidden behind sunglasses, and managed: `I'd just like to say
to Joe, thank you for caring for me.'' To his teammates, he added:
``And I love you guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the bunting and balloons that bedecked City Hall seemed
fitting for a presidential inauguration, Giuliani, who apparently
would settle for a Senate seat for now, kept his remarks brief,
nonpartisan and sentimental, also noting the Yankees' ability to
turn the ``adversities of life'' into ``something positive.''
</P>
<P>
   He recalled how the season started on a rainy day in April. ``It
ends on a beautiful and glorious day in an October New York sun
that is shining and that's bright,'' he added. ``Because the
Yankees and New York own October.''

LIBRARY OF CONGRESS TO BUY KING'S PAPERS FROM FAMILY FOR $20
MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., Calif.)   (bl)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Library of Congress has reached a tentative
agreement with the family of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to
buy the slain civil rights leader's private papers for $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   Though the price is the largest amount of money the Library of
Congress has ever paid for a collection of papers, some researchers
and students of the civil rights era question the historic value of
the material.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, first reported this week in Roll Call, a
Capitol Hill newspaper, the King family will transfer to the
library King's letters, notes, and first drafts of speeches which
are now at the Martin Luther King Center in Atlanta. The
collection, which is made up of about 80,000 items, was valued at
$30 million by Sotheby's, which did a private appraisal at the
request of the King family.
</P>
<P>
   The King family originally wanted the full $30 million, but when
Library officials balked, the family agreed to reduce the payment
request to $20 million and take a $10 million tax deduction.
</P>
<P>
   ``By accepting a payment that is substantially below market
value, we are meeting our fiduciary responsibility to the estate of
Dr. King while making a substantial gift to the nation,'' said a
statement issued in the name of Dexter Scott King, the civil rights
leader's son who now heads the King Center in Atlanta and is
executor of the King estate.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is subject to Congress passing legislation
appropriating money for the library to buy the King collection. The
Senate passed such a measure by unanimous consent Friday. Sponsors
of the House bill say they hope to gain passage within the next few
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Library of Congress rarely spends money to acquire historic
documents. Since the library is the Copyright Office of the United
States it automatically gets copies of books and manuscripts that
are published in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the library purchased a collection was in 1930,
when it spent $1.5 million to buy a rare-book collection that
included one of three perfect copies of the Gutenberg Bible. To
date, that was the most the library had ever paid for a collection.
</P>
<P>
   Some historians say the King papers that are being purchased are
worth more for their prestige value than their historical content.
The King family retains control of the official papers of civil
rights groups such as the Southern Christian Leadership Conference,
which King headed, the Congress of Racial Equality and the Student
Non-violent Co-ordinating Committee. These papers are currently
housed at the King Center, and will remain there.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Ask anybody who is a historian of the movement, and they would
say that the SNCC papers are worth more to scholars than the King
papers,'' said David Garrow, a historian at Emory University and
author of ``Bearing the Cross: Martin Luther King Jr., and the
Southern Christian Leadership Conference.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in 1997, both Stanford University and Emory entered into
negotiations with the King family to buy some of the papers housed
at the King Center. But the two universities were not really
interested in the material that now may be sold to the Library of
Congress, according to Phillip Jones, chairman of Intellectual
Properties Management, an Atlanta company that oversees the King
estate.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether the payments the King family will receive
from the library will be used to maintain official documents like
the SCLC papers that are still housed at the King Center. Some
historians say they fear that should the originals of King's
personal papers be removed from the King Center, the King family
will lose interest in protecting the rest of the collection.
</P>
<P>
   The Library of Congress has long been a repository of the papers
or leaders and organizations of the African American civil rights
movement. Among the official papers housed there are those of The
Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People, the National Urban League and
the private papers of A. Phillip Randolph, Thurgood Marshall,
Booker T. Washington and Bayard Rustin.
</P>
<P>
   But, unlike the King papers, all were donated to the library.
</P>
<P>
   The pending sale of King's papers has again raised the question
of the King family trying to capitalize financially on the legacy
of one of the towering figures of the 20th Century and an icon to
many Americans of all races.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the family sued CBS for copyright infringement when it
included excerpts from King's famous speech during the 1963 March
on Washington. The speech, which included the memorable lines, ``I
have a dream,'' is considered one of the great pleas for racial
harmony and justice. Last year, a federal judge in Washington
denied the Kings' claim, ruling that the speech was in the public
domain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The family is amazing, isn't it?'' said Gilbert Jonas, one of
the chief fund-raisers for the NAACP for 30 years who recently
donated his papers to the library. ``They're first ones, in my
knowledge, from the civil rights era who have made money on it.
They're really creating an image that was counter to his.''
</P>
<P>
   But others defend the King family's right to earn money. ``I
never quite understood why the issue of money was used against the
King family when any other family that owns a valuable piece of
property would not be expected to just give it away,'' said
Clayburn Carson, a history professor at Stanford who was involved
in the negotiations to purchase many of the papers from the King
Center in 1997.

FINANCIALLY TROUBLED HMO MAY SELL R.I. CENTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Harvard Pilgrim Health Care is on the verge of selling its Rhode
Island health centers, a move that will help New England's largest
health maintenance organization walk away debt-free from its
financially troubled Rhode Island business, according to senior
executives at the HMO.
</P>
<P>
   The most likely buyer of Harvard Pilgrim's five health centers
is Lifespan Inc., the Ocean State's largest hospital group and the
owner of Boston-based New England Medical Center, sources at both
firms confirmed. An agreement could be reached as soon as next
week, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The health centers, located in Providence, Warwick, and Lincoln
in Rhode Island and in Plainville and Swansea in southeastern
Massachusetts, employ about 400 physicians who care for 85,000
patients.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, as part of its ongoing effort to mend its tattered
finances, Harvard Pilgrim next week will announce a decision to
subcontract management of its mental-health benefits to Value
Options Inc., a firm that manages mental-health benefits for
Massachusetts state employees and for Medicaid beneficiaries,
sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Alan G. Raymond, spokesman for the company, said Harvard Pilgrim
is ``identifying a company with whom we could subcontract to manage
our mental-health and substance-abuse benefits'' but said a
contract has not yet been signed.
</P>
<P>
   A change in management would not affect benefits for the HMO's
1.5 milllion members, Raymond said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Harvard Pilgrim officials and state regulators Friday
moved swiftly to put out speculation fueled by a front-page article
in the Boston Herald that said the HMO would go bankrupt. The
article cited unnamed hospital sources as saying they have hired
attorneys to secure a place in the line of creditors ``if Harvard
Pilgrim files for bankruptcy court protection.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Harvard Pilgrim has no intention of seeking bankruptcy
protection whatsoever,'' said Charles D. Baker, chief executive of
Harvard Pilgrim, who called the article ``misleading and
irresponsible.'' Baker added, ``We have adequate reserves to meet
our existing and future obligations and expect to end our current
year with a positive net worth in excess of $100 million.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Pilgrim last year lost $94 million from operations and
is expected to post a loss of $100 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   State regulators also moved to assure consumers that they saw no
signs of insolvency at Harvard Pilgrim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the story in the Herald this morning, citizens should
know that the Division of Insurance is actively monitoring the
financial condition of our HMOs,'' said state insurance
commissioner Linda Ruthardt. The division is conducting a financial
examination of the HMO.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas F. Reilly, the state's attorney general, added, ``At this
point, we have no reason to believe that members of (Harvard
Pilgrim) will not receive the benefits they are entitled to.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Pilgrim has shared its financial status with
Massachusetts officials, along with a plan to revamp its
organization, Reilly said. ``They have a plan, and they should be
given an opportunity to work through that plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite these assurances, state Senator Guy W. Glodis filed
legislation to force official action by requiring the attorney
general, Governor Paul Cellucci, and Auditor Joseph DeNucci to
appoint an independent inspector general to evaluate Harvard
Pilgrim's finances. Glodis, a Democrat from Worcester, cast
suspicion on the Republican administration's ability to be
objective, given that Harvard Pilgrim's top two executives were
once officials of the administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've all worked together,'' Glodis said. ``Friends should
not be watching friends.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Massachusetts hospitals continue to worry about
Harvard Pilgrim's ability to pay its bills. Harvard Pilgrim's
capital reserves at the end of June were just $96 million, just
0.05 percent of its annual expenses. That amount, which serves as a
cushion against fluctuations in medical costs and cash flow, makes
the HMO ``vulnerable,'' according to Standard &AMP; Poor's, a rating
service in New York that recently downgraded Harvard Pilgrim to
``junk bond'' status.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's necessary but not sufficient for Harvard Pilgrim to give
us assurances,'' said Ronald Hollander, president of the
Massachusetts Hospital Association. ``I think the state needs to be
more involved and give the public more assurances.''
</P>
<P>
   Hospital sources said the hospital association is considering a
class-action lawsuit against all HMOs, not just Harvard Pilgrim,
for nonpayment of bills. An association survey released Friday
indicated that HMOs in the state are at least 90 days late in
paying bills worth $256 million by June, up from $123 million on
Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the concern, it is in many hospitals' interest to make
sure Harvard Pilgrim stays financially healthy, if only so they can
continue to pay their bills. ``All of the hospitals have concerns
about Harvard Pilgrim's finances, but it makes little sense for us
to be calling, `Fire!' in the theater when there isn't even any
smoke,'' said Dr. James Reinertsen, chief executive of CareGroup
Inc., parent of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.

 c .1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Led by Sen. Robert Byrd, the West Virginia
congressional delegation is planning 11th-hour legislation to block
what environmentalists call a landmark federal court ruling that
severely restricts the state's strip mining of mountaintops.
</P>
<P>
   After a White House meeting on Thursday on the ruling, which
state officials warn will prove ruinous for the coal industry,
participants from environmental groups said the Clinton
administration decided not to oppose the West Virginia delegation's
attempt to reverse the court decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``The White House staff told us President Clinton will not
oppose this because it was a provision favored by Senator Byrd,''
said Anna Aurilio, staff scientist with the U.S. Public Interest
Research Group, a civic advocacy organization. She complained that
this would violate the administration's pledges to block
anti-environmental legislative riders in the final days of the
congressional session.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials denied the pledge would be broken. An
administration environmental official said that any legislative
action should be short-term and that the White House favored
studying whether additional environmental controls are warranted
for the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The Oct. 20 ruling by Chief Judge Charles H. Haden II of U.S.
District Court in Charleston found that clean water and surface
mining laws were being violated in the blocking of hundreds of
miles of streams by rock waste dumped into nearby valleys during
the strip mining of mountaintops. The technique involves shearing
the mountaintops with explosives to get at the underlying
low-sulfur coal, with mining wastes bulldozed into surrounding
valleys.
</P>
<P>
   Friday evening, as pressure grew here and in the state over the
ruling on ``mountaintop removal,'' as the technique is legally
known, Haden issued a temporary stay reaffirming his basic decision
but allowing the state time to appeal. Lawyers familiar with the
struggle speculated that the judge issued the unusual stay to head
off congressional actions that might weaken the environmental laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is any life form that cannot acclimate to life deep
in a rubble pile, it is eliminated,'' Haden ruled in ordering West
Virginia authorities to curb much of the waste dumping to protect
vital waterways. ``No effect on related environmental values is
more adverse than obliteration.''
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the suit by the West Virginia Highlands
Conservancy and individual citizens, Haden found that state
regulators had loosely interpreted environmental law to allow the
waste dumping in established streams that flow much or all of the
year and are supposed to be protected by buffer zones. Federal
regulations, he ruled, are clear in restricting dumping to areas of
smaller streams that only flow temporarily after rainstorms and
snow melts.
</P>
<P>
   The decision has been denounced as ``devastating'' by Gov. Cecil
Underwood, a Republican, who ordered a hiring freeze and 10 percent
budget cut to prepare for negative effects on the state economy.
But one of the successful litigants, Patricia Bragg, a valley
dweller near a mountaintop mine in Pie, W.Va., said the state,
after years of failing to enforce the law, was attempting a
``political ploy'' to divide miners and other residents in the coal
region.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mountaintop mining has gotten closer and closer to our
communities in the hollows,'' she said, describing a chain of
problems, from cracked walls to spoiled wells to the endless boom
and dust of explosives. ``The problem goes beyond the environment
to the very people the coal industry comes in and hires,'' said Ms.
Bragg, the wife of a retired coal miner. ``We're the workers, but
we're also the victims.''
</P>
<P>
   With coal industry and union officials warning that the state's
mining could be destroyed, the state congressional delegation said
Friday it was ``continuing to aggressively pursue all possible
legislative options.'' A rider to one the remaining appropriations
bills is considered the likely vehicle in the closing days of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Byrd, Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV, like Byrd a
Democrat, and the state's House delegation called on the
administration to join in the state's plan to appeal the ruling.
They warned that the decision ``will have a dramatic effect on the
lives of thousands of coal miners.''
</P>
<P>
   But environmental groups insisted that pro-industry officials
were trying to panic the federal authorities into a legislative
reversal of the ruling. Haden, in an unusual postscript, complained
on Wednesday that ``people are interested in engaging in
hyperbole'' about the ruling's effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under a valley fill,'' Haden declared in his ruling, ``the
water quality of the stream becomes zero. Because there is no
stream, there is no water quality.''
</P>
<P>
   William M. Eichbaum, a vice president of the World Wildlife Fund
who helped draft the mining controls as a federal official, said
the state and the coal industry have ``overblown'' the judge's
ruling. ``I'm concerned Senator Byrd is putting this at such a high
level, refusing to deal with all sorts of other issues, that the
administration will be put in a very difficult position.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrd's office denied he was pressuring the administration beyond
the merits of the issue, in which the state delegation insists
Haden ignored the intent of Congress in passing the Clean Water and
Surface Mining Control laws.
</P>
<P>
   The director of the federal Office of Surface Mining, Kathy
Karpan, said she had received the first reports of job layoffs in
the state. ``The industry is going to come to a virtual halt,'' she
warned. She said that in carrying out the ruling state officials
estimated that only three of 62 previous mountaintop mining
projects could go forward.

U.S. PANEL TO REQUIRE DISCLOSURE OF GENE TESTS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., Pa., Mass.)  (Exclusive) 
(rk) 
 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Concerned that investigators in gene therapy
experiments are trying to keep information about patient deaths and
serious side effects out of public view, members of a federal
oversight panel are planning to rewrite their rules to force
greater disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   The move by the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee comes six
weeks after the death of an 18-year-old Arizona man, Jesse
Gelsinger, apparently the first person to die as a result of gene
therapy. Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania, where the
experiment was conducted, were quick to report the death and have
spoken about it publicly.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, there is no evidence that any other patients have
died as a direct result of receiving gene therapy. But the
committee is concerned that other scientists and companies have not
always been forthcoming with information about side effects
experienced by gene therapy patients, or about patients who die
from causes other than the therapy itself.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, a researcher reported the death of a patient with
advanced heart disease last year and asked that it be ``kept
confidential and not part of the public record.'' In another, a
drug company, the Schering-Plough Corp., has insisted that
information about side effects be classified as a trade secret.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things that might be patentable are things that a company
should rightfully hold as confidential,'' said the panel's
chairwoman, Dr. Claudia Mickelson, biosafety officer at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ``Adverse events, we do not
feel, fall into that category, and so we are changing the language
to be more explicit.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue, Dr. Mickelson and others say, is how much information
scientists and companies should share with their competitors in
what is still a novel, and relatively unsuccessful, scientific
field. Typically, companies experimenting with new drugs and
therapies report solely to the Food and Drug Administration, and
the information they generate is kept confidential by the
government until the drug is approved.
</P>
<P>
   But gene therapy experiments are treated differently; they are
submitted to both the FDA and the advisory committee, a group that
was established in the early days of the research to foster public
discussion. The committee, which reports to the director of the
National Institutes of Health, no longer has authority to approve
gene therapy experiments, but is authorized to review and publicly
discuss experiments, except for proprietary information.
</P>
<P>
   But the question of just what is proprietary is a sticking point
between the committee and at least one company, Schering-Plough. A
spokesman for Schering-Plough, Robert Consalvo, says the company
believes that information about the design of gene therapy
experiments, and patient safety data, is proprietary and should be
kept confidential.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the same information that goes to the FDA and remains
confidential there,'' Consalvo said.
</P>
<P>
   That committee greeted that suggestion with ``a sufficient
amount of outrage,'' said another member, Dr. Ruth Macklin, a
professor of bioethics at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in
the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Information about how gene therapy treatments are manufactured
is clearly a trade secret, Dr. Macklin said, ``but not the deaths
or adverse experiences of people who are in a clinical trial.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The members are unanimous in saying this kind of information
is not proprietary,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The debate reached a boiling point at the committee's meeting in
early September, two weeks before Gelsinger died. At that time, the
panel members received confidential reports of adverse effects
experienced by patients in Schering-Plough gene therapy clinical
trials; those reports have not been made public.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the committee received a copy of a
confidential letter from Dr. Ronald G. Crystal of New York
Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, who wrote on May 14, 1998, to
report the death of a patient with advanced heart disease during a
gene therapy trial.
</P>
<P>
   The letter, which Crystal made available to The New York Times
Friday, said the death was not related to the gene therapy, and
asked that the information ``be kept confidential and not part of
the public record.'' It advised committee members to call Crystal
with any questions.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Friday, Crystal said the patient was one of
three with serious heart disease who died during gene therapy
experiments intended to grow new blood vessels. He said he had
publicly discussed the deaths at scientific meetings and had
reported on them in the scientific literature. And he said he would
have gladly discussed them with members of the advisory committee,
known by its acronym as the RAC, if they had called upon him to do
so.
</P>

   ``There was no intention of holding this back from members of
the RAC,'' Crystal said. He said he asked that the information be
kept confidential simply because he had not yet sorted out what
happened, and did not ``want it blown out of proportion.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Amy Patterson, who directs the office at the National
Institutes of Health that provides administrative support to the
RAC, said that committee members had seen the letter when it was
first written in 1998. But, Dr. Patterson said, the letter was
provided to the panel a second time ``as background material in
support of the concept that there are adverse events that are not
publicly discussed.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. LeRoy Walters, a bioethicist at Georgetown University who
served as chairman of the committee until 1996, said that as far as
he knew, Crystal's letter represented the first time an
investigator had asked that a death in a gene therapy trial not be
publicly disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The premise of the RAC review process from its inception was
that all nonproprietary details about the protocol itself and all
adverse events would be publicly reported,'' Walters said, ``and in
a timely way.''  &QL;

 LOS ANGELES: seeking comment.

<P>
   Under the terms of the proposed settlement, which still must be
approved by the judge, Toshiba will make available on its Website,
starting Nov. 10, free software that can be downloaded to correct
the problem. Some owners of newer machines will be able to receive
an external floppy disk drive if they do not want to do the
download. Any computer sold after Nov. 8 will not have the flaw.
</P>
<P>
   Owners of Toshiba notebook computers purchased since March 5,
1998, will be eligible to receive cash rebates ranging from $210 to
$443.21, with the higher figures for the more recently purchased
machines. The settlement announcement said that there are 1.8
million such computers and that the total costs will be $597.5
million. Any unclaimed amounts will go to a charity to provide
Toshiba computers to schools and libraries.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, owners of machines still covered by warranty as of
March 1999 _ an estimated 3 million machines _ will be entitled to
coupons worth either $200 or $225 that can be used toward the
purchase of Toshiba computers or computer accessories. Owners of
laptops not covered by warranty _ an estimated 2 million machines _
will be entitled to a $100 coupon.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw and Moon, the two plaintiffs, are to receive $25,000 each.
But their attorneys, led by the Beaumont law firm of Orgain, Bell &AMP;
Tucker, stand to make $147.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Toshiba America said details of the proposed settlement and
procedures for making claims will be advertised in newspapers on or
about November 10.
</P>
<P>
   The Toshiba settlement is much greater than those reached so far
in the case of computers and software infected with the so-called
millennium bug, which means they are not ready for the transition
to the year 2000. In cases that have already been settled,
companies have provided free fixes to their products but have not
made payments to the owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly in the Y2K field nothing has approached that,'' said
Michael C. Spencer, an attorney with Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes &AMP;
Lerach who has filed many of those cases.
</P>
<P>
   But Kerr, with Morrison &AMP; Foerster, said the Toshiba case would
not be much of a precedent for Y2K cases because special
legislation limits Y2K lawsuits and settlements.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement could tarnish the reputation of Toshiba. In the
United States, the company used to have a commanding lead in the
personal computer market but is now in a race for the lead with
Compaq, Dell and IBM, according to International Data Corp., a
market research firm.
</P>
<P>
   The embattled Japanese electronics giant has been counting on
notebook computers, one of its stronger businesses, to help offset
problems in its computer chips and consumer electronics divisions
that have plunged the company into the red.
</P>
<P>
   Toshiba announced Friday that because of the settlement it
expects to lose 50 billion yen, or about $476 million, in the
current fiscal year, about triple its earlier estimate.
</P>
<P>
   The flaw is in the floppy disk controller, a chip that, as its
name implies, governs the workings of the floppy disk drive. All
floppy drives make mistakes when the data to be recorded does not
arrive in time as the spinning disk moves to its next position. But
those errors are normally flagged and fixed.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the error in the microcode _ the instructions for the
floppy disk controller _ such errors sometimes go undetected,
according to Gary Elsasser, vice president of international
marketing for Toshiba America Information Systems. But he said the
error would only go undetected if it occurred in the 512th byte of
the 512 bytes that are recorded at one time, not in any of the
other 511 bytes. Also, he said, it appeared to occur only when the
computer was heavily loaded, such as when it was playing a video
while also writing to the floppy disk.
</P>
<P>
   The defective instructions were actually designed by NEC,
another Japanese electronics company. But NEC discovered the error
and fixed it in its own chips in 1987, according to Allan Van
Fleet, an attorney in Houston who represents NEC, which was also
sued in the case but was dismissed from it as part of the
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is how Toshiba got the chip along with the bug,'' Van
Fleet said. ``They just copied ours and didn't bother to copy the
fix.'' He said some references to the flaw have appeared in
industry literature for ten years or so.
</P>
<P>
   The flaw is also in Toshiba computers sold elsewhere in the
world and the software fix on the Web site will be made available
worldwide. But the settlement applies only to machines bought in
the United States. It is unclear whether Toshiba sold some of the
defective floppy disk controller chips to other manufacturers,
which would mean the defect is also present in other brands.
</P>
<P>
   Kimball Brown, an analyst who follows the notebook computer
industry for Dataquest, a market research firm, said Toshiba's move
was understandable and could help reassure customers. But he added,
``They dug themselves into a hole by not fixing it a long time
ago.''

 &HT;    Event cancelled after deadly Blue Angels crash
 &HT;    (ATTENTION: Maryland, Colorado eds.)
 &HT;    By Brad Schrade
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   VALDOSTA, Ga. _ Jeff Clanton went searching Friday for the spot
where angels fell from the sky.
</P>
<P>
   Clanton drove down the flat, dusty farm road Friday north of
Moody Air Force Base where a Navy Blue Angels F/A-18 crashed
Thursday. He had watched as the plane dipped below the tree-line.
He heard the violent noise when the plane crashed through a grove
of trees. Two pilots from the Navy's elite flying unit died among
the pines.
</P>
<P>
   ``A friend put it in macabre terms,'' Clanton said. ``He said,
`You stood on your front porch and saw two men die.' It's pretty
upsetting.''
</P>
<P>
   This South Georgia Air Force town that touts ``Moody is us'' as
part of its civic pride grieved Friday for two Navy pilots: Lt.
Cmdr. Kieron O'Connor, 35, of Burtonsville, Md., who had been with
the 14-member team since last November, and Lt. Kevin Colling, 32,
of Castle Rock, Colo., a new team member who was in training.
</P>
<P>
   Flags flew at half mast across Valdosta. The Blue Angels had
come to Moody for a community appreciation air show today and
Sunday. But their performances were cancelled because of the crash,
and they returned to their home base in Pensacola, Fla., on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The crash left a 250-yard-long swath across a wooded area
northeast of Moody, said Master Sgt. Don Moncrief, a base
spokesman. He said the plane ignited random fires on either side of
its path, some of which continued to smolder Friday. Investigators
were scouring the site for pieces of the plane.
</P>
<P>
   Eyewitnesses said the plane appeared to be banking to land when
it made a dive into the woods, Moncrief said. But the Blue Angels'
flight leader, Cmdr. Pat Driscoll, said Friday the plane was making
a normal left turn and was not trying to land.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor was ``actually starting to run the show line, which is
where we perform most of our maneuvers in front of the crowd,'' he
said. ``They were going to fly down the show line and just check
for their check points.''
</P>
<P>
   Air Force security personnel were guarding the crash site
Friday, keeping onlookers out of a roped-off area where a tent was
erected for use by investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Panousis had a restless night Thursday. Panousis has been
feeding the men and women of the base for 25 years at his
restaurant, Family Pizza.
</P>
<P>
   His walls are a museum and tribute to those who fly. On one wall
is a photo collage of Air Force folks who ate his pizza while
stationed at the base before transferring to the next assignment. A
U.S. flag hangs from the ceiling. It flew with a pilot on a mission
over Irag.
</P>
<P>
   Panousis is proud of these pilots. Feeding them his pizza, he
says, has made them feel like his own children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still couldn't believe it last night that we had lost two
young men,'' Panousis said. ``I didn't sleep all night.''
</P>
<P>
   The crash puts a somber tone on an air show meant to thank the
community and celebrate the pilots and their elegant, noisy jets
that fly over this area's cotton and tobacco fields every day. A
moment of silence and a missing man formation at the show will
honor the dead pilots, said Lt. Tricia Pagan, a spokeswoman at
Moody.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mood is really somber on base,'' Pagan said. ``We're all
trying to re-group emotionally.''
</P>
<P>
   The children at Valdosta Middle School wore blue ribbons to
honor the pilots. The Blue Angels canceled a visit to the school on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Valdosta Mayor James Rainwater visited the school to talk about
drug prevention with a sixth-grade class. But students wanted to
talk about the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``We identify with the airplanes,'' Rainwater said. ``We hear
them every day. We know this could happen to any of them. These
students are old enough to know what tragedy is. Some of them have
fathers at the base.''
</P>
<P>
   Harry and Chris Cooper's farmhouse sits on Cooper Road. The
crash occurred across the dirt road on a neighboring farm.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the base opened in the 1940s, planes have crashed in
the fields and groves around the farm. The Cooper's children have
found broken pieces of fuselage and tires in the woods from some of
those past crashes.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Cooper said Thursday's crash, about a quarter-mile or so
from their home, has shaken up her family, particularly her
husband, who recalls tales of other crashes from his youth. ``When
you have a plane crash this close to home it scares you,'' Chris
Cooper said. ``You think one could end up closer, on your house.''
</P>
<P>
   Randy Pfister saw the effect the crash had on others at the base
as they came in his the Swifty Mart convenience store he manages.
One man associated with the Blue Angels came in Friday morning,
Pfister said. He bought a stack of newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   As he read the headlines, the man was noticeably upset, Pfister
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's upsetting, it's real upsetting,'' Pfister said. ``I tell
people that come in `Keep going on.' You've got to. This is part of
the job.''

against it, and to this day millions of Americans would pay
anything to get rid of bad breath. Between mouthwashes and mints,
drops and toothpastes, Americans spent $2.6 billion last year in
the war on the halitosis. Now, two California entrepreneurs hope to
conquer this age-old curse by selling a long-forgotten, low-tech
tool called the tongue scraper, which attempts to attack bad breath
at its source. BY TOM ABATE.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Could this have worked out any better for Hardball Harry Sinden?
</P>
<P>
   After a lengthy contract stalemate, Bruins goalie Byron Dafoe
fired his agent, sat down with Harry, and took the deal that was
originally offered a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   Another notch in Hardball Harry's gunbelt.
</P>
<P>
   In our lifetime, nothing in sports has polluted the air more
than contract stories. They are as old as the games themselves (the
Babe was always trying to bleed more dough out of Harry Frazee and
Jacob Ruppert), but through the years contract stories have become
more frequent, protracted, and outrageous.
</P>
<P>
   Smart fans know that the only contract stories worth their
attention are the ones written after resolution. Everything else is
sabre-rattling, gum-flapping, horsebleep.
</P>
<P>
   Byron Dafoe and the B's Friday announced a three-year, $9.3
million deal. Today we ask, ``Who won?''
</P>
<P>
   Hardball Harry, of course. Another embarrassed player. Another
agent leaving in a body bag.
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe said, ``I went into a battle with Harry . . . We've both
come to an agreement and we're both happy. The bottom line is I'm
satisfied. I felt it had to come to an end sooner or later. We both
extended ourselves more than we thought we initially could.''
</P>
<P>
   Absent from the press conference was Dafoe's agent, Ron Salcer.
Dafoe would not talk about his representative.
</P>
<P>
   Set to make $9.3 million over three years, Dafoe and all future
Dafoes are set for life, so it's hardly a devastating loss for the
talented goalie. But the Bruins get to say they made Dafoe blink.
They made him fire his agent. And they held the line on salary
escalation _ for the good of the league and, naturally, for the
good of owner Jeremy (Mr. Smithers) Jacobs.
</P>
<P>
   What was lost was time. The B's played too long without their
top goalie and Dafoe lost $400,000 in holdout time.
</P>
<P>
   Picked to make it all the way to the Stanley Cup finals, the
1999 Bruins have won only three of their first 12 games. In truth,
they underachieved because they lacked scoring and (in the first
week) effort, but they've also been playing without Dafoe, who was
a Vezina finalist last year. Rob Tallas and John Grahame played
well in Dafoe's absence, but the B's spotty start put some pressure
on management to get a deal done with their starry young goalie.
This was Dafoe's leverage.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins' leverage was stronger. Their hammer was a history of
fan loyalty that assures profit at the gate (and the hot dog stand)
regardless of success on the ice. Once Salcer let Dafoe forfeit his
arbitration rights (like Flounder in ``Animal House,'' he messed
up, he trusted that the Bruins would be fair), management had the
upper hand. The team's soft start never really mattered. Hardball
Harry through the years has demonstrated that he doesn't care about
criticism from fans or media.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Smithers probably sent Sinden another Buffalo fruit basket
for holding the line and sending a message to all agents and NHL
teams. Harry has emerged as the Guardian at the Gate against NHL
salary insanity. Ask Dmitri Khristich. Ask the overmatched Salcer.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Bruins got the guy they wanted at the price they
wanted to pay. They got Dafoe for less than half of what Patrick
Roy and Dominek Hasek make and by the time the playoffs roll
around, Dafoe will be at the top of his game and no one will
remember the misses of October.
</P>
<P>
   Once again we have a demonstration of the economic reality of
Causeway Street. Boston hockey players must wait their turn. It
took Ray Bourque almost 20 years to get market-rate value for his
services and Dafoe wasn't about to break the bank after only 133
games in a Bruins uniform. Harry was intent on teaching Salcer a
lesson.
</P>
<P>
   The collateral damage is felt in the balcony of the New Garden
and the bowels of the B's locker room.
</P>
<P>
   The Dafoe stalemate made fans feel foolish and used. They love
the Bruins too much to stay away, but they loathe management's
business practices. Fans suspect that making a profit is all that
matters. And they feel used for being made to worry that Dafoe
would be traded over a salary dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Bruins players get the same message and it strips some of their
collective intensity. The Skaters know that the bottom line is more
important than the red line, the blue line, or the checking line.
Scoring star Jason Allison and youngsters Joe Thornton and Sergei
Samsonov look at Dafoe and see themselves in the same situation one
year from now. Allison's already been there. Thornton and Samsonov
will be fresh meat for Hardball Harry.

<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan _ An answer to the mystery of why so many
ordinary Pakistanis rejoiced when the military smashed their
democracy can be found right here within the city limits of the
nation's capital, in a small, centuries-old village nestled into
the Margalla Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Here, just hours before the armed forces seized power Oct. 12,
government bulldozers demolished more than 500 houses and reduced
most of the impoverished village of Saidpur to a dusty pile of
rubble where weeping children wandered in the chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Saidpur was largely destroyed because politicians and their
bureaucratic appointees decided that it was an eyesore and a
nuisance on what one official called ``the VVIP route,'' the road
where very, very important people like Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
roared past in shiny black Mercedes-Benzes.
</P>
<P>
   And its residents say they now must live with the bitter
knowledge that they were unable to stop the destruction because
they had no money or political pull like the rich and powerful
people of Bani Gala, another village only 15 minutes away. They
faced the gnawing power of the bulldozers for other reasons earlier
in the decade but managed to save most of their grand mansions.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the poor, there is no democracy,'' said Nisar Ahmad, whose
house and shop in Saidpur were destroyed and who is now penniless
and unemployed. ``For us it has only meant trouble and
oppression.''
</P>
<P>
   The different fates of Saidpur and Bani Gala, two rural villages
on the city's outskirts, could serve as a metaphor for the failings
of Pakistan's democracy.
</P>
<P>
   In both places, the residents were accused by the authorities of
inhabiting their villages illegally, but poor Saidpur was destroyed
and rich Bani Gala was saved.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmad explained the ways of the system: ``You bribe people, it
works. You don't bribe them, it doesn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   It is that corrosive belief _ that the law cannot touch the high
and mighty, while it is wantonly used to crush the poor and
powerless _ that has done so much to discredit the idea of
democracy in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Saidpur was obliterated without even a whisper of notice in the
English-language newspapers read by the elite. Its young men were
jailed for stoning the machines that came to knock down their huts.
Its people, who scrape by on incomes or $40 or $50 a month, are
homeless now as the cold winter rains approach, with no place to go
and no one to turn to.
</P>
<P>
   But in Bani Gala, stately villas and elegant houses, with rose
gardens and crystal chandeliers, still command sweeping views of
Rawal Lake and the Kurang River seven years after the government
tried to bulldoze them out of existence, fearful that sewage from
the houses was polluting the water supply of Rawalpindi and
Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A.Q. Khan, the scientist generally known as the father of
Pakistan's atomic bomb, still has his imposing brick house in Bani
Gala, with a fountain on the front lawn, topped by a playful stone
fish, though his chowkidar, or watchman, Tariq Zulfi, said Khan
rarely visits. When a visitor came knocking, seven servants
clustered at the iron gates that guard the grounds.
</P>
<P>
   In was in 1992, after the bulldozers had destroyed the homes of
many poor villagers in Bani Gala and drew ever closer to some of
Bani Gala's most impressive houses that a retired army colonel rang
up the head of the army's secret service, who called the president,
said several residents, who said he then phoned Sharif, who ordered
the destruction of Bani Gala to halt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within seconds they were gone,'' said Mrs. Mahmood Ali, a
wealthy businesswoman. ``They got in their jeeps and went away.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Politics in Pakistan is very much an elite affair, with the
military and political establishments intricately woven together,
as they were in Bani Gala. Sharif was the protege of Pakistan's
previous dictator, Gen. Mohammad Zia ul-Haq, and named the new
military ruler, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, chief of the army a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan has produced only two elected leaders with national
appeal in the last decade of democracy _ Sharif, from a family of
businessmen who became extremely rich industrialists after he
entered politics, and Benazir Bhutto, from a wealthy family of
feudal landowners. She was convicted this year of taking kickbacks
on a government contract.
</P>
<P>
   Many political analysts say that both seem to have viewed their
stints as prime minister mainly as a license to enrich themselves,
their families and their cronies.
</P>
<P>
   The impunity with which powerful politicians and bureaucrats
have served their self-interest seems to have sapped the
willingness of many other people, from the top to the bottom of
society, to follow the rules. Why, the people of Saidpur ask,
should they leave their village, even though the authorities say
they are there illegally, when the rich are able to pull strings?
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The poor of Pakistan, handicapped by staggering levels of
illiteracy and consumed by the daily tasks of survival, have yet to
produce their own crop of political leaders. In India, by contrast,
the most oppressed sections of society were given preferences in
university admissions and public employment and have produced a
small middle class of leaders who have risen to power.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, one of the most striking differences between India and
Pakistan, carved from the same British empire in 1947, is that so
many of the poor of Pakistan seem to have an ebbing faith in
democracy, while surveys have documented a rising belief in the
power of the vote among India's poor.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That faith is all gone in Saidpur ever since the bulldozers and
hundreds of police officers and employees of the Capital
Development Authority arrived on the morning of Oct. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Hazran Bibi, a gaunt 95-year-old, said she hobbled over to the
bureaucrat in charge that day, gripped his chin in her gnarled hand
and begged him to spare the home where she has lived all her life.
But she said he told her: ``I can't do anything for you. Prepare to
remove your things.''
</P>
<P>
   Saidpur is just one of the many ``encroachments'' that have been
``removed'' in the last year since the prime minister installed one
of his close allies to head the Capital Development Authority, a
man who was quickly removed after the military toppled Sharif and
began installing its own people in the bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   About 6,000 houses in Islamabad have been destroyed and tens of
thousands of mostly poor people displaced in the removal
operations, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Faiz Muhammad, assistant director of enforcement at the
development authority, said the old villages and towns of mud huts
had been demolished because they had been illegal and unsightly and
had posed a nuisance and ``security'' problem along what he called
the VVIP routes.
</P>
<P>
   People's cows and dogs kept wandering onto the road that
connects Rawalpindi, where the army is headquartered, to the
capital, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Once the rubble is cleared, Saidpur will be planted with trees
and will become part of the city's greenbelt, he said. The people
there _ or their relatives _ sold the authority their land about
the time that Islamabad was founded in 1960 and have no legal right
to live there, he said.
</P>
<P>
   So the people of Saidpur have been uprooted to make way for
trees, but they have not given up hope that somehow the new regime
will be their salvation. In the two and a half weeks since the
coup, no bulldozers have returned to the village to finish off the
job. And the residents have begun piling up huge mounds of bricks
and wood in hopes of rebuilding.
</P>
<P>
   By day children play in the ruins. Little girls in dingy dresses
walk on the craggy, broken walls like dainty gymnasts on the
balance beam. Boys aimlessly toss the chunks of hay, mud and stone
that once enclosed their families.
</P>
<P>
   And the grown-ups nurse their hatred of the former prime
minister. A handbill bearing his photograph was tacked to a tree in
the village. ``Look at this man,'' it said in Urdu. ``He is the
result of betraying his own people.''
</P>
<P>
   As people walked past the poster, they cursed Sharif. ``He
destroyed us,'' said one. ``May God destroy him.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, to the people of Saidpur, the prime minister's overthrow
seems to be divine retribution. ``We are happy,'' said Parveen
Bano, 30, a mother of three. ``He brought our houses down, and he
fell down.''

WEST NILE VIRUS FOUND IN BIRD IN MARYLAND 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JENNIFER STEINHAUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A dead bird found in Maryland has tested positive for the West
Nile virus, the disease that killed seven people in the New York
region this summer and made dozens of others ill, officials from
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The bird, a crow, was found near Baltimore Harbor on Oct. 14 and
was sent to a government laboratory in Madison, Wis. It was one of
34 dead birds found in the state that were sent to a unit of the
Department of Agriculture for testing in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The agency and scientists at the centers have been examining
bird samples from the Eastern Seaboard for weeks, looking for clues
about the migration patterns of birds that might have been infected
in New York and about the scope of the outbreak. Maryland is the
first state outside the New York region where an infected bird has
been found.
</P>
<P>
   The virus, which killed six New Yorkers and a Canadian tourist
from July to September, had never been seen in the Western
Hemisphere before the outbreak in New York. The West Nile virus is
carried by birds, which can be bitten by mosquitoes that then carry
the illness to humans. The virus is usually mild, although in
severe cases it can develop into an encephalitis that can be fatal.
Most vulnerable to life-threatening cases are the elderly, children
under 5 and people with weakened immune systems.
</P>
<P>
   No human cases outside the New York region, other than the
Canadian tourist, have been reported by the disease centers. Birds
from around the region began dying in large numbers earlier this
summer, and scores of them have tested positive for the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Cold weather and a spraying campaign earlier this fall have
combined to kill most of the area's mosquitoes, a New York City
Health Department spokeswoman said, so the city has no plans for
more spraying.
</P>
<P>
   Some area horses tested positive for the disease in August.
Friday, the European Commission said it would restrict horse
imports from the United States because of fears of the virus being
carried into the 15-nation European Union, The Associated Press
reported. The commission's health commissioner said that horses
would be admitted only with proof that they had not been in the New
York region in the last 15 days.
</P>
<P>
   Bird pathologists warned that infected birds would likely be
seen in other areas this fall, as they begin to migrate south.
</P>
<P>
   ``The significance of a single bird with a positive finding
alerts us to be more vigilant with surveillance,'' said Dr. Jeffrey
Roche, chief of the center for clinical epidemiology in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Adding that he did not expect any human cases to turn up in the
state, Roche said, ``We are a little concerned, and we are watching
real close to make sure we are right.''

SCHOOL BOARD AND SUPERINTENDENT AT WAR IN LOS ANGELES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES_ With 660 schools, 67,000 employees and 700,000
students, nearly 70 percent of them Hispanic, the Los Angeles
Unified School District is a fair proxy for the future of the
nation's second-largest city. These days, that future looks cloudy
at best.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does the district confront the daunting range of
educational problems faced by urban public schools around the
nation. In recent months, it has also been forced to grapple with
how it began building the most expensive high school in American
history above a toxic former oilfield, moved to acquire an even
more polluted site for another school and missed a deadline to
claim $1 billion in state bond funds.
</P>
<P>
   Now the district is in a messy fight over the decision of a
divided school board to oust the system's embattled superintendent,
Ruben Zacarias, over the cumulative problems. Zacarias is Hispanic,
and the battle has exposed fault lines among the city's diverse
population and energized its emerging class of Hispanic elected
officials. It has also renewed debate about whether the sprawling
school district _ or even the city itself _ should be broken up.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Los Angeles Board of Education voted by 4-3 to
begin talks to buy out the unexpired contract of Zacarias, a
30-year veteran of the Los Angeles system who was appointed
superintendent in 1997. Senior board and political officials,
speaking on the condition of anonymity, said their first choice to
succeed him on an interim basis was 67-year-old Ramon Cortines, a
former New York City schools chancellor, who has also led systems
in San Francisco and Pasadena, Calif. He may be appointed as soon
as next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The No. 1 thing is we have to get the focus back on kids and
off of politics,'' said Caprice Young, one of the three new school
board members, all of whom voted against Zacarias, elected with the
support of Mayor Richard Riordan last spring in an effort to
overhaul the district. ``Within five years, we're going to have
80,000 students with no chairs, a larger number than the whole San
Francisco school system. And that's a crisis. We really have to
pour all of our attention into that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Zacarias has threatened a lawsuit arguing that the board
broke state law and violated his contract when it voted earlier
this month to install Howard Miller, a former school board member,
in a newly created post of district chief executive, responsible
for overseeing all day-to-day aspects of management, a decision
that left the superintendent virtually powerless.
</P>
<P>
   Zacarias' lawyer, Joseph Coyne, said Friday that Zacarias did
not want a buyout and instead wanted to stay on and carry out his
own proposal, hastily announced this week, for reorganizing the
district into 12 semiautonomous mini-districts. The aim is to
enhance accountability by creating greater community control of
local schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to listen to their offer,'' Coyne said of
the board. ``But we're not interested in a buyout. They'll say they
have the right to impose one, and we'll say they don't.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, the controversy has roiled the city's political
establishment, and galvanized Hispanic elected officials who were
outraged at the board's initial effort to sidestep Zacarias by
voting, without the 24-hour notice required by law, to bring in a
new chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   The highest-ranking Hispanic official in Los Angeles, Antonio
Villaraigosa, the speaker of the state Assembly, who has announced
that he plans to run for mayor in 2001, spent much of the last week
in unsuccessful shuttle diplomacy that sought some face-saving
compromise between Zacarias, who remains popular with many parents
and students, and the board's majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``My view is that accountability has to be color-blind,''
Villaraigosa said in a telephone interview Friday, by way of
explaining that he questioned not the board's right to seek a new
superintendent, only its procedural lapses and what he regarded as
its heavy-handed approach. ``In a city like this, we can't afford
to racialize these issues this way. But we also can't be
paternalistic, with top-down solutions. We need to find that place
where there's respect for the differences and differing opinions.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Hispanic officials have complained that the board's
handling of Zacarias reflects insensitivity by its white majority
to the concerns of a school population that is overwhelmingly
Hispanic. Five of the seven board members are non-Hispanic whites,
and the newly elected board president, Genethia Hayes, executive
director of the local chapter of the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference, is black. Only one member, Victoria Castro, the former
president and Zacarias' most outspoken supporter, is Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly what's going to happen is that they are going to get
rid of the superintendent, and their idea is that reform begins at
the top,'' said Fernando Guerra, who directs the Center for the
Study of Los Angeles at Loyola Marymount University. Guerra
initially supported the new board majority's efforts, but now
believes it may be better to break up the district into as many as
35 smaller units.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Whatever the merits underlying the board members' approach,
though, ``they were very clumsy in executing'' it, Guerra said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a sense,'' he continued, ``they would explain their
clumsiness by saying they need to move fast, because they're in a
crisis. From a policy perspective, I don't have a problem with
that. But from a political perspective _ and there's always
politics involved _ race matters, and it structures your political
parameters. And to avoid that basically indicates you're not ready
for prime time.''
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, the choice of Cortines, a veteran Hispanic
educator who was ousted as the New York schools chief in 1995 after
battling with Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, could soothe angry feelings
among Hispanic officials.
</P>
<P>
   Cortines did not return telephone calls seeking comment, but
there is some irony in the possibility of his appointment: Riordan
is known to have favored replacing Zacarias, and the mayor's
critics have accused him of seeking to exert undue influence in
board affairs, just as Giuliani's opponents have in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she thought Zacarias would drop his threat of a lawsuit
and accept a severance package _ which at a minimum would most
likely include $277,000 in salary for the 18 months left on his
contract plus $150,000 for accrued vacation time _ Ms. Young, the
board member, was not optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's our hope, but frankly it's not our expectation,'' she
said. ``It would be nice if it happened, but it's not going to.''

SCRAPING AWAY BAD BREATH 
</HEADLINE>
   By TOM ABATE 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pharaohs fumed over it, ancient scholars railed against it and
to this day millions of Americans would pay anything to get rid of
bad breath.
</P>
<P>
   Between mouthwashes and mints, drops and toothpastes, Americans
spent $2.6 billion last year in the war on the halitosis.
</P>
<P>
   Now, two California entrepreneurs hope to conquer this age-old
curse by selling a long-forgotten, low-tech tool called the tongue
scraper, which attempts to attack bad breath at its source.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scientific studies have shown that, in 85 percent of the
cases, bad breath emanates from a small area at the back of the
tongue,'' said Sushma Nachnani, a breath expert with University
Health Resources in Beverly Hills who calls daily tongue scraping
``the key'' to expunging odor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans talk about having white dazzling teeth, but in the
center, we have this huge ignored organ called the tongue,''
Nachnani said.
</P>
<P>
   The tongue is exactly what U.S. DenTek of Petaluma, Calif., and
International Dental Design Specialists of Imperial Beach, Calif.,
have targeted. Both firms are competing to restore tongue scrapers
_ which were used in the Roman Empire _ to their rightful place in
the American bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't expect to take over from mouthwash, gums and mints,
but we think the new oral hygiene for the next millennium is going
to be brush, floss and tongue cleaning,'' said Clifford Yudelman,
co-founder of IDDS, which sells a spoon-shaped scraper to compete
with U.S. DenTek's fan-shaped device. Both plastic tools cost about
$5.
</P>
<P>
   The size and breadth of the halitosis market leaves plenty of
room for newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   For the 12 months ending in July, annual mouthwash purchases
totaled $663 million, up 2.5 percent over the previous 12-month
period, according to Information Resources International Inc., the
consumer goods tracking firm in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Breath mints rose a brisker 7.3 percent to $309 million, as Tic
Tacs, Certs, Altoids and Breath Savers jostled for market share.
Breath sprays and drops declined 12.5 percent to $49.3 million,
while sales of toothpaste _ which does double duty as a cavity
fighter _ rose 3.9 percent to $1.65 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, tongue scrapers don't even register. ``We don't have a
category for that yet,'' said market researcher Bob Bregenzer.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting for recognition is nothing new to U.S. DenTek chief
executive John Jansheski.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you imagine going into Wal-Mart two years ago and telling
them they needed to carry tongue scrapers,'' he said. ``We'd have
to wait five minutes for them to calm down, they were laughing so
hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Jansheski hopes to have the last laugh. His 40-person firm is
selling ``thousands'' of tongue scrapers a month. Yudelman is more,
shall we say, close-mouthed about sales. But tongue scrapers are
starting to grab shelf space at chains like Longs Drugs, Target and
Albertsons. Other tongue-scraper-makers sell their &LR;   &LR; wares direct
through Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   A recent article in the authoritative Journal of the American
Dental Association summarized the current thinking that bad breath
generally emanates from the rear of the tongue, where bits of food
and dead cells provide a breeding ground for bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   These microscopic bugs expel sulfurous gases that cause the
rotten egg or sour garbage smells we associate with halitosis. In
theory, as well as in practice, a daily scraping of this H-spot
should eliminate breath odor at its source, the dental association
article concluded.
</P>
<P>
   History proves that our ancestors knew the embarrassment of
halitosis. As far back as the Eber Papyrus in 1,500 B.C., Egyptians
were complaining about bad breath. Hebrew, Muslim and Hindu holy
books all bear references to bad breath, and early Buddhist
literature notes that ``The mouth becomes evil smelling ... (when
the) nerves of the tongue are not cleaned.''
</P>
<P>
   The earliest archaeological evidence of tongue scraping appears
to be a set of Roman toilet articles, containing a tongue scraper,
that dates to A.D. 100.
</P>
<P>
   According to one history of oral hygiene, tongue scraping
remained common, at least among nobility and elites, in many
cultures around the world until earlier in this century, when
toothpastes, toothbrushes and mouthwashes made tongue scraping a
lost art, at least in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Now, tongue scraping advocates face an uphill battle in
convincing Americans that hand-to-mouth combat is as effective
against bad breath, if not more so, than waging chemical warfare
with mouthwash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some mouthwashes kill bacteria and provide a strong coverup,''
said U.S. DenTek's Jansheski. ``But they contain alcohol, which
dries out the mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   He said a dry mouth favors the growth of odor-causing bacteria,
so once people eat again, alcohol-based products actually worsen
the smell. ``Saliva flow is wonderful'' Jansheski said. ``That's
why babies have clean breath, because they're always salivating.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Witt, senior scientist with Proctor &AMP; Gamble, maker of
Scope mouthwash, rejected the notion that alcohol-based mouthwashes
allow bad breath to bounce back with renewed vigor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to the thought leaders (in breath research) and
got blank looks on their face in response'' to that suggestion,
Witt said.
</P>
<P>
   He said his own research on Scope shows that it decreases bad
breath as long as three to eight hours after rinsing.
</P>
<P>
   Dentist Anthony Dailley, who runs the Center for Breath
Treatment in San Francisco, said even if the scientific evidence
isn't conclusive, he is convinced alcohol-based mouthwashes do more
harm than good because of this drying-out effect.
</P>
<P>
   Dailley is one dentist you hope you'll never have to see. For
$550, he'll diagnose and treat extreme bad breath with tools
ranging from simple tongue scrapers to ionized water flows that are
supposed to neutralize breath odors by washing the tongue clean.
</P>
<P>
   He said many of his patients are elderly people whose bad breath
stems from the fact that they are taking anti-depressants,
anti-hypertensives, diuretics or other drugs that have the side
effect of drying out the mouth. Rather than use a mouthwash that
has the same effect, Dailley said ``It would be better to rinse
with water.''
</P>
<P>
   Tongue scrapers face a more formidable barrier to acceptance _
sticking something in the back of one's tongue provokes a gag
reflex.
</P>
<P>
   Dental experts suggest the reflex becomes less extreme once
people become accustomed to tongue scraping. But some firms are
hedging their bets by packaging tongue scrapers with new age
chemical brews that claim to spray bad breath away _ without the
use of alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. DenTek recently released OraSan, a compound invented by
Beverly Hills dentist Rudi Saldamando. Fearful that ordinary
mouthwashes were drying out the palates of the stars, Saldamando
brewed up a compound with a main ingredient that contains extra
oxygen atoms.
</P>
<P>
   These oxygen atoms seek out and neutralize the sulfur gases
responsible for breath odor. At least that's U.S. DenTek's claim,
supported by some private tests that financed but are unverified by
any government agency. Breath remedies don't require U.S. Food and
Drug Administration approval.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. DenTek has incorporated OraSan into a new spray, drop,
mouth rinse and toothpaste to supplement its trusty tongue scraper.
Other vendors say this simple instrument, used daily, in
conjunction with brushing and flossing, is the best way to defeat
odor.
</P>
<P>
   However they choose to attack the problem, professional breath
busters know exactly what keeps them fighting the good fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you could only hear the people,'' said Nachnani, the breath
expert in Beverly Hills. ``I've had people who've literally cried
they were so grateful I could help them.''

WASHINGTON STATE VOTERS FACE CHOICE TO TAX THEMSELVES OR NOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The fierce debate over Initiative 695, a measure on
Tuesday's ballot here in Washington state that would all but do
away with an unpopular state tax on automobiles, does not quite
have the gravitas of the battle in Washington, D.C., over how to
preserve Social Security or Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   But in a curious way, the question that is emerging in this
election debate is similar to the one that has lingered in the
nation's capital this year: Do voters want a big tax cut, or are
they willing to let government keep the money in the hopes that it
will fix a big problem?
</P>
<P>
   In Washington state's case, that problem is traffic congestion
and urban sprawl, an issue that voters, especially in the
increasingly congested Seattle metropolitan area, identify as one
of their top frustrations. Opponents of Initiative 695, including
the state's Democratic governor, Gary Locke, and a flock of
business leaders here, warn that it would wipe more than $500
million a year out of the state's transportation budget and stall
all kinds of road-improvement projects. An advertising blitz from
the ``no'' forces features a traffic reporter in a helicopter,
reporting bumper-to-bumper traffic jams all over Puget Sound.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact remains that the motor-vehicle tax, which can cost
about $440 a year for a new $20,000 vehicle and is the
fourth-largest source of revenue for the state government, is very
tangible and deeply disliked. That is not only because of its high
cost, but because it is based on the manufacturer's suggested
retail price for a car, so anyone who haggles out a better deal
gets no break in the amount of the tax.
</P>
<P>
   And despite the governor's no-free-lunch warnings and his recent
vow that he would propose a ``dramatic'' overhaul of the car-tax
structure if Initiative 695 is defeated, the chance to do away with
the tax and replace it with a flat $30 annual fee for all vehicles
may prove irresistible. Most polls have shown the measure well
ahead, although support has dropped since the ``No on 695''
campaign kicked into gear.
</P>
<P>
   The tax measure is arguably even more radical in another
respect: it would require voter approval for any increases in state
or local taxes and fees, giving Washington voters the broadest
control over such increases as voters in any state. (In Colorado,
voters backed a 1992 measure that requires votes on all state and
local taxes, but not on fees and utility rates. The Washington
measure would apply to just about anything, it seems, including
library fines.)
</P>
<P>
   That provision is statutory and thus can be changed by the state
Legislature, though lawmakers would face a politically risky vote
if they did so. In any event, the car tax has predominated in
campaign advertisements and media coverage, and the question seems
to be whether voters trust that state and local officials, if they
keep the car-tax revenues, will use them wisely to deal with
traffic and sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   The answer is uncertain. Some polls suggest that, when the
question is phrased that way, people are far more willing to oppose
the initiative. But Brett Bader, a Republican consultant here who
is a veteran of at least 11 initiative campaigns in this state
(though not this one), said there was little indication that voters
actually trusted that the money would make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the approach could work,'' said Bader, referring to
the pitch of the anti-695 campaign. ``But the problem is that a lot
of folks feel like they have been spending that money for years and
we're still in a traffic mess. So it's a less compelling argument
than it once might have been. There's a real cynicism out there
that this can be fixed.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle is plagued with some of the worst traffic problems
anywhere, which have only increased as the region continues to grow
and are especially bad for commuters who must cross between the
city and the suburbs and high-tech centers on the east side of Lake
Washington. A light-rail project remains on the drawing board, and
complaints about congestion are common.
</P>
<P>
   And it is easy to find people who have no confidence in
government to fix the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely not,'' said Elizabeth Goldmanis, a purchasing
manager from Mercer Island, in the middle of Lake Washington, who
was buying gas Friday and said she planned to vote for I-695, as
the measure is known. ``You just can't trust that they won't spend
the money on something else.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Eyman, the 33-year-old chief sponsor of the initiative, who
uses phrases like ``it continues to rock and roll'' when describing
the tax-cutting movement here, said the doomsday scenarios offered
by critics were backfiring with voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people clearly don't believe a word our opponents are
saying,'' said Eyman, owner of a mail-order business that sells
sorority and fraternity wristwatches. ``Our opponents are trying to
make the case that the state just can't afford this. Staring them
in the face is a huge $1 billion surplus, a huge $300 million
tobacco settlement, huge local surpluses. If you can't provide tax
relief now, when can you?''
</P>
<P>
   But Locke and opponents say it will blow a permanent hole in the
budget and cut off state money for local ambulance, fire and police
services, which receive revenue from the vehicle tax. And that
argument is clearly catching on with some voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just too drastic,'' said Christine Black, a Seattle
homemaker, who was also buying gas Friday. ``A lot of people could
get hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents also argue that I-695 is unfair because the current
tax rises with the value of the car and thus wiping it out ``gives
the biggest tax break to wealthy people who own the most expensive
cars,'' according to the No on 695 campaign's statement in the
state's official voter guide.
</P>
<P>
   There have been some strange-bedfellows aspects to the
opposition campaign, which has brought together unions,
environmentalists, highway pavers and some of the state's biggest
companies, including Boeing, Microsoft and Weyerhaeuser, who have
all given at least $60,000 each.

DAIMLERCHRYSLER SHIFTS U.S. MANAGERS TO INCREASE LOCAL CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROBYN MEREDITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT_ The U.S. unit of DaimlerChrysler AG announced a
sweeping reorganization of its senior executive ranks Friday, a
move that the company said was intended to preserve a good deal of
autonomy for the former Chrysler Corporation, which Germany's
Daimler-Benz bought in November.
</P>
<P>
   Tension between the U.S. unit and the German executives who
control DaimlerChrysler have bedeviled the trans-Atlantic merger.
Thomas Stallkamp, the second-ranking American, was forced out a
month ago, and several other American executives have left the
company in frustration. When Stallkamp was pushed out,
DaimlerChrysler said it had settled on a structure that called for
its automotive business to be run essentially as three
semiautonomous divisions, with the former Chrysler as one of those
units. But that was overshadowed by the news of the departure of a
man who had been seen as the defender of the American company's
interests at DaimlerChrysler.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, his successor moved decisively to reorganize the
American unit while stressing that the company's various units
would still strive to take advantage of savings and other benefits
from the merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a year of working together, DaimlerChrysler has
concluded that its automotive businesses can best function as
individual divisions of DaimlerChrysler AG,'' said James Holden,
president of the U.S. unit. He reassigned about 35 executives as
part of a plan to run the unit largely separately from
Mercedes-Benz and the rest of DaimlerChrysler.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, most of those executives were told to
report to Thomas Gale, the U.S. unit's general manager for car
operations and executive vice president for product development and
design. That signals that DaimlerChrysler expects Gale will not
leave the company. Auto industry executives said he had been
considering leaving, although Gale previously called such talk
``speculation'' and refused further comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putting Tom Gale front and center is very reassuring to
investors and U.S. employees,'' said John Casesa, an auto analyst
at Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   Holden promoted Susan Cischke to senior vice president for
regulatory affairs and passenger car operations, and named eight
executives to report to her on those matters. She will report to
Gale.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Schaum was named general manager for power train
operations and senior vice president for platform engineering and
quality, reporting to Gale on engineering matters and to Holden on
other matters. Six platform engineering executives were placed
under Schaum's responsibility, and two other executives will
continue to report to him.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Robertson was named general manager for truck operations
and senior vice president for engineering technologies and will
report to Gale. Seven executives were directed Friday to report to
him.
</P>
<P>
   John Miller was named vice president for product planning and
will report to Gale. Seven executives were chosen to report to
Miller, who will be in charge of centralizing the planning of new
cars and trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Holden and his senior management team planned the changes
without direction from Stuttgart, said an American executive
involved in the reorganization.
</P>
<P>
   While Stallkamp had been faulted in Germany for failing to
quickly and decisively take charge of the American business,
Friday's announcement showed Holden was eager to avoid that
mistake, Wall Street analysts and former Chrysler executives said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to be evidence that Holden is gathering some of the
reins into his own hands,'' said David Healy, an analyst with
Burnham Securities. He said the announcement would also serve as a
``morale boost'' to American employees.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, DaimlerChrysler seemed to be rushing to
dismantle the former Chrysler, but it encountered several problems.
In July, Wall Street analysts lost confidence in the quality of
financial reports handed out by executives in Stuttgart, and the
stock took a pounding until Daimler agreed to largely return to
American-style financial disclosures. Stallkamp's departure left
the impression that the U.S. unit was expected to stay out of the
way as Germans oversaw the global operations of the new company.
That turmoil caused employee morale to sink in the United States,
increasing the number of defections to other auto companies.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Lutz, who retired as vice chairman of Chrysler, warned in
his book, ``Guts,'' that mergers of companies with such separate
cultures are hard to pull off. ``I know that one of the major
reasons Juergen Schrempp wanted to merge with Chrysler was to get
at Chrysler's creativity,'' he wrote, ``just as one of Bob Eaton's
major reasons was to access Daimler's legendary technical prowess
and attention to detail. What a shame it would be if either group
were to squander the very thing they did the deal to get!'' &QL;

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 31)  
 (af)  
 By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. 
  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When directors of the Dun &AMP; Bradstreet Corp. handed walking
papers to Volney Taylor, the chief executive, last Monday, it
looked as if peace might be near for the troubled old-line credit
data company. After the stock hit a low for the year in late
August, D&AMP;B's largest shareholder had demanded an auction of the
company, only to be rebuffed repeatedly by Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, investors bid up the stock nearly 5 percent, to
$29.375 at Friday's close, in hopes that his departure foreshadowed
a quick sale.
</P>
<P>
   But they may be disappointed. The turmoil about the future of
D&AMP;B, far from being over, appears to be only beginning. Clifford L.
Alexander Jr., the director who was appointed interim chief
executive by the board, said in an interview last week that he had
no intention of auctioning the company or splitting Moody's
Investors Service, D&AMP;B's renowned bond-rating unit, from the
company's larger but ailing credit-information business. And big
shareholders, led by Harris Associates LP, a Chicago
money-management firm that owns a 13 percent stake, are considering
filing shareholder resolutions to help force a sale. The filing
deadline for resolutions to be included in the proxy and taken up
at the annual meeting next spring is Nov. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander said he would ``consider any options,'' but insisted
that fixing the credit-information business and hiring a new chief
executive would lead to better shareholder returns than the ``quick
fix'' of a sale, breakup or spinoff.
</P>
<P>
   One showdown could come as early as next week. Bill Nygren, a
portfolio manager at Harris, and Henry Berghoef, an analyst there,
are organizing a gathering in New York City on Nov. 8, where
investors will talk about what they believe the company should do.
Alexander, who was invited, said he will not attend.
</P>
<P>
   If Alexander is worried about a proxy fight, he is not showing
it. He says the other eight directors agree with him that the
company should not be auctioned. (Several board members did not
return calls seeking comment.)
</P>
<P>
   And while he declined to say exactly what overtures, if any, the
company has received from would-be buyers, he said, ``There hasn't
been any offer worth consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few weeks, Alexander will take his message
directly to large shareholders through meetings and telephone calls
to ``give them the clear picture they deserve'' of the company's
strategy. With some large shareholders, he added, he hoped to
correct ``misimpressions they may have, somehow, that we're all
missing a grand opportunity to make a sale.''
</P>
<P>
   Among companies of its size _ the market capitalization is about
$5 billion _ few enjoy such a storied place in American business
history as D&AMP;B Long before the investor protections ushered in by
Depression-era reforms, D&AMP;B was often the best _ if not the only _
reliable source an investor or lender could turn to for information
about a company or proprietor.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1841 by Lewis Tappan, an abolitionist who, curiously,
did not cotton to the idea of credit _ ``Owe no man anything but to
love one another,'' he would say _ R.G. Dun &AMP; Co. was a repository
for reports filed by a network of credit reporters equipped to
judge an enterprise's integrity and bill-paying ability.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, subjective factors would come into play: One early
credit reporter, Abraham Lincoln, noted that an Illinois grocer had
a rat hole in his store that ``would bear looking into.''
(Presidents Grant, McKinley and Cleveland also worked for D&AMP;B) But
the company's reputation for objective assessment of
credit-worthiness remains today. The firm still has no peer in its
ability to influence whether lenders and companies extend business
credit.
</P>
<P>
   After Dun merged with the John M. Bradstreet Co. in 1933,
business at the renamed Dun &AMP; Bradstreet continued to grow as it
found new ways to market its credit-information services. An
important innovation came in 1962 when the company created D-U-N-S,
now an internationally recognized tracking service for 57 million
public and private companies.
</P>
<P>
   But has the innovation stopped?
</P>
<P>
   D&AMP;B's core credit-information business is floundering, some
investors and analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   No one debates that the D&AMP;B data base is one of the great
business information franchises. But in interviews, investors said
the rapid growth of the Internet threatens to erode even an asset
as respected and proprietary as the D&AMP;B data base, and they
complained that the company has been very slow to build an
electronic commerce business. More dawdling could spell trouble,
they warned.
</P>
<P>
   If the company ``does not take advantage of E-commerce, we could
potentially get further behind the 8-ball,'' said David Carr,
president of Oak Value Capital Management in Durham, N.C.
``Shareholders might have less of a franchise.'' Oak Value owns 2.5
million D&AMP;B shares, a 1.5 percent stake.
</P>
<P>
   The company ``needs to be bought by somebody who has the tools
and urgency to get it done,'' Carr added, complaining that the
board ``has sat around being patient for too long.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The time for patience is over,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Sowinski, the former D&AMP;B chief financial officer who was
appointed last month to get the credit-information business back on
track, acknowledges that the company may have been slow to
capitalize on electronic commerce. But he says he is ``very
sensitive to the need to be able to be much more aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways our organization has had a mindset to defend the
franchise and market share and profits we've enjoyed,'' he said,
conceding there may have been a ``play not to lose'' mentality.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to be much more aggressive in terms of playing to
win,'' Sowinski said, adding that D&AMP;B is close to announcing its
first major electronic-commerce relationship. He declined to give
details.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Sowinski, who will be helping Alexander at
meetings with investors in coming weeks, is a candidate to replace
Taylor. Sowinski declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1996, when Taylor became chief executive, and 1998, the
company's main credit-information business, the Dun &AMP; Bradstreet
Operating Co., posted modest gains in sales and profits: revenue
rose to $1.42 billion from $1.33 billion and operating income
climbed to $256.6 million from $243 million.
</P>
<P>
   And even though its European unit posted more than $400 million
in revenue in each of those years, that subsidiary's financial
results were so poor it managed a cumulative operating profit of
just $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Since it spun off R.H. Donnelley, the advertising marketer, in
June 1998, Dun &AMP; Bradstreet's shares have lagged the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index by more than 25 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The bright spot has been Moody's, which competes with Standard &AMP;
Poor's, Duff &AMP; Phelps and other rating agencies but has managed an
average 17 percent annual increase in revenue since 1980. The last
two years have been even better: Moody's sales leapt to $495.5
million in 1998 from $349.7 million in 1996, and operating income
soared 73 percent, to $223.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Moody's is an even bigger part of D&AMP;B's overall
results: It posted third-quarter operating income of $68.1 million,
a 33 percent jump from last year, compared with $49.2 million in
operating income at D&AMP;B Operating.
</P>
<P>
   This year began optimistically enough for the United States
credit-information business, as management expressed hope that it
would post another 8 percent revenue gain for the year. But
investors got an inkling that something was amiss in July, when the
company managed to meet earnings estimates only because blowout
numbers from Moody's compensated for sluggish growth at the
credit-information business.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 19, the company disclosed that revenue at the United
States credit-information business had plunged 13 percent during
July, compared with the period a year earlier. As a result, it said
full-year profits for D&AMP;B would be about 6 percent lower than
expectations. By the end of the day, the stock had plunged 17
percent.
</P>
<P>
   What had happened? Investors and analysts said they were still
not sure, and, they added, it did not appear that the company was,
either. Taylor, through a company spokesman, declined to comment.
But the most likely culprits, analysts and investors said, included
a poorly thought-out change in the sales commission system that set
quotas so high that even dogged members of the sales force simply
gave up trying to meet their numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Sowinski, however, said that a number of execution problems had
arisen as the company tried to transform from its old-line business
_ credit reports _ to newer businesses. In addition to getting into
E-commerce, these include ``value added'' products that allow
customers to use D&AMP;B data to better analyze their customers and
vendors, and software and other products sold by other companies
that have D&AMP;B data embedded in them.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide sales of value-added products have jumped 20 percent
so far this year, he said, while companies including SAP and SAS
Institute now use D&AMP;B data in their products.
</P>
<P>
   But he acknowledged that the quota problems had hurt results and
led some salesmen to leave. He said the system had been changed to
allow ``appropriate sales commissions'' to be earned for the rest
of the year.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Harris, the largest shareholder, had waited
patiently for three years for the stock to catch fire; now it had
had enough. After an unsatisfactory meeting with Taylor on Aug. 25,
the Chicago money-management firm said in a disclosure filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission that it had asked D&AMP;B to put
itself up for sale.
</P>
<P>
   In the filing, Harris outlined why it believed the stock was
worth as much as $60 a share to an acquirer. Harris said a
strategic buyer might be willing to buy Moody's for more than D&AMP;B's
total current market value.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an environment where there has been no substantial
competitive threat to their business franchise, it's quite unusual
to see a lengthy period of disappointing performance out of a
company whose franchise doesn't seem to be declining,'' said Nygren
of Harris. ``Certainly for us, and my belief is other shareholders,
there has been a long frustration with the gap between the business
franchise and the market price of the stock.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris and other shareholders believe the company could sell for
about 15 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization _ or about $60 a share, based on prices fetched by
other business-information companies. That was the benchmark this
year, for example, when VNU, the Dutch publisher that owns
Billboard and Adweek magazines and The Hollywood Reporter, bought
Nielsen Media Research.
</P>
<P>
   Harris' principals also think that a financial buyer, like a
leveraged-buyout firm, would covet D&AMP;B because of its
cash-generation ability. Such a deal could not support the same
price a strategic buyer might be willing to pay, perhaps, but with
D&AMP;B throwing off huge amounts of cash _ it has returned more than
$500 million to shareholders through buybacks and dividends since
1998 _ a price in the 40s is an attainable goal, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   After the Harris filing, other big investors told the company
that they also preferred a sale. But after the board's Sept. 15
meeting, the company issued a statement making clear it did not
intend to take any such action. Instead, directors appointed
Sowinski to turn the D&AMP;B Operating unit around.
</P>
<P>
   He has met some success. The unit posted modest revenue growth
in August and September, the company said, though it added that
results were ``still at unacceptable levels.''
</P>
<P>
   But analysts say they are not sure the company realizes how
fragile the credit-information franchise could become if the
problems are not solved quickly. ``Time is working against them
big-time,'' said Lauren Rich Fine, who follows D&AMP;B for Merrill
Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   But management and directors ``have not exhibited any
appreciation for the difference between what they're thinking and
what shareholders are thinking,'' she said. ``It's one of those
unfortunate examples where you look at how corporate governance
rules are supposed to work, but they don't seem to be necessarily
working.''
</P>
<P>
   That is why investors eagerly await the Nov. 8 meeting. ``We'll
see what's on the mind of other owners before we make a decision if
we want to go ahead with the shareholder resolution or not,''
Nygren said. ``It's a bizarre situation. You have a group of owners
who probably represent a substantial majority of the shares
outstanding, and we're put in an adversarial position to try to
find a way to maximize the value of the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris officials emphasize they are not hostile by nature and
that they would prefer the dispute to be settled cordially. But,
quite seriously, Nygren said that prospective chief executives
might want to call before they consider quitting their other jobs.
Given the split between shareholders and the directors, he said,
``to take that post without the endorsement of large investors is
almost foolish.''
</P>
<P>
   To which Alexander, who spent part of last week lining up
headhunters for the search, responded, ``That's the kind of thing
that doesn't help the process.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the agitation for a sale had come from fewer investors
than it might appear and dismissed the significance of their
``noise.''
</P>
<P>
   Other stockholders, he is certain, support his plan, though none
have informed him of this. ``In this case, silence is golden,''
Alexander said. ``I don't know of public companies where
shareholders write love letters'' to management.

AMID PUMPKIN SHORTAGE, ONE FARM BOASTS A BOUNTIFUL HARVEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By GLENN COLLINS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DOVER, N.Y. _ It took the Rivera family two interminable hours
to drive from the Bronx to a farm that had escaped the great
pumpkin shortage of 1999, but the reward was a bonanza. ``We'd
heard of the shortage, so we were glad to see these fields were
full,'' said Jamie Rivera, a New York City police officer.
</P>
<P>
   His 8-year-old son, Jamie Jr., pointed to the 10-pounder he had
picked for his grandmother. ``And that one, that's for my teacher,
Mrs. Grant,'' he said of the tiny pumpkin at his feet.
</P>
<P>
   Generations of Dutchess County residents and citified
interlopers have made an annual pilgrimage to pick a patch of
pumpkins at Dykeman's Farm here, near Pawling. And this year's
customers have not been disappointed. They can stumble over 2,000
pumpkins in the Dykeman family's eight-acre field on Pleasant Ridge
Road.
</P>
<P>
   By taking heroic measures to beat last summer's drought and save
their cash crop, the Dykemans have enabled Halloween pumpkin
pickers to engage in one of the obligatory rituals of autumn, along
with leaf peeping, apple picking and trick-or-treating.
``Irrigation saved our crop, but a lot of other farmers were
hurt,'' said family patriarch Henry Dykeman, 71.
</P>
<P>
   Halloween, which is America's fastest-growing holiday, is
helplessly dependent upon its symbolic gourd. And so, the Halloween
boom has created an insatiable need for the pumpkins of New York,
which happens to be _ who knew? _ the nation's second-largest
pumpkin-growing state, according to the U.S. Department of
Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   But months of extreme weather have been disastrous for the
state's pumpkin supply. The shortage has not only caused wholesale
pumpkin importation and instances of vegetable subterfuge, but has
also unleashed pumpkin handle deception in the jack-o'-lantern wars
at the New York region's farm stands and garden centers.
</P>
<P>
   There are fewer pumpkins right now because of the scorching
summer heat and severe drought of June and July. The brutal weather
kept seeds from germinating, discouraged bees from pollinating
pumpkin flowers and shriveled root systems. Worse, many of the
surviving pumpkins ripened prematurely in August and September;
they rotted well before Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in September, paradoxically, many farmers were devastated
by floods brought on by Tropical Storm Floyd. ``Pumpkins just hate
standing water,'' said Pete Gregg, a spokesman for the state
Department of Agriculture and Markets in Albany, ``so we got a lot
of flat-sided, misshapen pumpkins. And many were discolored with
grayish fungus that customers don't find desirable.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, ``it's an off year in terms of yield and quality,''
Gregg said, ``and many pumpkin farmers in the lower Hudson Valley
and Long Island were severely affected.''
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture analysts have estimated that this year's harvest
from the nation's 74,000 acres of pumpkin fields will be more than
50 percent below average. In New York state, drought-related damage
to all crops has cost farmers $186 million, Gregg said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, this fall, the Halloween-minded have discovered that
pumpkins are smaller, often more expensive ``and there are fewer of
them,'' said Tony Mannetta, director of Greenmarket, a nonprofit
organization that operates 28 open-air farmers' markets in New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   ``My advice has been to shop early,'' Mannetta said, ``because
pumpkins are not available to our customers in nearly their
ordinary abundance.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Abundance was hardly in question at Dykeman's Farm. ``We got all
paranoid about the shortage, but here we don't have to worry,''
said Jack Bonacorso. He had arrived with his picking crew _ wife
Donna and daughters Bryana, 8, and Kayleigh, 6 _ from nearby
Wingdale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Halloween without a pumpkin,'' he said, ``would be like
Christmas without a tree.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, Heather Bassano, 9, hugged her favorite pumpkin and said
she was going to paint a face on it. Erin Ryan, 8, her best friend,
said she would be carving hers. ``Picking these is so much better
than getting them at the A&AMP;P,'' said her mother, Charlou Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   At the farm stand, George Kuklevsky and his 10-year-old son,
Simon, had just put their six pumpkins on the scales: they weighed
100 pounds and cost $40. ``I figured with the shortage, they'd make
us pay through the nose,'' Kuklevsky said. But at Dykeman's, the
price, 40 cents a pound, ``was the same as last year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The beastly weather of 1999 was more of a blow to New York's
farmers than it might have been only a few years ago thanks to
``the growing industry of Halloween,'' as Gregg put it.
</P>
<P>
   The state's pumpkin acreage increased by nearly 20 percent from
1992 to 1997, the last year for which figures are available,
according to the federal Agriculture Department. It has calculated
that New York, with 5,388 acres harvested in 1997, is second only
to Illinois, with 7,631 acres harvested.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are spot shortages around the region, small,
locally grown pumpkins are generally available. But there is a
scarcity of the large, perfectly formed jack-o'-lanterns essential
to success in the Halloween competition among roadside stands,
garden centers, nurseries and vegetable markets.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, merchants have relied on ingenuity to save their
season. For example, Gregg said, New York has seen a massive,
wholly unpublicized influx of pumpkins from Canada, ``where there
was no drought and no Floyd.''
</P>
<P>
   Even at humble farm stands, authenticity is not a certainty this
season. ``Some of the roadside stands that make their money from
pumpkin sales had to buy their supply,'' said Dave Tetor, the
Dutchess County agriculture program leader at the Cornell
Cooperative Extension in Millbrook.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, some pick-your-own pumpkin fields have run out of
produce and have purchased imported ``ringers.'' ``People want the
fun of finding them in the field, and if you don't have any
pumpkins left you have to plant them at midnight,'' said Tetor.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Even cosmetic reconstruction has not been unheard of in this
season of crisis. Drought-induced brittleness has caused some
growers to experience problems ``with the handles on the
pumpkins,'' said Jean Warholic, executive secretary of the New York
State Vegetable Growers Association, a trade group. ``Some
customers won't look twice at a pumpkin without a handle. We won't
ask whether anyone glued them back on.''
</P>
<P>
   When Henry Dykeman started his pumpkin-picking operation in
1974, ``we were the only one doing it within a 25-mile radius,'' he
said, ``and now everyone is copying us.''
</P>
<P>
   Dykeman and his wife, Jean, own the farm along with their
45-year-old son, Wright, and Wright's wife, Beth. ``Last summer we
irrigated the fields for 70 consecutive days, for 20 hours a day,''
said Wright Dykeman. ``I ran out of ambition before I ran out of
water.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dykemans say it was the hottest, driest summer in memory,
and the experts concur. ``I've been in Dutchess County 27 years and
this is the worst drought I've seen,'' said Tetor. ``Not every farm
has Dykeman's soil, or his irrigation capability.''
</P>
<P>
   Many farmers were not so lucky. ``I lost my whole pumpkin crop.
It was like planting them in the desert,'' said Eugene Froehlich,
55, a vegetable farmer who has grown pumpkins for 25 years on his
family farm in Montgomery, across the Hudson River from Dutchess
County.
</P>
<P>
   Pumpkin farming ``is a gamble every year,'' said the elder
Dykeman, noting that in addition to drought and flood, the
neighboring deer population devoured ``1,000 of my best pumpkins.''
Dykeman smiled, shook his head, then said, ``A farmer has to depend
on the Lord.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing amid rows of pumpkins, Mrs. Ryan made it clear,
however, that she would not be dependent on Dykeman's Farm for her
pumpkin pie. That ``will come out of a can this year,'' she said.
``All the work that's involved with a real pumpkin, it's not worth
it _ it tastes exactly the same.''

 COKE ASSIGNS LARGEr ROLES TO 3 OFFICERS TO EASE BURDEN ON CEO  
 (bl)  
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Coca-Cola said Friday that three top executives would assume
greater authority, apparently setting up a succession contest for
the top job and easing some criticism that the chairman and chief
executive, M. Douglas Ivester, lacked a second in command.
</P>
<P>
   The changes increase the responsibilities of two senior vice
presidents, Jack Stahl and Douglas Daft, as well as those of the
chief financial officer, James Chestnut.
</P>
<P>
   One stock analyst said the management streamlining largely
eliminated questions about how such a large company facing so many
challenges could be run by Ivester, 52, without a strong second.
``He cut the number of divisions reporting to him from 12 to 6,''
said Andrew J. Conway, a beverage analyst for Morgan Stanley.
``There is less need for a No. 2 in the short run.''
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts also applauded the move. ``They had to
consolidate,'' said Emanuel Goldman, a global consumer-products
analyst for Merrill Lynch. ``You had all these technical guys
reporting to Doug Ivester. It didn't make any sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola's share price rose 18.75 cents on the day, to $59,
though it is still about 12 percent below where it started the
year. The company's profits have fallen steadily for a year and a
half, and its third-quarter results, released last week, showed an
11 percent decline from the comparable period in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Company spokesman Randall Donaldson said the timing was good for
the changes because various economies around the world that have
depressed Coca-Cola's profits had lately appeared to be
stabilizing. ``This is something that could have been done
earlier,'' he said, ``but given the economic turmoil, it just
didn't make sense for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the new structure, most of the technical groups, including
corporate services, communications, human resources, product
integrity and technical operations, will report to Chestnut, 49.
Daft, 56, who has had responsibility for the Middle East and East
Asia as a senior vice president, will add Africa to his portfolio.
The senior vice president in charge of Coke's African business,
Carl Ware, will report to Daft.
</P>
<P>
   Stahl, 46, a former chief financial officer at Coke, will take
direct charge of some international operations for the first time.
Now the head of the company's important North American division,
Stahl will expand his oversight over countries where the company
has been struggling, like Brazil, Colombia and Venezuela. The move
is seen as crucial to making him a contender some day for Coke's
top spot, where international experience has been a prerequisite.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``He still has responsibility for North America, but he just
gets to bring it all the way down to Cape Horn,'' Goldman said.
Timothy Haas, who oversees Coca-Cola's business in Latin America,
will continue in that role but will report to Stahl, not Ivester.
Stahl also takes on responsibility for Minute Maid, Coke's smallest
division, whose president, Ralph Cooper, moves to the top of
Coca-Cola's North American operations.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new structure, the company's European operations will
report to Ivester, as will Daft and Stahl. Coca-Cola was forced to
make the biggest product recall in company history by the Belgian
government in June. The order came after hundreds of Belgians
complained of nausea and other symptoms of illness after drinking
Coca-Cola and other soft drinks made by the company. In all, 17
million cases of Coke products were pulled off the market, and the
recall cost Coca-Cola two to three cents a share in earnings in
both the second and third quarters of this year.
</P>
<P>
   To replace Chestnut as chief financial officer, Ivester plans to
propose Gary Fayard, now the company's controller, at the December
board meeting, the company said. Fayard, 47, is an accountant very
familiar with Coca-Cola's finances.
</P>
<P>
   ``This vastly increases the scope of Jack Stahl's and Doug
Daft's jobs,'' said John Sicher, the editor of Beverage Digest, an
industry newsletter. ``It also increases James Chestnut's
responsibility significantly. Most of Coke's global operations will
now be run by two of the most talented people in the system.''
</P>
<P>
   In other changes, Sandy Allan, who has been president of the
North Africa operations, becomes the new chief of the Middle East
and Far East group, and Steve Jones, who has had a senior position
in Coke's Japan division, takes over as president of Minute Maid.
</P>
<P>
   The other executives who continue to report to Ivester are
general counsel Joseph Gladden and chief marketing officer Charles
Frenette. .

BRADLEY CAMPAIGN VIEWS FLORIDA AS PIVOTAL STATE  

</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES DAO    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEMBROKE PINES, Fla. _ When George Platt, the chairman of the
Broward County Democratic Committee, introduced former Sen. Bill
Bradley at a campaign rally Friday, he ticked off the familiar
highlights of Bradley's resume: Princeton graduate, Olympian,
Rhodes scholar. But a huge cheer went up among the 800 retirees
when he hit the next item: former New York Knick.
</P>
<P>
   For Bradley, who is running for the Democratic presidential
nomination, being a former Knick, as well as a three-term senator
from New Jersey, could be a secret weapon in a state like Florida,
which has a large population of retirees from the New York City
area who tend to be die-hard Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   While much of the attention in the Democratic presidential
campaign has focused on states like New Hampshire, New York and
California, Bradley's strategists are taking a hard look at
Florida. The Florida primary on March 14, one week after the
delegate-rich primaries in California, New York and other states,
could be pivotal.
</P>
<P>
   If Bradley does well on March 7, his strategists believe he
would have the momentum he needs to topple Vice President Al Gore.
The vice president would then be expected to rely on Southern
states, which are holding six of the seven primaries on March 14,
to try to stop Bradley. So a weak showing by Bradley on March 14
could slow his campaign, but a good showing in a few states, such
as Florida, could keep momentum building.
</P>
<P>
   Although fond memories of Bradley's achievements, particularly
as a professional basketball star, are probably not enough to win
him the primary, they could help him close the gap with Gore, who
has the support of much of the Florida's Democratic establishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are old-line, FDR Democrats,'' said Bob Brooks, 64, a
retired schoolteacher from Massapequa, N.Y., who organized Friday's
rally at a sprawling condominium complex in Pembroke Pines called
Century Village. ``They knew Bill Bradley from New Jersey, some of
them worked on his campaigns, and they certainly remember him from
the Knicks.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Florida's potential importance, neither candidate has
spent much time here, focusing instead on the earlier events in
Iowa and New Hampshire, as well as in New York and California. Gore
has been in Florida several times since January, but some have been
official White House visits. Friday was Bradley's first campaign
swing in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Graham, a Democrat who has yet to endorse a candidate,
said although the state went for President Clinton in 1996, Gore
cannot assume it will automatically be in his column. He noted that
Gore lost Florida to Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts in the
1988 primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will be competitive,'' Graham said. ``While Gore is
in the lead today, it's not a foregone conclusion that in a primary
in March, he would win it.''
</P>
<P>
   Aware that they may not have the resources to compete with Gore
throughout the South, Bradley's aides suggested that they are
likely to target specific states, including Florida. Bradley's
deputy campaign manager, Ed Turlington, spent all of last week
meeting with Democratic activists across Florida, laying the
foundation for a campaign organization.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign has also stepped up its fund-raising here. An event
on Thursday night at the Jacksonville home of Stephen Pajcic, a
Democratic candidate for governor in 1986, raised nearly $200,000,
while an event Friday in Miami was expected to take in another
$125,000, Bradley's aides said.
</P>
<P>
   In appearances Friday, Bradley suggested that Gore had become
too negative. ``I'm trying to be positive in this campaign,''
Bradley said during a morning stop in Boca Raton. ``And believe me
that takes a certain amount of discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   Later his campaign put out a document titled ``Promises Without
Pricetags,'' accusing the Gore campaign of not being specific about
the costs of the vice president's proposals, from licensing
handguns to hiring school counselors.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign asserts that cost estimates have been provided
for most of its proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also tailored his remarks to local concerns. In Pembroke
Pines, for instance, he noted how his plan for near universal
health care would expand Medicare to help the elderly pay for drugs
and for medical services in their homes, so they do not have to
move into nursing homes.
</P>
<P>
   He also told the crowd that he would not interfere with Israel's
ability to negotiate a peace settlement, which drew loud applause
from the many Jewish retirees. And at a news conference in Miami,
he said he would support maintaining the trade embargo with Cuba _
noting that he had learned a great deal about Cuban issues because
of the large Cuban community in Union City, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   But his knowledge did not cover one volatile issue. Asked
whether he would turn back Cubans trying to flee to the United
States by boat, Bradley simply said, ``I don't know.'' Asked to
clarify, he said it was the first time he had encountered the
issue.

   TOSHIBA TO SPEND $1 BILLION TO SETTLE LAPTOP LAWSUIT
</P>
<P>
   Toshiba said that it would spend about $1 billion to settle a
class-action lawsuit brought by two people who contended that the
company, the world's leading maker of laptop computers, sold 5
million defective machines in the United States since 1987.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise settlement covers nearly all owners of Toshiba
notebook computers bought in the United States. Lawyers called the
settlement extraordinarily large for a minor flaw. Indeed, nobody
had complained about the defect until last March, when the suit was
filed. The company said the cost of a jury trial could have been
far greater, possibly endangering the company's existence.
</P>
<P>
   LOCKHEED PROFITS AND STOCK SKID
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin, the nation's largest military contractor,
posted a 32 percent decline in third-quarter income and, after
halving its profit forecast for next year, said its president and
chief operating officer, Peter Teets, would retire. It was the
fifth time since November that Lockheed has cut its profit
forecast, and its stock, which traded as high as $56.75 a share a
year ago, fell $2.6875, to $20.25. Vance Coffman, the chairman and
chief executive, will assume the duties of chief operating officer,
as well.
</P>
<P>
   NEW HOME SALES FELL IN SEPTEMBER
</P>
<P>
   Sales of new homes fell in September to the lowest level in
almost two years as higher mortgage costs cooled housing from the
robust pace earlier this year. New single-family home sales fell
12.8 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
811,000 units, the Commerce Department said.
</P>
<P>
   ANOTHER WEB INITIAL OFFERING SOARS
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Akamai Technologies, which has a new Internet
technology that speeds up delivery of Web pages, including Yahoo's,
to computer users, soared in the fourth-hottest initial public
offering ever. Akamai closed at $145.1875 on NASDAQ after opening
at $110. It was initially priced at $26.
</P>
<P>
   BRAZILIAN AIRLINES OPPOSE MERGING
</P>
<P>
   Three of Brazil's leading airlines have dismissed a proposal
from a competitor, Vasp, the country's second-largest carrier, that
they all merge into a company to be called Air Latina. The idea was
dismissed by Varig Brazilian Airlines, Brazil's largest carrier, as
well as by TAM and Transbrasil.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. APPEALS WORLD TRADE RULING
</P>
<P>
   The United States appealed a World Trade Organization ruling
that invalidated $2.5 billion in tax breaks to American companies
that export through offshore subsidiaries. The U.S. trade
representative, Charlene Barshefsky, argued that the trade panel
``committed multiple legal errors.'' The European Union had
challenged the American law, saying the tax breaks amounted to
illegal subsidies to American companies.
</P>
<P>
   TYCO INTERNATIONAL SHARES DECLINE
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Tyco International fell almost 9 percent after a
column by Floyd Norris in The New York Times said that Tyco had
failed to inform investors about charges taken by two companies
soon before Tyco acquired them. Tyco's chief financial officer,
Mark Swartz, criticized Norris' analysis, saying, ``Tyco's
accounting adheres to the letter and spirit'' of generally accepted
accounting practices and to SEC regulations.

   WEST VIRGINIANS BACK STRIP MINING
</P>
<P>
   The West Virginia congressional delegation is planning 11th-hour
legislation to block what environmentalists call a landmark federal
court ruling that severely restricts the state's strip mining of
mountaintops. State officials contend it will prove ruinous for the
coal industry. Representatives of environmental groups said after a
White House meeting that the Clinton administration would not
oppose the West Virginia delegation.

   BANK OF NEW YORK INQUIRY LAGGING
</P>

   More than a year after federal authorities began their

never be solved unless Russia or other countries help American
prosecutors.

O'NEILL FINDS COMFORT BEING WITH HIS FRIENDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Andrew and Aaron O'Neill, ages 10 and 7,
respectively, bounced around the clubhouse at Yankee Stadium on
Friday morning. They had hardly slept, their father said, because
they were so excited about the parade being held for the Yankees on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Paul O'Neill, the Yankees' right fielder, wanted to go to the
parade because his sons wanted to go, and then he and his family
were scheduled to fly to Ohio to attend a memorial service Saturday
for his father. Charles O'Neill died early Wednesday morning,
before Game 4 of the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the events on consecutive days, Paul O'Neill said,
``all worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy for my kids, because they really looked forward to
this,'' he said of the parade.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill said it was good to be around friends, people he knew,
at a difficult time. ``Tomorrow will be a tough day,'' he said.
``But we'll enjoy today. This is a big day for the kids, with this
parade.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, as the ticker tape fell, O'Neill stood on a float with
the other Yankee outfielders, Bernie Williams standing in front of
him, his children around him, and when he was introduced at City
Hall, O'Neill received a huge ovation. After O'Neill received his
key to the city from Mayor Rudolph Guiliani, he turned, shook hands
with Yankees general manager Brian Cashman, bench coach Don Zimmer
and others, and then departed early so he could fly home to Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Decision on Davis Is Near
</P>
<P>
   Chili Davis has told Yankee officials he will remain in town
until next Friday, and before then the Yankees intend to sit down
with him and discuss whether they want to bring back the designated
hitter for another season.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees hold a $4.6 million option on Davis, 39, for next
season, but it figures they will buy out his contract for $800,000.
Davis said Friday that he would retire if the Yankees did not want
him back because he had enjoyed the last two seasons immensely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to play anywhere else,'' Davis said. ``What am I
going to do somewhere else to beat this? This has been probably the
best two-year ride of my career, and to actually go backwards _
which is what I would consider it _ is not something that I want to
do. If I'm not going to play baseball next year for the New York
Yankees, it's not going to be for anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis will have three championship rings after he receives the
ring for winning this year. He also played for the Minnesota Twins
when they won the World Series in 1991. ``I'm so afraid of losing
them,'' he said. ``I guess you could replace them, but you don't
want to replace them _ it would be like playing replacement
baseball.''
</P>

   Cone in a Positive Mood
</P>
<P>
   David Cone struggled to get through the post-season last year,
bypassing the normal throwing sessions between starts so he could
save his strength for each start. Cone, who is eligible for free
agency now, felt much stronger this year, contributing two solid
outings in the post-season.
</P>
<P>
   Cone allowed two runs in seven innings against the Boston Red
Sox in Game 2 of the American League Championship Series and then
just one hit in seven innings in Game 2 of the World Series against
the Atlanta Braves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel pretty good about this year,'' Cone said. ``I think,
maybe in the back of my mind, I can go a couple of more years, two
or three more years. I feel a lot better this year, as opposed to
last.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone also talked about how the immediate celebration of the
World Series sweep was unusual. ``We were a little subdued,'' he
said. ``I think everybody had perspective on the night. I think
there was some sadness in here, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Straw was having a tough time,'' Cone said of Darryl
Strawberry, ``so we were in there, talking to him. A lot of emotion
came out, the culmination of everything he'd been through hit him.
That's what is so great about this team. We help each other, not
only on the field, but off the field.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked who the first person was who came to mind when he
thought about the special nature of this year's title, Cone
mentioned Joe Torre. ``It was all about Joe this year, considering
all that he had to go through,'' Cone said. ``The way he came back.
He not only did a great job of managing, but he set an example with
how much grace and class he showed in dealing with cancer.''

   Irabu Misses Parade
</P>
<P>
   Hideki Irabu missed Friday's parade so he could return to Japan.
George Rose, the interpreter for Irabu, informed Yankees general
manager Brian Cashman that Irabu went home to be with his father,
who is to undergo surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu went 11-7 in 32 games this season, and next year he will
be in the last year of a four-year contract, for $2 million. &QL;

EDITORIAL: MEDDLING WITH OREGON'S LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Oct. 30:
</P>
<P>
   There is something cruel and intrusive about a bill passed by
the House of Representatives this week making it a federal crime
for doctors to prescribe lethal drugs so that terminally ill
patients can end their own lives. Congress is behaving like a
bad-tempered elephant, stomping and trumpeting to overturn an
assisted-suicide law approved twice by the voters of Oregon. The
Oregon law, a responsible effort to ease suffering at the end of
life, allows physicians to aid suicides of the terminally ill under
carefully defined circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   As America's population ages and medicine's ability to keep
people alive improves, some terminally ill patients may want to end
their lives rather than endure more misery. But as captives to a
system whose ethic is to help them live, they cannot do so. To fill
that void, Dr. Jack Kevorkian emerged in Michigan as a
self-anointed angel of death who helped more than 100 people end
their lives. But when he actually killed someone himself, public
sympathy ended and a jury sent him to prison.
</P>
<P>
   In Oregon, an alternative was developed with the help of the
terminally ill, their families, the legislature, the voters, the
courts and the state health bureaucracy. Oregon's Death With
Dignity Act allows a terminally ill adult _ judged by two
physicians to be of sound mind, with less than six months to live _
to request a lethal dose of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   There has been no rush to death as a result. Only 15 people
killed themselves that way in 1998, many with their families around
them. But Congress, alarmed by the Oregon example, is determined to
overturn it. The bill that passed the House masquerades as a
progressive attempt to ensure pain relief. It says that doctors may
legitimately prescribe high doses of drugs to alleviate pain, even
at ``the risk of death.'' But if the drugs should be prescribed
``for the purpose of causing death,'' then the prescribing doctor
could spend 20 years in prison. That draconian provision will
discourage aggressive pain relief, since doctors may fear they
could be charged with intent to kill whenever a patient dies from
the effects of pain medication.
</P>
<P>
   The House vote is already stirring anxiety and worry that the
Drug Enforcement Agency will be hanging over the shoulders of
physicians caring for people at the end of life. The Senate or,
failing that, President Clinton should kill this bill, and let
people deal with their own issues of life and death, in states that
permit it.

PLOT THICKENS IN SAGA OF PROPOSED ROAD TO PATRIOT'S STADIUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This soap opera in Foxborough is getting better each day. The
lastest in the home of the New England Patriots is the town filing
an action in Wrentham District Court against Joseph Lovejoy,
husband of Karen Lovejoy, leader of the dissident group who lives
on North Street that is trying to battle the proposed new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The town is asserting that the Lovejoys were illegally parking
cars on their property for money during stadium events with no
licenses or permits. Reportedly, police officers will testify that
they interviewed two people who parked their cars on the Lovejoy
property during a Patriots game and paid.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint is scheduled to be heard on Nov. 9 and the clerk
will decide whether it will go to trial. This action by the town
stings the credibility of the North Street group which is trying to
block a new access road into the parking lot at the stadium. Some
residents have apparently been parking cars illegally for years on
their property during games. Reportedly, Foxborough Police has
aerial surveillance photos showing another neighbor, also
unlicensed, with illegally parked cards on his property. This
should raise a few questions. How has this been able to go on for
years, apparently unnoticed by town officials? Some town leaders
live in the area, and apparently, never reported this illegal
activity to police. The theory is that the real reason the North
Streeters are up in arms is that their regular customers might
start parking in the stadium parking lots, and not in their
driveways.
</P>
<P>
   In the end whether the stadium is ever built will depend on two
things. First, will Patriots owner Robert Kraft make a financial
deal with the town that will make the majority of the citizens
willing to vote for it? The town will want guarantees on a specific
amount of money each year, perhaps $2 per head, compared to the
present $1.11 per head. They also want to know what will happen if
the Major League Soccer Revolution, who also play in the stadium,
go out of business, cutting back on town revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The second major issue is sewerage. The majority of the town
will want to be assured the new systems required for the new
stadium will not damage the rest of the systems across town.
Reportedly, neighboring Mansfield may expand its facility to help
out Foxborough. December will be the critical month for the stadium
vote. In the end, money and sewerage will be the big issues. Not
North Street.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Speaking of illegal activity:
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox have revoked the season tickets held by the person
who sold them via the Internet to a Connecticut doctor for $12,100
the day Pedro Martinez and Roger Clemens hooked up in the American
League Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``That person has already lost those tickets,'' said team
spokesman Kevin Shea. ``They are gone and he will not get them
back. We have also pulled the season tickets of other fans we found
reselling our tickets for profit during the season and in the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process is not over yet. We notify the season ticket-
holders in question, and give them their day in court first. Then
we take the tickets. We still have a long list to go through. More
will lose them before it is over.''
</P>
<P>
   Shea said the Sox did not eject the doctor who bought the
tickets, because they did not want to disrupt what was taking place
on the field.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hot off the presses, a survey done by the National Hockey League
office, on payroll efficiency in the league.
</P>
<P>
   The number crunchers in the league office surveyed the financial
books of all member teams, and then rated them 1 to 28, based upon
the bang for their puck. How well has the team done in recent
years, compared with how much money they spend on their players?
What a surprise. Ottawa was first, spending $220,000 for every
point earned in the standings over the last two years. The Bruins
finished second, with $273,000 a point. The Rangers were last at
$662,000 a point.
</P>
<P>
   The old dummy, Harry Sinden, the pet target of callers to a
local sports-radio show, apparently isn't so stupid in the eyes of
his peers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is quite a tribute to Harry,'' says Boston attorney Bob
Caporale of Game Plan, Inc., which has been hired to sell the
Ottawa Senators by their present owners. Caporale says there are
currently two bidders for the Senators (both from the United
States), one from the Boston area. Neither, he says, wants to move
the team out of Canada, as has been rumored.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, after 12 games last season, with Byron Dafoe in net,
the Bruins had 10 points and were in last place. This year they
have 10 points after the same number of games. The only difference
is that with Dafoe in net, the Bruins gave up six fewer goals.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How long do you think it will take Roger Clemens to announce his
retirement? Remember five years ago, when he was on cruise control
pitching for the Red Sox, he said he was only staying in the game
to play on a world champion, and if Boston was to win it all, he
would retire.
</P>
<P>
   Now that he has done that with the Yankees, being the man of his
word like he is, I'm sure he will call it a day, because we all
know, like Mo Money, he is not in the game for the money.
</P>
<P>

   Joe Gibbs, former Washington Redskins coach and now a major race
car owner, says he has been on private jets twice when cabin
pressurization became critical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm flying these small jets all the time in this (race car)
business,'' said Gibbs, speaking with friends at the memorial
service for his attorney, Robert Fraley. Fraley, US Open champion
Payne Stewart, and four others were killed this week in a plane
accident, from what officials feel was an air pressure problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twice I've been on planes when the alarms have gone off
because of pressure problems and we had to dive to get it under
control,'' said Gibbs. ``Robert and Payne weren't just as lucky as
I was. I guess their alarm system didn't work, and they never knew
what hit them.''
</P>

<P>
   Denver coach Mike Shanahan got some of the locals talking with a
decision he made at the start of the fourth period in Foxborough
last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos had just scored to cut the Patriots' lead to 5,
24-19. Shanahan opted to kick the extra point rather than attempt a
2-point conversion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had more than 14 minutes left to play in the game,'' said
Shanahan. ``We were moving the ball the second half. We had the
wind. I was confident we would get a couple of more scoring
chances, and we did. We didn't put the ball in the end zone on the
first one, and had to settle for a field goal. Then at the end, we
missed the long field goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there were 6 minutes, or 4 minutes, left in the game, and
in the same situation, I would have gone for 2. But time to me was
the key factor. We had plenty of time. Another factor was that we
were not good that day in short- yardage situations, and I didn't
like our chances on going for 2. If we had gone for 2 and missed,
and then scored a touchdown, we would have been ahead by 2, 26-24,
and they could have beaten us with a field goal. With 20 points and
we score a touchdown and go up by 3, they can't beat us with a
field goal.''
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos have not tried a 2-point play this year. Across the
league, all the teams combined have tried 35 and made just 10, a 29
percent completion rate. A year ago this time, it was 11 of 31 (36
percent). Therefore, the average in the league the last two years
indicates that two out of three times, the 2-point conversion
attempt fails.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mets pitcher Orel Hershiser, the morning after the Yankees swept
the Atlanta Braves: ``I think we took the wheels off the Braves. We
played them very hard in the series we had with them. There were a
lot of tough games, extra innings, a lot of emotion. The same thing
happened to us at the end of the year, needing to win every game or
else be eliminated. When you go through a tough stretch like that,
your team gets beat up. Our pitchers were hurting. Our regular
players were hurting. It seemed like everyone on our club had to be
treated before we could play some of those games against the
Braves, and I'm sure they were beat up for the Yankees after we
played them so hard.'' . . . When the free agency/trading period
gets under way in baseball, the Red Sox will be looking for a
slugging outfielder and a third pitcher for their starting
rotation. With contract increases on existing deals, the Sox
payroll will go up $10 million, without any new faces. But Jimy
Williams wants another starter and another big bat in the middle of
the lineup.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Memories of Payne:
</P>
<P>
   From his roommate at SMU and his best friend, Lamar Haynes.
``Our families went to Colorado on a skiing vacation one year, the
weekend before Payne had to leave for Los Angeles for his first
tournament of the year. When we finished skiing one day, we went
back to the apartment we had, and Payne pulled out a dozen new golf
balls, and his 8-iron out of his bag. I said, `what are you doing?'
He said, `I'm going to practice.' With that, he pulled back the
sliding glass doors which opened on to a little balcony, dropped
the balls on the rug, and hit the cleanest 12 8-iron shots you have
ever seen, off the rug, over the railing and up toward the
mountain. The next week I got a call, and he said to me: `Lamar, I
told you practice makes perfect. I said, `Payne, what are you
talking about?' He said, `I got a hole-in-one today with the
8-iron.''
</P>
<P>
   Memories of Payne II:
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the US Open this year Payne had promised his caddie,
Mike Hicks, he would go play in Mike's tourney in his hometown in
North Carolina the day after the Open finished,'' said Stewart's
coach, Chuck Cook, one of the top teaching pros in the country, out
of Austin, Texas. ``Payne lived up to his word, even though he won.
When it was over, he finished up with the press, and told Hicksey
to get his truck. Payne piled in the back, had a six-pack of Bud
Light, and toasted his title by drinking a few beers out of the
trophy. He didn't think it got any better than that. That's where
he preferred to be.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Say a prayer for Walter Payton. The word around the league was
the NFL's all-time leading rusher, critically ill with a liver
disease, was not expected to last the weekend.

TEARS FOR THE SERIES STRAWBERRY ALMOST MISSED AND THE MEN WHO GOT
HIM THERE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Darryl Strawberry strode to the podium at City Hall
Friday and thanked George Steinbrenner, Joe Torre, his teammates
and the fans for the support they had given him during a year in
which he was arrested in April and then suspended from baseball for
almost four months.
</P>
<P>
   After Strawberry was arrested for possession of cocaine and
solicitation of a prostitute six months ago, and subsequently
suspended by major-league baseball, there was a strong possibility
his career would be over.
</P>
<P>
   But Strawberry said one reason he navigated through those
``trials and tribulations'' to a ticker tape parade was because of
his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are very special to me,'' Strawberry said.
``Without them, I don't know if I would have made it.''
</P>
<P>
   There was passion in Strawberry's voice, and he seemed as
confident as any seasoned preacher. But after thanking the fans one
more time, Strawberry tried to thank Torre again and was
overwhelmed by his emotions. Strawberry bowed his head and began to
weep. The fans, understanding the weight of the moment after a few
seconds of silence, slowly began to cheer.
</P>
<P>
   Torre jumped from his seat, hurried over to Strawberry and
patted him on the chest the way a parent would calm a baby.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Strawberry was the focus of the parade because he was
still recovering from colon cancer and there was doubt that he
would even attend the festivities. When Strawberry did show, he was
cheered like a hero.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Strawberry was highly emotional and unable to speak for
48 seconds. With tears streaming down his face and Torre still
standing by his side, Strawberry eventually lifted his head and
half-mumbled and half-spoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd just like to say to Joe, thanks for caring for me,''
Strawberry said to his manager. ``And I love you guys.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CAN END HERE.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Neither Torre nor Strawberry was available after the ceremony,
but General Manager Brian Cashman was sitting a few feet away from
Strawberry and described the scene as gripping.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was sincere emotion and appreciation,'' Cashman said. ``It
was a great moment. For Joe especially, to know that he touches
people's hearts like that.''

 &HT;    Clinton speaks on hate crime bill, stumps for DNC in Dixie
 &HT;    By Kathey Pruitt
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ President Clinton brought his fight for stronger hate
crime laws to Atlanta on Friday, along with his ability to help
drum up financial resources for next year's elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here tonight because I believe in what we have done the
last seven years and I believe that the choices before the American
people are stark but also marvelous. We actually have a chance to
write the future of our dreams for our children,'' Clinton said at
a fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   The president, who arrived just before afternoon rush hour, was
the highlight of the $5,000 per couple fund-raiser at the home of
Democratic donor Larry Cooper. The event was expected to raise
$300,000 for the Democratic National Committee. About 7.5 percent
of the total will be returned to Democrats in Georgia for use in
races here, party leaders said.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential visit spurred curiosity and excitement in
Cooper's neighborhood. Police closed the street about 6:30 p.m.,
and it was the first indication for many neighbors that an event
was about to happen. Clinton's motorcade arrived about 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no earthly idea the president was coming here,'' said
Bob Lipman, who lives on nearby Riverly Road, where some of the
guests' cars were parked.
</P>
<P>
   Among the neighbors watching the motorcade were David Russell,
his wife, Jami Brownlee, and their two children. Kelley, their
5-year-old daughter, asked if she could go to the tony event.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll have to get out your custodial bank account and put on
your Sunday School dress, honey,'' said Russell.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the attention surrounding the fourth presidential visit
to Atlanta this year centered on his keynote remarks to the
Anti-Defamation League's annual meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is pressing a reluctant Republican Congress for an
expansion of federal hate crime statutes to cover more activities
and to include attacks on individuals because of their sexual
orientation, gender or disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Just this week he vetoed a spending measure that had been
stripped of stronger hate crime provisions. The torture-slaying of
a gay student in Wyoming last year, anti-Semitic attacks in
California, as well shootings in Indiana and Illinois this summer,
have heightened the need for enhanced penalties for crimes
committed out of hate, the president said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very important thing for our elected representatives to
say that we want special focus on these crimes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-Defamation League officials praised the president for
advocating an agenda they've pushed for 85 years. His speech to
their annual gathering, including 300 national leaders, is ``a
symbolic gesture of a commonality of goals,'' said Jay Kaiman,
southeast director of the league.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time Clinton has addressed the group as a whole
since taking office nearly eight years ago, but his support hasn't
wavered, Kaiman said. ``It's an agenda we've both been working on
together.''
</P>
<P>
   ADL leaders worry that the approaching millennium, following
attacks this summer aimed primarily at Jews _ the burning of three
synagogues in California and shootings at a Jewish community center
in Los Angeles _ may signal more violence to come. Some white
supremacy groups are predicting the turn of the century will usher
in a period of race wars and a societal breakdown, ADL leaders
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republican leaders have opposed Clinton's hate crimes
proposals. A spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott
(R-Miss.) this week said federal hate crime laws create ``the
notion that one individual is less valuable than another is, just
because of the group they belong to.''

   All that stands between Paula Kennedy and the man she loves is a
$12 million tax lien from the Internal Revenue Service. She
inherited $150,000 and one undeveloped lot on Lake Winnipesaukee,
N.H., from her mother, who died 13 years ago, but the IRS says she
and her brothers owe millions in gift and estate taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Until the case is settled, she fears that if she marries Joseph
S. Kennedy, his assets will be drawn into the case. To keep up
appearances, because they live together in Scotch Plains, N.J., she
has legally changed her name.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kennedy, 43, has good reason to be afraid. Even though she
and her brothers, Bill and Tom Boyer, 54 and 50, have cooperated
with the IRS, the agency has turned their lives into a nightmare,
going after them with a powerful tool Congress created for dealing
with major tax criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Without notice, the agency seized their bank accounts, their
paychecks and Ms. Kennedy's $7,500 bonus three years ago, using a
cudgel known as a jeopardy assessment.
</P>
<P>
   And while the IRS has vowed lately to treat taxpayers as
customers, the Boyers remain trapped in a case left over from the
old culture, in which all taxpayers were viewed with suspicion and
getting a case closed could take years.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kennedy and her brothers may well be in the wrong, and may
be victims of bad legal advice _ a review of court filings shows
that the rights and wrongs are anything but clear-cut. But they
have no money to pay any taxes, especially after incurring more
than $1 million in legal fees fighting the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the IRS will not let them go because they have one
potentially valuable asset: a malpractice claim against the lawyers
who originally handled the estate. In effect, the IRS has become a
speculative investor, hoping to profit from that litigation _ and
has refused all settlement offers.
</P>
<P>
   The agency, as its resources shrink, pursues fewer and fewer
cases, but when it does take on a case it rarely lets go. The story
of the IRS versus the Estate of Elizabeth Boyer raises questions
about how carefully it picks those targets, considering that by
pursuing this case, it has inevitably been forced to pass up
numerous more lucrative ones.
</P>
<P>
   The case also raises questions about the competence of
government lawyers, who twice had the opportunity to collect all or
most of the taxes the IRS claims are due, but let both chances slip
away.
</P>
<P>
   Tax litigators across the country, in interviews, were uniformly
critical of the IRS for using the jeopardy assessment in this case,
and most said the case illustrates how the IRS fails to close cases
that no longer have much chance of generating money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once a case is started, they are all Javerts,'' said Julian
Block, a tax lawyer in Scarsdale, N.Y., and a former IRS criminal
investigator, referring to the detective in ``Les Miserables'' who
pursued a man for decades over a stolen loaf of bread. ``There is
no one to tell them to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   And David Aughtry, an estate tax litigator with Chamberlain
Hrdlicka White Williams &AMP; Martin in Atlanta, said: ``With the IRS
you are dealing with a sleeping giant. The giant awakens and gets
excited on an individual case and its reaction is disproportionate
to both the circumstances of that case and the normal reaction of
other taxpayers.''
</P>
<P>
   The toll from the case, which has spawned eight separate court
actions, includes the failure of Tom's and Paula's first marriages
and the delay of her second. Bill and his wife, Mary Jo, say their
marriage has become strained.
</P>
<P>
   The roots of the saga go back to World War II, when Donald Boyer
married Elizabeth Skivington. They became teachers at a private
school, buying her parents' modest row house in Philadelphia, where
they lived until they died.
</P>
<P>
   They worked summers at Camp DeWitt on Lake Winnipesaukee, where
many campers were recruited by Boyer. Over the years, his children
say, his skill with boys won the favor of several wealthy
Philadelphians, who, in turn, helped the Boyers buy a growing stake
in the camp's 90 wooded acres and 5,000 feet of lakefront.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, when he was 65, Boyer retired from teaching to run Camp
DeWitt full time, but suddenly died. His widow stayed on and with
their second son, Tom, kept the camp going. She bought the last
half of Camp DeWitt in January 1984 for $430,000, with the sellers
holding the mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   The family lawyer, Albert Ciardi Jr. of Philadelphia, drew up a
plan in 1985 for Mrs. Boyer to transfer ownership of the camp to a
partnership in which she and her three children would each have a
quarter share.
</P>
<P>
   Even while his mother was alive, Tom Boyer envisioned dividing
half the camp into lots for second homes, using the profits to
start a new camp in Maine, then developing the other half.
</P>
<P>
   But Bill and Paula had other interests and wanted nothing to do
with those risky plans.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1986, Elizabeth Boyer, who was 71, grew ill,
hiding the gravity of her sickness from everyone until the last boy
left camp. She then asked Paula to drive her to the hospital, where
doctors said she was near death from cancer.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Oct. 30:
</P>
<P>
   The terrorists who assassinated several of Armenia's top
political leaders Wednesday do not appear to have been motivated
solely by the government's controversial willingness to talk peace
with its neighbor Azerbaijan over the disputed province of
Nagorno-Karabakh. A statement broadcast as a prelude to their
surrender cited a hodgepodge of grievances against Prime Minister
Vazgen Sarkisian, one of their victims, including a loss of
national pride, corruption and economic decline. The
Nagorno-Karabakh war, however, is a factor. The assassinations will
set back the peace talks. It is this war, moreover, that has kept
Armenia in misery, degrading the economy and fueling corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Nagorno-Karabakh is an Armenian enclave inside Azerbaijan. The
war broke out in 1988, when Nagorno-Karabakh sought greater
autonomy. Then in 1991 it bid for independence. Armenian soldiers
helped carve out a corridor linking the region to Armenia, and took
control of nearby Azeri villages. Fighting killed at least 30,000
people and displaced a million before a 1994 cease-fire. But the
dispute continues to cripple both countries' economies. Both spend
disproportionately on the military. A blockade of tiny Armenia by
Azerbaijan and Turkey has idled half the nation's industry.
Azerbaijan wants to develop its oil reserves, but foreign companies
are reluctant to invest or build vulnerable pipelines in an
unstable region. Also, under a 1992 American law passed largely at
the urging of the Armenian-American community, American companies
cannot get loans for drilling or construction in Azerbaijan while
the blockade continues.
</P>
<P>
   Last year when Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosian appeared
ready to make peace with Azerbaijan, Sarkisian and other
hard-liners overthrew him to prevent any compromise. But as prime
minister, Sarkisian realized that peace was the key to many of
Armenia's problems, and began talks with Azeri leaders. Many
Armenian nationalists accused him of selling out.
</P>
<P>
   The issue continues to burn because of 1915. That year, hundreds
of thousands of Armenians were killed or starved to death by
Ottoman Turks. The massacre reshaped the culture as dramatically as
did 70 years of Soviet communism. To Armenian nationalists,
negotiating with Azeris, who are ethnic Turks, is a sign of
weakness. As long as the nationalists can use violence to veto any
possible end to the war, they are dooming future generations to
suffer.

 UNDATED: from cancer.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On hearing that, Tom said, his grief was mixed with panic: in
his desk were the unsigned papers to carry out the plan for the
partnership. Tom took the papers to the hospital, where his mother,
delirious from painkillers, signed them moments before she lapsed
into a coma. She died 10 days later.
</P>
<P>
   Then Tom took the papers to a New Hampshire real estate lawyer,
Rod Dyer, to file at the courthouse. Dyer said he told Tom he
needed to check with Ciardi on whether, for tax reasons, it would
be wise to file the papers or to let the property remain in his
mother's estate. Tom has testified that the worst thing he could
imagine would be for his mother to die without executing that plan.
</P>
<P>
   Tom then called Ciardi, who was not in, and spoke to a junior
lawyer, Paul J. Winterhalter, who, Tom recounted, said that he knew
nothing of the matter but that if Ciardi had said to proceed, he
should proceed.
</P>
<P>
   Dyer, his warnings overruled, filed the papers giving
three-fourths of Camp DeWitt to the Boyer siblings.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the camp was a gift or in the estate had enormous tax
implications. When a gift is made, the recipients inherit the price
originally paid, or ``cost basis,'' and when the property is sold
owe taxes on the entire capital gain. But when property passes
through an estate, the basis is the value at the time of death.
</P>
<P>
   In dealing with the IRS, the siblings proceeded as if the
property were in the estate, but in trying to develop the property
they acted as if their mother had completed the gift. The family
says this was all done on Ciardi's advice. In court papers, Ciardi
said he had simply done what the Boyers wanted, and was not
responsible for their many mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Estate tax experts said the gift could have been undone by
Ciardi in the months after the papers were filed, which might have
gone a long way to ease the fight with the IRS. Repeated attempts
to interview Ciardi on that point were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   The Boyers said Ciardi told them he was taking care of
everything and not to worry, and they trusted his judgment.
</P>
<P>
   In the first three years after their mother died, Paula and Bill
largely left Tom to work with Ciardi. Paula said she had heard
there were problems, but nothing unusual.
</P>
<P>
   Paula and Bill kept their distance from the risky development
project, which they say Ciardi urged on Tom. To get out of the
estate, each agreed to accept a waterfront lot, $150,000 and a
promise of $500,000 later if the development went well.
</P>
<P>
   Tom, who never reopened the camp, then took out a $2.5 million
mortgage at First N.H. White Mountain Bank, paying Paula and Bill
out of the proceeds. Court records show that the bank required none
of the usual documentation and took Tom's cash-flow projections
from lot sales and rewrote them to make the loan look like a great
deal for the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Nine months after Mrs. Boyer died, her estate tax return was
due. Ciardi, in letters, proposed setting the camp's value at
double the price paid for the last half, or $860,000. Tom Boyer
said that at Ciardi's urging, he got an appraisal that
substantiated the $860,000 valuation.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ciardi had settled Donald Boyer's estate, he was not an
estate or tax specialist, so he sought advice from another lawyer,
Byron Prusky of Philadelphia, a former IRS agent who in letters
generally approved the plan, provided the $860,000 appraisal was
valid.
</P>
<P>
   Ciardi prepared Elizabeth Boyer's estate tax return using that
value, ignoring a requirement that an appraisal be based on using
the land in the most lucrative way possible.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, the IRS came up with its own valuation of $4.9 million,
its estimate of the retail value of all the potential lots. This
valuation ignored the speculative nature and cost of development.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Boyer sent his siblings a note that began: ``Bad news, the
estate owes IRS some $3.9 million!'' _ $1.4 million in taxes and
the rest interest and penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Estate tax specialists said that with good planning any estate
tax could have been avoided, noting that the Boyers never could
have realized $4.9 million because of the costs of preparing the
site for sale. In one court case, a judge valued the estate at $2.7
million, a figure that two experts, in interviews, said was more
than twice the number that might have passed muster with the IRS
given careful planning.
</P>
<P>
   Other experts pointed to another issue: each sibling held a
minority share of an illiquid asset.
</P>
<P>
   ``These lawyers never heard of `undivided minority interest'?''
asked Shannon Pratt, publisher of Shannon Pratt's Business
Valuation Update, a newsletter widely read by estate lawyers. The
IRS routinely grants discounts of up to 40 percent for such
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Boyer's note about the IRS's demand for $3.9 million came
just as the Northeast real estate market slumped. The lots did not
sell quickly enough to cover the mortgage payments, and the project
headed toward foreclosure.
</P>
<P>
   Paula and her first husband, a lawyer, who lived outside
Philadelphia, decided the family needed a new lawyer, and in 1993,
six years after Elizabeth Boyer died, she and her brothers settled
on Thomas W. Ostrander at Duane, Morris &AMP; Heckscher in
Philadelphia.

MILUTINOVIC IS LEAVING METROSTARS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Germany)  (rk) 
 By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After a calamitous season as the worst team in Major
League Soccer, the New York-New Jersey MetroStars and Bora
Milutinovic agreed to part ways Friday, leaving the team with the
task of hiring its sixth coach since it started play in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Clavijo, an assistant coach and a friend of
Milutinovic, has been named the interim coach and will be
considered for the head coaching job, according to Charlie
Stillitano, the MetroStars' vice president and general manager.
Clavijo said Friday he had also been interviewed by New England for
the head coaching job with the Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Stillitano, the only general manager in the MetroStars' history,
indicated Friday that the team's next coach would be someone who
understands the way the league operates and allocates players to
the teams. Milutinovic often expressed frustration that he could
not choose his own players.
</P>
<P>
   The MetroStars finished the season with a 7-25 record, the worst
in the league, and scored only 32 goals.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Clavijo, a native of Uruguay who has been in the
United States for 20 years, Stillitano also mentioned college
coaches Dave Masur of St. John's and Bob Reasso of Rutgers as
candidates. The other name mentioned was John Ellinger, currently
the coach of the under-17 U.S. men's national team that will play
in the world championship in New Zealand that starts Nov. 10.
</P>
<P>
   Though Milutinovic did not return phone calls Friday, he
released a statement through the team. ``My only regret is that we
were unable to meet the objectives that both the team and I had in
mind when we started this project,'' the statement read. ``I wish
Stuart Subotnick, Charlie Stillitano, the players and their great
fans the very best in their goal of making the team successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Subotnick is the partner of John Kluge with Metromedia, , which
operates the team. He makes the final decisions for the MetroStars
and is also the chairman of the league's Board of Governors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't reach his expectations,'' Stillitano said of
Milutinovic, who has coached Mexico, Costa Rica, the United States
and Nigeria in the World Cup since 1986. ``We looked at each other
at the end, like husband and wife, and we decided there was no
sense to continue.''
</P>
<P>
   The expected arrival of Lothar Matthaeus may also have
influenced Milutinovic's decision. The German superstar has been
telling the German news media that he wouldn't mind coaching the
MetroStars one day.
</P>
<P>
   Stillitano said Clavijo will start working with the players on
Monday in off-season training and he expected to name Milutinovic's
replacement within the next three weeks.

EDITORIAL: A CONTRACT FOR PRINCIPALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Oct. 30:
</P>
<P>
   One of the most debilitating problems faced by New York City's
school system is its inability to keep good principals and dismiss
bad ones. Suburban schools routinely lure away some of the city's
most talented school administrators by offering higher salaries
with fewer headaches. And underperforming principals in New York
are protected from removal by an outdated tenure agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The city's 1,200 school principals have been working without a
contract since 1996. Protracted negotiations have now produced what
looks like a workable trade-off on these key issues. The principals
have been promised a 33 percent raise, much of it immediately, if
they give up tenure, which would allow the city to hold them
accountable for their schools' performance. Although it is still
too early to celebrate a deal, under this proposal the schools
chancellor could hire principals on contract, with yearly
evaluations to help weed out those who fail.
</P>
<P>
   Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
understandably need to be able to make changes at the top of
schools swiftly. The present system contains a lengthy process that
makes it too hard to get rid of a tenured principal. Both sides
appear ready to shorten that process to a workable 60 days, with a
principal's final appeal going to the state education commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining question is how to treat a principal who was an
excellent teacher or administrator before failing at a job that
requires different skills. The city and the union should both find
a way to allow talented educators to return to the jobs they did
well. Without such a system, it could become increasingly difficult
for the chancellor to persuade good teachers to try their hand at
being principals.
</P>
<P>
   If negotiators for the city and the principals' union can find
an accommodation, principals could get a pay boost immediately.
Nobody in New York City wins by keeping bad principals in their
jobs while good ones take their talents to the suburbs. &QL;

BERNIE WILLIAMS CONSIDERS SURGERY FOR SHOULDER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The throbbing in his shoulder persisted for more than
four months, but Bernie Williams played through it, finishing the
regular season with a .342 batting average and 115 runs batted in
and performing spectacularly on defense in the postseason. But now
he can rest, and Williams, the Yankees' center fielder, wants to
have his injured left shoulder taken care of immediately.
</P>
<P>
   While waiting for the buses to leave Yankee Stadium for the
parade up Broadway Friday, Williams said that he expected to
undergo more tests next week and that if surgery was necessary it
would take place as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Williams initially injured his shoulder while attempting a
diving catch in June, and the resulting inflammation affected his
swing from time to time, especially when he batted right-handed.
</P>
<P>
   In the postseason, Williams said, his shoulder ``felt good _
good enough, and I was going to play.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly wasn't 100 percent,'' he added. ``I was under
anti-inflammatories and painkillers and things like that, and I was
able to pull through, but that's not the way I want to keep
playing. If there is something wrong there, I want to get it fixed.
I have a lot of time to recover.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said during the season that there was a possibility
that doctors would perform arthroscopic surgery in an attempt to
identify the source of his discomfort and that if more work was
necessary it could be done then. In any event, Yankees officials
expect Williams to be ready to play by the start of spring training
in February.
</P>
<P>
   At last year's victory parade, fans implored Williams, who was
about to become a free agent, to remain with the Yankees, and
Williams turned toward the team's principal owner, George
Steinbrenner, and said the fans would have to talk to Steinbrenner.
</P>
<P>
   Williams ultimately signed a seven-year, $87.5 million contract
with the Yankees _ after Albert Belle rejected an offer from the
Yankees that would have ended talks with Williams _ and at Friday's
celebration, Williams thanked Steinbrenner for allowing him to stay
with the franchise.

INVESTIGATORS SAY INQUIRY ON BANK OF NEW YORK STALLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ More than a year after the federal authorities
began their investigation at the Bank of New York, law enforcement
officials say the global money laundering inquiry has bogged down
and may never be solved unless Russia or other countries help U.S.
prosecutors crack the case.
</P>
<P>
   Investigative leads have reached into Russia and about 50 other
countries, the officials said. The dimensions have forced U.S.
investigators to seek assistance from hundreds of foreign law
enforcement organizations, not all of them friendly, which operate
under wildly conflicting laws and procedures. All that has slowed
an already plodding investigation, they said.
</P>
<P>
   With the investigative trails growing cold, federal
investigators must rely on the Russian law enforcement authorities
to help them find the source of about $7 billion transferred to the
Bank of New York from a handful of Russian banks. So far, law
enforcement officials from the two countries have spent less time
chasing possible suspects than they have in the tedious work of
translating U.S. bank records from English into Russian.
</P>
<P>
   To bring a money laundering case in a U.S. court, prosecutors
must show that the funds were ill-gotten gains from specific
crimes. With little to show for their efforts, the officials said
the outcome of the case was far from clear and the prospect of
money-laundering prosecutions by no means certain.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of progress has underscored the difficulty in bringing
a money laundering case and the inadequacies of governmental
mechanisms to combat abuses of the global banking system.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to jump-start the inquiry, the government has
increased the pressure on several suspects, unsealing an indictment
this month that accused three people of relatively minor offenses,
not including money laundering, in an attempt to secure their
cooperation. But those efforts have failed to yield tangible
results so far, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The federal authorities in New York have issued arrest warrants
for the three people charged in the earlier indictment: Lucy
Edwards, a former Bank of New York executive; her husband, Peter
Berlin, who opened several suspect accounts at the Bank of New
York, and Aleksey Volkov, an associate of Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Edwards and Berlin are thought to be in London. Volkov is
believed to be in Russia. Their lawyers have not discussed the
case, although a London-based lawyer for Ms. Edward has said she
did nothing wrong. The Bank of New York has not been accused of any
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the case is the most extensive money laundering
inquiry ever mounted by the FBI, officials say they have little
concrete information about how much of the money that flowed
through the Bank of New York represented the illegal proceeds of
Russian organized crime activities like drug trafficking, extortion
or fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are examining evidence unearthed by the Italian
authorities, who found that Russian gangs operating in northern
Italy had used accounts at the Bank of New York to transfer several
million dollars out of Russia. Moreover, a small part of the money,
about $300,000, may have been the ransom from a kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, the case has been assigned to the FSB, an
organization with law enforcement and counterintelligence
responsibilities that grew out of the KGB, the former Soviet spy
agency. FSB officials have expressed their willingness to
aggressively investigate the case, but some United States officials
remain skeptical.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The relationship between U.S. law enforcement and its Russian
counterparts remains delicate. The FBI has worked effectively with
the Russian authorities in some cases. But FBI officials have been
reluctant to criticize the Russians or to push too hard for fear of
a backlash by the Russian authorities, defensive about accusations
that their country is awash in corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators speculated that a substantial portion of the funds
were moved out of Russia to avoid heavy taxes or the vagaries of
volatile economy or to invest in the West, in ways that are not
prosecutable. The mingling of legal and illegal funds would
frustrate federal prosecutors trying to bring a money laundering
case who must show that specific funds represented the gains of a
criminal enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators, sifting records of more than 85,000 transactions
monitored by Federal agents, have made little progress in their
attempt to determine the source of the money, an estimated $7
billion that flowed through nine suspect accounts in the three
years before the federal authorities froze the accounts in August.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin first opened an account in 1996 in the name of a company
named Benex at the Wall Street headquarters of the Bank of New
York. The account and another in the name of a company called Becs
International were part of electronic pipeline through which
Russian companies pumped millions of dollars a day.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin's wife, Ms. Edwards, was a senior official at the bank
who rose to the executive ranks by her aggressive courting of
Russian clients. The customers who used Berlin's accounts varied
widely, the officials said, but they contend that some were tied to
Russian racketeers who acted to spirit profits out of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   But following the money has proven a particularly tedious
effort.
</P>
<P>
   Funds that investigators suspect may have originated from
organized crime elements in Moscow appear to have been funneled
through several countries, and in some cases may have been
subdivided into multiple accounts before reaching New York.
Sometimes, the funds were mingled with money in several accounts,
blurring its origins.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI did not enter the case until it was asked to investigate
the accounts as part of an extortion-kidnapping case involving
Russian organized crime. Officials said investigators immediately
suspected that the accounts were being manipulated. For instance,
funds were rapidly deposited in accounts and then withdrawn, a
practice known as a rollover that may point to laundering.
</P>
<P>
   The amount that swirled through the bank was a daunting sum. But
overall the funds represented a minuscule fraction of the trillions
of dollars transferred around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like trying to sort out individual drops of water from
Niagara Falls,'' an investigator said. ``And we don't own the
river.''

 &HT;    Judge seals grand jury report on inmate Valdes' death
 &HT;    By Beth Kassab and Jenny Staletovich
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Fla. _ A grand jury reviewing the July beating
death of Death Row inmate Frank Valdes took action Friday, but a
judge immediately sealed its work, citing the ``unique
circumstances of this case.''
</P>
<P>
   Maintaining the silence that has surrounded the case since
Valdes died, Alachua County Judge Stan Morris returned it to
criminal court in Bradford County.
</P>
<P>
   Morris also sealed four tapes and two transcripts reviewed by
the 21-member grand jury. Nine guards have been on paid leave
pending its findings.
</P>
<P>
   State Attorney Rod Smith declined to comment, but speculation
spread quickly that grand jurors had issued criminal charges and
arrests will follow. Jurors could have also written a report
outlining their findings. In the past, grand juries have issued
scathing reports when they found a state agency, not just its
employees, at fault.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, several state officials, including two Florida
Department of Law Enforcement investigators, and one of the guards'
former wives were ushered into the grand jury room. Ericka Lewis
testified for just over 20 minutes, presumably about Sgt. Andrew
Lewis. The couple divorced in 1996 and Andrew Lewis was given
primary custody of their two children.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I want to say is innocent until proven guilty,'' she said
as she left.
</P>
<P>
   The case was moved to Alachua County after Smith argued that too
many residents of Bradford County, home to Florida State Prison,
work in a prison or are related to employees.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes, 36, died when he fought guards trying to search his
cell. The guards said they tried to subdue him with mace and pepper
spray, then sent a five-man extraction team into his cell with a
shield with a stun gun.
</P>
<P>
   The guards and a nurse said Valdes received minor scratches and
bruises and later inflicted fatal injuries on himself by jumping
from cell bars. An autopsy showed he every rib broken, collapsed
lungs and boot marks on his body.
</P>
<P>
   After the July 17 death, the FDLE, and later the FBI, began an
intense investigation. Corrections investigators are also
scrutinizing the guards' actions. Over the years, inmates have
repeatedly complained about the guards. Sgt. Montrez Lucas was
suspended for 60 days in 1995 after a fight with inmates at another
prison. Sgt. Jason Griffis was reprimanded in 1996 for kicking a
wheelchair-bound 62-year-old inmate. Capt. Timothy Thornton, their
supervisor, was arrested twice on battery and assault charges. One
of the charges was dropped and Thornton pleaded guilty to
misdemeanor assault on the other. His wife also complained of
domestic assault and tried to obtain a restraining order but
failed.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Corrections also came under criticism for the
way it ran X-wing. Valdes, convicted of killing Glades County
Correctional guard Fred Griffis in 1987, was on the wing for more
than two years before his death. While his record reflected a
violent, difficult inmate, critics said X-wing did little to
improve his condition and probably worsened it.
</P>
<P>
   Moving the case to Bradford County does not bode well, said
Peter Siegel of the Florida Justice Institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is criminal indictments and it's tried in Bradford
County,'' he said, ``I think everybody's probably wasting their
time.''

 UNDATED: in Philadelphia.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ostrander wrote the IRS that from the sale of the two waterfront
lots owned by Paula and Bill and other assets of the estate he
could raise $765,000.
</P>
<P>
   He calculated that if the IRS appraisal were adjusted to reflect
what the Boyers might have netted _ he proposed $2.7 million,
matching the figure the judge set three years later _ the estate
tax would come to $750,000. He said the penalties were sure to be
canceled because the Boyers relied on legal counsel at all times.
</P>
<P>
   Ostrander also made an observation that proved remarkably
prescient. If his offer was rejected, he wrote, protracted
litigation was sure to ensue and the $765,000 would be paid to him
as fees, which would ``very substantially reduce (and perhaps
eliminate) the funds available'' to pay taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS rejected the offer, and within a few years Ostrander did
in fact collect all of the $765,000. He has since billed the Boyers
for several hundred thousand dollars more, which they have been
unable to pay.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS is barred from discussing an individual case. Charles O.
Rossotti, the commissioner of Internal Revenue, and other IRS
officials listened to a reporter's recounting of the case, but none
would comment, even on questions about how the IRS uses its
litigation resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``By law, we can't talk about it and we won't,'' said Don
Roberts, an IRS spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, litigation was under way over the mortgage. Under tax
law, if the camp was a gift the bank was entitled to be paid before
the IRS, but if the land was in the estate the IRS claim took
precedence.
</P>
<P>
   The government might have collected more than $1 million from
the sale of lots had it taken a firm position that Mrs. Boyer had
not made the gift before she died. The government has still not
decided whether it is due tax on a gift or an estate, but a federal
judge ruled that the land was a gift, at least in her courtroom. So
again the government got nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Ostrander, the family's new lawyer, kept trying to settle for
six years while also filing the Boyers' malpractice claim against
Ciardi, Winterhalter and Prusky.
</P>
<P>
   The malpractice claim is not for the taxes owed, but for any
interest and penalties, for advice that led to the fight with the
IRS and for advice on a ``doomed project'' to develop the property,
wiping out most of each sibling's inheritance.
</P>
<P>
   All three lawyers deny any liability. Prusky said in court
papers that his advice was limited by what Ciardi had told him and
that he had nothing to do with setting the value at $860,000.
Winterhalter said he acted properly and had only peripheral
involvement.
</P>
<P>
   In an added twist, the malpractice case was to go to trial
months ago, but has been delayed at least until December because
the company that insured all three lawyers is itself in financial
trouble and operating under the supervision of regulators.
</P>
<P>
   If and when that case goes to trial, years of appeals may
follow, and the IRS has shown no sign that it plans to settle with
the Boyers until those appeals are complete.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Boyer, who like his father is a football coach at a private
school, lives alone now in a tiny ground-floor apartment in Basking
Ridge, N.J. As he was recounting the last 13 years in an interview
he broke into tears _ sobbing at how his chance at getting rich was
gone but more, he said, over the failure of his marriage. ``I made
a mistake because I didn't understand,'' he said, ``and the IRS
just keeps punishing me and punishing me and it seems like this
will go on until I die.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kennedy says Tom ``is a broken man,'' adding, ``Bill has not
done much better.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kennedy has struggled to make lemonade. She studied taxes
and investing and became a personal financial planner.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS has seized none of her money since 1996, but if she puts
any away, the agency could seize it later as part of any
settlement. ``I live this bizarre life,'' she said, telling people
``to be thrifty and invest for their retirement. But because any
assets I acquire will be taken by the government, I own nothing but
my clothes and furniture. I can't save for retirement. I can, and
do, buy nice clothes, go out to dinner in restaurants and have even
gone on great vacations, the very things I tell clients to
postpone.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the case began, she said, ``I was just another Main Line
housewife with sweaters and wool skirts and pearls doing nothing of
consequence. This case has made me a better person. I just wish I
didn't have to go through this. I just wish it was over.''

DOZENS MORE FROM SECT ARRESTED IN BEIJING 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Dozens more followers of the banned Falun Gong
spiritual movement were detained Friday on Tiananmen Square, a few
of them dragged away shouting, in the fifth straight day of
protests while hundreds and perhaps thousands of fugitive believers
were said to remain hidden around the city.
</P>
<P>
   On previous days, most of those detained on the giant public
square were middle-aged and elderly people from out of town, who
meekly allowed police to lead them to buses and jail. But Friday,
police had to tackle and drag away some younger, shouting adherents
who had gathered in an attempt to deliver a letter to political
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   All week an eerie, nearly invisible drama played out on the
square that is the country's symbolic center _ crowded throughout
with plainclothes police officers and hordes of unknowing Chinese
and foreign tourists. While surveillance was stepped up at airports
and train stations, the city's life appeared on the surface to be
normal.
</P>
<P>
   Each day this week, clusters of Falun Gong practitioners, mostly
from other provinces and often identifiable, amid more affluent
tourists, in their slightly dowdy clothes and tennis shoes,
appeared on Tiananmen Square with seemingly little more purpose
than to be detained. It was a bewildered response, perhaps, to the
way their most ordinary lives have been overturned since July 22,
when the government outlawed as an ``evil cult'' the movement that
millions of Chinese consider a path to salvation.
</P>
<P>
   As they detained hundreds on Tiananmen Square, the police also
spent the week combing other parts of Beijing for unwelcome
visitors. This week they detained more than 3,000 people, coming
from every part of China but Tibet, a party official told the
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Falun Gong, which was developed in 1992 by a former clerk named
Li Hongzhi, combines elements of Buddhism, Taoism and traditional
Chinese notions of cosmic forces in the body. It offers an approach
to clean living as well as physical exercises said to bring health
and happiness, and somehow it struck a chord in China, spreading
rapidly around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Before the crackdown by authorities who charge that Falun Gong
aims to subvert society and exploit the gullible, millions of
Chinese had been practicing its slow-motion exercises daily, often
in groups in public parks.
</P>
<P>
   Many merely sampled it, but for those who truly believed they
were invoking supernatural powers to fend off disease, Falun Gong
became something more intense than a hobby, sometimes causing
friction within families.
</P>
<P>
   Though members insist that the group is not political, the
Communist government is clearly frightened by its deep appeal and
obvious ability to mobilize believers. So it has tried to stamp out
the movement by imprisoning top leaders and vilifying the founder,
Li, as a charlatan. Li himself _ whose every word is gospel to
believers _ is out of reach, in exile in New York.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Communist Party members and g workers were barred from
practicing Falun Gong on risk of dismissal, and all followers were
warned to avoid public displays of support.
</P>
<P>
   But the same government that calls this a dangerous cult seems
to have badly underestimated the fervor of its more dedicated
followers, who have persisted in their faith through threats and
detentions and now pose an embarrassing problem.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, group members say, thousands of adherents _
people who until a few months ago were considered upright citizens
_ streamed into Beijing, some of them sleeping in makeshift
quarters under bridges and in construction sites. Most say they are
afraid to return to their home towns, where they are likely to be
arrested or hounded by the police.
</P>
<P>
   The out-of-towners have linked up with Beijing practitioners of
the movement, including well-educated professionals who communicate
with each other and supporters abroad by e-mail and cellular
phones. Members were even able to organize a clandestine meeting
with foreign journalists in Beijing on Thursday to tell the outside
world about intensifying repression.
</P>
<P>
   The trial of at least one leader, Xu Xinmu, a former government
official in Hebei province, may start as early as next week, a
human rights monitor in Hong Kong said. Xu faces a long prison term
for allegedly leaking a secret document concerning strategies for
suppressing Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
   In talks here with Chinese foreign policy officials over the
past two days, Thomas Pickering, the U.S. undersecretary of state
for political affairs, said he specifically raised concerns about
the crackdown on Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made it very clear with respect to Falun Gong in particular
that we believe the peaceful rights to freedom of religion, freedom
of assembly and of speech and of access to the press are all very,
very important and need to be protected,'' Pickering said at a news
conference Friday.

CELL IMPLANTS FOR PARKINSON'S ARE READY FOR HUMAN TESTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A new brain implant therapy for Parkinson's disease
that doesn't rely on human or animal fetal tissue has shown such
promising early results in monkeys that researchers plan to try it
soon in humans.
</P>
<P>
   In seven monkeys with a drug-induced form of Parkinson's, the
cell implants resulted in an improvement in each animal that varied
from 44 percent to 90 percent within three months.
</P>
<P>
   Richard C. Allen of Titan Pharmaceuticals Inc., which developed
the therapy, said last week he believes it can bring about
``long-term, significant restoration of function'' using implants
of ``readily available human cells'' that could be stored frozen
and used as an off-the-shelf product.
</P>
<P>
   The cells are dopamine-producing cells that form a pigmented
layer in the retina of the human eye. Why retina cells produce
dopamine, the substance lacking in Parkinson's, is not known. The
cells can be obtained from donor eyes at organ banks and then grown
and multiplied in the lab. For implanting, the cells are deposited
on the surface of tiny gelatin spheres _ they are barely visible to
the naked eye _ and hundreds of thousands of spheres are injected
into the patient's brain. The cell product is called Spheramine.
</P>
<P>
   One donor eye could provide enough cells to perform thousands of
implants, said Allen. And, unlike implants of human or animal fetal
cells, the Spheramine cells are not attacked by immune cells in the
brain. Exactly why that is hasn't been determined for certain, said
Allen.
</P>
<P>
   The Spheramine results were presented last week at a meeting
here of companies developing tissue engineering and ``regenerative
medicine'' products. The meeting was sponsored by TechVest LLC, an
investment research firm.
</P>
<P>
   The Spheramine clinical trials will be car ried out at Emory
University School of Medicine in Atlanta. Dr. Ray Watts, an Emory
neurologist, said Friday that the animal studies, in which he is
involved, have shown a ``very prominent'' improvement. He said it
is too soon to predict the eventual role of Spheramine in
Parkinson's disease.
</P>
<P>
   More than 500,000 people in America have Parkinson's, including
US Attorney General Janet Reno and actor Michael J. Fox.
</P>
<P>
   The disease results from the death of brain cells that produce
dopamine, a key chemical messenger needed for smooth and
coordinated movement. Symptoms usually begin in middle age or
beyond: they include tremors of the hands and, as the disease
progresses, slowed movement, balance and gait difficulties, rigid
extremities, and profound disability.
</P>
<P>
   Medication that provides dopamine to the brain can keep symptoms
under control for a few years, but eventually the drugs lose much
of their effect. In the 1990s, surgeons have experimented with
implanting dopamine-producing nerve cells into the brain, in hopes
the nerves would take root and pump out a constant supply of
dopamine.
</P>
<P>
   This strategy requires fetal cells that can adapt to their new
environment. Implants of human fetal cells are likely to have a
limited role because they present ethical issues, and because
aborted fetuses would not provide a large enough supply for the
expected demand.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, implants have been carried out with fetal pig cells. A
Charlestown company, Diacrin, Inc., has been developing the pig
system and its president and CEO, Thomas H. Fraser, reported on its
progress at the tissue engineering conference.
</P>
<P>
   Fraser said that in a study of 11 implant patients who got a low
dose of pig cells there was an average of 20 percent improvement in
symptoms. Three patients have had ``spectacular recoveries,'' he
said, while three remained at their pre-treatment level of
disability, and the other five were ``somewhere in between.''
</P>
<P>
   It takes about 16 fetal pigs to provide enough nerve cells for a
transplant, Fraser said. The cells have to be used almost
immediately. By contrast, the Spheramine system allows cells to be
frozen and kept indefinitely, and does not require raising large
animals, as the Diacrin effort does.
</P>
<P>
   Watts, at Emory, is involved in research for Diacrin as well as
the Spheramine experiments. At this point, he said, ``I don't think
you can say yet whether one is more effective or more promising
than the other.''

 &HT;    Bowman composes theme for new CBS morning show
 &HT;    By Bob Batz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ When the theme song plays to kick off Monday's
premiere episode of CBS' ``The Early Show,'' it should be
accompanied by an on-screen message that says, ``This music was
made in Dayton, Ohio.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Early Show,'' hosted by Bryant Gumbel and Jayne Clayson,
will air Monday through Friday. The show's theme _ an upbeat,
contemporary tune called ``Sunrise'' _ was composed by Dayton
musician Chris Bowman.
</P>
<P>
   The 39-year-old Bowman plans to be in front of his TV set when
``The Early Show'' debuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watch television often because I'm interested in the music
they use on movies and sitcoms, and I'll definitely be watching
Monday because this is something really personal _ and I'm
excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowman, a guitarist/composer, is a Dayton native. As lead
guitarist for the band Buck Naked, he has accompanied such local
performers as jazz bassist Larry ``Hump'' Humphrey and pop singer
Melanie Moore.
</P>
<P>
   He sent his recording of Sunrise to the producers of ``The Early
Show'' after reading a story in the newspaper that said they were
still putting together the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just figured they didn't have a theme song yet, so I sent
them mine,'' he explains. ``It wasn't anything unusual for me,
because I've been submitting music to record companies for years. I
usually don't even hear back from them. But this time it was
different. It was a one-in-a-million shot, like hitting the
lottery. They liked what I sent.''
</P>
<P>
   When Bowman got a phone call from the director of ``The Early
Show,'' the musician thought somebody was pulling his leg.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured one of my friends was playing a practical joke on
me, so when the director told me Bryant Gumbel was interested in my
song, I was skeptical,'' he recalls. ``I asked him, `Who is this
again?' But, then he explained, and I realized this was the real
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowman, who plays all the instruments on his recording of
``Sunrise,'' says the song ``grabs the feel of a morning show.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It runs a little over four minutes, and I tried to make it
something that's easy to listen to,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Gumbel praised ``Sunrise.'' ``Out of the hundreds of (entries),
Chris Bowman's work clearly stood out and compared favorably with
the best efforts of established professionals. I'm happy for him
and glad his taste fits ours so nicely.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS has tweaked Bowman's tune.

   ``As I understand it, they plan to use about a minute of the
music at the beginning of every show, and about two minutes during
the closing credits,'' he says. ``The network has an arranger, and
he has done some variations to the melody so it can be used at
other times during the show. For example, if Bryant is doing a
segment in, say, Mexico City, ``Sunrise'' will get a Latin beat.''
</P>
<P>
   As he awaits the debut of ``The Early Show,'' Bowman will
continue putting finishing touches on a 10-song solo album that
will include Sunrise. ``It should be done in two or three weeks,
then I'll start looking for a record company to produce it,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   He hopes exposure on network television will lead to bigger
things.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal is to do more theme songs for TV ... and I'd love to
do movie scores, too,'' he says.

A BLOCK PARTY FOR THE YANKEES, BUT NO TIME TO REST ON LAURELS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Nineteen black, blue and white buses noisily steered
away from Yankee Stadium Friday, the beginning of a caravan that
took the Yankees to the ticker tape parade and another World Series
celebration. The Yankees have been in this enviable setting before,
so they knew this delightful routine even with their eyes at
half-staff.
</P>
<P>
   Pick up your new Yankee jacket from a clubhouse attendant, find
out the bus to which you have been assigned, arrive in Battery
Park, get on one of the six floats for you and your family and
coast up Broadway for what should be the ride of a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   With these incredible Yankees, what is supposedly a
once-in-a-lifetime experience happens almost every Halloween. Two
straight championships and two straight parades, three titles in
four years and three parades in four years, three extremely rare
experiences in the time it takes to earn a college degree.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees reveled in their wondrous day. Several players
videotaped the sea of fans. George Steinbrenner was animated while
he shook a broom to signify the four-game sweep of the Atlanta
Braves. David Cone wore a cap reading ``NYPD,'' and when the fans
chanted, ``One more year, one more year,'' imploring him to remain
with the Yankees, he raised two fingers and playfully asked, ``How
about two more years?''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Girardi used a similar negotiating tactic. He reminded
Steinbrenner that last year, when the Yankees surprised him by
exercising their option to keep him in 1999 for $3.4 million,
Steinbrenner had told him that three out of four is better than two
out of three. Friday, Girardi turned to Steinbrenner and said that
four out of five ain't bad.
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Strawberry provided the most emotional scene when he
lowered his head and wept as he tried to thank Joe Torre.
Strawberry stayed speechless for 48 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like the commercial says, there are some things money can't
buy,'' Tino Martinez said. ``Days like this are priceless.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a warm and fuzzy block party in a city of 8 million, a
chance for the Yankees to bask in what they have done. But the
Yankees know that the expectations have escalated now. Fans
chanted, ``Three-peat, Three-peat'' at City Hall. That term has
been in mothballs since Michael Jordan stopped dribbling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's relax with the repeat,'' Torre told the fans. ``Give us
a couple of days to enjoy this.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, Joe. Time is up. The onus will be on the Yankees to do it
again, which is only natural and is a probable scenario. The
Yankees reiterated that they are the premier team in baseball by
barreling through the postseason like a sled down a slick mountain,
and even though they will tweak their roster, they should be
favored to win another title. They should win it.
</P>
<P>
   Forget who might depart and focus on who will return. The
Yankees will have their four finest players back in Derek Jeter,
Bernie Williams, Orlando Hernandez and Mariano Rivera. They have
solid talent in Chuck Knoblauch, Martinez, Scott Brosius, Jeff
Nelson and probably Paul O'Neill, young talent in Andy Pettitte,
Jorge Posada, Ricky Ledee and Ramiro Mendoza and emerging talent in
Alfonso Soriano, Ed Yarnall and D'Angelo Jimenez. No matter who
departs, the Yankees should be equipped to repeat their feat again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's plausible to think about, especially because of how much
talent is in the system,'' Cone said. ``It's amazing because not
that many teams can even talk about this.''
</P>
<P>
   So the pressure on the Yankees resumes today, if it did not
already start Friday night. Can you do it again? That is a question
that will hound the Yankees until next October.
</P>
<P>
   ``We answered that same question last year about whether we
could get two in a row so, sure, it's possible,'' O'Neill said.
``This team is accustomed to winning and afraid of the results of
losing.''
</P>
<P>
   Afraid of losing. It was a revealing way for O'Neill to describe
why the Yankees win and can win. They have been so used to winning
that they despise the queasy feelings they get from losing. O'Neill
discussed the stinging loss to the Cleveland Indians in the 1997
division series as if it had transpired Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of another title was already being discussed in the
clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I've thought about it,'' Jeter said. ``People were
asking us, `How can you get better?' The only way to get better is
to win. You can't do anything to top this unless you win.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The team will have a different look. Despite Cone's admission
that he has proposals for the Yankees, which probably include the
idea of a contract that is incentive-based, there is no guarantee
he will return. Either Roger Clemens or Cone will probably not be
with the team because the Yanks want to add the inexpensive rookie
Yarnall to the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Cone said he was ``anxiously waiting'' to hear from the Yankees,
and Clemens conceded that he should have listened when Steinbrenner
tried to sign him before the 1997 season. Steinbrenner has been
slow in exercising O'Neill's $6.5 million option for next year, but
he probably will. Girardi is a dark horse to return. Strawberry,
Allen Watson and Mike Stanton should be back.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   When players arrived in the Bronx, they saw that Steinbrenner
already had workers paint 1999 Champions on the Stadium, with room
to eventually paint 2000, too. That is what the Yankees want and
what they should get for a third straight year.

POLITICAL STANDOFF DERAILS TRADE BILL FOR AFRICA, CARIBBEAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Dealing an embarrassing blow to the Clinton
administration's foreign policy agenda, the Senate on Friday pushed
aside legislation promoting trade with Africa and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   The rejection was spurred not by opposition to the trade bill,
which had won strong bipartisan support, but by a political
standoff on whether Democrats could attach to the bill nonrelated
legislation such as an increase to the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   African officials expressed disappointment, particularly after
strong personal commitments by President Clinton and Secretary of
State Madeleine K. Albright.
</P>
<P>
   Late Friday, two longtime U.S. senators, one Democrat and one
Republican who have served 10 terms between them, delivered rousing
speeches on the floor lamenting the direction of Congress when
politics can kill a popular bill.
</P>
<P>
   The speeches by Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York and
Republican William V. Roth Jr. of Delaware could resurrect the
bill, and shift momentum from a series of highly partisan rebukes
to the Clinton administration's foreign policy. Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi indicated that the issue could
come up for debate next week if enough amendments were stripped
from the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, which has been passed twice by the House, would
give sub-Saharan Africa, the Caribbean, and Central American
nations the same preferred trade status currently enjoyed by many
other nations, including China.
</P>
<P>
   For the last 18 months, Clinton and Albright repeatedly told
African leaders that they would promote a stronger African agenda
and their administration would build a new, progressive
relationship with them, promising ``trade not aid.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made his pitch for the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act
as recently as Thursday, saying it was ``vital'' to the
adminstration's efforts to boost the economies of some of the
poorest nations in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Standing by his side then was the president of Nigeria, who also
appealed for help in breaking down trade barriers. And watching
from Senate galleries Friday were a host of grim-faced African
ambassadors.
</P>
<P>
   Several African specialists said the handling of the bill, even
if it is eventually passed, reflected very poorly on the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``When something like this fizzles off, people get cynical about
the United States' supposed commitment,'' said Francis M. Deng,
Sudan's former foreign affairs minister and now a senior fellow at
the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank. ``They wonder,
is this the complexity of decision making in the United States, or
is it the lack of priority for the continent.''
</P>
<P>
   The promises by the Clinton adminstration for a new African
policy, Deng said, ``just seems like a lot of talk, with, in fact,
no action.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue over aid to Africa also comes only a month before the
president presents a free-trade agenda at the World Trade
Organization's meeting in Seattle. If nothing happens, it could
weaken the administration's leverage in new rounds of trade
negotiations that will follow the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation early Friday became hostage to a debate between
Lott and Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota, who
both supported the measure. But Lott did not want unrelated
amendments attached to the bill, which is a common practice in
Congress, and negotiations with Daschle failed to resolve
differences.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate voted 46-45 against Lott's attempt to limit the
number of amendments and end debate. Senators had been debating the
issue all week.
</P>
<P>
   Senators, most of them Democrats, had proposed a series of
measures to tack onto the bill, including raising the minimum wage
to $5.15 an hour and easing agricultural sanctions on Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not be gagged,'' Daschle said, referring to the
Democrats' abilities to tag on amendments to bills.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after Lott sidelined the bill, Roth and Moynihan urged
reconsideration, working in tandem, each yielding to the other over
and over. Roth said 75 to 80 senators supported the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``What kind of signal are we giving the rest of the world?''
Roth asked. ``People are talking about isolationism. What does this
vote represent? Does it mean we can't act effectively when the
welfare of thousands of people both here and abroad is at stake? I
say to my distinguished colleague and ranking member of the Finance
Committee, for whom I have the greatest respect, that we will not
consider this to be a dead issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan agreed, saying: ``We have put in jeopardy trade
policies of the last two-thirds of a century. . . . I want to stand
alongside my chairman and say this is not over. It cannot be over.
Do we have any idea what is at stake?''
</P>
<P>
   After negotiations, Lott showed some flexibility, indicating
that Democrats could attach the minimum-wage measure to another
bill in return for a quick vote on the trade bill.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would allow duty-free shipment into the United
States for textiles and other goods from 47 sub-Saharan Africa
countries as long as the countries made market reforms. Sponsors
added an amendment to extend trade preferences to Caribbean and
Central American nations.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the legislation say it could eliminate jobs in the
United States and benefit only multinational corporations and the
African elite. Others have argued that African and Caribbean
sovereignty would be undermined under the terms of the bill because
of the requirements of market reform.
</P>
<P>
   For Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo, the vote represented a
second disappointment on his trip. On Thursday, he failed to secure
a promise from Clinton to cancel some of Nigeria's crippling $30
billion in foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
   African nations such as South Africa strongly back the U.S.
trade bill, even with stringent US conditions, said Pshediso
Matona, director of bilateral trade relations in the South African
ministry of trade and industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it is an important bill,'' Matona said Friday night.
``It would be the basis for U.S. relations with the African
continent in the next millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   Africa needs such a boost, he said. Echoing Clinton, he said,
``Now would have been an ideal time to pass it, on the eve of the
millennium, when we will see Africa renewing itself.''

ROBERT MILLS, 72, THEORIST IN SUBATOMIC PHYSICS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, Vt., N.J., Md., Pa.)  (mk) 
 By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Mills, a physicist who made major contributions to
the study of subatomic particles, died on Wednesday at his summer
home in East Charleston, Vt. He was 72.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was prostate cancer, said a statement from Ohio State
University, where Mills taught for 39 years.
</P>
<P>
   For most of his career, Mills toiled as a respected but
little-known teacher and researcher. In 1953, however, as a
27-year-old graduate student, he was a co-writer of what has been
called one of the landmark scientific articles of the century,
putting forth the Yang-Mills theory, which later made possible
major advances in subatomic physics.
</P>
<P>
   The theory, according to The Scientist, provided ``the
foundation for current understanding of how subatomic particles
interact, a contribution which has restructured modern physics and
mathematics.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Mills was a research associate at Brookhaven
National Laboratory in Upton, N.Y., working with a 31-year-old
physicist from the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J.,
Chen Ning Yang. Yang, the senior member of the research team, went
on to share the Nobel Prize in physics in 1957 for other research.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview published in The Columbus (Ohio) Dispatch in
1995, Mills described the Yang-Mills theory as ``a theory of forces
between nuclear particles analogous to the electromagnetic theory
of forces between electrically charged particles.''
</P>
<P>
   He further explained that the theory extended Einstein's idea
``that the fundamental symmetries of nature could actually dictate
the character of the force fields of nature.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It exploited the symmetry relating protons and neutrons, which
were widely regarded at that time as two different forms of the
same particle, with different electrical charges,'' Mills said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Laurence Mills, who lived in Columbus, was born on April
15, 1927, in Englewood, N.J. From 1944 to 1947, he served in the
U.S. Merchant Marine. He later received a bachelor's degree from
Columbia University, a master's degree from Cambridge University
and a Ph.D. from Columbia .
</P>
<P>
   He was a research associate at the Brookhaven National
Laboratory from 1953 to 1955 and a member of the Institute for
Advanced Study for the next two years. In 1956, Mills joined the
department of physics at Ohio State as an assistant professor and
became a full professor in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   He retired in 1995 but lectured afterward as a Fulbright scholar
at St. Patrick's College near Dublin, Ireland. He also wrote two
books, ``Propagators for Many-Particle Systems'' (Gordon &AMP; Breach,
1969) and ``Space, Time and Quantra'' (W.H. Freeman &AMP; Sons, 1994).
</P>
<P>
   Mills is survived by his wife, Elise Mills; a brother, William,
of Kendall Park, N.J.; five children, Katherine Anderson of Silver
Spring, Md., Edward of Pittsburgh, Jonathan of New Brunswick, N.J.,
Susan Warner-Mills of Lewisburg, Pa., and Dorothy Mills of
Columbus; and four grandchildren.

CLINTON ANNOUNCES NEW RULES TO PROTECT PRIVACY OF MEDICAL RECORDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ADDS three grafs from end with penalties for violations) (rk) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton kicked off an intense debate on
Friday on how to protect the privacy of medical records in an era
when doctors can test their patients for genetic defects and send
the information round the world with the click of a computer mouse.
</P>
<P>
   In unveiling new rules to safeguard such information, Clinton
said, ``These standards represent an unprecedented step toward
putting Americans back in control of their own medical records.''
</P>
<P>
   But doctors said the rules were inadequate and could actually
erode some protections that patients now have. Several physician
groups said they had been invited to Friday's White House ceremony,
but stayed away because in many cases the proposal does not require
that patients give consent before their records are shared, only
that they be notified. Such rules, they said, does not give
patients enough control over the use and disclosure of their
medical records.
</P>
<P>
   While the administration estimated that compliance would cost
the health care industry $3.8 billion over five years, the
insurance industry says the costs could be 10 times that amount.
With both sides saying they support the goals of the standards, a
central point in the debate will be: What is privacy worth in
dollars and cents?
</P>
<P>
   Health insurance plans object, in particular, to a provision
that would make them responsible for privacy lapses by companies
that collaborate in the care of a patient. For example, an HMO that
sends a patient to a pharmacy could be liable if the pharmacy
improperly uses the patient's records.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposed rules, patients would gain a new federal
right to inspect, copy and suggest corrections in medical records
that have been kept or transmitted electronically.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials estimated that it would cost doctors,
hospitals and health maintenance organizations more than $400
million to issue notices informing patients of their privacy
rights, as required by the rules. In addition, the officials
predicted, thousands of patients will try to correct their medical
records, and it will cost the health care industry more than $2
billion to deal with these requests over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   The rules would permit the use and disclosure of medical
information without the patient's consent for treatment, payment
and a wide range of loosely defined ``health care operations,''
including many common business practices of HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Donald J. Palmisano, a trustee of the American Medical
Association, said: ``The AMA believes that mere notice of a health
plan's intended use is inadequate.''
</P>
<P>
   Many doctors contend that health plans and insurance companies
should have to obtain consent from patients before using
information from their files to monitor the patients' compliance
with recommendations for medical treatment and testing. Too often,
they say, HMOs interfere in the doctor-patient relationship by
suggesting a cheaper drug or a different course of treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration would allow health plans to use
personal health information, without the patient's consent, for
these ``health care operations'': assessing the quality of care and
the performance of doctors and nurses; developing clinical
guidelines; setting premiums for the renewal of insurance
contracts, and investigating fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard K. Harding, vice president of the American
Psychiatric Association, said the proposed rules ``give the federal
good housekeeping seal of approval to practices that could
undermine privacy.'' William Bruno, a lobbyist for the psychiatric
association, said ``patients could lose some protections they now
have'' undercourt decisions that have allowed the disclosure of
certain information only with the patient's consent.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials insisted that the rules would create
protections in areas where none now exist. Doctors, hospitals and
HMOs would, for example, have to keep logs documenting who received
access to patients' records for various purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The rules would greatly expand the role of the federal
government in regulating the practices of the health care industry.
It would set hundreds of detailed federal standards, with civil and
criminal penalties for violations.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Nell Lehnhard, senior vice president of the Blue Cross and
Blue Shield Association, described the rules as costly, complex and
confusing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that all patients should have the peace of mind
that comes from knowing their personal records are secure, and we
are outraged when breaches of this trust occur,'' Ms. Lehnhard
said. ``But why do we need 600 pages of regulations to protect
medical records when the Bill of Rights takes only one page to
provide Americans with all their basic rights? Why didn't the
administration just simply spell out what activities are illegal?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Janlori Goldman, director of the health privacy project at
Georgetown University, said: ``This is a historic day. These
regulations will be the first enforceable federal rules protecting
health privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   But, she said, the proposal falls short because ``there is no
requirement that a judge or a magistrate approve or deny access to
medical records sought by laws enforcement agencies.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the rules, most health care providers would have to
designate ``privacy officials'' to develop privacy policies and
procedures. This rule would apply even to a small office with three
doctors, who could designate the office manager as privacy
coordinator. Health care providers would also have to designate a
``contact person'' to handle patients' complaints about violations
of privacy.
</P>
<P>
   The rules make doctors, HMOs and insurance companies responsible
for any violation of a patient's privacy by their ``business
partners.''
</P>
<P>
   Kristin A. Bass, director of legislative affairs at the American
Association of Health Plans, a trade group, said that an HMO would
have little power over a drug store that improperly sells
information about the patient to a drug manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would hold us responsible for the pharmacy's
misbehavior,'' said Ms. Bass.
</P>
<P>
   Health insurance plans could also be held accountable for the
misuse of medical records by their other ``business partners,''
including their lawyers, auditors, billing firms and consultants.
</P>
<P>
   Under the rules, health care providers and health plans would
have to get the patient's consent for certain types of disclosures
_ if, for example, the information was to be used in marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors and insurers could not insist that people surrender
their privacy rights as a condition of getting treatment or
insurance. In other words, they could not coerce patients into
giving consent.
</P>
<P>
   The administration acknowledged that the rules would create
substantial costs for health care providers and health plans. But,
it said, the rules are necessary because computer technology makes
it possible to ``breach the security and privacy of health
information on a scale that was previously inconceivable.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, doctors have many new clues to their patients'
destiny. Scientists have developed more than 450 genetic tests that
may help identify people with an increased risk of developing
breast cancer, prostate cancer, cystic fibrosis and other diseases.
</P>
<P>
   In a preface to the rules, the administration said they would
have ``major social benefits'' that could not be quantified.
Privacy concerns now discourage people from being tested for
certain types of cancer and for some sexually transmitted diseases,
the administration said. The new rules will allay these concerns,
so more people will receive effective treatments, according to the
administration.
</P>
<P>
   A person who violated the rules could be required to pay a civil
penalty of $25,000. The rules authorize tougher penalties for
criminal violations: a $50,000 fine and one year in prison for
willful violations; a $250,000 fine and 10 years in prison if the
offender tried to use or sell data for ``commercial advantage,
personal gain or malicious harm.''
</P>
<P>
   The public will have two months to comment on the proposals,
which are to be published in the Federal Register on Nov. 3. The
secretary of Health and Human Services is supposed to issue final
rules, with the force of law, by Feb. 21, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said he was acting because Congress failed to
meet its goal of adopting comprehensive privacy standards by Aug.
21.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am taking this action today because Congress has failed to
act and because, a few years ago, Congress explicitly gave me the
authority to step in if they were unable to deal with this issue,''
Clinton said.

   ``I could take off my shoe and show you I don't have a cloven
hoof,'' said David Hunter, putting a self-mocking spin on his
contentious line of work.
</P>
<P>
   Famous as a slash-and-burn cost-cutter who can do the dirty work
that floundering hospitals cannot bring themselves to tackle on
their own, Hunter is often greeted as the Devil incarnate. No one's
job is safe when his 70-member consulting firm, Hunter Group,
wields the axe: along with thousands of clerks, technicians,
nurses, doctors and other workers, Hunter has recently displaced
chief executives at major university-affiliated teaching hospitals
in Chicago, Detroit and San Francisco. The company's latest
emergency rescue plan is for the premier medical center in
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   No question, these institutions and others like them are staring
at daunting problems. Battered by big cuts in Medicare payments,
rising drug costs and managed care plans that force them into
below-cost deals, teaching hospitals around the country face
mounting financial stresses.
</P>
<P>
   The hardest-pressed among them, generally large hospitals in
inner cities, find themselves with no choice but to cut costs
drastically to keep their doors open.
</P>
<P>
   That is when Hunter, 54, a no-nonsense management expert with 11
years of experience operating on wounded hospitals, is called in by
hospital trustees. ``If they are using guys like us,'' he said,
``the problems have to be enormous.'' He calls the hostile
reception he often gets ``a shoot-the-messenger issue,'' adding
that ``the problems were there before we got involved.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics say Hunter Group's shock therapy endangers the
triple mission of the medical centers: educating doctors, treating
patients of all income levels and conducting the breakthrough
medical research that has little or no place at for-profit
hospitals. Officials of medical faculty associations and nursing
unions, for example, say the job cuts tend to be of the meat-axe,
across-the-board variety, hitting vital services as hard as
ancillary areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is happening today is the invisible destruction of the
great academic medical centers,'' said Dr. William M. Kelley, chief
executive of the financially troubled University of Pennsylvania
Health System. ``We will be more efficient and able to deliver care
at a lower price, but we will not be able to do the things that
made us great,'' like experimenting with new surgical procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our ability to develop the medicine of tomorrow is going
away,'' Kelley said.
</P>
<P>
   Academic medical centers play a vital role in American health
care that is important even to people who never set foot in them.
They treat the toughest cases and train the best new doctors, who
often hone their skills serving the poor before beginning practice
elsewhere. Teaching hospitals develop and test new medicines and
surgical procedures on the frontiers of medical knowledge. In many
cities, academic medical centers are also the largest employers of
both skilled and entry-level workers.
</P>
<P>
   But as inflation in health care revs up after a four-year lull,
the great hospitals are under growing pressure from government and
private payers to take yet another tuck in their world-class
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter Group's forte is emergency work, and it loses no time
once an engagement begins. Teams of operations and finance experts
move from the home base of St. Petersburg, Fla., into nearby hotels
and motels and shuttle to the troubled hospital in hired limousines
and rental cars paid for by the client.
</P>
<P>
   Referring frequently to a portfolio of ``benchmarks'' like the
ratio of nurses to beds or floor polishers per square foot, drawn
from consulting stints at 100 hospitals across the country, they
analyze the hospital's operations from the wards and surgical
suites to the billing department to the executive suite. ``We take
a real hard look at the expense side,'' Hunter said.
</P>
<P>
   Within 14 weeks in most cases, the consultants present a plan to
a steering committee of hospital board members and senior
management:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Cut jobs 20 percent, they said in Philadelphia, where the
prestigious University of Pennsylvania Medical Center had an
operating loss of $198 million the year ended June 30. Late this
month, the hospital said that it would eliminate 2,800 health
services jobs out of 14,000 over the next 14 months.
</P>
<P>
   _ Close a money-losing satellite hospital that serves the poor,
they said in San Francisco, where a merger of two nationally
acclaimed hospital systems was bleeding $2 million a month in
operating losses. Though the two medical centers, those of Stanford
University and the University of California at San Francisco, said
on Thursday that they would dissolve the merger, UCSF said it would
go ahead with the closing of in-patient and emergency room services
at Mount Zion Hospital. A similar recommendation in Detroit led to
the closing of Mount Sinai Hospital there.
</P>
<P>
   _ Find a new chief executive, they said in Detroit, Chicago and
San Francisco. Someone from Hunter will mind the store in the
meantime: David Hunter himself became interim chief executive of
California-Stanford; what his role will be after the dissolution of
the merger was not clear on Friday. A longtime aide of Hunter ran
the Detroit Medical Center and later the University of Illinois at
Chicago Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   _ Flatten management, reduce the numbers of laboratory tests and
electrocardiograms, get rid of hundreds of salaried physicians,
reduce support money flowing to medical education from patient fees
and pare teaching budgets, they say nearly everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   _ When the financial problems seem intractable, simply sell the
hospital. An 80 percent stake in the George Washington University
Medical Center in Washington, for example, was sold in 1997 to a
for-profit chain, Universal Health Services.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The discussions between the Hunter team and the client hospital
can be tense, said a top hospital executive who has participated in
such meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Not every recommendation is accepted: in Boston, the New England
Medical Center spurned a Hunter Group proposal that it should sell
out to a for-profit company, later arranging its own merger with a
nonprofit health care system in Providence. But it is hard for
hospital boards to say no when management is temporarily ceded to
the consultants.
</P>
<P>
   Rank-and-file doctors, nurses and technicians at the hospitals
say they get little or no chance to contribute suggestions or
influence the consultants' decisions on cuts. ``We knew we were on
the chopping block,'' said a nurse at the San Francisco hospital.
``We heard about it on the whisper circuit.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter Group gets the lion's share of assignments to turn around
troubled academic medical centers, said Larry Lewin, director of
hospital strategy for Lewin Group, a Washington-based consulting
firm. But a growing number of health care turnaround firms are
competing for the business, and Ernst &AMP; Young, the giant accounting
and consulting firm, also jumped in recently.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates for the consultants' ministrations have been
exploding in number since last year's cuts in Medicare payments to
hospitals. The nation's 120 academic medical centers operate 200
hospitals, but some hospital executives doubt that they can all
survive without severe cutbacks and closings.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of its members by the University Health System
Consortium of 80 big teaching hospitals last summer found that two
in five had losses in operations in their most recent quarterly
results.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, the five big academic medical centers are
headed for a drop of $100 million in their combined annual
operating income this year, and shortfalls at the three teaching
hospitals of the State University of New York are straining the
university system's statewide budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``Academic medical centers are the crown jewels of our health
system,'' said Dr. Bernard Ferrari, a consultant at McKinsey &AMP; Co.,
the management consulting firm. ``They often deliver the most
expensive care to the people who are least able to pay. They are an
endangered species.''
</P>
<P>
   A handful have large endowments or other sources of investment
income that have tided them over while the stock market has been
booming, but even they are now struggling with declining revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Medical schools are attracting fewer applicants than they were a
few years ago, but health care economists debate whether the
centers are still training too many specialists, too many general
practice doctors, or both. Though union officials and politicians
stress the importance of the centers in providing tens of thousands
of jobs and vital health services for low-income people in cities,
deteriorating finances are robbing many of them of the ability to
play these roles and still be self-sustaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is questionable whether Boston, Philadelphia, Washington
and New York can support multiple big medical school
organizations,'' Hunter said.
</P>
<P>
   The hospitals that recently sought help from Hunter Group all
have especially steep losses.
</P>
<P>
   The Detroit Medical Center posted operating losses of $160
million last year and $93 million in the first seven months of
1999. The University of Pennsylvania Health System in Philadelphia
lost $288 million on operations in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   University of California-Stanford Health Care projected a $65
million surplus for the first two years after it was created by
merging the hospitals of Stanford and the University of California
in November 1997. The projection was over-optimistic by $111
million; the center lost $46 million. The two top executives at
California-Stanford resigned last August.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in some cases, critics say, Hunter-inspired economizing
made it harder, not easier, to stanch the losses. Senior physicians
at the New England Medical Center said it took much longer for the
hospital to collect outstanding bills after it made deep cuts in
its billing department.
</P>
<P>
   At the same hospital, a profit-generating liver transplant unit
was out of action for a week until replacements could be found for
blood bank technicians whose jobs were cut.
</P>
<P>
   But Hunter's fans point to a return to profitability at
beleaguered hospitals in several cities as evidence that broadly,
his methods work.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter, a former hospital executive at Duke University and in
Mount Holly, N.J., started Hunter Group with two partners in 1988.
Hunter and his partners sold the firm to 16 of its executives last
year for an undisclosed price. Hunter stayed on as chief executive
on contract and retains a financial interest in the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can do things that existing management can't do,'' he said
in a recent conversation on the front porch of his century-old
stone house in Newtown, Pa., outside Philadelphia. For one thing,
most academic medical centers operate by consensus among
turf-guarding medical superstars not known for small egos.
Decision-making in such an environment can be excruciatingly slow,
and resistance to outside criticism can run high.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninety-five percent of our members are trying to keep David
Hunter out of their institutions,'' said Robert Baker, president of
the University Health System Consortium.
</P>
<P>
   When the Hunter Group is brought in, it is typically for a few
months of drastic cutting. ``We're not there long term,'' Hunter
said, and clients rarely sign up for a return engagement. ``They
never want to go through it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the problems that lead a medical center to call the
Hunter Group were all too evident in the short, unhappy merger in
the San Francisco area.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford Health Services and the University of California San
Francisco Medical Center both ranked among the nation's top 10
hospitals in independent surveys before their merger, which was
motivated by a desire to overcome the challenges of operating in
the vortex of one of the nation's most intense markets for health
care plans.

<P>
   The merger, however, just made the financial problems worse, at
least for the short run. Instead of cutting staffs and eliminating
duplication, the merged entity wound up adding 1,000 employees,
including new managers to coordinate hospitals 40 miles apart at
Palo Alto and San Francisco. Unforeseen millions were spent on
computers and consultants, including $100 million for Year 2000
upgrades.
</P>
<P>
   Desperate to reverse the trend, the hospital's board called in
Hunter Group, at a cost of $414,000 a month plus expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The consultants found that the merged medical centers were
spending $15,000 more for each patient than other large hospitals
did, reflecting teaching, research and treating the indigent. The
number of emergency patients increased sharply, adding to
unreimbursed costs last year, after the medical center expanded
emergency room capacity at its main hospital in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   To attack the cost problems, Hunter consultants negotiated staff
reductions with the medical school faculty and the managers of
hospital departments and examined ways to get better prices on
supplies. Taking care of poor people is both a duty and a financial
drag.
</P>
<P>
   The merged medical center loses $80 million annually on
uncovered services to Medicaid patients, said Peter Van Etten, who
was chief executive until August.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Cieutat, a pediatric intensive care nurse who is active in
the California Nurses Association, said cuts in staffing levels are
causing problems. ``There used to be one nurse for three or four
patients,'' she said. ``Now it's five or six patients. Nurses are
exhausted, stressed, demoralized. Many are looking for work
elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter acknowledges that cutting the nursing staff can be
delicate because good nursing is crucial to quality of care. And in
some places there is a shortage of nurses ready to do stressful
jobs. ``It's more `Can we get them?' than `Can we cut them?''' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   As for revenues, Hunter proposed trying to renegotiate contracts
with managed care companies that were based on capitation _ a flat
monthly fee for each health plan member _ or on fixed day rates for
hospital care; both are money-losers for the hospital, he said, and
it would be better off with a fee schedule that varies with the
patient's diagnosis. That will not be easy in California, a bastion
of managed care.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of care for poor people poses an even more difficult
revenue problem. Costs that hospitals have to swallow have been
rising as health plans raise their premiums, causing a growing
number of working people who are not eligible for Medicaid to drop
their coverage. Hospitals are stuck with much of the cost of caring
for such patients.
</P>
<P>
   In the glory years before the managed care squeeze and Medicare
cutbacks, payments from patients subsidized teaching and research.
No longer. Dr. Warren Gold, chairman of the UCSF medical school
faculty association, noted that Hunter Group had recommended ``a
major cutback in payments from professional fees'' _ the money
faculty doctors bring in when they treat patients at the hospital _
to finance teaching and research.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, according to Dr. Lee Goldman, the acting dean of the
medical school, the main concern was to retain money in the
hospital to buy state-of-the-art equipment like $3 million gamma
knives for delicate brain surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is really at risk here is clinical innovation, the
interface between a faculty that does research and tries to make
advances, and the clinical care,'' Goldman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. is indisputably the leader in this,'' he added. ``In
the 1860s it was Germany. Now everybody comes here. It's a great
American triumph. But we could screw it up.''
</P>
<P>
   But the real choice facing the most troubled medical centers,
Hunter argued, is not one of preserving research financing or
cutting it back; it is a choice of ruthlessly cutting expenses or
closing the doors. Like it or not, the money to operate the old way
simply will not be there in the future, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter predicted that revenues at academic medical centers would
fall by at least 10 percent a year for the foreseeable future,
though he acknowledged his estimate might be colored by his
close-up knowledge of hospitals in deep trouble. ``We're not,'' he
said, ``looking at the Miss Americas.''

RESTAURATEURS PRAISE IRS MOVE THAT EASES THEIR BURDEN ON TIP
REPORTING 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By TERRY PRISTIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At Gabriel's Bar and Restaurant near Lincoln Center,
the waiters and bartenders are required to report their tips to the
management every night. When they forget _ as the bartenders did
three nights in a row this week _ the owner, Gabriel Aiello, calls
to remind them and hopes they are telling the truth so that the
Internal Revenue Service does not come after him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we found out they were fibbing, we would suspend them,''
Aiello said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Restaurateurs have argued for years that it is unfair to hold
them accountable when their employees hide their tips. ``It's a
colossal pain in the neck,'' Aiello said.
</P>
<P>
   This week, in a policy change hailed by the National Restaurant
Association as a ``huge victory,'' the IRS said that as long as
restaurants cooperate with the tax agency, they will not face an
audit _ even if their employees are suspected of cheating.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, all tips are supposed to be reported as income,
but each year, billions of dollars in cash tips are concealed from
the government.
</P>
<P>
   The new policy ``is certainly a good thing for business,'' said
E. Charles Hunt, a spokesman for the 2,000-member New York City
chapter of the New York State Restaurant Industry. ``Restaurant
owners have enough to worry about keeping their customers happy
without having to worry about being the tip police.''
</P>
<P>
   And since patrons of New York restaurants tend to tip more than
those elsewhere, restaurants in New York have typically been more
likely to be audited than establishments in other cities, said
Thomas R. Burger, director of the IRS's Office of Employment Tax
Administration and Compliance.
</P>
<P>
   The new approach means that employers who abide by the
requirements of a voluntary compliance program set up in 1995 by
the IRS will no longer be liable for paying Social Security and
Medicare taxes on unreported tips.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a huge development,'' said Peter G. Kilgore, a senior
vice president of the National Restaurant Association, which has
37,000 members representing 170,000 establishments. ``The
restaurant is protected even if the IRS district director didn't
believe that all employees are reporting their tips to their
employers.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that being forced to pay years of back taxes could be
catastrophic for a restaurant. In practice, however, that has not
happened to restaurants participating in the program, he said.
</P>
<P>
   By making the policy change, IRS officials say they are not
changing the longstanding requirements for restaurant employees to
report their tips but are merely trying to alleviate a burden on
restaurant owners in the hope that more of them will enroll in the
program. Of the 183,000 full-service restaurants in the country
that are eligible to join, only 32,000 have done so, Burger said.
</P>
<P>
   But some critics of the agency say that the IRS has caved in to
the industry by making it even harder to enforce the tip-reporting
requirements. The agency estimates that waiters, bartenders and
maitres d'hotel in the United States collect about $18 billion tips
a year yet report only $7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Donald C. Alexander, a Washington tax lawyer who served as IRS
commissioner from 1973 to 1977, called the policy change an attempt
to improve the tax agency's image. ``The IRS now, in its warmness,
cuddliness and fuzziness, is willing to go further than before,''
Alexander said. ``The industry should be delighted.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The agency's voluntary program, known as the Tip Reporting
Alternative Commitment, was developed in 1995 as a joint effort
between the agency and the restaurant industry to try to increase
compliance with the law. Participants agree to maintain and submit
certain tax records and educate their employees about the reporting
requirements by, for example, showing them IRS videotapes and
brochures. These requirements ``are not that onerous,'' said
Kilgore of the National Restaurant Association.
</P>
<P>
   Some restaurants like Gabriel's go further and require employees
to report their tips after every shift, but that degree of effort
is not required under the program.
</P>
<P>
   Aiello said he intends to keep after his employees to report
their tips, just in case the IRS changes its policy again. But he
said he was happy that the agency was loosening up. ``It's a little
bit of pressure off our shoulders,'' he said. ``The waiters should
be responsible for the money that they earn.''

BOXING BOARD VOTES NOT TO SANCTION TYSON, RELEASES $8.7 MILLION
PURSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Nevada State Athletic Commission voted 4-0 Friday not to
sanction Mike Tyson and released his purse of $8.7 million after a
hearing to determine whether the former heavyweight champion had
intentionally hit Orlin Norris after the bell in the first round of
their bout last Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Steele, the referee of the bout, had ruled that the blow
was accidental and deducted two points from Tyson. But the bout was
ruled no contest because Norris injured his right knee when he fell
from the late blow and could not continue.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioners agreed with Steele's ruling inside the ring
and saw no reason for further action against Tyson, who did not
appear at the hearing in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, on occasion, boxers get hit after the bell,''
Tyson's manager, Shelly Finkel, told The Associated Press after the
ruling. ``Mike is pleased to put this ordeal behind him.''
</P>
<P>
   But some members of the commission said they had seen enough of
Tyson and his antics and want him to fight elsewhere for a while.
Dr. Elias Ghanem, the chairman of the Nevada commission, said that
it could be difficult for Tyson to get his boxing license renewed
in Nevada when it expires in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``My advice is to pack Mike Tyson's bags up and take this act on
the road,'' Lorenzo Fertitta, the state commissioner, said. ``I'm
not so sure we need him in the state of Nevada any longer.''
</P>
<P>
   During a bout in Las Vegas on June 29, 1997, Tyson bit both of
Evander Holyfield's ears. Tyson was disqualified for that and his
boxing license was revoked for 19 months. In a bout against
Francois Botha in January, Tyson admitted that he tried to break
Botha's arm during a clinch between the two boxers.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Goossen of America Presents, Tyson's promoter, said plans
were already under way for Tyson to fight elsewhere. Goossen is
exploring the possibility of having Tyson fight in Europe on Dec.
11. And a fight planned for Madison Square Garden against Shannon
Briggs on Feb. 26 is close to being completed.

J. HOWARD EDGERTON, 91, OFFICIAL IN S&AMP;L INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (js) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   J. Howard Edgerton, who decades ago built the California Federal
Savings and Loan Association into the nation's largest savings
institution, died Oct. 14 at his home in Beverly Hills, Calif. He
was 91.
</P>
<P>
   Edgerton, a lawyer, joined the Railway Mutual Building and Loan
Association in 1931. Five years later, he took over the institution
and, in 1937, changed its name to California Federal Savings and
Loan. Two years later, he became its president and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   California Federal grew to have assets of more than $6 billion
in the 1970s from $5 million in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the 1950s, California Federal was the largest
savings and loan association in the United States, and its 28-story
corporate headquarters on Wilshire Boulevard, which was completed
in 1965, was for a time the tallest building in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   After several mergers in recent years, California Federal
Savings and Loan became part of the California Federal Bank in San
Francisco, now the second-largest savings bank in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Edgerton, who retired in 1980, served as president of the U.S.
Savings and Loan League.
</P>
<P>
   He was also active in Los Angeles civic affairs, raising funds
to help abused children, hospitals, museums, political causes and
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   James Howard Edgerton was born on Feb. 12, 1908, in Sulphur
Springs, Ark., and grew up in Prescott, Ariz., and Los Angeles. He
earned a bachelor's degree and a law degree from the University of
Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Catherine; a daughter, Beverly Adair
of Los Angeles; a son, Russell Howard Edgerton of Bala-Cynwyd, Pa.;
11 grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren.

O'NEAL SAYS LAKERS HAVE A BIG PROBLEM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Shaquille O'Neal is not the Los Angeles Lakers'
general manager, but he's played the role before. He pushed hard to
get Tom Gugliotta last season, and when that failed, he
successfully lobbied for Dennis Rodman (a move he's come to
regret).
</P>
<P>
   Now O'Neal is fretting about losing his backup, Benoit Benjamin,
and is frustrated he still has no one to help him defend the paint
and rebound. He said he's not going to play GM again _ ``I'm done
with that'' _ but he offered up some solutions anyway.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal would like a reunion with Horace Grant, his teammate with
Orlando, since traded to Seattle. He also is high on Antonio Davis,
a stalwart with Indiana since traded to Toronto, which has a glut
of big men.
</P>
<P>
   Both players can start at power forward and play backup center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, we can do something for Horace or do something for
Antonio Davis, guys like that,'' O'Neal said. ``We're going to get
by. If we did get a four (power forward), those guys are the best
guys at the position. Antonio Davis, I know he doesn't want to be
in Canada with that double tax. He needs to come back to America.''
</P>
<P>
   The lack of a strong power forward has plagued the Lakers for
three years running, and O'Neal freely admits it bothers him.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us to contend, we're going to have to have a strong four
spot,'' he said. ``San Antonio has an excellent four (Tim Duncan).
Utah has an excellent four (Karl Malone). Sacramento (Chris
Webber), Portland (Brian Grant/Rasheed Wallace), everybody has an
excellent four.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers are struggling to get by with a combination of Robert
Horry, A.C. Green, John Salley and Rick Fox. Horry and Green, the
two primary players at the position, combined to go 1 for 5 for two
points and five rebounds in 33 minutes against Utah in the Lakers'
final exhibition Thursday. The Jazz outrebounded the Lakers 43-28
and won 92-76.
</P>
<P>
   As undermanned as the Lakers are, coach Phil Jackson expects
better from his power forwards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't see how we can get any worse,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After a lackluster effort against the Jazz, that sentiment
applied to most of the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we just quit hustling entirely,'' Jackson said. ``I
think some of the guys are embarrassed by their lack of hustle. And
we're embarrassed by it.''
</P>
<P>
   No time to rest: With few big bodies available, Jackson has
suggested O'Neal might play 40 minutes a game. O'Neal embraced the
notion but said he'd prefer that Benjamin be there to back him up _
``It's unfortunate that Big Ben (was cut). I would have loved to
have him around.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm going to give my best 40 minutes. I'll be fine. I'll
get it. I just have to stay out of (foul) trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal averaged 34.8 minutes last season, a career low, and has
only come close to 40 once, playing 39.8 minutes per game in
1993-94.
</P>
<P>
   On the bubble: With Thursday's cuts of Benjamin and Stephen
Howard, the Lakers are down to 15 players, leaving them with a few
decisions to make by 3 p.m. Monday _ the league's deadline for
finalizing the 12-man roster.
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant (broken hand) and Travis Knight (sprained ankle)
probably will be placed on the injured list to reduce the roster to
13. Then the Lakers must either stash a third player on the IR or
cut someone. Rookie guard John Celestand, without a guaranteed
contract, is the most likely to be waived.

DAD, HUSBAND, AND WOULD-BE WORLD CHAMPION 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By ROBIN FINN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. _ The role playing he does is dizzying;
then again, Michael Weiss, the 1999 U.S. men's figure skating
champion, who was also named the 1999 father of the year by the
National Fatherhood Initiative, has always been adept at leaps,
spins and changes. He has had to be.
</P>
<P>
   Just three days ago, Weiss, 23, was back home in Fairfax, Va.,
changing the diapers of his 13-month-old daughter and a newborn son
between practice runs for the first significant competition of the
season, Skate America, Friday night and Saturday at the World
Arena.
</P>
<P>
   His wife/choreographer, Lisa, had given birth to their second
child, Christopher Michael, in a scheduled delivery last week. The
birth had been timed, said Weiss, to insure that his participation
in Skate America _ the event he considers a precedent-setter for
what will happen on the podium at the World Championships next
March _ would not be endangered.
</P>
<P>
   The family wanted ``no dramatics as to whether I'd be there or
not,'' said Weiss, who is also nursing a minor stress fracture in
his left ankle. But there were complications.
</P>
<P>
   His son developed a digestive problem, requiring a weekend in
intensive care, before being allowed to come home on Monday.
Meanwhile, his firstborn, Annie May, his intended travel companion
for this weekend's performance, developed a sinus infection and was
grounded by her pediatrician. So Weiss had to come alone to Skate
America to test himself against the likes of Alexei Yagudin and
Elvis Stojko, plus fend off an internal challenge from 19-year-old
Tim Goebel, the third-place finisher at the U.S. Championships last
February.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was all right with sticking to his original plan to
compete: his mother and his mother-in-law were filling in at home.
And his wife had no intention of letting his training and her
choreography (she master-minded his long program, while Brian
Wright handled the short program) go to waste.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Weiss can turn his attention to the two wildly different
roles he has selected for his short and long programs here. Friday
night, in the short program competition that accounts for one-third
of his final score, the 5-foot-8-inch Weiss, who routinely bench
presses 275 but can do 300 pounds on demand, transformed himself to
Brando and skated to ``On The Waterfront'' in a piece he describes
as ``a very dramatic, fighting type of program.''
</P>
<P>
   For his long program, Weiss opted to try something he has never
done, skate to familiar of music that has come to be considered a
figure skating classic _ ``Carmen.'' His intended program features
one quad and eight triples; Weiss plays a toreador and lets a
gentler, interpretative side show through.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be typecast,'' he said. ``I can skate to Van
Halen, I can skate to Carmen: versatility is a very big key to my
skating.''
</P>
<P>
   As is consistency. Last season Weiss, whose own role model for
multi-faceted success is Michael Jordan, won silver at Skate
America, gold at the United States Championships and bronze at the
World Championships.
</P>
<P>
   This season, where he is convinced that it will take a perfectly
executed quad-triple combination backed up by eight more triples to
nail down the world championship, he wants to take the next step.
And his domestic role, rather than being a distraction, has helped
him have the confidence to map his strategy. ``Any time you have a
happy individual, you have a happy athlete,'' Weiss said. ``That's
basically what I've been riding for the last year or so.''
</P>
<P>
   Another strong showing at Skate America, he noted, is the first
and best way to make a good impression on the judges this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that I'm one of the world medalists, it's like I have to
win the event, not only be competitive,'' he said.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ If George W. Bush can thank his father for a
well-known name, for much of his wealth he can thank Richard E.
Rainwater, a billionaire investor from Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   The vast bulk of the $18.4 million Bush and his wife reported in
1998 income came from the sale of the Texas Rangers and other
investments in which Rainwater, a man not widely known outside of
Wall Street, played a major role.
</P>
<P>
   Rainwater, at age 55, is considered a master investor and has
built fortunes for others as well as for himself.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a grocer and a J.C. Penney sales clerk, Rainwater
gained his reputation skillfully marshaling the assets of the
legendary Bass family of Fort Worth, whose original holdings were
in oil. He soon created his own fortune, recently estimated by
Forbes magazine at $1.2 billion, by building a real-estate empire
and helping to found the nation's largest chain of hospitals,
Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the financial ties between Bush and Rainwater, their
relationship has long been a target for the governor's political
opponents in Texas. In Bush's first campaign for governor, in 1994,
a spokesman for his Democratic opponent, Gov. Ann W. Richards,
declared that Rainwater ``owned'' Bush.
</P>
<P>
   A review of Bush's relationship with Rainwater did not produce
evidence that Bush, as governor, has sought to aid the businessman,
though there would be more potential for conflict if he became
president. Rainwater is involved in companies that are heavily
regulated and have hundreds of millions of dollars in government
contracts. One of those companies, which operates psychiatric
hospitals, is the subject of federal and state investigations into
patient abuse and Medicare fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said in a statement: ``Richard Rainwater is a friend and a
former business partner who is very successful. Some of my
investments in his companies have been successful as well. Richard
has never sought a favor for any of his companies nor would I have
offered any.''
</P>
<P>
   Rainwater declined to comment on the relationship, saying
through a spokesman that it would be inappropriate during Bush's
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in 1994, Rainwater said, ``George Bush happens
to be one of about 100 people that can make the statement that
their involvement with Richard Rainwater has had a very positive''
effect on their wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, as he prepared to run for the Republican presidential
nomination, Bush liquidated a blind trust created to hold his
assets when he was elected governor. One reason for doing so, said
the accountant who managed the trust, Robert A. McCleskey, was to
eliminate the appearance of any conflicts of interest, including
any investments with Rainwater.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get people inquiring about the Rainwater interests _ is
there a conflict?'' McCleskey said. ``So it was decided that the
best thing was to get rid of it.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the wealth of many politicians has been shaped by
others, and many national figures have had close friendships with
people heavily regulated by the government. In 1976, for example,
Hillary Rodham Clinton quickly turned a $1,000 investment in
commodities futures into a gain of nearly $100,000 with advice from
a friend who was then the top lawyer for Tyson Foods, the nation's
biggest poultry producer.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, for his part, invested $385 in 1991 in a ``consulting''
group set up by Rainwater as part of a deal with Americredit Corp.,
the car loan company. Three years later, when the investment paid
off, Bush received $45,512.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Bush, Dan Bartlett, said that the investment was
``passive'' and that Bush did no consulting.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Bush, Rainwater was not born into a world of connections.
He went to public schools in Fort Worth, where his father operated
a family grocery and where he regularly won races at a local drag
strip in a souped-up Buick. He attended the University of Texas and
then the Stanford University Graduate School of Business.
</P>
<P>
   At Stanford, he was a classmate of Sid R. Bass, the eldest of
the four Bass brothers, and it was Bass who soon hired him to help
direct the investments of Bass Brothers Enterprises. Rainwater so
aggressively invested the family's oil wealth in languishing
companies like Walt Disney that by the time he left in 1986, $50
million had grown to $5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after going out on his own in 1986, Rainwater connected
with another Texan, Richard L. Scott, a lawyer who believed that
investor-owned hospitals could be efficient and highly profitable.
They soon joined forces, and the result was Columbia/HCA, the
nation's biggest chain of for-profit hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   His current holdings also include energy, oil rigs, office
buildings and the sumptuous Canyon Ranch resorts. So sprawling are
his interests that gamblers can bet in casinos operated by one of
his companies or seek treatment for their gambling compulsion at
another.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a mega-deal guy who is extremely intelligent,'' said J.
Thomas Schieffer, who was a partner with Bush and Rainwater in the
Texas Rangers. ``He has a Midas touch.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While Bush and Rainwater have described themselves as friends,
people who know them said they are not particularly close. And they
did not know each other before Bush approached the businessman in
1989 for help in putting together an investment group to buy the
Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   In their first conversation, Bush was rebuffed. Only after the
baseball commissioner, Peter V. Ueberroth, intervened, intent on
having Bush include Texas investors, did Rainwater agree to take
part. He and a group of associates eventually put up half of the
$46 million purchase price.
</P>
<P>
   Rainwater's role in the Texas Rangers is well known. But not
long after, he began offering Bush investment opportunities in oil
and gas, real estate and a car loan company, which together yielded
at least $650,000 and possibly hundreds of thousands more. Then in
1994, he contributed $100,000 when Bush successfully ran for
governor.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, in a comment made through his spokesman, Bartlett, said
that those investments naturally followed from the Texas Rangers
deal. Other team investors with long ties to Rainwater took part in
them, though three large investors brought in by Bush _ Schieffer,
Mercer Reynolds and William O. DeWitt Jr. _ each said that the Fort
Worth businessman never approached them with similar opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically he allowed George to invest in some of the stuff
that he invested in,'' said Schieffer, who was the team's president
before its sale.
</P>
<P>
   Within the high-stakes financial world inhabited by Rainwater,
Bush's investments were very small, and how much he made from them
is unclear. McCleskey said the terms of Bush's trust prevented him
from disclosing the annual returns on the investments between 1995
and 1998, the time they were in trust.
</P>
<P>
   But between 1991, the first year that Bush publicly released his
tax filings, and 1994, he earned about $270,000 from investments
involving Rainwater, according to data provided by McCleskey. And
in 1998, when all remaining Rainwater-related investments were
sold, Bush made from $355,000 to $415,000, public filings show.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Rangers provided Bush his biggest payday from deals
involving Rainwater, some $14.9 million based on a total investment
of $606,000.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's investments with Rainwater were questioned during his
1994 race against Gov. Richards and after, as Texas newspapers and
other news organizations scrutinized their ties.
</P>
<P>
   One issue was whether Bush's proposal to privatize state
psychiatric hospitals could benefit Magellan Health Services Inc.,
a company in which Rainwater is the largest shareholder.
</P>
<P>
   Had the plan gone forward, which it did not, Magellan Health
would have been a prime contender for such a contract. But in fact,
the privatization proposal did not originate with Bush. It was part
of a 1994 report by the state's Democratic comptroller, John Sharp.
</P>
<P>
   Questions were also raised about the state teacher retirement
system's sale of several buildings to a publicly traded company
headed by Rainwater, Crescent Real Estate Equities Co. Bush said he
had no role in the sales, and reviews of the sales by appraisers
hired by the retirement system found the prices paid by Crescent
Real Estate to be fair.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, however, did not divorce himself completely from the
concerns of companies tied to Rainwater. In early 1995, Scott, the
chief executive of Columbia/HCA, met with the governor to express
his concerns about a Medicaid bill in the Texas Legislature,
documents obtained under the state open-records law by The New York
Times show. The bill was intended to expand the number of children
and adults covered by the state's health-insurance program for the
poor.
</P>
<P>
   People involved in the ensuing debate said they did not see any
evidence that Bush had tried to influence the final bill, though
Rainwater's interests in the matter were well known.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that went around was the affiliation between
the governor and Mr. Rainwater, that anything being done was a
favor to him,'' said Hugo Berlanga, a former state representative
from Corpus Christi who was involved with the bill. ``I thought it
was a far reach.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, some of Rainwater's investments have lost their
luster. In 1997, for example, Columbia/HCA became the subject of a
wide-ranging federal investigation into Medicare fraud.
(Rainwater's wife, Darla D. Moore, a former investment banker with
Chemical Bank who took over his seat on the Columbia/HCA board in
1994, was widely credited with removing Scott as its chief
executive.)
</P>
<P>
   Charter Behavioral Health Systems, another Rainwater-related
company in which Bush was invested through his blind trust, is now
the subject of regulatory scrutiny. Until recently, it was a unit
of Magellan Health, a company that Ms. Moore joined as a director
in 1996 after resigning her post at Columbia/HCA.
</P>
<P>
   Rainwater came to invest in Charter Behavioral through his ties
to Magellan Health and Crescent Real Estate, a publicly traded real
estate investment trust, or REIT, that he founded.
</P>
<P>
   REITs typically invest in commercial real estate. But in 1997,
Rainwater turned Crescent in an unusual direction, the psychiatric
industry, paying Magellan Health $400 million for a 50 percent
stake in Charter Behavioral, which operates a chain of psychiatric
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was structured to provide the REIT with rent from the
hospitals. But since operating the hospitals would jeopardize the
REIT's tax status, Rainwater and his associates created a new
company, Crescent Operating, to operate the hospitals with
Magellan. Shareholders in Crescent Real Estate, including Bush,
received stock in Crescent Operating as a dividend.
</P>
<P>
   Charter Behavioral, which runs about 80 hospitals nationwide,
already had financial problems as private and public insurers cut
back on in-patient psychiatric stays. But the terms of the Crescent
deal added two new costs, calling on Charter to pay the REIT at
least $40 million a year in rents and to pay Magellan Health $81
million in annual franchise fees.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two years, federal and state regulators have found
a growing list of problems at Charter Behavioral hospitals, which
receive tens of millions of dollars from programs like Medicare and
Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   Recently Charter agreed to close the adolescent unit of its
hospital in Nashua, N.H., after failing to remedy conditions there,
said Donald Shumway, commissioner of the New Hampshire department
of Health and Human Services. Regulators had found untrained staff,
unsanitary conditions, improper use of restraints, record-keeping
violations and sexual abuse of teen-agers and children.
</P>
<P>
   In August, the federal Health Care Finance Administration
announced that it was ending payments to a Charter Behavioral
hospital in Pembroke, Mass., after the company failed to submit an
acceptable plan to correct deficiencies.
</P>
<P>
   Shumway said Magellan Health had told him that Charter
Behavioral had dismissed most corporate-level officials involved in
reviewing the quality of medical care sometime in the past two
years as part of a cost-cutting move.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Jenkins, a spokeswoman for Charter Behavioral, which has
headquarters in Alpharetta, Ga., said patient care at company sites
had never suffered. ``We have strict standards of quality
assurance,'' she said. ``If there was a reduction, the functions
would not stop.'' She would not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Crescent Operating, which is also headed by Rainwater, recently
took Magellan Health's remaining stake in Charter Behavioral. Bush
is no longer an investor in either Crescent or Crescent Operating
because the stocks were sold when his trust was liquidated.

   EAST HADDAM, Conn. _ If good fences make good neighbors, the
Damucks and Marty Bodwicz need a tall, thick wall, able to
withstand the caprices of cordless phones, baby monitors and video
recorders. By all accounts, the three are not good neighbors at
all, and their enmity is reaching the courts in an unconventional
way.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Damuck, a town official in this rural community
criss-crossed by stone walls, and his wife, Patricia, face a felony
charge of eavesdropping on Bodwicz, a local newspaper reporter. The
Damucks admit that they overheard Bodwicz's telephone conversation,
which he made on his cordless phone and they picked up on a baby
monitor in their kitchen. Unlike conventional phones, cordless
phones emit a signal that can be picked up by listening devices
like police scanners and baby monitors.
</P>
<P>
   The Damucks used a video recorder to tape the call, in which
Bodwicz complained about town officials. The Damucks took the tape
to Bodwicz's editor at The Middletown Press, as proof, they
believed, that he was biased and should not be covering East
Haddam.
</P>
<P>
   But when Bodwicz, 43, learned the details of the visit from a
colleague, he reported it to the police. The couple were arrested
this month, and arraignment was scheduled Nov. 9 in Middletown
Superior Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen lots of cases where the police or somebody else
intercepted a cordless phone call, but this one is way over the
top,'' said Dave Banisar, a senior fellow at the Electronic Privacy
Information Center in Washington. ``Since cordless phones don't
have that great a range, usually less than a mile, this is pretty
rare.''
</P>
<P>
   The ill will between the neighbors dates back to 1996, when
Bodwicz built his house, a Cape Cod on a wooded lot about eight
miles from town. A dispute followed over the proximity of the
Damucks' woodshed to Bodwicz's property line. Only then, Bodwicz
said, did he realize that Damuck was a town official who was on the
conservation committee. He is up for re-election this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The couple did not know they were breaking the law, said Mrs.
Damuck, who is 40. In Connecticut, it is illegal to tape phone
conversations without the permission of the people speaking, though
it is not against the law to listen to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was his responsibility not to broadcast'' the conversation,
she said in an interview this week. ``Basically, he invaded my
home.'' When they first heard the voices, she said, they thought
someone had broken in. ``When he started broadcasting what he
wanted to do to us, and to public officials, wow, there it was,
thrown in our laps,'' she said. ``It worked out perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   The dispute gets messier.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Damuck said Bodwicz was stalking her family, as
demonstrated by his stated determination to be at every public
meeting Damuck attends. She added that Bodwicz had followed her
around town.
</P>
<P>
   She said she was giving his picture to local school bus drivers,
because she considers him a danger to her three children. She also
said he had allowed his golden retriever puppy to attack them.
</P>
<P>
   Bodwicz said Thursday that the stalking accusation was ``utterly
groundless'' and that it was his job to attend town meetings. The
Damucks have trained video cameras on his house, he said, and made
his life so miserable that he is selling his house and moving
``back to civilization.''
</P>
<P>
   He filed a civil suit in Superior Court this month accusing the
Damucks of invasion of privacy and causing him severe emotional
distress.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Damuck said she was not aware of any suits against her
family.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Levy, editor of The Middletown Press, said that the paper
believed Bodwicz's reporting has ``never been anything but fair,
balanced and accurate,'' but that he was taken off East Haddam
coverage on Monday to avoid the appearance of a conflict of
interest.
</P>
<P>
   Levy said he asked the couple whether they could show that
Bodwicz's work was unfair. ``I invited the Damucks to cite specific
instances where if Marty had bias, where did this bleed through,
and they didn't show any,'' he said. ``I invited them to come back,
and they did not.''
</P>
<P>
   The case is similar to the national controversy caused in 1996
by a Florida couple who taped a cellular phone call from Newt
Gingrich, the speaker in the House of Representatives at the time,
as he was discussing how to handle ethics charges against him. The
couple, John and Alice Martin, heard the conversation on their
police scanner and gave a tape of it to Democratic leaders. They
were fined $500 each.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CAN END HERE.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The lessons about behavior _ political or neighborly _ to be
taken from this case may be elusive. But Evan Hendricks, editor of
and publisher of Privacy Times, a Washington newsletter, said there
was a clear lesson for users of cordless phones: Remember that they
are broadcasting devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``You shouldn't engage in conversations that could be deemed
sensitive on a cordless phone, even though most of us do it all the
time,'' he said.

SPORTS COLUMN: CELEBRATION IN A MELTING POT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Autumn here was never better than this. For the
second consecutive October, thousands of Yankee fans converged on
City Hall on Friday. The lucky ones sat; most stood. They all came
to celebrate the franchise's third World Series championship in
four years.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani _ the Yankee fan with the
highest profile _ kicked off the celebration and set the tone by
acknowledging the odd, bitter symmetry of life that sports often
mirrors. This was a year in which the Yankees lost Joe DiMaggio and
Catfish Hunter, a season in which three players lost fathers and
the manager was found to have cancer. The mayor spoke wisely of
confronting the difficulties of life and celebrating life's
triumphs. He spoke of facing sickness and death, and from that
gaining strength and resolve.
</P>
<P>
   The parade and the celebration carried the historic undercurrent
that framed the playoffs: the Arizona Diamondbacks having no
history, the Mets attempting to overcome history. Finally the
classic confrontation: Atlanta's decade vs. the Yankees' century.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, the long view of the celebration was drenched by
history, some of it playful, some of it profound. On this very
date, Oct. 29, in 1889, the New York Giants defeated the Brooklyn
Bridegrooms, 3-2, to win a World Series. On another Oct. 29, in
1920, the Yankees made a hiring move that changed the course of the
franchise and established an unrivaled standard for dominance. New
York hired Ed Barrow, the manager of the Boston Red Sox, to be the
Yankees general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Under Barrow, sour and tightfisted, the Yankees dominated the
next quarter-century, winning 14 pennants and 10 World Series
championships.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani placed the Yankees in the context of a larger, wider
history than baseball. We have come through what has been called _
ruefully by some, proudly by others _ the American Century. To
understand the United States, the mayor said, one must understand
the American Pastime, and to understand the Pastime one must first
understand the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   But to understand the Yankees one must look at the diversity of
the crowd that showed up at City Hall and along the parade route to
celebrate the Yankees. The fans were young, they were old, they
were men and women, they were all variations of white. They were
also all shades of black and brown. What has been striking during
the Yankees' championship runs in the last four years has been the
number of Hispanics, African-Americans and West Indians who
described themselves as die-hard, longtime Yankee fans.
</P>
<P>
   At first I passed this off to a natural inclination to want to
identify with a winner. Certainly there couldn't be an authentic
``minority'' following. The Yankees were one of the last teams to
integrate in the 1950s. As early as 1945, Yankees president Larry
MacPhail openly condemned those who pushed for integrating
baseball, saying they ``knew little about baseball and nothing
about the business end of its operation.''
</P>
<P>
   In his book ``Viva Baseball,'' Professor Samuel Regaldo recounts
how Bill McCory, the Yankees' traveling secretary, vowed that no
black man ``will ever have a berth on any train I'm running.''
Casey Stengel, who managed the Yankees from 1949 to 1960,
frequently made off-color remarks about blacks. In the 1950s and
'60s George Weiss, the architect of that Yankee dynasty, didn't
think that the team's upper-middle class white customers wanted to
mingle with black fans, or that white players wanted to play with
black players. That attitude put up a wall of negative perception
that took decades to tear down.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the plaza and the podium Friday, it was clear the
wall has crumbled. The Yankees' best pitcher is from Cuba; the best
reliever is from Panama; the most popular player is a center
fielder from Puerto Rico, and hosts of sports radio shows are
actually fighting over the racial rights to Derek Jeter, the
Yankees' shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   In this vein Friday's ticker-tape parade for the Yankees offered
the most fitting symmetry. On Oct. 29, 1886, New York City held its
first ticker-tape parade. It was a spontaneous celebration by
office workers who threw ticker tape during a parade held to
celebrate the dedication of the Statue of Liberty. More than a
century later, the Statue is the hopeful symbol of New York's great
immigrant tradition; the championship Yankees are a compelling
microcosm of what can happen when the ingredients mix.

EVENT TO FEATURE ONLY ONE FIRST LADY

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For a brief moment it looked like a do-not-miss
event: Hillary Rodham Clinton and Donna Hanover were to do
``theatrical readings'' next week at a fund-raiser to celebrate a
film about Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton.
</P>
<P>
   But the two women of the 20th century _ one of whom, Ms.
Hanover, is married to Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who is Mrs.
Clinton's likely opponent in their expected U.S. Senate race next
year _ could not seem to get together as the two 19th century
women's rights advocates had. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It started Friday morning, when a press release listing both
names went out from Dan Klores Associates, the public relations
firm handling the event. By Friday afternoon, Ms. Hanover had
canceled. ``Originally she was asked, and she was going to go, but
now she's not going to go,'' said Joannie Danielides, Ms. Hanover's
press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ms. Danielides said that Ms. Hanover did not learn of
Mrs. Clinton's participation in the event until reporters called
Ms. Danielides' office Friday, Ms. Danielides said that Mrs.
Clinton had nothing to do with Ms. Hanover's cancellation. ``She
didn't change her mind; her schedule changed,'' Ms. Danielides
said.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 3, the night of the event at the Hammerstein Ballroom on
West 34th Street, Ms. Danielides said, Ms. Hanover will be
preparing voice-overs for her new job as host of ``House
Beautiful,'' a weekly television show on home design on the Arts &AMP;
Entertainment Network. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hanover, who has rarely attended public events with her
husband since 1996, has in the past said favorable things about
Mrs. Clinton. ``I think she's dynamic, and I think she's very
smart, and she's an amazing speaker,'' Ms. Hanover said last year,
before Mrs. Clinton expressed her interest in the Senate seat. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The fund-raiser is to benefit the National Breast Cancer
Coalition and the American Film Institute. Mrs. Clinton is still
scheduled to attend, as is Libby Pataki, the wife of Gov. George
Pataki. The film, ``Not for Ourselves Alone: The Story of Elizabeth
Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony,'' is directed by Ken Burns and
Paul Barnes.

TYSON CLEAR, BUT UNWANTED IN NEVADA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mike Tyson said he was tired of boxing last weekend after his
aborted bout against Orlin Norris in Las Vegas ended in
controversy. Friday, Nevada boxing officials said they were tired
of him.
</P>
<P>
   Although Tyson escaped with his $8.7 million purse intact
following a 30-minute hearing before the State Athletic Commission,
it was clear the commissioners are tired of seeing Tyson's
attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   The Commission held up paying Tyson following his one-round no
contest against Norris at the MGM Grand Garden Arena, a ruling that
came after he hit Norris a full two seconds after the bell had
sounded five times to end the first round. The blow knocked Norris
to the floor, and he dislocated his knee.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Flip Homansky ruled Norris could not continue and referee
Richard Steele called the punch accidental, as did Norris. That
left the commission with little it could do but release the money,
because to disqualify Tyson would have required it overrule the
judgment of one of the sport's most experienced referees. The
commission was not willing to do that, even though someone with
intimate knowledge of Tyson's style believes the late punch was
premeditated.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know that it's not an accident,'' Evander Holyfield said
from his Houston training camp. ``It's happened his whole career.
People have to stop things before they get started or somebody gets
cracked every time. It's not like it's a secret (with Tyson).
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference is, people are fed up with Tyson now and
they're saying this is not going to be the situation any more. But
if you don't enforce your rules and regulations, you can't really
argue about it. You can't just punish this (one) guy. It has to be
made for all in boxing _ you hit somebody hard enough (after the
bell) you're gonna lose the fight.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the third straight time Tyson fouled an opponent during
a fight in Las Vegas, and although the commission voted, 4-0, to
let the no contest stand, it made clear he may have difficulty
renewing his license next year if he returns to Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not so sure we need him in the state of Nevada any
longer,'' said commissioner Lorenzo Fertitta.
</P>
<P>
   Normally a fighter's license is automatically renewed by the
commission staff if he is under 36 and has boxed fewer than 350
rounds. That will not be the case with Tyson, however. He now must
appear for a hearing if he intends to fight in Nevada again, as he
is expected to do, and any further rules violations in the interim
could put his future in jeopardy. ``We don't need any hoodlums
fighting in the state of Nevada,'' said Dr. Elias Ghanem, chairman
of the commission.
</P>
<P>
   The 4-0 vote came while commissioner Luther Mack was in Atlanta
on business. Mack was highly critical of Tyson after the fight,
saying he should be severely fined. Mack was also openly concerned
about relicensing Tyson after the problems that led the fighter to
serve 3 1/2 months in a Maryland prison on an assault charge
following a fender-bender, but in that case, he voted with the
majority to issue the license.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson's chief Las Vegas attorney, Jim Jimmerson, told the
commission the late blow came ``in the heat of the moment'' _ the
same argument he made after Tyson twice bit Holyfield during their
rematch and was disqualified. He was later fined $3 million and had
his license revoked. It was more than a year before he got it back,
and he had to undergo a battery of psychological tests at
Massachusetts General Hospital and a humiliating public debate over
his psychological fitness to fight.
</P>
<P>
   Why these things keep happening to the explosive ex-champion is
anyone's guess, but Holyfield believes he has an idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lack of confidence,'' Holyfield said. ``He's suffering
from a lot of frustrations. He's finding out a lot of people are
coming and fighting him now. That hurts his ego. Other people are
crowding him. He has to work for his money now. So it's an
intimidating factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't get the last lick in, when you go sit down you've
got to think for a minute about how hard you got hit and you can
kind of panic. But your mind don't think about it if you hit him
last.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tyson has a habit of hitting on the break to try and take your
heart. Fouls, intentional or not, they need to let people know
they're not going to have this.''
</P>
<P>
   The commissioners declined to disqualify Tyson, however, but
warned his handlers that their patience is wearing thin. Perhaps
because of that, promoter Dan Goossen said if Tyson fights in
December, the bout would not be in Nevada. Plans were already afoot
to bring Tyson to Madison Square Garden Feb. 26 to fight Shannon
Briggs, but it now appears if Tyson fights before the end of the
year it, too, would be out of Nevada and possibly out of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   While Tyson is free to fight, Norris is under 90-day suspension
because of his injury. Although his injuries may require surgery
(which means he could not fight regardless), it is a cruel irony
that it is he, not the man who injured him, who today is under
suspension in Nevada.

BOBBING UP IN THE POLLS, MCCAIN IS FEELING BUOYANT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., N.H.)  (mk) 
 By MELINDA HENNEBERGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PETERBOROUGH, N.H. _ Mainlining glazed doughnuts and mixing it
up with reporters in the back of his bus, the Straight Talk
Express, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., really seems to be having the
fun that all presidential candidates talk about having.
</P>
<P>
   And why not?
</P>
<P>
   On Friday he walked into a packed town hall meeting here and
drew an ovation from the crowd of several hundred with this line:
``We had a debate last night, and I think we ought to do more of
that.'' Then he cracked an inside joke that should have been funny
only to those who had been present at an earlier event, many miles
away, and got a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   In between stops, he was surrounded by television cameras, and
asked these questions: Would you say you are surging? Is this a
victory lap? How did you get the momentum going? Are you pleasantly
surprised? Is this the McCain moment?
</P>
<P>
   Recent New Hampshire polls do show McCain gaining some ground on
the Republican front-runner, George W. Bush. The crowds here are
full of people who say they liked the looks of him in Thursday
night's Republican debate, which Bush skipped, and many carry
copies of his best-selling book, ``Faith of My Fathers.'' On
Friday, several who described themselves as independents said they
were torn between McCain and former Sen. Bill Bradley, who is
challenging Vice President Al Gore for the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Like Bradley, McCain is trying not to make too much of the
moment. But as in the Bradley-Gore matchup, there is no comparison
between the free-wheeling underdog's campaign and that of the
orchestrated front-runner. Bush's campaign, for example, recently
threatened to call hotel security to have reporters cleared from a
public hallway at a luncheon in Norfolk, Va., so that they would
not get within shouting distance of him.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who bounced onto his campaign bus at 6:45 Friday morning
in an almost illegally good mood _ wearing the black, rubber-soled
Easy Spirit shoes that he bought on the day of the first Republican
debate, a week ago, and now considers his lucky shoes _ was, on the
other hand, completely accessible throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   Nipping into his second doughnut _ ``I try to keep it to three
or four a day'' _ he made self-deprecating wisecracks in between
long, complicated answers about the recently rejected nuclear test
ban treaty, which he felt should never have been brought to a vote.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke of an absence of the kind of bipartisan leadership that
had until recently characterized foreign policy since World War II,
and said, ``We really have not responded either structurally or
psychologically to the end of the Cold War, even after nine
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Which, of course, brought him back to his favorite topic:
getting special-interest money out of politics. Part of the reason
the military has not been properly restructured, he says, is that
lawmakers are beholden to defense contractors.
</P>
<P>
   He calls overhauling the way elections are financed a ``gateway
reform,'' because education cannot be improved until Americans
``break the back of the teachers' union'' lobbying against
experiments with vouchers or charter schools, and a patients' bill
of rights cannot be enacted as long as drug companies exert so much
influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trial lawyers control the Democrats,'' he said, ``and the
drug companies and HMOs control the Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But then again, the senator was joking and telling stories on
himself, like one about how he lied about his age when he met his
much younger wife, Cindy. An aide briefed him on the first event of
the day, a town hall meeting at a school in Walpole, population
4,000, saying, ``It's a very small town.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So they'll believe anything,'' he replied, ``is that what
you're saying?''
</P>
<P>
   His biggest applause lines there were: We should pay our U.N.
dues, we should pay teachers better, and, with regard to the World
Series, ``I grew up loving Ted Williams, therefore I was a Red Sox
fan, therefore I hated the Yankees, therefore there goes the New
York vote.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain took several questions on foreign policy, saying the next
president would have to pay extra attention to it because of the
``feckless photo-op foreign policy that this administration has
conducted.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This administration is always surprised,'' he said, ``because
it's totally reactive. It's the first administration in history in
which the president, the secretary of state and the national
security adviser have never spent one minute wearing a uniform.''
</P>
<P>
   Again, he was interrupted by applause.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Steven Sodders, an 18-year-old who cannot wait to
vote for the first time, said he thought McCain could ``energize
the youth vote.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a state that hates front-runners,'' Sodders said,
``and he's the only Republican who has more going than a nebulous
stump speech.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   How would McCain feel if this happy moment on the trail did not
last?
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go in and you're not afraid to lose, you're OK,'' he
said. ``The ones I've seen be sorry, whether it's a presidential
campaign or a campaign for sheriff, are the people who want it so
badly that it makes you do things you later regret, like run a
nasty campaign or take a position you know is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain seems in little danger of doing either. At the debate on
Thursday night and elsewhere, he has passed up chances to take
shots at Bush. And like Bradley, he seems to have no trouble
telling voters that he disagrees with them. At another public
forum, at Keene State College, he argued with no fewer than three
members of the audience, and seemed, if anything, to enjoy those
exchanges even more.
</P>
<P>
   Told by a self-described lifelong Democrat that America's
history was not so pure as McCain would like to think, he said: ``I
know you disagree, but we were fighting to keep communists from
taking over America, and that forced us into some very unsavory
alliances. I firmly reject your notion that we're not the most
noble. It's almost an insult to those whose bones rest in what were
once killing fields.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, he had to be physically pulled back onto the bus and
away from a spirited debate with a Native American woman from
Alaska. She: ``The caribou was displaced.'' He: ``They were not
displaced. These are called the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   Then on here to Peterborough, where Don Stoops, a retired
teacher, said he was torn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I'm on the fence between him and Bradley,'' Stoops said.
``I like both of them for their honesty.''

MORE THAN 50 GOLF CHAMPIONS ATTEND PAYNE STEWART'S FUNERAL  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ It was a memorial service that fit the
personality of Payne Stewart _ emotional, humorous, unique and
unforgettable.
</P>
<P>
   More than 3,000 people came to First Baptist Church of Orlando
Friday to pay their respects to Stewart, one of six people who died
Monday in a plane crash. In his opening remarks, the Rev. J.B.
Collingsworth, the pastor, warned that the service would bring both
laughter and tears. He was right, as the 90-minute service
reflected on the many sides of Stewart, who lived his 42 years to
the fullest, touching people round the world.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart's accomplishments as a golfer were well known to sports
fans who watched Stewart win two U.S. Open championships, a PGA
Championship and 18 tournaments worldwide. But those closest to
Stewart knew that his family and his faith mattered the most to
him. Making her first public appearance since her husband's death,
Tracey Stewart spoke at the service, as the couple's daughter and
son, 13-year-old Chelsea and 10-year-old Aaron, sat in the church's
front row. Tracey Stewart described Payne as a devoted husband and
father, as a devout Christian and as someone who could not be
replaced in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I met Payne, I thought he was the most beautiful man I
had ever seen in my life,'' she said. ``After 18 years of marriage,
he was still the most beautiful man I had ever seen, not because of
the way he looked on the outside anymore, but because of what he
was on the inside.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 of the world's most prominent golfers attended the
service. Many of them are competing in the Tour Championship in
Houston, which was suspended for the day to allow players to attend
the service. The Southern Farm Bureau Classic in Madison, Miss.,
another PGA Tour event, was also suspended for the day. Tiger
Woods, Davis Love III, Phil Mickelson, Hal Sutton and Justin
Leonard were among those who arrived on charter flights Thursday
night from Houston. Others, like Jack Nicklaus, Greg Norman and
Fred Couples, traveled from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't show up because he was a golfer,'' Brad Faxon said.
``We showed up because he was a special guy.''
</P>
<P>
   At the front of the massive church, many belongings of Stewart's
were on display, including his U.S. Open and PGA Championship
trophies, a pair of his trademark knickers and family portraits.
His children left more personal artifacts, including a bottle of
Rogaine, some fake buck teeth and a framed message that said: ``We
love you Dad. We will miss you.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a picture of Stewart and Aaron, taken at last week's
father-son tournament at the National Car Rental Classic at Walt
Disney World Resort here, the last tournament in which Stewart
competed. Stewart missed the cut last week, but that allowed him to
watch Aaron play football. Aaron scored a touchdown, and Stewart
was there to cheer. Friday Aaron's teammates were sitting in the
church, wearing their jerseys in support of their friend.
</P>
<P>
   Once the service started, it was an emotional roller coaster.
There were musical tributes from the recording artists Michael W.
Smith and Vince Gill, who wrote a song this week titled, ``Hey,
God,'' in tribute to his friend Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Several of Stewart's closest friends told intimate stories.
Chuck Cook, his golf coach, recalled relaxing at Pebble Beach with
Stewart when he was approached by an overbearing fan who questioned
Stewart's identity.
</P>
<P>
   ```Some guy says that you're Payne Stewart, and I don't believe
it,''' Cook recalled. ``Payne said: `Suppose I go get the U.S. Open
trophy, and you keep filling it up with whatever I want to drink.
Will that prove it to you?'''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart then told the bartender to pour some very expensive
champagne, courtesy of the humbled man.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may be the only guy I know who was sorry he met Payne
Stewart,'' Cook said.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Azinger, the 1993 PGA champion, began his remarks by
rolling up his pants into his socks, knickers style, and donning a
tam-o'-shanter as people in the church applauded. Azinger then told
about Stewart ruining the engine on a fishing boat by starting it
while it was still parked in the garage, causing the engine to
explode.
</P>
<P>
   ``Payne wasn't the most mechanically inclined person I've ever
met,'' Azinger said. ``When the engine popped, flames shot up to
the ceiling. He almost burned the house down.''
</P>
<P>
   But a few minutes later, Azinger pulled his pants out of his
socks, took off his hat and became serious. Before he could finish
his remarks, he was crying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trying to cope with the magnitude of this tragedy is one of
the most difficult things I've ever had to do,'' said Azinger, who
was also close with two other victims in Monday's crash, Van Ardan
and Robert Fraley, Stewart's agents.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the service, Collingsworth instructed members of the
church to pass out bracelets to everyone in attendance that were
inscribed with the letters WWJD, which stands for What Would Jesus
Do. Stewart wore a similar bracelet every day, which was a gift
from Aaron. Collingsworth asked the players to wear the bracelets
on the golf course when the Tour Championship resumes Saturday in
honor of Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of the service, a heart-tugging video of Stewart
was played on a screen in the front of the church. During the
video, Stewart was shown being interviewed, saying that he knew he
was going to a special place when he died.
</P>
<P>
   In the last several years of his life, Stewart's personality
changed because of his renewed religious faith. There were times
early in his career when Stewart could be abrupt or surly,
particularly when he was not playing well. But he had found inner
peace, and he contributed to numerous charities in the Orlando
area.
</P>
<P>
   After winning the U.S. Open this year and being part of last
month's winning Ryder Cup team, Stewart had never seemed more
content.
</P>
<P>
   ``Payne said, `I don't have any more goals,''' Cook said. ``
`I'm having a hard time getting motivated. I'm so happy. I just
want to stay home.'''
</P>
<P>
   When the service ended, players from the tour lined up along the
center aisle of the church, then Stewart's family filed out between
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the service was absolutely beautiful,'' said Mets
pitcher Orel Hershiser, a friend of Stewart's. ``I'm glad the video
wasn't any longer. I couldn't continue to watch, knowing that he's
gone.''

DEL MAR GRAY IS SOLID FAVORITE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA, Calif. _ Ed Friendly, the ``Laugh-In'' producer whose
gelding Del Mar Gray should have the strongest stretch kick in
today's $250,000 California Cup Classic, said he wishes defending
champion Budroyale weren't passing up the race.
</P>
<P>
   And he wasn't laughing when he said it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to take a shot at whipping his butt,'' Friendly
said.
</P>
<P>
   Friendly can talk so boldly since, with California-bred stars
Budroyale and General Challenge competing at next weekend's
Breeders' Cup instead, Del Mar Gray is a solid favorite among the
seven horses remaining at Santa Anita for this afternoon's 1[-mile
race for Cal-breds aged 3 and up.
</P>
<P>
   Del Mar Gray, a gray (of course) 4-year-old trained by Bob
Baffert and ridden by Alex Solis, has been assigned a race-high 118
pounds because of the quality of his victories. He's the only horse
in the field with $100,000 stakes victories showing in his
past-performance chart.
</P>
<P>
   Those victories came on the turf courses at Hollywood Park in
July and Bay Meadows last time out in September. Today's race is on
the main track.
</P>
<P>
   But Del Mar Gray has run well on the main track too. He was
second to Budroyale on the Hollywood Park dirt in June.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the son of Gray Slewpy will be tripped up by this curious
trend: None of the previous Cal Cup Classic winners _ a list led by
the popular Best Pal (1993) _ won his previous start.
</P>
<P>
   Without the prohibitive favorite that either General Challenge
or Budroyale would have been, the race presents a nice handicapping
puzzle, with 3-year-olds facing older horses; horses coming out of
races at Santa Anita, Bay Meadows, Fairplex Park and even a
Canadian track; horses who ran at four distances and on both
surfaces last time; and three horses (Warm April, Lesters Boy and
Smoky Cinder) with pace-setting speed.
</P>
<P>
   The field in post-position order: Warm April, Lesters Boy, Smoky
Cinder, Prestigious Chief, Bagshot, Splendid Splinter and Del Mar
Gray.
</P>
<P>
   The Cal Cup Classic is the main event among 10 races, with
purses totaling $1.275 million, restricted to Cal-bred horses. The
10th edition of the state's thoroughbred breeding industry showcase
starts at noon and is expected to draw up to 30,000 fans to Santa
Anita.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ A Mexican government plan to charge travelers who
drive cars with American plates into Mexico a deposit of up to $800
has provoked expressions of dismay from critics who say it could
persuade hundreds of thousands of tourists to cancel plans for
travel to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The new regulation was written to crack down on illegal car
imports, but experts estimated that half or more of the 800,000
people who receive car permits for Mexico each year would make
other travel plans rather than pay the large deposits.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new rules, the deposit required to drive into Mexico
is to rise from the current $11 to $400 for a U.S.-registered car
manufactured before 1994, to $600 for cars made from 1994 to 1998,
and to $800 for a 1999 or later model. The deposit, which is
refunded on the car's return to the United States, applies only to
cars used to drive beyond the 15-mile border zone.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican Customs officers were originally instructed to begin
collecting the new deposits in cash on Nov. 1. But after the plan
drew fire from residents along the border and from politicians in
Washington and Mexico City, officials postponed it late Thursday
and amended it to allow for credit card payment. The new plan is to
take effect Dec. 1, the Mexican Treasury Ministry said in a
statement Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our problem with illegal vehicles is serious,'' said Marco
Provencio, a Treasury Ministry spokesman. ``We understand the
complaints about this program, but the law is the law and we have
the right to enforce it.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those criticizing the plan were several American
congressmen and hundreds of Mexican-Americans who have been calling
television and radio stations from Texas to California.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who are going to suffer most are from the
Mexican-American community, because when you have to pay $600 or
$800, people just don't have the money,'' said Rep. Solomon Ortiz,
D-Texas. ``This will affect businesses, families, tourism. There
are meetings all up and down the border, people are getting
together and there will be demonstrations because this is unfair. I
hope they rethink this or there's going to be chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   Even several Mexican officials have criticized the program as
unfair to the 2 million Mexican workers who drive home from the
United States for Christmas and Easter. The plan, authored by
Mexican Treasury officials, has unleashed a slugfest inside the
government, with special opposition coming from Mexican consular
officials based in the United States, one Mexican official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a horrifying error,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Carla Felsted, a co-editor of Mexico Meanderings, an Austin,
Texas, newsletter about vacationing by car in Mexico, said half her
readers would probably cancel plans to vacation in Mexico rather
than pay the deposits.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're going to charge that much to your credit card, even
with the promise of cash back on leaving, that's going to keep at
least 50 percent of Americans from going,'' Ms. Felsted said. ``If
they charge $11 to your credit card, that's OK. But $800, now
that'll really get your attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Because used cars often cost less than half as much in the
United States as in Mexico, 1.5 million used cars are currently
circulating in Mexico illegally, with no Mexican plates. The
illegal cars are often used by criminals, and since their owners
pay no taxes, the situation represents a serious drain on
government revenues, said Provencio. The 14 million legally
registered cars in Mexico provide $800 million in tax revenues each
year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under current rules, travelers who wish to drive cars with
American plates into Mexico at any of the 23 legal crossing points
along the 2,000-mile border can receive a six-month permit by
paying an $11 deposit with their credit card. Two other cash-based
options are far more expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new rules originally proposed by the Treasury
Ministry, travelers' were to pay the new $400 to $800 deposits only
in cash, and the deposits were to be redeemable only at the same
border crossing through which travelers had entered Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   After a flood of criticism, officials amended the new rules to
allow for payment by credit card and to allow the redemption of the
deposits at any border crossing, Carlos Bandala Serrano, the
central administrator of the Mexican customs agency, said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Customs officials and Banjercito, the army-owned bank that
handles the border deposits, will need several weeks to
``fine-tune'' computer communications among the 23 border stations
to allow officials to process the credit card deposits and cash
redemptions at any point along the border, Bandala said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A Mexican official who criticized the new plan said it would
force the government to keep large amounts of cash stockpiled at
each border station, inviting robbery or graft.
</P>
<P>
   The new regulation reflects a hardened determination to crack
down on the illegal auto imports, which have posed an increasingly
ticklish political problem. For several decades, successive
governments did little to enforce Mexico's vehicle importation
laws. Instead, police allowed the cars to accumulate on the streets
until, every six years during the presidential election campaign,
successive candidates of the governing party would promise to
legalize the vehicles, thus buying votes from hundreds of thousands
of illegal car owners.
</P>
<P>
   But this year a consensus has emerged within the establishment
of the governing party, known as the PRI, that the cars pose too
serious a problem to play politics. Francisco Labastida Ochoa, the
PRI's leading presidential candidate, has refused several times
this year to promise to legalize them.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the PRI governor of Chihuahua took a different stand
when he began selling authorization stickers for illegal cars there
for $300, brushing aside protests from federal officials. The
Treasury Ministry retaliated by withholding federal funds from
Chihuahua, and the case ended in court. A district judge has sided
with the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   This political background, as well as the increasing use made of
the illegal vehicles by drug traffickers and others to commit
crimes, appears to have persuaded the government that it must
prevent further illegal importation of cars at all costs.
</P>
<P>
   The new deposits are part of a broader package of new rules
governing cross-border travel, some of which are already being
implemented at the border. And there are signs that confusion
surrounding the new program is being aggravated by the traditional
communications problems between Mexico City and the border.
</P>
<P>
   Juani Martinez, a Mexican woman with legal American residency in
Corpus Christi, Texas, said that for 15 years she has renewed her
Mexican car permit every six months. But earlier this month,
customs officials refused to renew her permit, saying she was now
eligible for only one six-month permit each year.
</P>
<P>
   Bandala said that there has been no change in the frequency with
which car owners can apply to renew their permits. But Ms. Martinez
said customs officials at the border were emphatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked, `Why are you denying me this permit?' and they said,
`People in the capital city told us this is the new law,''' Ms.
Martinez said. On Wednesday, Ms. Martinez organized a meeting in
Corpus Christi to develop protests of the new rules.

CSUN'S JONES A STAND-UP GUY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The program was investigated, the head coach got
fired, the offensive coordinator resigned, there was the huge loss
at Kansas, and just recently a student vote that could have
provided financing for a new stadium was cancelled.
</P>
<P>
   But there is Shawnbay Jones, making his Cal State Northridge
football teammates smile and laugh and forget reality. On a team
full of guys who seem like they could take their act to the Comedy
Store, Jones may be the wackiest.
</P>
<P>
   ``He likes to enjoy himself,'' CSUN defensive-line coach David
Robinson said. ``He always wants to be fidgeting or talking. It's
almost like he's teasing everybody. There's also times it drives
you nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, a senior defensive lineman, is a 6-foot-3, 265-pound
12-year-old. He's the classic cut-up, a person who needs to make
those around him laugh and smile _ even though he admits he can be
infuriating.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody does something to make the coaches mad,'' Jones
said, ``the next practice I'll try to emulate that, what he did (to
make them mad), just to get a rise out of the coaches. It keeps
everybody cool, everybody happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we get a little bit of laughter out there, it makes it a
cool day.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones' personality is a hit with his teammates, even if some of
his best stuff can't be published in a family newspaper. Levi Line,
a junior defensive lineman who rooms with Jones on the road,
remembers one practice when Jones snuck into another drill: ``I saw
him playing defensive back. That was pretty funny.''
</P>
<P>
   ``On the field, he's our character,'' Line said. ``When it comes
down to it, though, he's a gentleman. He'll spend hours at a time
talking to his girlfriend. That's when the true Shawnbay comes
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, Jones got into trouble in high school. He said he
wasn't a serious student at Center High, near Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would put my mind to making people laugh instead of my
books,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he's a serious student and also an emerging force for a
defense that has risen from dead last to sixth in the Big Sky
Conference in the span of two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Jones had 12 tackles, including seven for loss, in the Matadors'
24-21 win at Montana State last week. He also got his fifth sack,
giving him 11 in two seasons at CSUN. For the year, Jones has 47
tackles, including a team-leading 16 behind the line of scrimmage.
He also forced a fumble.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is only my third year of playing defense end,'' said
Jones, a former linebacker, ``and now that I've gotten into that
groove, so to speak, it feels way more easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, who's in his first year coaching at CSUN, said he's
seen significant progress from Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's starting to be more consistent and also making the big
plays,'' he said. ``He's a good, athletic player.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson and CSUN's other coaches can take solace, though, in
knowing they only have Jones for four more games. Then they can put
away the aspirin.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to coach me, I'd put me in a corner or something,''
Jones said. ``Once (coaches) get to know me, they say I'm better
with my mouth shut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I beg to differ.''

CLINTON ATTENDS RALLY IN PHILADELPHIA, BUT IS DOUBTFUL ABOUT
ENDORSEMENTS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MARC LACEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ President Clinton raised doubts Friday about
whether presidents can sway the results of local elections, even as
he came to the aid of a Democratic mayoral candidate here who is in
danger of losing City Hall to a Republican for the first time in
half a century.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want you to know I came here not as president to tell you
how to vote,'' Clinton said at a rally at LaSalle University for
John F. Street, a city councilman in a tight race. ``But I hope you
will listen to me as someone who has tried to be a good friend to
Philadelphia.''
</P>
<P>
   As the president made a spirited endorsement of Street, the
candidate smiled broadly at his side. Philadelphia voters are
registered 4-to-1 Democratic, but Street's campaign is facing a
strong challenge from Republican businessman, Sam Katz, only four
days before Tuesday's election.
</P>
<P>
   What should have been a runaway election for Street has turned
neck and neck in public opinion polls. Both local newspapers have
endorsed Katz, whose campaign has shown an appeal among Democrats
that is making Street's backers anxious. Katz, who is white, is
even challenging Street, a former City Council president who is
black, for the support of Democratic black and Hispanic voters.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton's own campaigning days are over, he clearly
cannot get the excitement of campaigning out of his blood. Besides
his visit here, the president in recent days has taped a radio
advertisement for Street, lent his name to campaign mailers and, in
a telephone call to the host of a local radio talk show, pressed
for the election of Street. In that conversation, Clinton warned
that a Republican victory in the mayoral race here could be bad
news for Democrats in next year's congressional and presidential
elections.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech Friday, the president said he was mystified by
newspaper accounts of the campaign that portrayed Street, who is
56, as lacking vision and charisma. ``This is a young, vigorous,
brilliant, committed public servant,'' Clinton said. ``You heard
him up here today. His heart is on fire for the children and the
future of the city. He has all the experience in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The president recalled that former President Ronald Reagan had
visited Arkansas to endorse the Republican challenger when Clinton
was running for re-election as governor, and said the endorsement
had little effect on the outcome. Clinton's last endorsement
effort, when he went to New Orleans last month on behalf of William
J. Jefferson, the Democratic candidate for governor of Louisiana,
was similarly fruitless.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Jefferson, a 52-year-old congressman who sought to
become Louisiana's first black governor, lost soundly to the
incumbent, Mike Foster, a Republican. With this in mind, Clinton
said he purposely did not pull out his ``big, whoop-de-do political
speech.'' He even offered a backhanded compliment to Katz, saying
that he was campaigning well and ``singing a good song,'' but would
be judged in the end on whether he could deliver.
</P>
<P>
   Street and Katz have debated three times, outlining their
differences on school vouchers, economic development and other
issues. Although the campaign has been remarkably free of attacks,
Street has sought to cast his rival as a Republican who is new to
politics and out of touch with the city's needs.
</P>
<P>
   Katz, 49, has played up his experience in business, where he has
been a sports world dealmaker, and stresses his genial personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``People get excited when they find out I can tap a keg with the
best of them,'' Katz said in an interview in The Philadelphia
Inquirer, adding that he had ``danced the chicken dance in the
German American Festival.''
</P>
<P>
   Street's backers were confident that Clinton's eleventh-hour
appearance would be enough to attract undecided Democrats _ the
group that both campaigns agree will be critical in determining the
successor to Mayor Ed Rendell, who is retiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have the president in town, it has to make a
difference,'' said Joseph Rauscher, president of the Philadelphia
Council of the AFL-CIO, whose members are telephoning registered
voters on Street's behalf. ``The man is loved by just about
everyone in this town.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Bob Barnett, the campaign director for Katz, is a Clinton
supporter. But Barnett, a Democrat who campaigned for Clinton and
served in his administration as head of the Overseas Private
Investment Corp., said his former boss was right that local issues,
not a Presidential endorsement, would decide the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``When President Clinton leaves, the abandoned car on the street
is still there,'' Barnett said. ``This is not about foreign policy
or the nuclear test ban treaty. Philadelphia has not reacted well
to people coming in from out of town to tell them how to vote.''
</P>
<P>
   The Katz campaign considered it a day like any other. While the
president lavished praise on Street, Katz spoke at a center for the
elderly. Later, he greeted voters at a bar and appeared on a local
television station's ``meet the candidates'' night.

A DAY OFF, SANCTIONED BY THE CITY'S TOP FAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also BBO-YANKS-PARADE) 
(js) 
 By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Just before 10 a.m. Friday, a dozen teen-agers from
the Upper West Side on their way to the Yankee victory parade
jammed into the tail end of the downtown No. 1 train _ their boom
box blaring, cigarettes smoking and a bottle of Cointreau passing
between them.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are, this was not exactly the experience in
``alternative education'' that Mayor Rudolph Giuliani had in mind
when he suggested a field trip to the parade for students who would
otherwise be in school. But thousands of young New Yorkers, from
within the city and without, were nevertheless eager to take the
mayor up on the idea.
</P>
<P>
   City high schools experienced a ``considerable drop'' in
attendance Friday, said Margie Feinberg, a spokeswoman for the
Board of Education. About 64 percent of students showed up for
school (80 percent attendance is considered normal).
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when Giuliani was more circumspect in his suggestion
that students might benefit from going to the parade, high school
attendance declined by 13 percentage points. High schools had
planned a half-day session Friday for parent-teacher conferences,
and that, too, might have affected attendance.
</P>
<P>
   Middle schools and elementary schools in the city experienced
little to no decline, Ms. Feinberg said. In middle schools, about
83 percent of the students were in their seats, slightly below the
normal 89 percent, and in elementary schools, attendance was normal
at 91 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Even some students from outside the city said Giuliani's
exhortations steeled their decision to play hooky.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't going to come, but we heard that Mayor Giuliani
said it was OK,'' said Rich Ventura, 16, who was part of a group of
students from Sewanhaka High School in Floral Park, N.Y., who
boarded a No. 2 train in Times Square headed downtown. ``I figured
if the mayor of New York said it was OK to miss school, it was OK''
</P>
<P>
   The teen-ager did not, however, envision writing an essay about
the experience, as suggested by Giuliani. ``It will give us a day
we'll remember, though,'' he added.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some students agreed with Giuliani's thought that the parade
offered a chance to contemplate ``the ongoing social situation''
and ``civic unity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting to see all kinds of people get together for just
one thing,'' said Kyle Boyd, 17, who made the journey from
Mattituck on the North Fork of Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   One student even compared the parade to a sort of Career Day
event with insights on the toils and rewards of life as a
professional athlete. ``I want to be a baseball player,'' said
Emmanuel Ortiz, 15, who attends the High School for Humanities in
Manhattan. ``So I want to see what the players are like.''

U.S. ATTORNEY WON'T PROSECUTE OFFICER IN SHOOTING DEATH OF DRIVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By TINA KELLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. _ The U.S. attorney for Connecticut announced
Friday that he would not prosecute a white police officer in the
1997 shooting death of a young black driver. The announcement ended
a 20-month investigation into possible civil rights violations by
the officer, who had been cleared of any criminal wrongdoing in
state and local investigations.
</P>
<P>
   The case has been one of several recently in Connecticut and New
Jersey that brought attention to assertions that police officers
treat members of minority groups unfairly during traffic stops.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation by U.S. Attorney Stephen Robinson found that
the officer in the case, Robert Flodquist of the East Haven Police
Department, did not follow proper police procedures when he
approached Malik Jones, 21, after a high-speed chase, because he
did not wait for other officers to arrive, the recommended
procedure for arresting someone in a dangerous situation. Officers
had been pursuing Jones after receiving a report that he was
driving erratically.
</P>
<P>
   Flodquist shot Jones four times after Jones' car backed toward
him, according to the report, and Flodquist feared for his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on all of the information we have been able to gather,
we find that there is reason to believe Officer Flodquist did not
act in full accordance with the police guidance regarding the safe
management of this vehicle stop,'' Robinson said during a press
conference. ``However, this factor is insufficient to establish a
violation of federal law.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said he was also unsure whether the officer's mistakes
led directly to Jones' death. ``There were a lot of points along
this scenario where if one or the other person acted differently,
this tragedy would not have occurred,'' he said. Investigations
concluded that before the shooting, Jones, who was not armed, had
consumed alcohol and a hallucinogenic drug that can sometimes cause
aggressive behavior.
</P>
<P>
   After the Jones shooting, the Connecticut Legislature passed a
law against ``racial profiling,'' a practice in which officers stop
or question someone because of race. The law, which took effect
this month, requires officers to record the race of drivers they
pull over for traffic violations and their reasons for doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said that he expects some people to be upset with his
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a terrible tragedy, and there are people very close to
this incident, who I think it would be unfair to expect to sit back
and take an objective view of these events,'' he said. Robinson
said he had spoken to Jones' father about his decision before
making it public, adding, ``It's fair to say he had a positive
reaction, although this is not the result they wanted to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Moniz, a Hartford lawyer who is representing Jones'
family in a suit against the police, said he was disappointed with
the results of Robinson's investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those words are of no comfort to the family. The family's
interest is to have Flodquist go to court, for a jury to determine
if he has done anything wrong,'' Moniz said. ``It's like killing
him again.''
</P>
<P>
   He questioned some of the findings of the investigation,
including one that Jones was backing up fast enough to endanger the
officer.
</P>
<P>
   The East Haven Police Department referred questions to their
lawyer, who did not return two phone calls this afternoon.
Flodquist, who is still employed by the department, was not
available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Vann, president of the state chapter of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said his group
will seek changes in the law governing criminal civil rights
violations.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, civil rights investigations focus on the instant the
decision is made to shoot, not on the events leading to the
decision. Vann said allegations that police were trying to pull
over Jones solely based on his race should be relevant to any
decision about whether his civil rights were violated.

<P>
   Dr. Theodor H. Benzinger, a medical researcher who invented the
ear thermometer and a device to measure calorie loss, died on
Tuesday at a retirement home in Bethesda, Md. He was 94.
</P>
<P>
   Benzinger worked at the Naval Medical Research Institute in
Bethesda from 1947 to 1970. He studied temperature regulation and
helped create the related field of biothermodynamics. He held
patents on 40 inventions, the most famous the ear thermometer,
which he developed in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   A former colleague, Dr. Lutz A. Kiesow, said Benzinger had been
keenly interested in how the body maintains its narrow range of
temperature, and in its deviations during fever and hypothermia.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; He developed the ear thermometer while searching for a way to
take a person's temperature and get a reading as close as possible
to the brain temperature, which regulates the core body temperature
and is found in the hypothalamus, at the base of the brain.
</P>
<P>
   Because the hypothalamus and the eardrum share blood vessels,
Benzinger decided to use the ear canal to take a reading, Kiesow
said.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, attaching electrodes to the hypothalamus was the
only way to get a brain temperature reading. Benzinger once had
electrodes implanted in his hypothalamus, Kiesow said, to compare
his brain temperature and the temperature of his eardrum.
</P>
<P>
   Until Benzinger's invention, temperatures could be routinely
taken only by inserting a thermometer into the mouth or the rectum
or under the arm. But ``the ear is clearly the best, because it
most closely correlates to the brain temperature,'' said Kiesow,
chief of research at Legacy Health Systems, a hospital group in
Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   A few years earlier, working in the field of chemical
thermodynamics, Benzinger developed the microcalorimeter, a device
that measures small amounts of heat given off in a chemical
reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very important phenomenon,'' Kiesow said, ``as it
shows why chemical reactions proceed and how much they proceed.''
</P>
<P>
   Benzinger then built a larger version of the microcalorimeter,
the human calorimeter, which measures the amount of heat radiating
from a person.
</P>
<P>
   Theodor Hannes Benzinger was born in Stuttgart, Germany, on
April 13, 1905. He graduated from the University of Tuebingen and
earned a medical degree at the University of Freiburg, where he did
research before becoming director of the medical department of the
German air forces testing center in 1934.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next decade and throughout World War II, Benzinger, who
was also a test pilot, researched issues like decompression and
high-altitude physiology. He discovered, for example, that it is
air embolisms that sometimes cause death in explosions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Following a blast,'' Kiesow explained, ``a pressure wave leads
to a rapid expansion and contraction of blood vessels in the
lungs.''
</P>
<P>
   Benzinger came to the United States in 1947 and was naturalized
in 1955. After retiring from the Naval Medical Research Institute
in 1970 as director of the bioenergetics division, he worked for
four years at the National Institute of Standards and Technology,
in Gaithersburg, Md. It was there that he developed the
Planck-Benzinger equation, which modified the second law of
thermodynamics.
</P>
<P>
   The second law of thermodynamics essentially states that nothing
lasts, because friction reduces energy in a process called entropy.
The Planck-Benzinger modification introduced important new
mathematical components that affect the energy balance in
calculations involving the basic thermodynamic equation.
</P>
<P>
   Benzinger is survived by his wife, Dr. Maria Benzinger, of
Bethesda; four children, Rolf Benzinger of Charlottesville, Va.,
Angela Klose of Bad Soden, Germany, Monika Uttermann of Bad Honnef,
Germany, and Fay Ann Benzinger-Wilson of Bethesda; a stepson,
Robert Henke of Lutherville, Md.; a sister, Maja Ottens of
Kirchheim, Germany; six grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York Knicks spent their languid preseason
searching for something to inspire them to begin a sequel to their
dramatic success last season. At times, you could almost see them
look at their director, coach Jeff Van Gundy, and ask: What's my
motivation?
</P>
<P>
   No opposing team has shown disrespect. Not when the Knicks are
the defending Eastern Conference champions. No one has scrutinized
their play. Not with Latrell Sprewell's contract decisions
overshadowing their 2-6 exhibition record.
</P>
<P>
   So, they wait. They seem to believe that, at some point,
adversity will come along like smelling salts and awaken them from
their malaise. Just like last season. It took a desperate situation
_ almost missing the playoffs for the first time in 12 years _
before the Knicks started playing as a unit instead of showcasing
their one-on-one talents.
</P>
<P>
   The same scenario could play out again. But it is risky for the
Knicks to depend on desperation to prod their emotions and solve
their habitual problems: high turnovers, low assists and inadequate
late-game defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't learned from last year,'' Allan Houston said after
the Knicks blew another fourth-quarter lead and lost their final
preseason game to the Nets in overtime Thursday night. ``I think
what we have to do is our mentality has to change, somehow.
Hopefully, the first month of the season can be a challenge, and we
can treat it that way, because it seems like we need a challenge to
play well.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenge is a bit daunting. The Knicks will open their
season at Madison Square Garden on Tuesday against the Cleveland
Cavaliers. Then they will play 10 of their next 12 games on the
road.
</P>
<P>
   Through the preseason, the Knicks' go-to players, Houston and
Sprewell, have flashed their brilliance, but only between crucial
fourth-quarter turnovers and untimely lapses on defense. When Larry
Johnson is not on the floor, the Knicks grope for a vocal leader.
When they think of the court as their personal showroom, they
revert to the kind of individual play that haunted them last
spring, until they finally got it with eight games to go in the
regular season. ``It's reflective of our mind-set,'' Van Gundy
said. ``We haven't had our mind on basketball since the end of last
season. So, that's how it is. You get out of the game what you put
into it, and we've put in very little.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy's anxiety is not widely shared in the Knicks' locker
room. While slightly disturbed by their preseason play, few players
have been shaken out of their disinterested demeanor. At times, the
whole team has seemed distracted, particularly Sprewell, who was
preoccupied with sorting through his contract options this week. He
finished the preseason shooting 41.1 percent, averaging 16.9 points
a game and a team-high 3.9 turnovers a night.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to get alarmed about the preseason. But Houston is
one of a handful of Knicks who are baffled over why they have to
invent a motivation to get themselves going.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's discouraging, starting with me and everyone else, it's
not like we've got a lot of new players,'' Houston said. ``It's our
mental state right now. I don't know what to say about it, but
we've shown what we can do when we mentally apply ourselves and
stay hungry. We haven't done that. It's like we weren't treating
this preseason seriously. At some point, you have to kick in and
show some pride and maturity. That's what we need to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on early indications, the Knicks are in need of some drama
in order to perform.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can always make basketball a priority, and that's what we
did last year,'' Van Gundy said. ``We started to get it, what it
takes to win. The unfortunate part is we learned nothing.''

JULIO MARTINEZ, EX-DRUG OFFICIAL, DIES AT 55 OF CANCER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Puerto Rico, Fla.)   By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Julio Martinez, a former drug addict who helped found
the Phoenix House and Project Return programs for addicts and who
eventually became the director of New York State's drug treatment
programs, died on Thursday at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx. He was
55 and lived in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said his cousin Ray Colon.
</P>
<P>
   Although Martinez was forced to give up his state post in 1989
because of questions about his financial practices, he was a key
figure in the restoration and expansion of drug treatment programs
both in New York State and around the nation, and in the shift from
state-operated rehabilitation to community-based treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Today, largely as a result of his policies, instead of about 20
state-run treatment centers there are almost 1,000 community-based
centers in New York, treating addicts near their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell S. Rosenthal, the president of Phoenix House, said
Friday that Martinez had been responsible for building in New York
State ``the nation's strongest network of substance abuse treatment
programs.''
</P>
<P>
   These programs had been severely cut after Gov. Nelson
Rockefeller's decision in 1973 to combat the drug epidemic chiefly
with incarceration rather than treatment, which he thought was both
costly and ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez was one of those who vigorously protested. When
hundreds of lobbyists opposing the cut went to Albany for a rally
called ``The City of the Forgotten,'' Martinez was so prominent
that he was called ``the mayor of the City of the Forgotten'' by
the protesters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The event helped bring about a raising of consciousness in the
state about the effectiveness of community-based services,'' said
Lee Sharp, an addiction program specialist at the New York State
Office of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Services, the state agency
created in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   In a budget crisis in the early 1980s, when Gov. Hugh Carey
asked all state agencies to prepare plans for drastic cuts _
including a list of staff members whose jobs would be eliminated _
Martinez, who was then director of the New York State Drug and
Substance Abuse Services, complied by submitting a list with his
own name at the top.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of the other commissioners had thought of suggesting the
elimination of their own jobs,'' recalled Norwig Debye-Saxinger, a
Phoenix House executive who worked for Martinez at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Born on Jan. 20, 1944, in Gurabo, Puerto Rico, Martinez was
brought by his parents to New York City at the age of 2. He
attended public schools in Manhattan and graduated from Benjamin
Franklin High School.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez became a heroin addict who from his teen-age years to
his early 20s roamed the streets of Spanish Harlem and the South
Bronx, selling drugs and stealing to support his habit.
</P>
<P>
   Both Colon and Martinez went through the detoxification program
at the Morris Bernstein Institute of Beth Israel Hospital about 15
times before the treatment was successful.
</P>
<P>
   In 1966 Martinez and five other people helped to establish
Phoenix House, the treatment facility operated by former addicts,
which is now the largest private drug treatment agency in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Several months later Martinez founded Project Return, which
developed a variety of programs to help addicts and former addicts.
The projects included one providing food delivery to the elderly,
another offering psychiatric counseling for adolescents in jail on
Rikers Island and one treating gay and lesbian addicts.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, Martinez became nationally known when Carey named him
to head the state drug-free agency.
</P>
<P>
   A decade later, Gov. Mario Cuomo forced Martinez to resign after
state investigators reported that he had steered money for drug
treatment to programs run by his friends that failed to treat
addicts. He was never accused of taking any money for himself.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez denied the charges and deplored that he had never been
given a public forum in which to reply to them.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Martinez returned to the Bronx, where he set up a
consulting firm. In 1998, he became executive director of Basics, a
drug treatment program in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez is survived by his wife, Judy, of the Bronx; a daughter
Delia, of Manhattan; a brother, Manny, of the Bronx; and a sister,
Delia Jimenez of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Before he assumed his state job, Martinez announced that he
would spend one-third of his time in Albany, one-third at the
agency's office in the World Trade Center and ``one-third in the
streets.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't ever want to forget where I came from,'' he explained.

EDITORIAL: FLAT-TAX FOLLIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Oct. 30:
</P>
<P>
   The Republican presidential candidates who debated in New
Hampshire on Thursday night did not quarrel much. But it was
especially discouraging that they embraced a flat tax to replace
the progressive income tax. In the 1996 GOP primaries, Steve Forbes
made the flat tax a centerpiece of his campaign, only to have Bob
Dole demolish the idea by pointing out the absurdity of lowering
tax rates on rich people like Forbes and raising them on the middle
class.
</P>
<P>
   This week Forbes said he was delighted at the revival of his
issue. But Republicans would do well to drop it or risk being seen
as a servant of the privileged.
</P>
<P>
   The current economic boom has benefited the wealthiest Americans
while the working class has struggled to stay even. That is one
reason the Republicans' $792 billion tax cut scheme, weighted
heavily toward the rich and vetoed by President Clinton, stirred so
little support over the summer. Contrary to Alan Keyes' overheated
description of the income tax as slavery and a Marxist-Leninist
plot, progressivity in tax rates has been accepted by Americans for
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Except for Keyes, the flat tax was embraced in one form or
another by all the other debaters, including such otherwise
sensible Republicans as Sens. Orrin Hatch and John McCain. The
candidates dwelled on the bewildering complexity of the current tax
system. But as Gary Bauer noted, it is not the overall tax rate
that makes the tax system confusing so much as the array of tax
breaks, deductions and definitions of income in the tax code.
Flat-tax advocates say they would eliminate many of these
deductions, but they disagree over which ones. Such steps might
demystify the system, but having the rich and middle class pay the
same marginal rates would make the end result unfair.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who did not participate in the
debate, has said he favors a ``fairer and flatter'' tax, but he has
not yet specified what he means. The best point scored in the
debate was by McCain. He noted that what keeps overall rates high
is the ability of powerful business groups to get tax breaks in
return for campaign donations. ``Every time we pass a tax bill,''
he said, ``we add another special loophole and a special deal for
the special interests.'' McCain may be getting some traction for
his idea that the soft-money ban he is pushing in the Senate would
actually bring about tax relief for average Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Taxes have been at the center of U.S. presidential campaigns at
least since 1980, when Ronald Reagan won by promising a sweeping
tax cut. It is healthy to have a quadrennial discussion on whether
to cut taxes or spend government funds on health, education and
social programs. But the idea that the flat tax is needed in order
to simplify the tax code is disingenuous, when the basic result
would ease the tax burden on the super-rich. That cannot be what
most Americans want. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ If George W. Bush can thank his father for a
well-known name, for much of his wealth he can thank Richard E.
Rainwater, a billionaire investor from Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   The vast bulk of the $18.4 million Bush and his wife reported in
1998 income came from the sale of the Texas Rangers and other
investments in which Rainwater, a man not widely known outside of
Wall Street, played a major role.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Rainwater, at age 55, is considered a master investor and has
built fortunes for others as well as for himself.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a grocer and a J.C. Penney sales clerk, Rainwater
gained his reputation skillfully marshaling the assets of the
legendary Bass family of Fort Worth, whose original holdings were
in oil. He soon created his own fortune, recently estimated by
Forbes magazine at $1.2 billion, by building a real-estate empire
and helping to found the nation's largest chain of hospitals,
Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Because of the financial ties between Bush and Rainwater,
their relationship has long been a target for the governor's
political opponents in Texas. In Bush's first campaign for
governor, in 1994, a spokesman for his Democratic opponent, Gov.
Ann W. Richards, declared that Rainwater ``owned'' Bush.
</P>
<P>
   A review of Bush's relationship with Rainwater did not produce
evidence that Bush, as governor, has sought to aid the businessman,
though there would be more potential for conflict if he became
president. Rainwater is involved in companies that are heavily
regulated and have hundreds of millions of dollars in government
contracts. One of those companies, which operates psychiatric
hospitals, is the subject of federal and state investigations into
patient mistreatment and Medicare fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said in a statement: ``Richard Rainwater is a friend and a
former business partner who is very successful. Some of my
investments in his companies have been successful as well. Richard
has never sought a favor for any of his companies nor would I have
offered any.''
</P>
<P>
   Rainwater declined to comment on the relationship, saying
through a spokesman that it would be inappropriate during Bush's
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in 1994, Rainwater said, ``George Bush happens
to be one of about 100 people that can make the statement that
their involvement with Richard Rainwater has had a very positive''
effect on their wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, as he prepared to run for the Republican presidential
nomination, Bush liquidated a blind trust created to hold his
assets when he was elected governor. One reason for doing so, said
the accountant who managed the trust, Robert A. McCleskey, was to
eliminate the appearance of any conflicts of interest, including
any investments with Rainwater.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get people inquiring about the Rainwater interests _ is
there a conflict?'' McCleskey said. ``So it was decided that the
best thing was to get rid of it.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the wealth of many politicians has been shaped by
others, and many national figures have had close friendships with
people heavily regulated by the government. In 1976, for example,
Hillary Rodham Clinton quickly turned a $1,000 investment in
commodities futures into a gain of nearly $100,000 with advice from
a friend who was then the top lawyer for Tyson Foods, the nation's
biggest poultry producer.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, for his part, invested $385 in 1991 in a ``consulting''
group set up by Rainwater as part of a deal with Americredit Corp.,
the car loan company. Three years later, when the investment paid
off, Bush received $45,512.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Bush, Dan Bartlett, said that the investment was
``passive'' and that Bush did no consulting.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Bush, Rainwater was not born into a world of connections.
He went to public schools in Fort Worth, where his father operated
a family grocery and where he regularly won races at a local drag
strip in a souped-up Buick. He attended the University of Texas and
then the Stanford University Graduate School of Business.
</P>
<P>
   At Stanford, he was a classmate of Sid R. Bass, the eldest of
the four Bass brothers, and it was Bass who soon hired him to help
direct the investments of Bass Brothers Enterprises. Rainwater so
aggressively invested the family's oil wealth in languishing
companies like Walt Disney that by the time he left in 1986, $50
million had grown to $5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after going out on his own in 1986, Rainwater connected
with another Texan, Richard L. Scott, a lawyer who believed that
investor-owned hospitals could be efficient and highly profitable.
They soon joined forces, and the result was Columbia/HCA, the
nation's biggest chain of for-profit hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   His current holdings also include energy, oil rigs, office
buildings and the sumptuous Canyon Ranch resorts. So sprawling are
his interests that gamblers can bet in casinos operated by one of
his companies or seek treatment for their gambling compulsion at
another.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a mega-deal guy who is extremely intelligent,'' said J.
Thomas Schieffer, who was a partner with Bush and Rainwater in the
Texas Rangers. ``He has a Midas touch.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While Bush and Rainwater have described themselves as friends,
people who know them said they are not particularly close. And they
did not know each other before Bush approached the businessman in
1989 for help in putting together an investment group to buy the
Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   In their first conversation, Bush was rebuffed. Only after the
baseball commissioner, Peter V. Ueberroth, intervened, intent on
having Bush include Texas investors, did Rainwater agree to take
part. He and a group of associates eventually put up half of the
$46 million purchase price.
</P>
<P>
   Rainwater's role in the Texas Rangers is well known. But not
long after, he began offering Bush investment opportunities in oil
and gas, real estate and a car loan company, which together yielded
at least $650,000 and possibly hundreds of thousands more. Then in
1994, he contributed $100,000 when Bush successfully ran for
governor.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, in a comment made through his spokesman, Bartlett, said
that those investments naturally followed from the Texas Rangers
deal. Other team investors with long ties to Rainwater took part in
them, though three large investors brought in by Bush _ Schieffer,
Mercer Reynolds and William O. DeWitt Jr. _ each said that the Fort
Worth businessman never approached them with similar opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically he allowed George to invest in some of the stuff
that he invested in,'' said Schieffer, who was the team's president
before its sale.
</P>
<P>
   Within the high-stakes financial world inhabited by Rainwater,
Bush's investments were very small, and how much he made from them
is unclear. McCleskey said the terms of Bush's trust prevented him
from disclosing the annual returns on the investments between 1995
and 1998, the time they were in trust.
</P>
<P>
   But between 1991, the first year that Bush publicly released his
tax filings, and 1994, he earned about $270,000 from investments
involving Rainwater, according to data provided by McCleskey. And
in 1998, when all remaining Rainwater-related investments were
sold, Bush made from $355,000 to $415,000, public filings show.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Rangers provided Bush his biggest payday from deals
involving Rainwater, some $14.9 million based on a total investment
of $606,000.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's investments with Rainwater were questioned during his
1994 race against Gov. Richards and after, as Texas newspapers and
other news organizations scrutinized their ties.
</P>
<P>
   One issue was whether Bush's proposal to privatize state
psychiatric hospitals could benefit Magellan Health Services Inc.,
a company in which Rainwater is the largest shareholder.
</P>
<P>
   Had the plan gone forward, which it did not, Magellan Health
would have been a prime contender for such a contract. But in fact,
the privatization proposal did not originate with Bush. It was part
of a 1994 report by the state's Democratic comptroller, John Sharp.
</P>
<P>
   Questions were also raised about the state teacher retirement
system's sale of several buildings to a publicly traded company
headed by Rainwater, Crescent Real Estate Equities Co. Bush said he
had no role in the sales, and reviews of the sales by appraisers
hired by the retirement system found the prices paid by Crescent
Real Estate to be fair.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, however, did not divorce himself completely from the
concerns of companies tied to Rainwater. In early 1995, Scott, the
chief executive of Columbia/HCA, met with the governor to express
his concerns about a Medicaid bill in the Texas Legislature,
documents obtained under the state open-records law by The New York
Times show. The bill was intended to expand the number of children
and adults covered by the state's health-insurance program for the
poor.
</P>
<P>
   People involved in the ensuing debate said they did not see any
evidence that Bush had tried to influence the final bill, though
Rainwater's interests in the matter were well known.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that went around was the affiliation between
the governor and Mr. Rainwater, that anything being done was a
favor to him,'' said Hugo Berlanga, a former state representative
from Corpus Christi who was involved with the bill. ``I thought it
was a far reach.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, some of Rainwater's investments have lost their
luster. In 1997, for example, Columbia/HCA became the subject of a
wide-ranging federal investigation into Medicare fraud.
(Rainwater's wife, Darla D. Moore, a former investment banker with
Chemical Bank who took over his seat on the Columbia/HCA board in
1994, was widely credited with removing Scott as its chief
executive.)
</P>
<P>
   Charter Behavioral Health Systems, another Rainwater-related
company in which Bush was invested through his blind trust, is now
the subject of regulatory scrutiny. Until recently, it was a unit
of Magellan Health, a company that Ms. Moore joined as a director
in 1996 after resigning her post at Columbia/HCA.
</P>
<P>
   Rainwater came to invest in Charter Behavioral through his ties
to Magellan Health and Crescent Real Estate, a publicly traded real
estate investment trust, or REIT, that he founded.
</P>
<P>
   REITs typically invest in commercial real estate. But in 1997,
Rainwater turned Crescent in an unusual direction, the psychiatric
industry, paying Magellan Health $400 million for a 50 percent
stake in Charter Behavioral, which operates a chain of psychiatric
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was structured to provide the REIT with rent from the
hospitals. But since operating the hospitals would jeopardize the
REIT's tax status, Rainwater and his associates created a new
company, Crescent Operating, to operate the hospitals with
Magellan. Shareholders in Crescent Real Estate, including Bush,
received stock in Crescent Operating as a dividend.
</P>
<P>
   Charter Behavioral, which runs about 80 hospitals nationwide,
already had financial problems as private and public insurers cut
back on in-patient psychiatric stays. But the terms of the Crescent
deal added two new costs, calling on Charter to pay the REIT at
least $40 million a year in rents and to pay Magellan Health $81
million in annual franchise fees.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two years, federal and state regulators have found
a growing list of problems at Charter Behavioral hospitals, which
receive tens of millions of dollars from programs like Medicare and
Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   Recently Charter agreed to close the adolescent unit of its
hospital in Nashua, N.H., after failing to remedy conditions there,
said Donald Shumway, commissioner of the New Hampshire department
of Health and Human Services. Regulators had found untrained staff,
unsanitary conditions, improper use of restraints, record-keeping
violations and sexual abuse of teen-agers and children.
</P>
<P>
   In August, the federal Health Care Finance Administration
announced that it was ending payments to a Charter Behavioral
hospital in Pembroke, Mass., after the company failed to submit an
acceptable plan to correct deficiencies.
</P>
<P>
   Shumway said Magellan Health had told him that Charter
Behavioral had dismissed most corporate-level officials involved in
reviewing the quality of medical care sometime in the past two
years as part of a cost-cutting move.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Jenkins, a spokeswoman for Charter Behavioral, which has
headquarters in Alpharetta, Ga., said patient care at company sites
had never suffered. ``We have strict standards of quality
assurance,'' she said. ``If there was a reduction, the functions
would not stop.'' She would not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Crescent Operating, which is also headed by Rainwater, recently
took Magellan Health's remaining stake in Charter Behavioral. Bush
is no longer an investor in either Crescent or Crescent Operating
because the stocks were sold when his trust was liquidated.

 &HT;    Florida-Georgia lost its excitement? Not with SEC title on line
 &HT;    (EDS: Corrects to take the apostrophe out of ``St. Johns
River.'')
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ With Florida holding an 8-1 edge in games
played this decade, there have been suggestions that some of the
passion last been lost in the annual border war between Georgia and
Florida, which has been contested by the St. Johns River since
1933.
</P>
<P>
   Don't tell that to Freddy Jones, the ticket manager at Georgia.
For today's nationally televised 88th meeting, Jones sold his
40,000 tickets faster than you could say ``Lindsay Scott.'' In
fact, Georgia refunded 6,000 ticket orders, a record for this
decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you kidding me?'' Jones said when asked if some of the
life had been drained from the World's Largest Outdoor Cocktail
Party. ``Our people are more excited than ever. After beating them
two years ago (37-17), we think we see the light at the end of the
tunnel. They can't wait to get down there.''
</P>
<P>
   Others have suggested that because of Florida's rivalries with
Tennessee and Florida State, which usually have national
championship implications, the Gators don't get up to play Georgia
the way they used to.
</P>
<P>
   Florida coach Steve Spurrier doesn't buy it. Georgia knocked him
out of an SEC championship as a player in 1966. Before he arrived
as coach in 1990, the Bulldogs inflicted a lot of pain on the
Gators. That's something, said Spurrier, you never forget.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe if you started following this game in 1992 you'd think
it's not that big a deal,'' Spurrier said. ``But history shows that
for us to win the SEC championship, we have to beat Georgia. That
makes it a real big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Still others say the tenor of the game has changed because the
city of Jacksonville has grown up. Mike Bianchi, a columnist for
the Florida-Times Union, points out that a decade ago Florida had
only two pro sports franchises. Now it has nine, including the
Jacksonville Jaguars of the NFL. Georgia-Florida used to be this
town's Super Bowl. Now, Jacksonvile has the muscle to bid for a
real Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   But don't tell that to the owners of all those RVs parked around
Alltel Stadium. Some of them have been here since Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can have pro football,'' said Jack Stewart of Macon as he
flipped a rack of ribs on his home-made grill. ``Our whole fall is
built around this trip. That will never change.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. Maybe not. The current contract between the schools and
the city of Jacksonville runs though the 2002 game. Next year
negotiations will begin on an extension. Florida has made it clear
that it wants to keep its home games in Jacksonville. Georgia
athletics director Vince Dooley is keeping his options open.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the renovations to the stadium and the surrounding area,
it's been a very pleasant experience except, of course, for the
wins and losses,'' said Dooley. ``But from the perspective of the
Georgia people, we want to make sure that the game remains special.
You can't ignore the pro influence. We can't allow it to become
just another event on the calendar.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the last contract renewal, Dooley conducted a large
survey of the Georgia alumni. That group was split 50-50 over
keeping the game in Jacksonville or bringing it back to campus.
That survey, however, took place during a seven-game losing streak
to Florida and before new coach Jim Donnan led the Bulldogs to 19
wins in the past two years, including Georgia's only victory over
the Gators in this decade. Dooley concedes that the results might
be different if the survey were taken now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't get a mandate then,'' said Dooley. ``Given the
excitement generated the past few years, the Georgia people might
feel differently.''
</P>
<P>
   One guy who does have a mandate, however, is Georgia coach Jim
Donnan. In three seasons he has quickly caught on to what this game
means. Beating Florida in 1997 gave his program a huge shot of
credibility with the Georgia fans, who had endured the longest
losing streak ever to the Gators.
</P>
<P>
   Donnan said it is clear what the Georgia people want when they
arrive each year in Jacksonville: A chance to win on a consistent
basis with the SEC East title on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like where our program is. In my mind, we're in the elite of
the SEC. We just haven't won the East,'' said Donnan. ``To do that,
you have to be a Top 5 team and we haven't been that. Overall,
we've got a chance to do something. But you've got to go out and do
it on the field. There comes a time when you have to get over the
hump.''

CLINTON ANNOUNCES NEW RULES TO PROTECT PRIVACY OF MEDICAL RECORDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (REVISES 12th graf and adds 13th graf with information on state
laws) (rk) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton kicked off an intense debate on
Friday on how to protect the privacy of medical records in an era
when doctors can test their patients for genetic defects and send
the information round the world with the click of a computer mouse.
</P>
<P>
   In unveiling new rules to safeguard such information, Clinton
said, ``These standards represent an unprecedented step toward
putting Americans back in control of their own medical records.''
</P>
<P>
   But doctors said the rules were inadequate and could actually
erode some protections that patients now have. Several physician
groups said they had been invited to Friday's White House ceremony,
but stayed away because in many cases the proposal does not require
that patients give consent before their records are shared, only
that they be notified. Such rules, they said, does not give
patients enough control over the use and disclosure of their
medical records.
</P>
<P>
   While the administration estimated that compliance would cost
the health care industry $3.8 billion over five years, the
insurance industry says the costs could be 10 times that amount.
With both sides saying they support the goals of the standards, a
central point in the debate will be: What is privacy worth in
dollars and cents?
</P>
<P>
   Health insurance plans object, in particular, to a provision
that would make them responsible for privacy lapses by companies
that collaborate in the care of a patient. For example, an HMO that
sends a patient to a pharmacy could be liable if the pharmacy
improperly uses the patient's records.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposed rules, patients would gain a new federal
right to inspect, copy and suggest corrections in medical records
that have been kept or transmitted electronically.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials estimated that it would cost doctors,
hospitals and health maintenance organizations more than $400
million to issue notices informing patients of their privacy
rights, as required by the rules. In addition, the officials
predicted, thousands of patients will try to correct their medical
records, and it will cost the health care industry more than $2
billion to deal with these requests over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   The rules would permit the use and disclosure of medical
information without the patient's consent for treatment, payment
and a wide range of loosely defined ``health care operations,''
including many common business practices of HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Donald J. Palmisano, a trustee of the American Medical
Association, said: ``The AMA believes that mere notice of a health
plan's intended use is inadequate.''
</P>
<P>
   Many doctors contend that health plans and insurance companies
should have to obtain consent from patients before using
information from their files to monitor the patients' compliance
with recommendations for medical treatment and testing. Too often,
they say, HMOs interfere in the doctor-patient relationship by
suggesting a cheaper drug or a different course of treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration would allow health plans to use
personal health information, without the patient's consent, for
these ``health care operations'': assessing the quality of care and
the performance of doctors and nurses; developing clinical
guidelines; setting premiums for the renewal of insurance
contracts, and investigating fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard K. Harding, vice president of the American
Psychiatric Association, said the proposed rules ``give the federal
good housekeeping seal of approval to practices that could
undermine privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Many states allow patients to limit the use of some or all of
the information in their medical files. In theory, the federal
rules do not override state laws that provide more protection for
privacy.
</P>
<P>
   But William B. Bruno, a lawyer for the psychiatric association,
said, ``Patients could lose some protections they now have. At
present _ because of state laws, court decisions and canons of
medical ethics _ many hospitals will not disclose medical records
unless the patient gives consent. The federal government is now
weighing in, saying that's not required. It's giving a green light
for significant changes in current practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials insisted that the rules would create
protections in areas where none now exist. Doctors, hospitals and
HMOs would, for example, have to keep logs documenting who received
access to patients' records for various purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The rules would greatly expand the role of the federal
government in regulating the practices of the health care industry.
It would set hundreds of detailed federal standards, with civil and
criminal penalties for violations.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Nell Lehnhard, senior vice president of the Blue Cross and
Blue Shield Association, described the rules as costly, complex and
confusing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that all patients should have the peace of mind
that comes from knowing their personal records are secure, and we
are outraged when breaches of this trust occur,'' Ms. Lehnhard
said. ``But why do we need 600 pages of regulations to protect
medical records when the Bill of Rights takes only one page to
provide Americans with all their basic rights? Why didn't the
administration just simply spell out what activities are illegal?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Janlori Goldman, director of the health privacy project at
Georgetown University, said: ``This is a historic day. These
regulations will be the first enforceable federal rules protecting
health privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   But, she said, the proposal falls short because ``there is no
requirement that a judge or a magistrate approve or deny access to
medical records sought by laws enforcement agencies.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the rules, most health care providers would have to
designate ``privacy officials'' to develop privacy policies and
procedures. This rule would apply even to a small office with three
doctors, who could designate the office manager as privacy
coordinator. Health care providers would also have to designate a
``contact person'' to handle patients' complaints about violations
of privacy.
</P>
<P>
   The rules make doctors, HMOs and insurance companies responsible
for any violation of a patient's privacy by their ``business
partners.''
</P>
<P>
   Kristin A. Bass, director of legislative affairs at the American
Association of Health Plans, a trade group, said that an HMO would
have little power over a drug store that improperly sells
information about the patient to a drug manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would hold us responsible for the pharmacy's
misbehavior,'' said Ms. Bass.
</P>
<P>
   Health insurance plans could also be held accountable for the
misuse of medical records by their other ``business partners,''
including their lawyers, auditors, billing firms and consultants.
</P>
<P>
   Under the rules, health care providers and health plans would
have to get the patient's consent for certain types of disclosures
_ if, for example, the information was to be used in marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors and insurers could not insist that people surrender
their privacy rights as a condition of getting treatment or
insurance. In other words, they could not coerce patients into
giving consent.
</P>
<P>
   The administration acknowledged that the rules would create
substantial costs for health care providers and health plans. But,
it said, the rules are necessary because computer technology makes
it possible to ``breach the security and privacy of health
information on a scale that was previously inconceivable.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, doctors have many new clues to their patients'
destiny. Scientists have developed more than 450 genetic tests that
may help identify people with an increased risk of developing
breast cancer, prostate cancer, cystic fibrosis and other diseases.
</P>
<P>
   In a preface to the rules, the administration said they would
have ``major social benefits'' that could not be quantified.
Privacy concerns now discourage people from being tested for
certain types of cancer and for some sexually transmitted diseases,
the administration said. The new rules will allay these concerns,
so more people will receive effective treatments, according to the
administration.
</P>
<P>
   A person who violated the rules could be required to pay a civil
penalty of $25,000. The rules authorize tougher penalties for
criminal violations: a $50,000 fine and one year in prison for
willful violations; a $250,000 fine and 10 years in prison if the
offender tried to use or sell data for ``commercial advantage,
personal gain or malicious harm.''
</P>
<P>
   The public will have two months to comment on the proposals,
which are to be published in the Federal Register on Nov. 3. The
secretary of Health and Human Services is supposed to issue final
rules, with the force of law, by Feb. 21, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said he was acting because Congress failed to
meet its goal of adopting comprehensive privacy standards by Aug.
21.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am taking this action today because Congress has failed to
act and because, a few years ago, Congress explicitly gave me the
authority to step in if they were unable to deal with this issue,''
Clinton said.

UCLA PLAYING HEAD (AND KNEE) GAMES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA began basketball practice two weeks ago with
a ton of talent and two questions: Dan Gadzuric's knees and Earl
Watson's judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Gadzuric has practiced sparingly because of chronic tendinitis,
and that's not likely to change during the season. He'll either
play with pain or he won't.
</P>
<P>
   As for Watson, who's sliding from shooting guard to point guard
to replace Baron Davis, check back in three months. It's easy to
make smart decisions in practice, quite another to make them in
Arizona's McKale Center or North Carolina's Dean Dome, which the
Bruins visit Jan. 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``Earl was a point guard in high school,'' Bruins coach Steve
Lavin said. ``He's been a stabilizing influence on the teams he's
played for.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, Watson is UCLA's most experienced player and its
locker room leader. He's tough and respected, resilient and
versatile. Last year, he was the team's second-leading scorer and
fourth-leading rebounder.
</P>
<P>
   But rebounds are not the issue this season, ballhandling is.
Given Davis' departure and Watson's resume _ he had at least five
turnovers in 10 games last season _ his judgment must improve for
UCLA to improve on last year's 22-9 record.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something you dream about as a kid,'' Watson said.
``My time has come. It's time to (meet) the challenge. I'm ready to
assume Baron's role.''
</P>
<P>
   Growing up, and out: Whether the Bruins perform better than last
year remains to be seen, but they certainly look better after an
offseason of running and weightlifting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, in some ways, we looked like a high school team,''
Lavin said.
</P>
<P>
   Blacked out: The black uniforms are no more. However, Adidas,
which outfits all UCLA teams, has agreed to make a navy blue road
uniform for special occasions.
</P>
<P>
   Roster update: Reserve guard Todd Ramasar had 3{-hour
reconstructive surgery on his left shoulder and is expected to miss
at least three months. Ramasar, of Corona, averaged three minutes
and less than one point per game last year.
</P>
<P>
   His injury leaves the Bruins with 11 scholarship players. Junior
Jason Flowers has joined the team as a practice player. The
6-foot-1 guard from Bellflower averaged five points for UC Irvine
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Schedule change: A Lithuanian club team has replaced the Chinese
National Team as UCLA's Nov. 10 opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore forward JaRon Rush lost several pounds and practiced
sparingly last week because of the same upper respiratory infection
that hampered the football team, UCLA officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Recruiting update: T.J. Cummings, a 6-8 forward from Chicago _
and the son of NBA player Terry Cummings _ made an on-campus visit
several weeks ago. His finalists are UCLA, Duke and DePaul, his
father's alma mater.

CSUN FRONT-END ALIGNMENT PAYING OFF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In this case, five was better than four.
</P>
<P>
   The Cal State Northridge football team has moved from dead last
in total defense to sixth in the Big Sky Conference since the
Matadors went from a four-man defensive line to a five-man front.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN (4-3, 3-2) also leads the conference in sacks as it enters
today's 3:05 p.m. game against Weber State at North Campus Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't having success with (the four-man front),''
defensive coordinator Foster Andersen said. ``We devoted all spring
and two-a-days to playing that defense. Finally we came to the
conclusion that it wasn't going to work.''
</P>
<P>
   That was laid out pretty clearly when the Matadors gave up 1,225
yards in back-to-back games _ a 71-14 loss at Kansas and a 48-41
loss at Eastern Washington.
</P>
<P>
   When CSUN was hammered at Montana 48-27, Andersen and the other
defensive coaches decided to change their philosophy, and one of
the foremost differences came on the defensive line.
</P>
<P>
   Erik Gardner (240 pounds) was added to the starting lineup,
which became smaller and quicker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quickness outweighed size,'' Andersen said, somewhat
ironically. ``I had every coach write down his best player and then
I asked, `Are they all out on the field?' The answer was no.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN has given up a combined 35 points during its current
two-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our kids realized they could stop good (teams),'' Andersen
said.
</P>
<P>
   It's elemental: The wind was blowing hard during practice Friday
afternoon, reminding backup quarterback Josh Fiske of the Matadors'
windy game two years ago at North Campus Stadium _ against Weber
State.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Weber State) had a real hard time in the first quarter,''
Fiske said. ``We had the wind (to our backs).''
</P>
<P>
   If the Santa Ana winds don't calm down today, CSUN could be
forced out of its passing offense for half the game, depending on
the direction in which the Matadors are headed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marcus (Brady) has two quarters and I have two quarters,''
running back Jaumal Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing the white shirt: Reserve linebacker Robert Porter
switched to tight end this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Porter) is a really good blocker,'' interim head coach Jeff
Kearin said. ``He may have a future there.''
</P>
<P>
   Closing in: With 449 completions and 5,247 yards in his first 18
college games, Brady has a chance to become Division I-AA's
all-time best quarterback, at least statistically.
</P>
<P>
   Brady needs 70 completions to pass former Northern Arizona
quarterback Greg Wyatt's mark of 518 as a freshman and sophomore.
Travis Brown, the Lumberjacks' current quarterback, had a record
6,793 yards his first two seasons and Brady needs to average 386
yards in the final four games to pass Brown.

   JERSEY CITY, New Jersey _ The mayors of Newark and Jersey City
demanded an apology Friday from the mayor of Elizabeth, who said
nonpartisan elections imposed an unnecessary expense and led to
less-responsive local government.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor J. Christian Bollwage of Elizabeth, a Democrat, is
campaigning against a proposal to change to nonpartisan elections
in that city. There are no primaries or political party labels in
nonpartisan elections, which are held in May and are used in many
communities in New Jersey. The proposal will be decided in a
referendum on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Newark's mayor, Sharpe James, and his counterpart in Jersey
City, Bret Schundler, who were both elected in nonpartisan
elections, held a news conference at City Hall here to dispute what
they considered disparaging assertions by Bollwage. He has said
that the cost of staging nonpartisan elections had burdened
taxpayers of Newark and Jersey City, where the money could be
better spent, he suggested, on fighting crime. They also disputed
Bollwage's assertion that without state or national candidates at
the top of the ballot voter turnout is low, leading elected
officials to be less responsive to constituents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're proud of what's happening in our communities and we're
here to set the record straight,'' Schundler said. ``When you talk
about what you think is a better approach, don't disparage other
communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Bollwage said in an interview Friday that he was not criticizing
Schundler's or James' leadership. But he reiterated his criticism
of nonpartisan elections, which he said would cost Elizabeth about
$100,000, and he did not offer an apology to the two other mayors.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Robert Jaspan of Elizabeth, who organized the
petition drive to get the change on the ballot, said it would make
elections more democratic.
</P>
<P>
   Because Elizabeth is overwhelmingly Democratic, said Jaspan, a
Democrat, city officials are in effect elected during the
Democratic primary, usually based on which candidates get the
party's endorsement. Schundler and James made similar statements.
</P>
<P>
   Bollwage, who is up for re-election next year, will be subject
to a nonpartisan race in May if the referendum is approved. He
said, however, that his opposition to the proposed change was based
on concerns about cost and turnout, not his own situation.
