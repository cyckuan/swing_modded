	   TOKYO (AP) _ A court sentenced a former top member of the Aum
doomsday cult to death on Friday for murdering four people in two
separate attacks, including one that strangled an anti-cult lawyer,
his wife and their infant son.
	   It was the first time Japan used capital punishment against the
Aum Shinri Kyo cult, which is accused of gassing the Tokyo subway
system in 1995, in an attack that killed a dozen people.
	   In issuing the ruling, the Tokyo District Court said former cult
member Kazuaki Okazaki, 38, deserved the death penalty because of
the brutality of the crimes.
	   It rejected his lawyers' request for leniency, Japan's public
television network NHK reported.
	   As always, the court confirmed the penalty the defendant
received, but refused to discuss details of the sentencing.
	   Okazaki and four other top cultists strangled Tsutsumi Sakamoto,
his wife, and their infant son on November 4, 1989, at their home
in Yokohama, just south of Tokyo at the request of AUM leader Shoko
Asahara, police say. The four other cult members involved in the
attack are being tried separately.
	   The bodies of the Sakamoto family, buried by the cultists in
remote mountains of central Japan, were not discovered until after
the March 1995 nerve gas attack on the Tokyo subways, when
investigators began a thorough investigation.
	   Sakamoto was preparing a lawsuit against the cult when he was
murdered, accusing Aum of luring youngsters into the group.
	   In the other killing, Okazaki was found guilty of murdering a
cult member who had tried to quit the religious group in February
1989. The victim, Shuji Taguchi, was strangled with a rope.
	   Asahara, who is accused of masterminding the subway gas attacks
that killed 12 people and sickened thousands, as well as the 1989
murder of the Sakamoto family, is being tried separately.
	   In Friday's ruling, Judge Megumi Yamamuro acknowledged Asahara's
role in ordering the murders of the Sakamotos, Kyodo News agency
reported.
	   Tomoyuki Oyama, the father of slain wife Satoko Tsutsumi, told
reporters, ``It was very painful to be in court today. Though we
always thought (Okazaki) deserved death, it was still painful to
listen to the ruling.''
	   Okazaki, who left the cult in 1990, first denied his involvement
in the murders of the lawyer and his family, then confessed details
of his role in the killings.
	   Before the Okazaki verdict, the severest penalty a convicted Aum
cult member had received was life in prison. That was Ikuo Hayashi,
51, a former heart surgeon, who was convicted in May of murder in
the subway gassing three years ago.

	   In Chicago, Eric Daze scored on a two-man advantage early in the
third period as Chicago rallied to tie winless San Jose.
	   The Blackhawks thought they won the game in sudden death, but
Chad Kilger's apparent rebound goal with 23.3 seconds left was
overruled because he kicked the puck past goalie Steve Shields.
	   San Jose's Owen Nolan and Joe Murphy scored in a 28-second span
in the first 47 seconds of the game. Tony Amonte had a first-period
goal for Chicago, with Doug Gilmour picking up his 800th career
assist on the play.

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australian Prime Minister John Howard
said he would host the first meeting Friday of a task force of
senior public-sector and private-sector figures to address the
impact of the international financial crisis.
	   ``The international debate about the ways to return to higher
growth, improve standards of living, create jobs and prevent future
crises must be brought to practical conclusions as soon as
possible,'' Howard said.
	   ``I will ask my task force for substantive and imaginative
suggestions for Australia to pursue in appropriate international
forums.''
	   He said the expertise of the private-sector members would be
useful ``given the significance of private capital flows in the
world's economy.
	   ``The task force will consider issues such as transparency and
accountability in the private sector, improved financial sector
monitoring and supervision, and measures to strengthen
international financial institutions,'' Howard said.
	   He has asked the task force to report by the end of the year.
	   Ian Macfarlane, governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, the
country's central bank, and the country's most senior economic
bureaucrat, Treasury Secretary Ted Evans, will join Treasurer Peter
Costello, who will chair the task force.

Equipment from historic exploration will return to the ice
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand (AP) _ Equipment used by Antarctic
explorer Sir Vivian Fuchs on the 1956 British Trans-Antarctic
Expedition will be returned to the ice, officials said Friday.
	   The equipment includes a sun-compass used to navigate near the
South Pole and an anemometer for measuring wind speed.
	   Archivist Bob Headland of the Scott Polar Research Institute in
Cambridge, England, brought the items to New Zealand and handed
them over to Antarctica New Zealand on behalf of Sir Vivian, who
recently turned 90.
	   They will be returned to the original Scott Base hut from which
Sir Edmund Hillary set out to support Sir Vivian's expedition to
cross Antarctica between the Ross and Weddell seas using Tucker
Sno-cats.
	   Although Sir Edmund was only supposed to set up a series of
supply depots for the last half of Sir Vivian's crossing, he ended
up driving his Ferguson tractors all the way to the South Pole,
becoming the first person to make the overland journey with
vehicles.
	   Paul Chaplin, executive director of the Antarctic Heritage
Trust, said a trust workshop involving experts from Canada, Norway,
Australia, and New Zealand had been held in Christchurch this week.
	   The workshop reviewed policies and principles on the
preservation and protection of historic sites in Antarctica.
	   ``We have plotted a long-term future for the heritage sites in
Antarctica such as Scott's and Shackleton's huts on Ross Island,
the memorial crosses, and other historic places,'' he said.
	   The hut structures are secure but many historic artifacts are
still in danger of being lost, he said.

Nicole Bobek tops women, Russia wins team title
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILWAUKEE (AP) _ Nicole Bobek skated a dazzling artistic program
to top three other skaters Thursday night, and Alexei Yagudin led
Russia to the championship in the World Team Skating Challenge.
	   Yagudin, the 1998 world champion, was ranked first by the five
judges to give Russia its second victory in the five years the team
championship has been contested. Russian skaters amassed 112
points, the United States and Canada 100 each and Europe 96.
	   Each team featured one man, one woman and one pair. The team
title was based on points skaters amassed in the three events, with
20 for finishing first.
	   Russia, which also won the title in 1994, built a big lead in
the technical portion when its skaters took the top spot in all
three events. Yagudin, however, was the only one to hold onto first
place after the artistic performance.
	   Wearing a colorful outfit that resembled a clown costume,
Yagudin skated dramatically and without any mistakes to the song
``Circus.'' American Todd Eldredge fell attempting a triple jump
and finished second while Kurt Browning of Canada, who helped
Canada win last year by taking the men's event, was third. Steven
Cousins of England was fourth.
	   Bobek, third after the technical portion, used an energetic,
flawless artistic program, skating to a medley of Motown hits
including ``Respect,'' to edge second-place Josee Chouinard of
Canada. Bobek was selected first by three of the judges.
	   Two-time gold medalist Katarina Witt, skating for team Europe,
finished third and Maria Butyrskaya of Russia fourth. Butyrskaya
was filling in for Ekaterina Gordeeva, out with a minor back
injury.
	   Mandy Woetzel and Ingo Steuer of Germany, former Olympic bronze
medalists now performing as professionals, on the pairs competition
over Oksana Kazakova and Artur Dmitriev of Russia, who won gold in
the 1998 Olympics. Kristy Sargeant and Kris Wirtz of Canada were
third and Kyoko Ina and John Zimmerman of the United States were
fourth.
	   For the first time the event included amateur as well as
professional skaters. Bobek and Yagudin are amateurs, Woetzel and
Steuer are professionals.

Chairman of NEC Corp. to resign over defense scandal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: New thruout ADD more background. Will be UPDATED as soon as
the NEC Corp. news conference ends.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The chairman of NEC Corp., a giant Japanese
electronics company, will step down because of its role in a major
defense scandal, the company announced Friday.
	   Recently, prosecutors raided two NEC subsidiaries, and the Tokyo
headquarters of the Japanese Defense Agency, in a widening scandal
involving corruption in military purchases.
	   A total of 13 officials from NEC Corp. and the two subsidiaries
_ Nico Electronics Co. and Toyo Communication Equipment Co. _ have
been arrested on suspicion of overcharging the Japanese military in
procurement contracts.
	   Two Defense Agency officials also have been arrested, suspected
of winking at the inflated billings in exchange for the three
companies' providing jobs to retiring agency employees.
	   Although NEC had previously denied any involvement in the
scandal, it held a news conference Friday and issued a statement
saying that Chairman Tadahiro Sekimoto would resign.
	   Kyodo News agency reported that NEC President Hisashi Kaneko
also would step down, but the statement issued at the beginning of
the news conference did not mention him.

Narita airport posts largest ever drop in passenger use
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A prolonged recession in Japan and other Asian
nations caused the largest ever half-year drop in passenger numbers
at Tokyo's main international airport, a spokesman said Friday.
	   Akira Kojima, a spokesman for the Narita International Airport
Authority, said the number of both Japanese and foreign passengers
using the facility was down 4.2 percent in the six months ended
Sept. 30.
	   It was the largest drop from the previous year for any six-month
period at the overcrowded airport since it opened in 1978, Kojima
said.
	   The last time the fiscal first-half saw a passenger decrease was
in 1991, when airport authorities reported a 2 percent fall in the
wake of the Gulf War earlier that year, Kojima said.
	   Kojima said that for the latest period, both passengers and
cargo volume were affected by an overall economic slowdown in Japan
and other Asian economies.
	   Also contributing to the decline were airline unions' strikes by
Northwest Airlines of the United States, Air France and a shutdown
by Philippine Airlines, Kojima said.
	   Air cargo handled at Narita came to 772,000 tons in the
April-September period, down 7 percent from last year. It was the
largest ever drop in tonnage, Kojima said.
	   The airport, with a single runway, is located in Narita, 65
kilometers (40 miles), northeast of Tokyo.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ On his first trip to Seoul since
assuming office, U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan met Friday with
South Korean leaders to discuss bringing peace to the divided
Korean peninsula.
	   Annan is on the first day of three-day visit to receive the dlrs
200,000 Seoul Peace Prize, a biennial award set up in 1990 to
commemorate the 1988 Seoul Olympics.
	   He also used the occasion to discuss issues of mutual concern
with President Kim Dae-jung, Foreign Minister Hong Soon-young and
other South Korean leaders.
	   Kim asked Annan for greater U.N. support for South Korean
efforts at reconciliation with rival North Korea. Seoul and
Pyongyang are sill technically at war after their 1950-53 Korean
War ended without a peace treaty, and mutual animosities run deep.
	   Kim also pledged a greater South Korean contribution to various
U.N. activities, according to a brief news release from the
presidential palace.
	   Annan was chosen as the recipient of this year's Seoul Peace
Prize for his contribution to world peace through international
diplomatic and humanitarian endeavors.
	   The award ceremony was scheduled for later Friday with hundreds
of South Korean and foreign dignitaries to attend.
	   Past recipients include International Olympic Committee
President Juan Antonio Samaranch, former U.S. Secretary of State
George Shultz and the international relief organization, Doctors
Without Borders.
	   Annan, who arrived from Japan following a conference on African
Development in Tokyo, leaves for New York Saturday after receiving
an honorary doctoral degree from Seoul's Kyung Hee University.

Police warn of arrests at planned anti-government rally
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALVIN UNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Police on Friday warned those who
intended to join a massive anti-government march on Parliament that
they faced arrest and time in jail.
	   Supporters of jailed dissident Anwar Ibrahim, ousted as deputy
prime minister and finance minister on Sept. 2, planned to march on
Parliament as Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad unveils the 1999
budget Friday.
	   Police have declared illegal all demonstrations in support of
Anwar, who is awaiting trial on charges of graft and sexual
misconduct. So far, authorities have detained 262 people who have
attended anti-government rallies, releasing them on bail pending
trial.
	   City police chief Kamaruddin Ali said that no one had applied
for a permit to hold Friday's demonstration, as required by law in
this Southeast Asian country.
	   ``We charged ... people on Wednesday for illegal assembly and
will not hesitate to do the same again,'' Kamaruddin was quoted as
saying in Friday editions of The Star.
	   On Wednesday, a local court ordered the trial of 127 people who
were arrested for participating in a demonstration that demanded
Mahathir's resignation.
	   Since Anwar's arrest last month, tens of thousands of Malaysians
have gathered regularly in the capital and other cities to demand
justice for the jailed politician.
	   Anwar, who showed up at his first court appearance bruised and
beaten, faces trial Nov. 2 on 10 counts of corruption and illegal
homosexual acts. He has condemned the charges as false and
politically motivated.
	   The political scandal and apparent police brutality against
Anwar have soured political relations with other nations. The
presidents of Indonesia and the Philippines threatened to boycott
the upcoming Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Kuala
Lumpur next month.
	   Indonesian President B.J. Habibie, who considers Anwar a close
friend, has since said he would attend, but only for one day.
Philippine President Joseph Estrada also will come, but says he
intends to bring up Anwar with Mahathir.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton won't meet with Mahathir during the
APEC summit because of U.S. concerns over the handling of Anwar,
administration sources said Thursday.
	   The U.S. House International Affairs Committee released a letter
Thursday to Clinton from committee Chairman Benjamin Gilman and
Rep. Doug Bereuter, head of the panel's Asia subcommittee.
	   They said Clinton should either have the meeting moved out of
Malaysia or use the sessions to ``speak out forcefully about the
economic policies and human rights practices of Prime Minister
Mahathir.''
	   Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi called the
comments by the congressmen arrogant.
	   ``They should realize that they are the ones who are being
highly offensive towards Malaysia,'' he said.

Family reunion awaits `El Duque'

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ New York Yankees pitcher Orlando ``El Duque''
Hernandez was on the verge of a sweet reunion with members of his
family, 10 months after he defected from Cuba on a raft.
	   Hernandez's mother, his ex-wife and her two daughters arrived at
Miami International Airport on a charter flight Thursday night.
They were expected to board the private jet of Yankees owner George
Steinbrenner for the flight to New York and the reunion with
Hernandez.
	   State Department officials and others indicated the family left
the island with the Cuban government's blessing for what is
expected to be a brief stay. Hernandez hasn't seen them since he
left Cuba.
	   ``I am very happy that I will be able to see my dad. I have
missed him,'' said Hernandez's older daughter, 8-year-old Yahumara.
She and 2-year-old Steffi wore Yankees T-shirts. Yahumara's shirt
showed a photograph of her father's face, and her sister's shirt
bore the name of El Duque.
	   ``I'm very happy. I'm very proud of my son,'' said Maria Julia
Pedroso Cruz, 52. ``He hasn't changed, in spite of the fact that he
has all that money.''
	   Since her son left, she said, ``it has been very difficult for
us, but we have survived the situation.''
	   Hernandez helped lead the Yankees to a 9-3 victory Sunday in
Game 2 of the World Series, which New York won in a sweep of San
Diego on Wednesday night.
	   Maria Cubas, whose husband helped Hernandez defect, said the
family hoped to attend Friday's World Series parade in New York.
	   The Fox News Channel first reported that ``El Duque,'' who
hasn't seen his family since he escaped Cuba last December, would
be reunited with his relatives.
	   Hernandez's half-brother, Livan, also played baseball in Cuba
and defected during a team trip to Mexico in 1995. He was the 1997
World Series MVP for the Florida Marlins and his mother was allowed
to fly from Cuba to Miami to visit him just before Game 7.
	   Juan Iglesias, Livan Hernandez's agent, said he didn't know
anything about the latest Hernandez family visit, only that ``El
Duque'' was planning to fly to Miami after Friday's parade and
ceremony to visit his brother.
	   Hernandez, who signed a four-year dlrs 6.6 million contract with
the Yankees in March, was banned from playing in Cuba for dealing
with American major league scouts.
	   He fled Cuba by climbing onto a rickety raft with his wife,
Noris Bosch, and six others. They landed on a remote Bahamian
island and were rescued by the U.S. Coast Guard.

Chinese dissident sentenced to seven years, group says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A veteran Chinese dissident held for five months
without access to his family or a lawyer has been sentenced in
secret to seven years in prison for joining an underground
opposition party, exiled democracy activists said Friday.
	   Chen Zengxiang, from the eastern port city of Qingdao, was
detained May 23 after he told police during questioning that he had
joined the dissident Chinese Democracy and Justice Party, the party
said.
	   Founded by exiled dissidents in the United States to challenge
Communist Party rule in China, the party claims to have an
underground, nationwide network of members on the Chinese mainland.
	   In a statement, it suggested that Chen was sentenced to deter
any other would-be party members. Because the party operates
underground, Chinese authorities ``can only use scare tactics'' to
hinder its development, the party claimed.
	   Chen's family was not informed of his trial, the group said.
Police only told Chen's sister on Thursday, a week after the event,
that he had been sentenced in secret to seven years imprisonment,
the group said. Earlier reports said Chen was facing charges of
plotting to subvert the government.
	   News of Chen's sentencing came three weeks after China signed a
key human rights treaty, the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights.
	   Chen's activism dates back to the Democracy Wall movement of the
late 1970s, when young campaigners urged Communist leaders to
embrace democratic reforms. Authorities tolerated the movement
through the winter and spring of 1978-1979 before cracking down,
imprisoning many of its leaders.

13 dead, dozens missing as Typhoon Babs ravages northern

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ At least 13 people died and dozens
were missing Friday as Typhoon Babs pummeled the northern
Philippines with heavy winds and rain, submerging parts of Manila
and forcing many businesses to close for a second day.
	   Police said at least 36 people were buried in a landslide in the
town of San Miguel in Catanduanes, where the typhoon first hit land
Thursday. Only six bodies have been recovered, regional police
chief Renato Arevalo said.
	   Arevalo said 25 gold panners in the town of Aroroy on Masbate
island were also reported missing Friday. No other details were
available.
	   The dead also included four people who drowned, a man hit by a
falling coconut tree, another man who died of shock, and a fireman
who was pinned to death after his van overturned on a slippery
road, said Franklin Castillo, director of the Office of Civil
Defense.
	   Many roads were flooded or blocked by landslides throughout the
central and northern Philippines. Thousands of people were stranded
as ports were shut down and ships forbidden to sail.
	   In the hard-hit Bicol region, one of the Philippines' poorest
areas, more than a hundred thousand people were forced to flee
their homes, Red Cross officials said. About 10,000 jammed the town
of Matnog waiting for ferry service to nearby Samar island, police
said.
	   Authorities blocked vehicles from approaching to prevent further
congestion of the town. The stalled vehicles lined a one-kilometer
(half-mile) stretch of highway, police said.
	   The storm also damaged telephone relay towers, cutting
communications to most of the region.
	   In Manila, President Joseph Estrada ordered most government
offices to close at noon Friday, with the exception of disaster
relief agencies.
	   About 15,700 people, including many squatters, were evacuated
from low-lying areas in metropolitan Manila, officials said.
	   About 1,000 people living along a seawall near the oceanside
U.S. Embassy were evacuated because of heavy waves. In suburban
Marikina, about 4,500 people living on the bank of the swollen
Marikina River were also moved to evacuation centers.
	   At least 12 domestic flights and one international flight were
canceled.
	   After skirting Manila, Babs veered north toward the area
devastated last week by Typhoon Zeb, which killed at least 74
people in the Philippines.
	   Babs was centered Friday morning over San Carlos City in
Pangasinan province, 170 kilometers (106 miles) north of Manila.
Its sustained winds weakened to 120 kph (75 mph) with gusts up to
150 kph (94 mph), weather officials said.
	   Babs pounded areas around the Mount Pinatubo volcano with heavy
rain, unleashing 1.5 meter (5 foot) -high avalanches of volcanic
material from the mountain's slopes. Most of the material was
carried safely away by swollen rivers.
	   Last week, large areas of the northern Philippines were
devastated by Super Typhoon Zeb, which went on to kill 31 people in
Taiwan and 12 in Japan.

Study: Traffic accidents more likely for drivers on anti-anxiety
</HEADLINE>
drugs &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs &QL; 
 &UR; By EMMA ROSS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Thousands of lives could be saved worldwide every
year and hundreds of thousands of traffic accidents avoided if
people who take anti-anxiety drugs such as Valium did not drive
while on medication, according to a new study published in Friday's
issue of The Lancet.
	   Drivers taking such anti-anxiety medications during the day are
more than twice as likely to be involved in traffic accidents as
those not taking the drugs, according to the British medical
journal.
	   The risk of accidents for people under the age of 45 is more
than three times greater if they take the drugs, the study said.
	   ``The current warnings are that if you feel drowsy, don't drive.
That needs to be changed,'' said Dr. Tom MacDonald, the clinical
pharmacologist from the University of Dundee in Scotland who led
the study. ``I would say if you use these drugs, don't drive.''
	   Tranquilizers such as Valium, generically known as diazepam, are
commonly used to treat anxiety, other stress-related disorders and
muscle spasms.
	   They are the most commonly prescribed tranquilizers, with 18
million prescriptions in Britain alone in 1997. Worldwide figures
were unavailable.
	   Patients usually feel drowsy on those drugs in the first few
days of taking them, but accidents occur at the same rate
regardless of whether drowsiness occurs, MacDonald said.
	   Jeff Soper, a spokesman for Hoffman LaRoche, the Swiss maker of
Valium, said his company's warning labels for Valium are clear.
	   ``Patients should be cautioned against engaging in hazardous
occupations requiring complete mental alertness, such as operating
machinery or driving a motor vehicle,'' he said, reading from the
label.
	   Dr. Desmond O'Neill, a geriatrician at the Center for Mobility
Enhancement at Adelaide and Meath Hospital in Dublin, Ireland,
viewed the study's conclusions with caution.
	   ``They've made us think hard, but it still isn't enough evidence
to tell people not to drive,'' he said. ``Is it the illness or the
medication? If you're that agitated that you need the drug, maybe
that's the problem.''
	   The results could be attributed to people whose personalities
make them prone to getting into more risky situations, he said.
``The jury is still out on this one.''
	   The researchers compared the records of all prescriptions
dispensed in the Dundee area with all 19,386 traffic accidents the
local police responded to between April 1992 and June 1995. A total
of 1,731 people involved in those accidents were taking one of the
drugs examined in the study.
	   Of the accidents involving those 1,731 people, four included
fatalities. Of those, three drivers were taking anti-anxiety drugs
on the day of the accident and the fourth driver had taken
anti-anxiety drugs during the study period.
	   MacDonald told The Associated Press that, extrapolating from
those figures, he estimated that thousands of lives could be saved
worldwide if drivers avoided the drugs.
	   The researchers looked at four groups of medications. Besides
anti-anxiety drugs taken during the daytime, they also examined
antidepressants such as Prozac, and other drugs that act on the
brain.
	   Only the anti-anxiety drugs were associated with an increased
risk of traffic accidents. Antidepressants showed no link and
neither did any sleeping pills, except for one _ zopiclone.
	   Similar results have been found by U.S. researchers studying the
link between anti-anxiety drugs and an increased risk of traffic
accidents, but those studies addressed only drivers over the age of
65.

Nicole Bobek tops women, Russia wins team title
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes, details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MILWAUKEE (AP) _ Nicole Bobek skated a dazzling artistic program
to top three other skaters, and Alexei Yagudin led Russia to the
championship in the World Team Skating Challenge.
	   She then drew the night's biggest cheers when, after skating off
the ice in triumph, Thursday night, she donned a cowboy hat version
of the foam rubber cheesehead that has become a symbol of the
spirit of Wisconsin sports.
	   ``One of the fans in the audience gave it to me,'' Bobek said.
``I knew the symbolism, so I thought, `Hey, give it to me, I'll put
it on right away.'''
	   Bobek's individual victory, however, did not keep Russia from
winning the title in the event, which pitted teams from the United
States, Russia, Canada and Europe against each other. Each team had
one male, one female and one pair competing for team points in the
three events, including 20 points for first place.
	   Yagudin, the 1998 world champion, was ranked first by the five
judges to give Russia its second victory in the five years the team
championship has been contested. Russian skaters amassed 112
points, the United States and Canada 100 each and Europe 96.
	   Each team featured one man, one woman and one pair. The team
title was based on points skaters amassed in the three events, with
20 for finishing first.
	   Russia, which also won the title in 1994, built a big lead in
the technical portion when its skaters took the top spot in all
three events. Yagudin, however, was the only one to hold onto first
place after the artistic performance.
	   Wearing a colorful outfit that resembled a clown costume,
Yagudin skated dramatically and without any mistakes to the song
``Circus.'' American Todd Eldredge fell attempting a triple jump
and finished second while Kurt Browning of Canada, who helped
Canada win last year by taking the men's event, was third. Steven
Cousins of England was fourth.
	   Bobek, third after the technical portion, used an energetic,
flawless artistic program, skating to a medley of Motown hits
including ``Respect,'' to edge second-place Josee Chouinard of
Canada. Bobek was selected first by three of the judges.
	   ``The first one wasn't perfect,'' Bobek said of the technical
portion when, like all the female skaters, she fell and finished
third. ``But it definitely felt better than the competitions I've
been doing, so it made me feel more confident about myself. Then
when I went out there in the second one, I had a good time.''
	   Two-time gold medalist Katarina Witt, skating for team Europe,
finished third and Maria Butyrskaya of Russia fourth. Butyrskaya
was filling in for Ekaterina Gordeeva, out with a minor back
injury.
	   Mandy Woetzel and Ingo Steuer of Germany, former Olympic bronze
medalists now performing as professionals, won the pairs
competition over Oksana Kazakova and Artur Dmitriev of Russia, who
won gold in the 1998 Olympics. Kristy Sargeant and Kris Wirtz of
Canada were third and Kyoko Ina and John Zimmerman of the United
States were fourth.
	   The Team Challenge is a unique event for figure skaters because
they skate for team and not individual honors. But Yagudin said
that was fun.
	   ``I can recognize that for Russians to be first was important,''
he said. ``I think it's a nice thing. I enjoyed skating here.''
	   For the first time the event included amateur as well as
professional skaters. Bobek and Yagudin are amateurs, Woetzel and
Steuer are professionals.
	   Bobek, however, who with Tara Lipinski and Michelle Kwan went to
the 1998 Olympics hoping for a 1-2-3 sweep only to have Bobek miss
out on a medal, is not sure how long she will remain an amateur.
	   ``I don't know about that,'' she said when asked if she would
skate in the 2002 Olympics. ``Right now I'm just saying, 'One year
at a time.'''

North Korea guarantees safe return of South Korean tourists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ North Korea on Friday guaranteed
safety for South Koreans who go on sightseeing tours of a scenic
mountain in the reclusive communist country.
	   Hyundai, South Korea's largest conglomerate, plans to send by
ship up to 2,000 tourists a week for four-day tours of Diamond
Mountain on the North's east coast beginning in November.
	   But mutual distrust runs so deep between the two countries that
South Korea has demanded a North Korean guarantee on the safe
return of its citizens.
	   North Korea will ``guarantee safety and safe return of all
tourists and personnel concerned ... and will take necessary
measures in case there happens an accident or disaster,'' said an
unidentified spokesman of the North's Ministry of Public Security.
	   The statement was carried by the North's official Korean Central
News Agency.
	   The tourism project would mark the first major joint venture
between the two hostile Korean states and give Pyongyang a new
source of badly needed foreign currency.
	   Hyundai's founder and honorary chairman Chung Ju-yung visited
his native North Korea in June with a gift of 500 cattle and agreed
to start sightseeing tours of the mountain as a joint venture.
	   Chung plans to travel to the North again next week with a gift
of 501 cattle and reach agreement on details of the tourism
project.
	   The tours, originally scheduled to begin in September, have been
delayed because of cost, security and other matters.
	   The Korean states were separated into the communist North and
the capitalist South in 1945. They are still technically at war
after their 1950-53 Korean War ended without a permanent peace
treaty.

Climate may not be as unpredictable as thought
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Weather researchers may be closing in on the
goal of reliable, long-term forecasts. And as they do, it is
becoming more apparent the oceans are the key.
	   ``Indeed, there is predictability in the midst of chaos,'' said
Jagadish Shukla, whose paper in Friday's edition of the journal
Science reports forecasts months ahead using sea-surface
temperatures.
	   His work adds detail to similar efforts by other scientists.
	   ``He has done some interesting things here,'' said Ants Leetmaa,
director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's
Climate Analysis Center, where meteorologists produce long-range
forecasts a year in advance using techniques similar to those
described in the new paper. They successfully predicted last year's
El Nino phenomenon in the Pacific Ocean.
	   But Shukla ``is running higher resolution models for the United
States,'' Leetmaa noted.
	   Even so, the long-term forecasts cannot tell the exact weather
events that will occur. They anticipate overall circulation of the
air and average rain and snowfall for coming seasons, said Shukla,
of George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, and the Center for
Ocean-Land Atmosphere Studies in Calverton, Maryland.
	   Last year's El Nino heating of the Pacific had major impacts,
ranging from heavy storms on the Pacific Coast to a mild winter in
the North and a light hurricane season in the Southeast.
	   ``It's pure luck that North America happens to be located at the
right location'' to be affected by tropical changes. ``North
America has the highest predictability outside the tropics ...
that's a gift of nature to North America,'' Shukla said.
	   But, he added: ``If we want to make better predictions for
farmers in Iowa,'' researchers will need better computer models and
better studies of conditions in the ocean and elsewhere.
	   Meanwhile, a separate study by scientists at the National Center
for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado, concluded that
global climate variations seem to be driven by the circulation of
water in the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian oceans.
	   Climate tends to vary about every 13 to 14 years, a schedule
determined by the average circuit time of the gyres that carry
oceanic heat, Gerald A. Meehl, Julie M. Arbaster and Warren G.
Strand report in a paper scheduled for the Nov. 1 edition of
Geophysical Research Letters.
	   That journal also will carry a paper by researchers at Columbia
University, who found decade-long relationships between ocean
temperatures and weather in the North Atlantic. Those connections
may offer the potential of long-range climate forecasts in the
area, report Balaji Rajagopalan, Yochanan Kushnir and Yves M.
Tourre of Columbia's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory.
	   Climate and weather are extremely complex and in recent years
scientists have begun using sophisticated computer programs _
called numerical models _ to predict changes.
	   Millions of pieces of information on current weather around the
world are fed into these models, which then use mathematical
formulas to calculate how conditions are likely to change.
	   Even small differences at the start can lead to widely different
results over time. That has become known as the ``butterfly
effect'' in which some suggest the flap of a butterfly wings might
change initial readings enough to result in weather changes
half-a-world away and months in the future.
	   But Shukla found that when he kept tropical sea surface
temperatures the same the models tended to come to similar
long-term conclusions, even if other initial conditions varied
greatly.
	   In most cases, he said, with slightly different initial
conditions, the model results diverged into chaos over time. But
``if you keep the initial (sea surface) temperature the same they
actually converge ... this is the key point.''

Vietnam to free 2,630 prisoners
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnam is freeing 2,630 prison inmates
under a presidential amnesty, the second big release in less than
two months, a government source said Friday.
	   The amnesty, signed Tuesday by President Tran Duc Luong, was to
be officially announced at prisons throughout the country Friday.
The release then could take several days.
	   It was unknown whether any of the prisoners have been jailed for
political or religious crimes. Vietnam claims it holds no one for
religious or political beliefs, only people who have broken the
law.
	   Human rights groups counter that a number of people are jailed
for violating the all-encompassing national security law or the
strict regulation of religious activities.
	   More than 5,000 prisoners, including some high-profile political
and religious dissidents, were freed under a presidential amnesty
on National Day, Sept. 2.
	   Vietnam has made two other amnesties since 1990, in 1993 and
1995, but the numbers involved this year are much larger, and
dissidents normally are released separately and quietly.
	   The reason for the releases is unclear, but the government has
shown signs of being more sensitive to human-rights concerns.
	   It has been trying to improve strained relations with the
Vatican, and the U.N. special rapporteur on religious intolerance
is in the country on a long-requested assessment visit.
	   The source said another batch of prisoners could be freed by the
end of the year, and the government has said it is planning another
general amnesty for the year 2000.

Reports: Indonesian authorities investigate Suharto's half-brother
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A relative of former President Suharto
has been declared a suspect in a credit scam at a liquidated bank
he owned, newspapers reported Friday.
	   Police on Thursday questioned Probosutedjo, Suharto's
half-brother, about allegations he was involved in irregularities
at Bank Jakarta, which was shut in November along with 15 other
troubled banks.
	   The closures were part of a series of banking reforms required
by the International Monetary Fund in exchange for billions of
dollars in aid to economically shattered Indonesia.
	   The business holdings of Suharto, who quit in May amid riots and
student protests against his 32-year authoritarian rule, have also
come under investigation. Critics allege he used his clout to
foster corruption that benefited his family and friends.
	   Probosutedjo admitted that he breached the bank's legal lending
limit, The Jakarta Post reported. Many bank credits were granted to
his Mercu Buana business group.
	   But he said he was innocent of other charges of wrongdoing and
that he had helped many small traders by granting them loans.
	   ``I didn't inflict any financial losses on my bank customers or
even the government,'' Probosutedjo said.
	   Suharto's successor, President B.J. Habibie, was a longtime
protege of the former president. However, Habibie is implementing
democratic reforms and is under pressure to wipe out corruption and
nepotism that flourished while Suharto was in power.

Investigation into Vietnam's biggest graft scandal completed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Ho Chi Minh City police said Friday they
have wrapped up their investigation into Vietnam's biggest graft
scandal and recommended prosecution of 77 people on fraud charges.
	   A 700-page report said 3,858 billion dong (dlrs 275 million) of
state funds were missing in the case involving the high-profile
Minh Phung Garment and Construction private company and Trading and
Tourist Service Epco, a former government entity.
	   Minh Phung director Tang Minh Phung and Epco counterpart Lien
Khui Thin were arrested in March 1997. Thin reportedly let Phung
sell commodities worth 200 billion dong (dlrs 14.3 million) in
Epco's storage which had been collateral at a local bank.
	   Phung and Thin allegedly collaborated with corrupt local bank
officials to seek loans without proper collateral to invest in
properties. Their real estate business went sour in 1996 when there
was a freeze on the market.
	   Many of the people involved in the case are local bank
executives and directors of Phung's front companies who helped him
obtain bank loans.
	   The Thanh Nien newspaper reported that the trial is set for
mid-February.

Thai board won't let new `King and I' be filmed in Thailand
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's Film Board has recommended
against allowing 20th Century Fox to shoot a new non-musical
version of the ``King and I'' in the country because it insults the
monarchy, The Nation newspaper reported on Friday.
	   The new film, starring Jodie Foster and Chow Yun Fat and called
``Anna and The King'' is a remake of the 1956 Hollywood musical.
Yul Brynner won an Academy Award for best actor for his portrayal
of King Mongkut in the movie.
	   The film was banned in Thailand, however, because Thais consider
the depiction of the fourth king of the country's Chakri Dynasty to
be inaccurate and insulting.
	   A Thai coordinator for the new film told The Nation the script
had been adapted to highlight King Mongkut's ingenuity, but the
board said the portrayal differed little from the original film and
therefore violated Thailand's strict lese majeste laws.
	   Criticizing or insulting the royal family can result in a prison
sentence.
	   A source in the Public Relations Department, which oversees the
Film Board, said, however, that the department was willing to
negotiate with the film company over the script, so there was still
a chance the movie could be made in Thailand, according to The
Nation.
	   Many Thais feel King Mongkut was depicted as a cruel and
ignorant autocrat in ``The King and I.'' They prefer to remember
him as an enlightened monarch, with passions for science and
language, who laid the groundwork for the modernization of
Thailand, which was then called Siam.
	   King Bhumibol Adulyadej, the current king, once said after
seeing Brynner in his most famous role that the actor's portrayal
of his grandfather was not historically accurate.
	   But he also said the portrayal nonetheless captured some of the
essence of Mongkut's personality and wasn't meant to be insulting.
	   King Bhumibol, with 52 years on the throne, is the
longest-reigning monarch in the world. He is revered by his
subjects as semidivine.
	   The film was based on a book written in 1870 by Anna Leonowens
called ``The English Governess at the Siamese Court.'' Leonowens
was hired by King Mongkut to give his sons a Western education,
something never before experienced by Siamese royalty.
	   Thai aristocrats from that era were angered by the book because
they said it was mostly fiction. Although Leonowens was hired to
teach Mongkut's sons, she met the king only once, they said.
	   Film Board executives were not available for comment on Friday
because it was a national holiday. Thais were celebrating
Chulalongkorn Day, commemorating the reign of King Chulalongkorn,
Mongkut's son and Leonowens' student.

Cambodia ruling party wants resumption of talks with opposition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The president of Cambodia's ruling
party called on Friday for opposition members of parliament to
return to the country and resume stalled negotiations to form a new
government.
	   Chea Sim, the president of Second Prime Minister Hun Sen's
Cambodian People's Party, said in a faxed statement that a new
round of talks should be limited to the ruling party and the senior
opposition party led by Prince Norodom Ranariddh.
	   Ranariddh has insisted that any talks also include the junior
opposition party led by Sam Rainsy.
	   After Hun Sen narrowly won a July election, Ranariddh and Sam
Rainsy led a gradual exodus of opposition politicians to Bangkok
after a ceremonial convening of parliament in September.
	   The two-party opposition says Hun Sen has threatened to arrest
its leaders, making it impossible for them to negotiate inside
Cambodia.
	   Chea Sim dismissed the opposition's demand for talks outside the
country as ``political extortion'' and an attempt to overturn the
results of the election.
	   Despite general approval of the election as relatively free and
fair by most international observers, the opposition has claimed
the CPP achieved its victory through fraud and intimidation.
	   It insists its allegations must be thoroughly investigated
before agreeing to any coalition.
	   Chea Sim said that no matter what an investigation showed, the
ruling party would not accept a change in the results of the
election.
	   Chea Sim did hint that there was still room for compromise in a
new round of talks, saying, ``the Cambodian People's Party is
considering avenues to serve the interests of our nation.''
	   The ruling party president said he held hope negotiations could
lead to a summit of top party leaders chaired by King Norodom
Sihanouk in Phnom Penh.
	   But the aging monarch, noting that the three parties could not
even agree on a venue for the summit, has since declined to chair
the meeting.

In major move by Japan, troubled bank to be nationalized
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: PMs; RECASTS, UPDATE with comment from analyst &QL; 
 &UR; By MARTIN FACKLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Japanese government said Friday that it will
take control of one of the nation's largest banks, in a move
applauded by analysts as showing Tokyo's resolve to finally clean
up its debt-ridden financial system.
	   In announcing the first nationalization of a Japanese bank since
World War II, Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi said he approved the
takeover of the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd., whose recent
troubles had shaken world confidence in Japan's banking system and
prompted heated debate about a taxpayer bailout.
	   ``The government will continue to take all possible measures to
protect depositors and others, to maintain an orderly financial
system, and to stabilize financial markets at home and abroad,''
Obuchi said.
	   The takeover will be the first test for newly passed legislation
aimed at revitalizing the financial system and lifting Japan out of
its worst recession in half a century.
	   The 60 trillion yen (dlrs 515 billion) package, approved last
week, allows the government to ease out ailing lenders and help
healthier ones rid themselves of a crushing burden of bad loans
that some analyst say total a trillion dollars.
	   On Friday, analysts said the takeover sent a clear signal that
Tokyo is at last willing to end the so-called convoy system, where
the government offered unconditional protection to banks, and begin
allowing market forces to sift winners and losers.
	   ``We wanted to see if the government would be willing to close
down non-viable banks,'' James Fiorillo, a senior analyst at ING
Baring Securities in Tokyo, said in an interview.
	   Under the takeover, the prime minister told reporters, LTCB will
temporarily continue normal operations, including lending to sound
borrowers.
	   Obuchi also said the government would guarantee repayment to
holders of LTCB's bonds _ called debentures _ and appoint a new
board of directors to oversee a public-funded cleanup of LTCB's bad
loans.
	   Once a pillar of Japan's postwar economy, LTCB lost billions of
dollars in real estate loans made during the speculative property
price bubble of the late 1980s.
	   The Financial Supervisory Agency, Japan's financial watchdog,
said Friday that an audit of LTCB's books had revealed that debts
exceed assets by some 340 billion yen (dlrs 2.9 billion) _ meaning
the bank is effectively bankrupt.
	   The most likely outcome for the bank, said analysts, would be
for the government to keep control for one year while public funds
are used to write off losses and another finance company is found
to absorb LTCB's healthy operations.
	   A possible partner would be Sumitomo Trust and Banking Co.,
which agreed to merge with LTCB earlier this year but then backed
out as the size of LTCB's troubles became known.
	   Government willingness to use public money may sweeten the deal,
media reports said.
	   The Tokyo Stock Exchange on Friday suspended trading in LTCB
shares, which it said would soon be delisted. Share prices had
fallen to a record low of 2 yen (dlrs 0.17) earlier this week amid
news reports that the bank may be insolvent.
	   The takeover spells the end of LTCB's 46-year history. Founded
in the aftermath of Japan's military defeat to provide cheap,
long-term loans to industry, the bank helped lead the country's
spectacular rise to economic superpower status.
	   But like the U.S. savings and loan industry a decade ago,
changes in regulations and the economy made specialized lenders
like LTCB obsolete.
	   Desperate for new customers, the bank increasingly lent to
riskier enterprises such as real estate developers until property
prices crashed in the 1990s.
	   Japan's tenth biggest bank with 28 trillion yen (dlrs 240
billion) in total assets, LTCB reported a 280 billion-yen (dlrs 2.4
billion) loss in the year ended March 1998.

China faces drought after floods
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ After battling a deadly summer of floods, China
now faces the threat of drought in major wheat growing areas, state
media said Friday.
	   A drought that began in early autumn is worsening in Henan,
Hebei, Shanxi and Shandong provinces in the north, the China Daily
said. Farmers in a few southern provinces also face the threat of
severe drought, it said.
	   The drought is endangering the planting of winter wheat, the
newspaper said. Xinhua, the state-run news agency, said northern
China has sown 16.4 million hectares (40.5 million acres) of land
since mid-September, instead of 21.1 million hectares (52.1 million
acres) as planned.
	   Northern China's wheat growing areas have had little rainfall
since September and no major rainfall is expected in the weeks
ahead, the reports said.
	   Hard-hit Henan province has allocated 18 million yuan (dlrs 2.17
million) for irrigation facilities to deal with the drought, Xinhua
said. Shandong, further south, has allocated 215 million yuan (dlrs
26 million), it said.
	   The Yellow River has been dry for 138 days in Shandong this
year, the China Daily said.
	   The drought follows a summer of floods in southern and
northeastern China that killed more than 3,000 people and caused
dlrs 30 billion in damage.
	   About 230 million people, a fifth of China's population, were
affected by the two months of floods _ the worst in 44 years on the
Yangtze River and in decades in China's northeast.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ When Tamaki Shimizu gets home from the office, her
work has just begun. She must tidy up, do the laundry and fix
dinner _ twice, since her husband gets home too late for them to
eat together.
	   ``I feel as though it's all been dumped on my shoulders,'' she
sighs. ``But if I don't do it, who will?''
	   But as more and more women work full-time outside the home, the
notion that they should also be the ones doing all of the cooking
has changed from unquestioned assumption to sore point between the
sexes.
	   Editors at Shukan Bunshun, a popular weekly magazine, found out
just how emotional the subject has become recently when they ran a
story slamming female celebrities who don't cook proper meals for
their husbands.
	   ``Divorce for celebrity wives who can't cook,'' it proclaimed.
``Suppose you come home late after work and whisper you want a bowl
of rice in hot green tea, but your wife serves instant noodles
instead. Isn't that sad?''
	   The article has since become the topic of dinnertime discussions
around the country. Two of Japan's biggest newspapers have run
stories looking into the cooking controversy, and a third published
a letter from an older woman praising her husband for helping out
with the cooking chores.
	   ``We were shocked'' by the response, said Bunshun
editor-in-chief Kiyondo Matsui. ``What we intended as an
entertainment story turned into a serious social issue.''
	   Bunshun was even taken to task by one of its own star
columnists, and one of Japan's most popular novelists, Mariko
Hayashi.
	   ``I couldn't help but think the story was a bit anachronistic,''
she wrote. ``If (men) want to eat ... they should cook. Their wives
are working, too.''
	   Women account for nearly 40 percent of Japan's workforce.
	   Equality in the workplace remains a rather distant goal in this
country _ discriminatory hiring practices and sexual harassment are
widespread. But the number of working women is increasing and the
quality and breadth of jobs women hold is gradually improving.
	   Still, attitudes about what their role should be at home remain
deeply entrenched.
	   According to a survey published by the Prime Minister's Office
in July, nearly 85 percent of women and 89 percent of men believe
that whether a woman works or not, it is her responsibility to
handle the domestic chores and child rearing.
	   The same government survey found women with jobs spend more than
four hours a day cooking, cleaning and taking care of the kids. But
men with working wives on average spend just 21 minutes on such
chores.
	   Natsuko Horii, a government official in charge of equal
opportunity promotion, said working women often feel they must do
the housework to live up to the expectations of their husbands and
in-laws.
	   ``In Japan, men's place used to be at work and women at home,''
Horii said. ``Now, women are responsible for both.''
	   Not all men are against being a little more helpful.
	   Midori Miwa, spokeswoman for the Better Home Association, a
nationwide cooking school chain, says there has been a significant
increase in male students signing up for cooking lessons.
	   She said about 55,000 women signed up for the course this year,
roughly unchanged from the number 10 years ago. In contrast, male
students made a 10-fold increase to 3,000. Many of the enrollees
are in their 50s or 60s, and plan to help their wives after
retirement.
	   Media signals, meanwhile, are mixed.
	   A popular Sunday variety show has a regular spot featuring the
efforts of young women to fix common dishes. The women, chosen off
the street, generally fail to cook the foods properly, and are
assailed for their lack of prowess.
	   On the flip side, another hit show centers around a popular
five-member, all-male singing group cooking fancy dinners for guest
actresses each week.
	   ``Things are slowly changing,'' said Bunshun editor Matsui.
	   ``But to be honest,'' he added, ``I'd prefer a wife who knows
how to cook.''

Moody's says it may downgrade ratings of four top Japanese banks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Credit ratings agency Moody's Investors Service
said Friday that it has placed the creditworthiness of four major
Japanese lenders, including top-ranked Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi
Ltd., under review for possible downgrades.
	   Moody's said the move was prompted by heightened concerns over
the banks' exposure to economic problems in Japan and other Asian
nations, higher borrowing costs overseas and declines in the value
of their stockholdings.
	   It also cited worries about potential undisclosed losses at
subsidiaries and affiliates of the banks.
	   In addition to the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, the action targeted
the Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd., Sanwa Bank Ltd. and Sumitomo
Bank Ltd.
	   The ratings agency welcomed the recent passage of legislation in
Japan which will allow banks to shore up their capital reserves
with public funds.
	   But it said many questions remain unanswered about how the
banking industry stabilization measures will be implemented.

Floods claim 20 lives in central Vietnam
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Flooding has killed 20 people and caused
extensive damage in central Vietnam, local officials said Friday.
	   Downpours with 300 to 500 millimeters (12 to 20 inches) of rain
over the past three days have raised water levels in most rivers
and submerged large tracts of land, officials said.
	   The Binh Dinh provincial Floods and Storm Control Committee said
flooding had claimed eight lives there, while Khanh Hoa and Quang
Ngai provinces each reported six deaths,
	   There was no estimate of damage in one of Vietnam's poorest
regions, which was one of the areas hit hardest earlier this year
by the country's worst droughts in at least a half-century.
	   The Southern Weather Forecast Center based in Ho Chi Minh City
is predicting more drought next year in the Mekong Delta, the
country's rice basket.
	   It said the water level in the Mekong River is about a meter
(three feet) lower than the average over recent decades. Low river
levels in the Mekong river system allowed saltwater to encroach on
rice paddies earlier this year.
	   The dry season in southern Vietnam usually begins in
mid-November and lasts until April.

Indonesian president calls on military to halt mysterious killings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ President B.J. Habibie urged the
military to restore order in a region where a wave of mysterious
attacks has left more than 150 people dead, a newspaper reported
Friday.
	   For three months, the eastern end of the main island of Java has
endured a killing spree in which some of those who died were Muslim
clerics accused of sorcery.
	   Vigilante groups struck at alleged assailants, and several
murder suspects have been beheaded. About 330 people have been
arrested and 22 people convicted in mob attacks have been sentenced
to five years in jail.
	   Habibie, who is grappling with an economic crisis while trying
to push through democratic reforms, said Thursday that he told the
military, known by its Indonesian acronym ABRI, to continue to
pursue those responsible for the terror.
	   ``I have instructed the ABRI commander to immediately take clear
measures against the perpetrators,'' the Kompas newspaper quoted
Habibie as saying. ``Whatever the reason, those killings can't be
justified.''
	   Armed forces commander Gen. Wiranto has visited the city of
Banyuwangi, where the killings began, to talk to community leaders
and Muslim teachers.
	   Earlier this week, police shot dead two men linked to some of
the murders in Jember, about 800 kilometers (500 miles) east of the
capital, Jakarta.
	   In some cases, mentally ill people have become scapegoats in the
killings and police have protected them from angry mobs. Some
community leaders believe unknown groups trying to sow chaos have
dropped off mentally ill people in neighborhoods to scare local
residents.
	   Some victims of the killings that began in August in the regency
of Banyuwangi were preachers or members of the 30 million-member
Nahdlatul Ulama, Indonesia's largest Muslim organization.
	   The government has rejected a claim by Nahdlatul Ulama leader
Abdurahman Wahid that an unidentified Cabinet minister was behind
the killings.

IOC warns on tax, calls budget ``ambitious''
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ International Olympic Committee
official Jacques Rogge warned Friday that a proposed federal goods
and services tax (GST) could spell ``big trouble'' for a successful
hosting of the Sydney 2000 Olympics.
	   IOC executive board member Rogge, who heads the committee formed
to monitor Sydney's progress ahead of the 2000 games, will meet
Australia's new Sports Minister Jackie Kelly to discuss the matter
on Saturday.
	   Rogge said Wednesday that the IOC was opposed to the GST, but he
moved onto the attack Friday.
	   ``Definitely it is important because it could lead to a major
(budget) blowout, and then we will run into big problems,'' Rogge
told a news conference. ``We are not really concerned about the
delivery of services looking at the (current) budget, but if the
GST is imposed then we are in big trouble.''	   
	   The federal government was reelected earlier this month running
on the platform of tax reform, including a 10 percent GST. SOCOG
says that unless it gets an exemption, it could cost up Aust dlrs
200 million (U.S. dlrs 126 million) and cause a major blowout to
the Aust dlrs 2.6 billion (U.S. dlrs 1.6 billion) budget.
	   Rogge said Friday he was impressed with the progress of venues
and games planning, but called the SOCOG budget ``ambitious yet
feasible.''
	   Rogge said the Asian currency crisis, which has seen a fall in
the Australian dollar against the U.S. dollar, along with most
currencies in the region, will also impact on the budget.
	   ``Much will depend on the Asian crisis, which is beyond the
control of SOCOG. It might affect the budget and marketing but not
to the point where the games will be endangered,'' Rogge said.
``But definitely it is going to have an influence.''
	   Rogge said SOCOG's fund raising plans were ambitious in the
areas of ticketing and marketing.
	   SOCOG needs to sell about two-thirds of its almost 10 million
tickets to reach budget estimates, while the sponsorship drive has
hit a lull.
	   SOCOG is aiming to make Aust dlrs 874 million (U.S. dlrs 550
million) from corporate sponsorship but has secured just 71 percent
of the target with about Aust dlrs 250 million (U.S. dlrs 157
million) still required.
	   Despite the warnings, SOCOG president Michael Knight maintained
his perpetual smile and was relaxed enough to crack wise Friday.
	   He said SOCOG staff had undergone ``lateral thinking,
brainstorming'' sessions in a bid to divine new channels of
sponsorship money.
	   ``We're always walking a fine line here between how you raise
revenue and how you also protect the integrity of the games,''
Knight said. ``You'd get a lot of money for putting the Olympic
rings on condoms _ and we're not going to do that.
	   ``You could get a lot of money for letting someone barbecue
chicken on the Olympic flame. We wouldn't have a bar of anything
like that.''
	   Neither idea was a great advertisement for SOCOG's
brainstorming, but Knight said some other ideas had merit.
	   ``The remains of the games have usually been sold off for second
hand equipment. But some of the things can be sold off as sporting
memorabilia,'' said Knight.
	   ``The bed that Cathy Freeman sleeps in in the village before she
wins the 400-meter gold medal is going to be either looked at as a
secondhand bed or an important piece of sporting memorabilia that a
lot of people would like to buy for their kids.''
	   The IOC will remain the final arbiter of taste.
	   ``The marketing area is looking at new avenues and uncharted
territories,'' said Rogge. ``The integrity of the games will be
maintained, we'll never go into marketing developments which are
not compatible with the ethics and image of the games.''

Taiwan denies report of arms race with China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ A defense think tank says Taiwan boosted
weapons purchases by billions of dollars last year, but Taiwanese
military officials questioned the figures and insisted Friday they
are not locked in an arms race with mainland China.
	   London's Financial Times reported Friday on an assessment of the
global arms trade by the International Institute for Strategic
Studies, which says Taiwan's purchases of military hardware jumped
to dlrs 7.3 billion last year, from dlrs 1.8 billion in 1996.
	   The London-based institute was quoted by the newspaper as saying
fighter jet deliveries to Taiwan fueled a 12 percent growth in
international arms trade last year, with Taiwan the world's second
largest weapons importer after Saudi Arabia.
	   The newspaper quoted the think tank's director of studies,
Gerald Segal, as saying the military buildup in Taiwan and China is
``one of the most dangerous aspects of the situation in east Asia,
though the orders for weapons had been known of for some time and
therefore the balance had not fundamentally changed.''
	   Taiwanese lawmaker Parris Chang said Taiwan was posing no
threats, but purchasing arms only to deter any invasion from China.
	   Taiwan also took issue with the figures in the report. Military
officials said payments for 150 American-made F-16 fighter jets and
60 French-made Mirage jets together with air-to-air missiles _
totaling dlrs 12.7 billion _ were spread out between 1992 and 1999,
when the last jets are scheduled to be delivered.
	   The Taiwanese declined to provide a breakdown, but they said
last year's payment was not significantly higher than that of 1996.
	   Lockheed Martin Corp. told Taiwanese reporters visiting its U.S.
plant in Fort Worth, Texas, this week that it had delivered 103
F-16 jets to Taiwan, and the remaining fighters will be delivered
by October 1999.
	   Taiwan has also taken delivery of 40 of the 60 Mirage 2000-5
fighters it ordered from the French planemaker Dassault. The island
is also making 130 shorter-range fighter jets by itself.
	   The purchases were part of a major overhaul to replace World War
II-era warplanes and naval vessels. Taiwan has said buying modern
weapons could help deter an invasion from China, and possibly spare
the West the pain of defending it.
	   Taiwan says China has placed 1,000 combat aircraft at bases
along its southeastern coast facing Taiwan.
	   Taiwan's Nationalists were driven to the island by Mao
Tse-tung's communists forces following a civil war in 1949. China
claims the island a renegade province to be reunified with the
mainland by force, if necessary.
	   Although the two sides are approaching each other to break a
three-year freeze in dialogue, neither side has eased its military
buildup.

No protests during cricket tournament
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Bangladesh's main opposition announced
a moratorium on potentially violent antigovernment protests Friday,
citing an international cricket tournament that begins Saturday.
	   ``We don't want to disturb the tournament,'' Abdul Mannan
Bhuiyan, a spokesman for the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, told
reporters. He said no protests will be held until November.
	   An opposition-led protest Thursday ended with riot police
beating and firing tear gas on protesters who exploded homemade
bombs, burned a police van and attacked buses. Two protesters were
killed, apparently beaten to death by police. The opposition was
demonstrating against what it called the government's mismanagement
of flood relief.
	   The nine-day Wills International Cricket Cup tournament features
Sri Lanka, India, Pakistan, Australia, South Africa, West Indies,
England, New Zealand and Zimbabwe.
	   Zimbabwe will take on New Zealand in Saturday's opening match.

Thai mother shoots accused killer of son outside court
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A Thai woman shot and critically
wounded the accused killer of her son outside the court where he
was about to stand trial for murder, a police officer said on
Friday.
	   Srisombat Pakdiwong shot Natthapol Virayutsilp three times with
a hand gun on Thursday outside a court in Lopburi, 115 kilometers
(71 miles) north of Bangkok, said the officer, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
	   Natthapol and two accomplices had been charged with robbing, and
then shooting and stabbing Srisombat's 25-year-old son seven months
ago.
	   ``I have taken revenge for my son. Even if I have to pay with my
life, I will accept it,'' Srisombat was quoted as saying by The
Nation newspaper.
	   She had gone to attend the trial with her husband and two other
sons, and then confronted Natthapol near the canteen in the court
compound.
	   ``I asked him whether he was the man who killed my son. He said
he was and threatened to get me next. I was suddenly overcome with
anger and shot him,'' Srisombat was quoted as saying by The Nation.
	   After being apprehended by police, Srisombat was released on
500,000 baht (dlrs 12,500) bail. Police said they will charge her
with attempted murder and violating the dignity of the court.
	   They are not sure, however, that she is mentally fit to stand
trial, the officer said, and she will have to be examined by a
doctor.
	   Srisombat's friends told investigating officers that she hasn't
been herself in the past few weeks and sometime doesn't make any
sense when she speaks, said the officer.
	   Natthapol is in intensive care in a provincial hospital, police
said.

Reports: Reputed Hong Kong crime boss had plans for more

kidnappings &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A reputed Hong Kong crime boss who reportedly
has admitted to participating in the kidnapping of two of the
territory's wealthiest businessmen also claims he had plans to
kidnap more, a newspaper said Friday.
	   The Chinese-language daily Ming Pao said that Cheung Tze-keung,
whose alias is ``Big Spender,'' told a Chinese court that he was
the only person who had the ability to kidnap a tycoon in Hong
Kong.
	   The newspaper quoted Cheung as saying during his trial in China
that ``had I not been arrested ... there would have been no way
that any of Hong Kong's top 10 tycoons could be spared'' from the
gang's kidnapping spree.
	   The trial of Cheung and 35 other defendants in Guangzhou,
southern China, is closed to journalists, and Ming Pao did not say
how it obtained its information.
	   Charges against the reputed gangsters center around the killing
of a mainland Chinese businessman and a Hong Kong resident, armed
robberies, smuggling explosives into Hong Kong, and the kidnapping
of the two Hong Kong businessmen for more than 1.6 billion Hong
Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 205 million) in ransom.
	   Prosecutors also accused the defendants of kidnapping a merchant
from Fujian, China, for a 4 million Chinese yuan ransom (U.S. dlrs
48,300).
	   Some media reports have said Cheung had already admitted to
planning and participating in the kidnapping of Hong Kong property
tycoon Li Ka-shing's son, Victor Li, and Walter Kwok, chairman of
Sun Hung Kai Properties.
	   But the Hong Kong Standard reported Friday that Cheung was
trying to pin the blame for masterminding the kidnapping of one
businessman, identified only by the surname ``Li,'' on one of
Cheung's purported henchmen, Chan Chi-ho.
	   Chan was described by the Standard as a professional criminal
who got 290 million Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 37 million) in the
tycoon's kidnapping.
	   The courthouse has remained ringed by tight security, reportedly
out of concerns that the gang's illicit weapon suppliers might try
to assassinate the defendants to silence them.
	   The South China Morning Post also quoted an unnamed prison
source as saying Cheung and other defendants were fearful that some
of Cheung's accomplices might try to poison them, so they were
taking their meals from food that had been brought in for security
officials.
	   Ming Pao said two bomb threats have been delivered since the
trial began, with the second on Thursday allegedly signed by
someone claiming to be a Cheung accomplice.

Malaysian budget to seek 1 percent growth next year
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Will be led after budget released 0800 GMT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
will seek stimulus measures to eke out a 1-percent growth rate when
he unveils the 1999 budget Friday.
	   The optimistic goal comes in the wake of 4.8 percent contraction
in the economy this year, provoking the first formal recession in
more than a decade.
	   Meanwhile, thousands of anti-government demonstrators were
preparing to march on Parliament just as Mahathir presents the
budget to lawmakers. They intend to protest the jailing of ousted
finance minister Anwar Ibrahim on charges of corruption and illegal
homosexual activities.
	   Analysts expect the budget to include a large deficit as it
follows Mahathir's economic philosophy of spending more to boost
corporate health, spur recovery and create employment.
	   Earlier this month, Deputy Finance Minister Wong See Wah said
further expansionary policies would be introduced in the budget.
Government spending has already been raised by nearly 20 percent in
1998, after Malaysia turned its back on International Monetary
Fund-style, tight-money, low-spending policies.
	   Malaysia imposed capital controls last month, which curbed flows
of speculative funds, and effectively pegged the country's currency
at 3.80 ringgit to the dollar.
	   Mahathir hopes these measures, which allow the government to
boost spending without undermining the stability of the currency,
would make Malaysia the first country in Southeast Asia to recover
from the Asian economic crisis.
	   Since 1993, Malaysia's budgets have always shown a surplus, and
revenues have been substantially higher than expenditure during the
boom years when the economy grew by between 8 percent and 10
percent annually.
	   Mahathir took over as Malaysia's finance minister in September
after he fired Anwar. Mahathir was unhappy with Anwar's policies,
which he said followed inappropriate Western-style austerity
prescriptions.
	   Analysts say the budget was expected to continue the National
Economic Recovery Plan announced in August. They also expect cuts
in corporate and personal income taxes, offset by levies on
gambling, alcohol and tobacco.
	   But it was unclear how the cash-strapped treasury would fund
many of the ambitious projects to revive a banking sector
staggering under the weight of bad loans and big corporations owned
by politically influential Malaysians.
	   Earlier this month, Daim Zainuddin, Mahathir's chief economic
aide, said Malaysia needs around 60 billion ringgit (dlrs 15.8
billion) to revive banks and pay for fiscal stimulus measures. He
said that sum was too much for the government to bear alone and
other sources of funding were being sought.

Fishermen run aground, spend two weeks searching for help
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A pair of fishermen ran aground in an uninhabited
patch of Russia's east coast and spent two weeks trekking through
the tundra before finding someone to help, a news report said
Friday.
	   The two fishermen, Andrei Shlykov and Alexei Chumachenko,
covered about 120 kilometers (75 miles) on foot before they came
across a reindeer breeders' camp near the town of Yamsk, the
Interfax news agency reported.
	   The two men suffered frostbite on their hands and feet and were
being treated at a hospital in Magadan, medical worker Tatyana
Dmitriyeva was quoted as saying.
	   While they were in the wilderness, the two men spent their days
walking across the tundra searching for help, and living off
berries they collected. They burned branches from fir trees to keep
warm at night and were fortunate that no snow storms had yet hit
the region, the report said.

Jewish settlers demonstrate against Wye accord

 &UR; With US_Mideast Talks

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli settlers in the West Bank, concerned
for their safety as an Israel-Palestinian agreement takes shape,
demonstrated Friday for the third straight day.
	   While Israeli hardliners protest, Israel's moderate Labor party
declared it would support the agreement, taking shape at summit
talks outside Washington. Labor, in the parliamentary opposition,
informed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party that Labor
will not vote in favor of motions of no confidence for two weeks.
	   Another Israeli minister added his name to a growing list of
opponents inside Netanyahu's cabinet. Yuli Edelstein, who lives in
a Jewish settlement outside Jerusalem, told Israel radio, ``Perhaps
the agreement will be signed at a very nice ceremony, but it will
not allow us and our children to live here in peace.''
	   Several dozen Israelis from the settlement of Efrat, between
Hebron and Jerusalem, demonstrated next to the highway in front of
their settlement. A similar number protested along the highway from
Jericho to Jerusalem.
	   Alex Tal from Efrat charged that the proposed agreement
threatens Israel's security. ``We will feel it first, but all of
Israel will suffer,'' he said. ``We are moving the border of a
terrorist state closer to Tel Aviv.''
	   In contrast to the two previous days, Israeli police prevented
the settlers from blocking roads Friday.

Japanese stocks finish lower, dollar rises higher
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing stocks, mid-afternoon dollar and bond,
comments

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stock prices finished lower Friday on
profit-taking following a five-day gain, while the U.S. dollar rose
against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 150.86 points,
or 1.06 percent, closing the week at 14,144.70. On Thursday, it had
climbed 79.23 points, or 0.56 percent.
	   The dollar bought 118.58 yen in mid-afternoon trading, up 0.86
yen from late Thursday in Tokyo and also above its rate of 117.87
yen in late New York trading overnight.
	   On the stock market, the Nikkei index opened higher but later
reversed course as investors began selling to take advantage of a
nearly 1,300-point gain in the index over the past five trading
days.
	   In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average bounced back from
a loss of 97 points and rose 13.91 points to 8,533.14, extending an
increasingly anemic winning streak to seven sessions.
	   On Friday, the Tokyo Stock Exchange suspended trading in shares
of the troubled Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. before the
market opened on news the bank had formally applied to be
nationalized under a government rescue plan.
	   Shares of LTCB, once a pillar of Japan's postwar financial
system but which recently has struggled under a massive load of bad
loans, had fallen to a record low of 2 yen (dlrs 0.17) earlier this
week.
	   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi later approved the takeover and
announced the first nationalization of a Japanese bank since World
War II.
	   Earlier this month, Japan's Parliament passed the legislation
allowing government takeovers of foundering banks to fix them or
shut them down. It authorized the government to pump up to 60
trillion yen (dlrs 515 billion) in taxpayer funds into the ailing
banking system.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section closed down 6.14 points, or 0.57 percent, to
1,068.15. The TOPIX had risen 2.46 points, or 0.23 percent, the
previous day.
	   In currency trading, the dollar moved higher after Japanese
investors sold yen and bought dollars but the U.S. currency's
upside was limited because of selling by Japanese exporters,
dealers said.
	   ``Japanese investors are gradually dismissing the dollar's
downside risk of falling below 110.00 yen,'' said Shuji Takano,
assistant manager of foreign exchange at ABN Amro Bank.
	   Also supporting the dollar was the announcement by credit
ratings agency Moody's Investors Service that it has placed the
credit ratings of four major Japanese banks on review for possible
downgrade, dealers said.
	   Moody's cited heightened concerns over the banks' exposure to
economic problems in Japan and other Asian nations, higher
borrowing costs overseas and declines in the value of their
stockholdings for the move.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 0.850 percent from Thursday's finish of 0.830 percent,
driving down its price to 108.46 yen from 108.66 yen.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ South Africa and Singapore signed a defense
agreement Friday allowing the deployment of military personnel from
the Southeast Asian city-state for training purposes.
	   A statement from Singapore's Ministry of Defense said the
agreement, which was signed in Pretoria, South Africa, was the two
countries' second such defense arrangement and a ``milestone in the
warm bilateral defense ties'' between the two countries.
	   Singapore's air force will deploy more than 50 personnel forming
the island republic's first ``unmanned aerial vehicle'' detachment
for a six-week training session at the Hoedspruit Airforce Base in

agreement in November, 1997, providing for military cooperation
covering training, technology and defense industry activities.

Iranians vote in key assembly election amid fears of low turnout
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with polls open, supreme leader casts vote; Polls
scheduled to close at 1430 GMT; first official results expected
Saturday &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos Planned
 &UR; By SCHEHEREZADE FARAMARZI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iranians voted Friday in nationwide
elections for a key assembly that is expected to be dominated by
hard-line clergymen who favor unhindered powers for the country's
supreme leader.
	   Few voters were seen in the first hour after polling began at 8
a.m. (0430 gmt) in 33,312 polling stations in the country's 28
provinces. The streets of Tehran were largely deserted and security
personnel _ among the 100,000 deployed nationwide _ lounged on
street corners, talking to each other.
	   Among the first to vote was supreme leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei, the successor of the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini who
led the 1979 Islamic Revolution to install the rule of Shiite
clergy in Iran.
	   A total of 161 candidates _ about 130 of them conservative
clerics _ are contesting for 86 seats in the Assembly of Experts,
whose job is to oversee the work of the supreme leader.
	   In practice, the supreme leader has the final say in all
matters, and the hard-liners want to keep it that way. Moderate
clerics led by President Mohammad Khatami are calling for more
accountability from the supreme leader.
	   In is main bulletin Friday, state radio said: ``This morning our
martyr-breeding people are going to the polls to determine their
destiny by voting in the Assembly of Experts elections.''
	   But the hard-liners had won the battle even before the polls: a
conservative supervisory council that vetted a list of 396
prospective candidates rejected most moderates, leaving only about
30 in the fray.
	   The lack of competition has led to fears of a low turnout from a
disappointed public, and even hard-line newspapers estimated that
only about 39 percent of the 38 million eligible voters will show
up.
	   This would be in sharp contrast to the 1997 presidential
election when 20 million people voted for Khatami, whose
one-year-old effort to ease the social, political and media
restrictions imposed by the Islamic Revolution has pit him against
the hard-liners in an intense power struggle in the ruling clergy.
	   Despite popular backing for Khatami's work, the hard-liners have
refused to ease their grip over Iran's key institutions such as the
judiciary and security agencies.
	   A low turnout in Friday's elections could be seen as a rebuff of
the hard-line policies of supreme leader Khamenei. Hoping to
prevent that, the conservative clergymen had been exhorting people
this week to exercise their ``divine duty'' at the polls.
	   Voting is scheduled to close at 6 p.m. (1430 gmt) but could be
extended by a few hours if needed. First official results are not
expected until Saturday.

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Donors around the world have provided
nearly all the money the Red Cross said was needed to help India
respond to the most devastating floods in decades, the aid
organization said Friday.
	   The European Community, the governments of Britain, Germany and
Switzerland and Red Cross societies in Sweden and Japan combined to
provide nearly dlrs 1 million in aid, the South Asia office of the
International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies
said in a statement.
	   The Red Cross had appealed for the aid in September, following
summer floods that killed 2,500 people in northern India and
destroyed countless houses and land.

Reports: Indonesian authorities investigate Suharto's half-brother
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS that attorney general has so far found no evidence
indicating Suharto committed financial crimes.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A relative of former President Suharto
has been declared a suspect in a credit scam at a liquidated bank
he owned, newspapers reported Friday.
	   Police on Thursday questioned Probosutedjo, Suharto's
half-brother, about allegations he was involved in irregularities
at Bank Jakarta, which was shut in November along with 15 other
troubled banks.
	   The closures were part of a series of banking reforms required
by the International Monetary Fund in exchange for billions of
dollars in aid to economically shattered Indonesia.
	   The business holdings of Suharto, who quit in May amid riots and
student protests against his 32-year authoritarian rule, have also
come under investigation. Critics allege he used his clout to
foster corruption that benefited his family and friends.
	   Attorney General Andi Muhammad Ghalib, a three-star army
general, said Thursday that he has yet to find any evidence that
implicates Suharto in financial wrongdoing.
	   ``If anyone has the courage to say that Suharto is a suspect,
they must produce evidence,'' the Post quoted Ghalib as saying.
	   Probosutedjo admitted that he breached his bank's legal lending
limit, The Jakarta Post reported. Many bank credits were granted to
his Mercu Buana business group.
	   But he said he was innocent of other charges of wrongdoing and
that he had helped many small traders by granting them loans.
	   ``I didn't inflict any financial losses on my bank customers or
even the government,'' Probosutedjo said.
	   Suharto's successor, President B.J. Habibie, was a longtime
protege of the former president. However, Habibie is implementing
democratic reforms and is under pressure to wipe out corruption and
nepotism that flourished while Suharto was in power.

China to conduct fifth census
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China plans to find out just how much its world's
largest population has grown by conducting a census in 2000, state
media reported Friday.
	   In addition to counting heads, the census will survey population
distribution, migration, marriages, income levels and living and
working conditions, media reports said.
	   The census will be the fifth since the communists came to power
in 1949. The last one in 1990 found the country had 1.13 billion
people _ 20 million more than the government expected. Some of the
extras came from families who exceeded strict government-set birth
limits and tried to hide additional children to avoid fines.
	   The government estimates the population surpassed 1.2 billion in
1994, six years ahead of its target.
	   Censuses in China are conducted with military-style flair. Seven
million census-takers were mobilized for the 1990 census. Wang
Zhongyu, who manages daily affairs of the State Council, China's
Cabinet, will oversee the 2000 census, the reports said.

Iranians vote in key assembly election amid fears of low turnout

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iranians voted Friday in nationwide
elections for a key assembly that is expected to be dominated by
hard-line clergymen who favor unhindered powers for the country's
supreme leader.
	   Few voters were seen in the first hour after polling began at 8
a.m. (0430 GMT) in 33,312 polling stations in the country's 28
provinces. The streets of Tehran were largely empty and security
personnel _ among 100,000 deployed nationwide _ chatted on street
corners.
	   Among the first to vote was supreme leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei, the successor of the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini who
led the 1979 Islamic Revolution to install the rule of Shiite
clergy in Iran.
	   A total of 161 candidates _ about 130 of them conservative
clerics _ are contesting for 86 seats in the Assembly of Experts,
whose job is to oversee the work of the supreme leader.
	   In practice, the supreme leader has the final say in all
matters, and the hard-liners want to keep it that way. Moderate
clerics led by President Mohammad Khatami are calling for more
accountability from the supreme leader.
	   In its main bulletin Friday, state radio said: ``This morning
our martyr-breeding people are going to the polls to determine
their destiny by voting in the Assembly of Experts elections.''
	   But the hard-liners had won the battle even before the polls: a
conservative supervisory council that vetted a list of 396
prospective candidates rejected all but about 30 of the moderates.
	   The lack of competition has led to fears of a low turnout from a
disappointed public, and even hard-line newspapers estimated that
only about 39 percent of the 38 million eligible voters will show
up.
	   This would be in sharp contrast to the 1997 presidential
election when 20 million people voted for Khatami, whose
one-year-old effort to ease the social, political and media
restrictions imposed by the Islamic Revolution has pit him against
the hard-liners in an power struggle in the ruling clergy.
	   Despite popular backing for Khatami's work, the hard-liners have
refused to ease their grip over Iran's key institutions such as the
judiciary and security agencies.
	   A low turnout in Friday's elections could be seen as a rebuff of
the hard-line policies of supreme leader Khamenei. Hoping to
prevent that, the conservative clergymen had been exhorting people
this week to exercise their ``divine duty'' at the polls.
	   Voting is scheduled to close at 6 p.m. (1430 GMT) but could be
extended by a few hours if needed. First official results are not
expected until Saturday.

Thousands of Malaysians defy police ban and hold reform rally

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Thousands of anti-government
demonstrators braved the threat of arrest Friday to gather at the
national mosque for a rally demanding political reforms.
	   Protesters waved their fists and shouted ``Reform!'', while
passing cars honked four times to punctuate the opposition rally
cry.
	   Hundreds hopped on motorcycles, their helmets over their white
caps donned for Friday afternoon prayers, and headed toward
Parliament, where Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad was set to
announce the 1999 budget.
	   Dozens of riot police with rattan canes and tear-gas canisters
looked on, preparing to disperse the crowd.
	   Police had warned those who joined the anti-government march
could face arrest under the Internal Security Act, which allows
indefinite detainment without trial.
	   The demonstrators are supporters of jailed dissident Anwar
Ibrahim, ousted as deputy prime minister and finance minister on
Sept. 2.
	   Police have declared illegal all demonstrations in support of
Anwar, who is awaiting trial on charges of graft and sexual
misconduct. So far, authorities have detained 262 people who have
attended anti-government rallies, releasing them on bail pending
trial.
	   City police chief Kamaruddin Ali said that no one had applied
for permit to hold Friday's demonstration, as required by law in
this Southeast Asian country.
	   ``We charged ... people on Wednesday for illegal assembly and
will not hesitate to do the same again,'' Kamaruddin was quoted as
saying in Friday editions of The Star.
	   On Wednesday, a local court ordered the trial of 127 people who
were arrested for participating in a demonstration that demanded
Mahathir's resignation.
	   Since Anwar's arrest last month, tens of thousands of Malaysians
have gathered regularly in the capital and other cities to demand
justice for the jailed politician.
	   Anwar, who showed up at his first court appearance bruised and
beaten, faces trial Nov. 2 on 10 counts of corruption and illegal
homosexual acts. He has condemned the charges as false and
politically motivated.
	   The political scandal and apparent police brutality against
Anwar have soured political relations with other nations. Indonesia
and the Philippines have expressed sympathy for the Malaysian
dissident.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton won't meet with Mahathir during the
APEC summit because of U.S. concerns over the handling of Anwar,
administration sources said Thursday.
	   The U.S. House International Affairs Committee released a letter
Thursday to Clinton from committee Chairman Benjamin Gilman and
Rep. Doug Bereuter urging the president to speak out ``forcefully''
about Malaysian human rights.
	   Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi called the
comments by the congressmen arrogant.
	   ``They should realize that they are the ones who are being
highly offensive towards Malaysia,'' he said.

15 dead, dozens missing as Typhoon Babs ravages northern

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ At least 15 people were dead and
dozens missing Friday as Typhoon Babs pummeled the northern
Philippines with heavy winds and rain, submerging parts of Manila
and forcing many businesses to close for a second day.
	   Police said at least 36 people were buried in a landslide in the
town of San Miguel in Catanduanes, where the typhoon first hit land
Thursday. Only six bodies have been recovered, regional police
chief Renato Arevalo said.
	   Arevalo said 25 gold miners in the town of Aroroy on Masbate
island were also reported missing Friday after the tunnel they were
working in flooded.
	   Roads throughout the central and northern Philippines were
flooded or blocked by landslides. Many people were homeless after
strong winds tore the roofs or walls off their simple bamboo
houses.
	   Thousands of people were also stranded as ports were shut down
and ships forbidden to sail.
	   In the hard-hit Bicol region, one of the Philippines' poorest
areas, more than a hundred thousand people were forced to flee
their homes, Red Cross officials said. About 10,000 jammed the town
of Matnog waiting for ferry service to nearby Samar island.
	   The storm also damaged telephone relay towers, cutting
communications to most of the region.
	   The dead also included six people who drowned, a man hit by a
falling coconut tree, another man who died of shock, and a fireman
pinned to death after his van overturned on a slippery road, said
Franklin Castillo, director of the Office of Civil Defense.
	   In Manila, President Joseph Estrada ordered government offices
to close at noon Friday, with the exception of disaster relief
agencies. He also ordered a forced evacuation of slum dwellers
living near swollen rivers.
	   About 15,700 people were evacuated from low-lying areas in the
capital, officials said.
	   ``Despite the situation, some people still refuse to leave their
homes to guard their meager property,'' said Jesusa Villanueva,
principal of a school being used as an evacuation center.
	   Some people, cradling chickens and dogs, stood on the roofs of
their houses, a few possessions piled next to them. Others used
tire tubes to float toward safer ground.
	   Hundreds of people living along a seawall near the oceanside
U.S. Embassy were evacuated because of high waves. In suburban
Marikina, about 4,500 people living on the bank of the swollen
Marikina River were also moved to evacuation centers.
	   At least 12 domestic flights and one international flight were
canceled.
	   After skirting Manila, Babs veered north toward the area
devastated last week by Super Typhoon Zeb, which killed at least 74
people in the Philippines and 43 more in Taiwan and Japan.
	   In Nueva Ecija province, more than 50 people crowded onto the
roof of a house in the town of Gapan to escape Babs' floodwaters.
	   About 88,000 hectares (217,000 acres) of rice were destroyed in
the province, officials said.
	   Babs also pounded areas around the Mount Pinatubo volcano with
heavy rain, unleashing 1.5 meter (5 foot) -high avalanches of
volcanic material from the mountain's slopes. Most of the material
was carried safely away by swollen rivers.
	   At midday, the storm was centered over Lingayen Gulf in
Pangasinan province, 200 kilometers (125 miles) north of Manila,
weather officials said. It had sustained winds of 120 kph (75 mph),
with gusts up to 150 kph (94 mph), and was on its way out to the
South China Sea.

Indonesian president says government determined to fight corruption
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ President B.J. Habibie on Friday
reiterated a pledge to wipe out government corruption that critics
say was endemic under his authoritarian predecessor, Suharto.
	   ``I am fully aware that various unhealthy business practices
have grown in the past in society,'' Habibie said at the opening of
a meeting of the National Distributors' Association.
	   The association includes businesses that provide materials for
government projects. Some government officials have allegedly
awarded contracts to well-connected tycoons.
	   Habibie, who took over from Suharto in May after riots and
protests against his 32-year rule, said he would promote the law
and business ethics as a way of battling corruption.
	   Once a protege of Suharto, Habibie is also implementing
democratic reforms as Indonesia endures its worst economic crisis
in decades.
	   The president promised support for small and mid-sized
businesses, which he said had suffered from corruption in big
business that helped derail the economy.
	   ``These groups were not wrong but in fact they have to suffer
the burden of the monetary crisis,'' Habibie said. ``The government
is determined not to repeat the mistakes that have been conducted
by big businessmen.''
	   The attorney general's office is investigating the source of
Suharto's wealth amid accusations that the former president used
his authority to enrich his family and associates. Suharto denies
any wrongdoing.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ An unfolding Japanese defense scandal claimed its
highest-profile victim yet Friday when the chairman of NEC Corp.
announced his resignation.
	   Chairman Tadahiro Sekimoto told reporters he knew nothing about
the scandal, but said he was stepping down because of the trouble
it had caused NEC customers, employees and shareholders.
	   ``I apologize deeply, and I decided to step down to draw the
line about ethical and social responsibilities. I hope NEC and its
group will now make a fresh start,'' he said.
	   However, Sekimoto said he remain a voting member of the
company's Board of Directors.
	   Prosecutors have recently raided two NEC subsidiaries and the
Tokyo headquarters of the Japanese Defense Agency in a widening
scandal involving corruption in military purchases.
	   A total of 13 officials from NEC Corp. and the two subsidiaries
_ Nico Electronics Co. and Toyo Communication Equipment Co. _ have
been arrested on suspicion of overcharging the Japanese military in
procurement contracts. Three of them are current NEC executives.
	   Prosecutors say the amount that the NEC affiliates overcharged
totals nearly 1.7 billion yen (dlrs 14.3 million).
	   Two Defense Agency officials also have been arrested, suspected
of winking at the inflated billings in exchange for the three
companies' providing jobs to retiring agency employees.
	   NEC president Hisashi Kaneko said on Friday that he would remain
with NEC, despite earlier reports that he too would resign.
	   ``I decided to remain as the president because it is also an
important management task to take measures to prevent the
recurrence of a similar incident, regain public trust and conduct
company reform,'' he said.
	   Neither Sekimoto nor Kaneko would explain those measures.
	   NEC, Japan's largest PC maker, is the world's second-largest
computer chip maker behind Intel Corp. It is owns more than 50
percent of California-based Packard Bell NEC, which controls about
10 percent of the world's computer market.
	   Sekimoto's resignation came three days before prosecutors are
expected to press formal charges against a former NEC executive who
was arrested earlier this month, Hiroaki Shimayama.
	   A key figure in the scandal is Kenichi Ueno, former deputy
director of Defense Agency procurement, who was arrested Sept. 3 on
suspicion of conspiring with the affiliates.
	   Kaneko said NEC is conducting an internal investigation about
the defense scandal, but he said this may not be sufficient and
expressed willingness to cooperate with prosecutors.

Hong Kong toys fair draws thousands to the business of play
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Thousands of toy merchants are in town to check
out the latest in teddy bears, roller blades and electronic games _
but whether they're having a good time depends mainly on whether
they're buying or selling.
	   Manufacturers aren't smiling too much about prices that are
falling along with Asia's economic fortunes, but retailers are
enjoying bargains that would have been unheard of a year ago.
	   ``Customers bargain too much,'' complained Stanley Lau of Hong
Kong, who came to the annual toy and gift fair to show off a range
of colorful stuffed toys that dance on cue to any noise made
nearby.
	   Many in the business sought to play down any link to the
financial crisis _ which has also helped some toy manufacturers in
the region by making their exports to the west more competitive.
	   ``Buyers are always trying to push down the prices; it's not
anything special,'' said Richard Marc Crosbie, a toy designer for
Hong Kong Toy Centre Ltd.
	   But some acknowledge business has taken a big tumble since last
year.
	   ``Purchase orders are down 30 percent,'' said Joe Chou of Koka
Chemical Industry Co. which makes a line of nouveau silly putty
products that can glow in the dark, release stinky scents, or emit
unpleasant sounds with names like ``Alien Putty,'' ``Zoo Putty''
and ``Fart Goo.''
	   International toy suppliers, buyers, designers, and distributors
come to the fair each year to drum up business and check out the
competition in Asia, the center of the world's toy manufacturing
business.
	   Brian J. Sykes of Los Angeles, who sources his merchandise from
factories mostly in China, said he comes to the fair because
``that's where the world comes.''
	   ``The idea is they're in Hong Kong, they feel they're getting a
better price because they're close to the factories,'' he said,
admitting that he can offer buyers the same price from his U.S.
office.
	   Most of the goods on display were made in China, which has
become the major source of the world's supply traditional toys,
excluding high-tech electronic toys.
	   Most of those fancier toys pass through Hong Kong, which still
acts as a gateway for many Chinese products.
	   Although diverse, the toys exhibited at the show that was ending
Friday did not represent the latest cutting edge designs in the
industry. They were comprised mostly of non-licensed brands.
	   One Taiwanese exhibitor was showing off swimming plastic fish in
a water-filled bowl.
	   ``It's like real fish, but normally, you need to pay attention
to feeding fish, with this one, you just change the water one time
a month,'' Stephanie Lin explained.

Reinstated defense force commander vows to end military's internal
</HEADLINE>
troubles &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ Reinstated commander
Brigadier-General Jerry Singirok vowed Friday to lead a leaner and
more disciplined military, after almost 20 months of turmoil
stemming from a mercenary crisis.
	   In his first speech since being reinstated earlier this month,
Singirok told about 400 troops at a swearing-in ceremony at Port
Moresby's Murray Barracks that he would end a difficult period for
the Papua New Guinea Defense Force.
	   He commended the troops on their turnout and drill, even though
some of them were wearing a mixture of uniforms.
	   ``The dress is mixed dress, but you have cleaned your boots, you
have brushed your teeth, you have shaved this morning, you have had
a haircut and you did stop at the mirror,'' Singirok said.
	   ``If you feel good, then you will do good and you will be
good.''
	   The reputation of the Papua New Guinea Defense Force has been
sullied recently by reports of weapons thefts, assaults and
robberies, complaints of poor conditions, insufficient food and
unsteady leadership.
	   The force has also been wracked by internal division over the
former government's hiring of British-based mercenary company
Sandline International to end a nine-year secessionist war on
Bougainville island.
	   Singirok was sacked as Defense Force commander by former prime
minister Sir Julius Chan after leading an army revolt in March 1997
to evict the Sandline mercenaries hired by Chan's government.
	   Prime Minister Bill Skate reinstated Singirok on Oct. 14, saying
morale in the forces was critically low and that he had lost
confidence in then-commander Brigadier Leo Nuia.
	   Reinstatement came despite findings of a judicial inquiry into
the Sandline crisis that Singirok had acted illegally and had
accepted bribes from a military equipment supplier while commander.
	   Singirok told the parade he would show the Defense Force's
critics that it could be highly disciplined, committed and
motivated.
	   He promised to urge the Skate government to spend more money on
defense and said all men would receive three meals a day, better
uniforms, improved housing and more training.

Yeltsin returns to Kremlin, meets with top lawmaker
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin said Friday that Russia was starting
to ``crawl out'' of its economic crisis and he called for better
relations with lawmakers who have often quarreled with the
president.
	   Yeltsin, who has spent most of the past two weeks at a country
residence recovering from a respiratory infection, was in the
Kremlin on Friday for talks with Yegor Stroyev, the chairman of
parliament's upper house, the Federation Council.
	   ``The situation is difficult, but we are starting to crawl out a
bit,'' Yeltsin was quoted as saying by Russian news agencies.
	   The Russian economy is not experiencing the daily shocks that it
suffered when the crisis hit with full force in August, but the
economic prognosis is still grim.
	   Already high prices continue to rise, millions of Russians are
out of work and millions more get paid months late. Yeltsin has
made only occasional comments on the crisis and the new government
led by Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov has focused only on stop-gap
measures to stabilize the economy and has not produced a long-term
recovery plan.
	   Meanwhile, Yeltsin's latest illness has prompted his many
critics to again question his fitness to govern. Yeltsin, 67, has
suffered health problems for years, including heart bypass surgery
in 1996.
	   The president has fought constantly with the lower house of
parliament, the State Duma, where Communists make up the largest
faction.
	   The president has had far better relations with the upper house,
which usually supports Yeltsin. However, nearly half the Federation
Council supported a non-binding resolution last week that called on
the president to resign.
	   But Yeltsin said he was still on good terms with Stroyev.
	   ``I like working with him,'' Yeltsin told reporters before the
meeting with Stroyev. ``We work in a friendly way.''
	   ``There is always a need to meet with you,'' Yeltsin told
Stroyev.
	   Yeltsin insists that he will serve out the final two years of
his term and denies speculation that he has serious health
problems.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ At least 80 people were dead and
dozens missing Friday as Typhoon Babs pummeled the northern
Philippines with heavy winds and rain, submerging parts of Manila
and forcing many businesses to close for a second day.
	   At least 53 people were killed in landslides on Catanduanes
island, where the typhoon first hit land Thursday, Office of Civil
Defense director Renato Arevalo said. Nineteen others died in
landslides in nearby Camarines Sur province, he said.

	   Roads throughout the central and northern Philippines were
flooded or blocked by landslides. Many people were homeless after
strong winds tore the roofs or walls off their simple bamboo
houses.
	   Tens of thousands of people were also stranded as ports were
shut down and ships forbidden to sail.
	   In the hard-hit Bicol region, one of the Philippines' poorest
areas, more than a hundred thousand people were forced to flee
their homes, Red Cross officials said. About 10,000 jammed the town
of Matnog waiting for ferry service to nearby Samar island.
	   The storm also damaged telephone relay towers, cutting
communications to most of the region.

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ A task force of senior bankers,
businessmen and government finance officials will arm Australia
with strategies to make it a regional leader in tackling the
international financial crisis, Prime Minister John Howard said
Friday.
	   Howard has ordered the task force to give him a preliminary
report to take to the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum
meeting in Kuala Lumpur next month, where he has already said
Australia will press hard for continued trade liberalization and
more transparency and accountability in finance sectors in some
APEC countries.
	   ``We have called this task force together because of the
importance of what is happening on the world financial scene,''
Howard told task force members at their first meeting.
	   Howard told an international conference of banking supervisors
Thursday the world was confronting ``an unprecedented degree of
instability'' in international finance markets, the impact of which
on Asia had been ``colossal.''
	   ``We want Australia to be properly armed to make a contribution
to resolving some of the challenges,'' he told the meeting Friday.
	   The task force is chaired by Treasurer Peter Costello and
members include Reserve Bank of Australia governor Ian Macfarlane
and the country's most senior economic bureaucrat, Treasury
Secretary Ted Evans. Private-sector bankers and companies
executives and the secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs
and Trade are also members.
	   Howard said he wants ``substantive and imaginative suggestions
for Australia to pursue in appropriate international forums'' from
the group.
	   ``The international debate about the ways to return to higher
growth, improve standards of living, create jobs and prevent future
crises must be brought to practical conclusions as soon as
possible,'' he said.
	   He has asked the task force to report by the end of the year.

Soviet-made fighter jet crashes, pilots survive
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ A Soviet-made MiG-29 fighter jet has
crashed while on a training flight, but the two pilots, a French
and a Romanian, survived, an official of the Defense Ministry said
Friday.
	   The crash occurred Thursday shortly after the jet had taken off
from a military air base near the city of Constanta, 225 kilometers
(140 miles) east of Bucharest, during a Romanian-French joint
military exercise, Capt. Vasile Lazar said.
	   There were no casualties or damage on the ground and the pilots,
Marc Leclerc and Vasile Ganea, left the plane without any
difficulty, he said.
	   According to media reports, the apparent reason for the crash of
the twin-engine plane was a malfunctioning of the landing gear, but
Lazar said this was still not officially confirmed.
	   The accident was being investigated, he said.

France's star risks losing nation's top honors for bad behavior
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ One of France's best-known faces, actor Gerard
Depardieu, risks losing his coveted Legion of Honor award because
of drunken driving, the newspaper France-Soir reported Friday.
	   The daily quoted two top officials at the ``Grande
Chancellerie'' which oversees distribution of awards like the
Legion of Honor and Legion of Merit honoring French citizens.
	   ``We have just sent a letter informing Mr. Depardieu of the
procedure that has just been opened against him ....,'' the paper
quoted a top aide at the Grande Chancellerie, Francois Sourd, as
saying.
	   ``It is obvious he can present his explanations (for his
behavior) ...,'' Sourd said, meaning Depardieu can defend himself.
	   Depardieu was convicted July 23 of driving drunk on his
motorcycle last May. A court gave him a three-month suspended
sentence and a 10,000-franc (dlrs 1,600) fine. But the court also
suspended the actor's driver's license for 15 months.
	   He was more than five times over the legal limit at the time of
the crash.
	   The star of ``Cyrano de Bergerac,'' ``Green Card,'' and ``The
Return of Martin Guerre,'' suffered leg and facial injuries in the
accident.

Hitachi group to enter brokerage business in December
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Hitachi Ltd., Japan's largest electronics maker,
established a brokerage subsidiary on Friday, becoming the latest
non-finance company to try its hand in the country's liberalizing
securities industry.
	   Hitachi Credit Securities, capitalized at 1 billion yen (dlrs
8.5 million), will start operations on Dec. 1, said Hitachi
spokesman Kenichiro Mizoguchi.
	   Hitachi is the second of Japan's electronics giants to set up a
brokerage unit.
	   Sony Corp. announced earlier this year that it plans to enter
the brokerage industry, which is in the midst of sweeping
deregulation to allow new market entrants and greater competition.
	   Both companies chose December as a start-up date because new
regulations taking effect then will make it easier to set up
brokerages.
	   Mizoguchi said the aim of Hitachi's new securities company will
to raise funds for group companies by issuing securities backed by
assets such as property. Hitachi Credit Corp., a consumer finance
subsidiary, will provide the capital for the new brokerage.
	   The Hitachi group comprises about 1,200 companies, including
some 900 that file annual earnings reports as part of Hitachi's
consolidated report.

18 die in truck bound for South Africa

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Eighteen bodies were found in
the Botswanan bush near the South African border, and police
suspect they were migrants who suffocated in the back of a truck, a
newspaper reported Friday.
	   Eight of the dead were Zimbabwean, and the rest were not
immediately identified, The Star of Johannesburg said.
	   Two people who turned up at a nearby police station said they
found themselves among the bodies Tuesday night. They victims
apparently had fallen asleep in the truck and suffocated, police
told the newspaper.
	   The couple said they had left Bulawayo in Zimbabwe on Monday and
passed through Gaborone, Botswana, which is just outside the South
African border.
	   The bodies were found by an elderly couple walking through the
veld about 5 kilometers (3 miles) from Gaborone.
	   South Africa, with its relatively large economy, has become a
magnet for illegal immigrants since the fall of apartheid in 1994.
Most of the arrivals are from Mozambique, followed by Zimbabwe.
	   Officials estimate up to 4.1 million illegal immigrants are in
the country, which has a population of 40.6 million, at any one
time.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Honda Motor Co. has decided against any mergers
with other automakers because it wants to stay small and quick,
President Hiroyuki Yoshino said Friday.
	   Yoshino, who became president and chief executive officer of
Japan's No. 3 carmaker in June, said he was confident Honda will
ride out Asia's economic turmoil by tailoring products to various
nations' tastes, yet staying small enough to respond quickly to
changing trends.
	   ``These are difficult days for the Japanese auto industry but
over the years Honda has thrived on tough challenges,'' he told a
new conference for foreign reporters.
	   Yoshino also made clear that Honda has rejected joining mergers
like the one between America's Chrysler Corp. and Daimler-Benz of
Germany.
	   Some see size as an advantage to survival in the global auto
market. But Yoshino said working with other automakers can be
difficult and is sure to compromise Honda's ``business speed.''
	   ``We are choosing to go ourselves without merger,'' he said.
	   Yoshino acknowledged Honda's strength lies in its global
operations. Honda uses the same platform, or the basic structure on
which a car is built, but adapts the rest of the car on the popular
Accord sedan model, for instance, to meet European, Japanese and
American tastes.
	   Honda has also been able to compensate for lagging sales in Asia
by strong sales in the United States. For the three months from
March to June this year, Honda's profits rose 25.7 percent compared
to the same period last year to a record high 78.22 billion yen
(dlrs 659.6 million).
	   Earlier this year, Honda decided to return to the expensive
sport of Formula One racing. Honda withdrew from Formula One racing
in 1992. Yoshino said Honda may return as soon as next year and was
preparing to try out test models in about a month.
	   Yoshino said getting back to Formula One racing will help Honda
engineers become even more nimble in responding to problems.
	   Honda has been expanding its business in Europe. It plans to
build a second plant in England and the new European Accord went
into production at Honda's first plant there this summer.
	   ``The new Accord symbolizes our approach to global auto
marketing,'' Yoshino said. ``I feel our overall outlook is more
positive than negative.''

Australia's tail-enders frustrate Pakistan before ending inning at

	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Veteran Ian Healy and No. 10 batsman
Stuart MacGill frustrated Pakistan with a half-century partnership
before Australia's first innings folded at 280 at lunch on the
second day of the third and final cricket Test Friday.
	   Debutante leg-spinner Shahid Afridi finished with five wickets
for 52, claiming the wickets of Gavin Robertson (5) and last man
Glenn McGrath (6). He took three wickets on Thursday.
	   After resuming at the overnight total of 207 for six, Healy (47)
and MacGill added a precious 55 runs for the ninth wicket in 105
minutes.
	   MacGill, who scored his first run after nearly half an hour,
remained unbeaten on 23 in 128 minutes.
	   Pakistan took the second new ball after 112 overs. The score was
244 for eight when the new ball came into play.
	   Off-spinner Arshad Khan finally broke the partnership when Healy
was ruled out by South African umpire Dave Orchard after he was
caught behind. However, TV replays suggested that the ball might
have missed the outside edge of Healy's bat.
	   Earlier, Afridi claimed his fourth wicket of the innings when
overnight batsman Gavin Robertson was caught at silly point by a
diving Yousaf Youhanna in his second over of the day.
	   And when Wasim Akram knocked back Collin Miller's off stump, at
the total of 211, it looked like Australia's innings might fold
before 220.
	   However, Healy and MacGill dug in and pushed the total beyond
250-run mark.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Eighty people were confirmed dead
Friday as Typhoon Babs pummeled the northern Philippines with heavy
winds and rain, submerging parts of Manila and forcing many
businesses to close for a second day.
	   At least 53 people were killed in landslides on Catanduanes
island, where the typhoon first hit land Thursday, Office of Civil
Defense director Renato Arevalo said. Seventeen others died in
landslides in nearby Camarines Sur province, he said.
	   Roads throughout the central and northern Philippines were
flooded or blocked by landslides. Many people were homeless after
strong winds tore the roofs or walls off their simple bamboo
houses.
	   Tens of thousands of people were also stranded as ports were
shut down and ships forbidden to sail.
	   In the hard-hit Bicol region, one of the Philippines' poorest
areas, more than a hundred thousand people were forced to flee
their homes, Red Cross officials said. About 10,000 jammed the town
of Matnog waiting for ferry service to nearby Samar island.
	   The storm also damaged telephone relay towers, cutting
communications to most of the region.
	   The fatalities also included six drownings, two people hit by
falling trees, another man who died of shock, and a fireman pinned
to death after his van overturned on a slippery road, officials
said.
	   A group of gold miners believed trapped in a flooded mine tunnel
in the town of Aroroy on Masbate island were later able to escape
safely, police said.
	   In Manila, President Joseph Estrada ordered government offices
to close at noon Friday, with the exception of disaster relief
agencies. He also ordered a forced evacuation of slum dwellers
living near swollen rivers.
	   About 15,700 people were evacuated from low-lying areas in the
capital, officials said.
	   ``Despite the situation, some people still refuse to leave their
homes to guard their meager property,'' said Jesusa Villanueva,
principal of a school being used as an evacuation center.
	   Some people, cradling chickens and dogs, stood on the roofs of
their houses, a few possessions piled next to them. Others used
tire tubes to float toward safer ground.
	   Hundreds of people living along a seawall near the oceanside
U.S. Embassy were evacuated because of high waves. In suburban
Marikina, about 4,500 people living on the bank of the swollen
Marikina River were also moved to evacuation centers.
	   At least 12 domestic flights and one international flight were
canceled.
	   After skirting Manila, Babs veered north toward the area
devastated last week by Super Typhoon Zeb, which killed at least 74
people in the Philippines and 43 more in Taiwan and Japan.
	   In Nueva Ecija province, more than 50 people crowded onto the
roof of a house in the town of Gapan to escape Babs' floodwaters.
	   About 88,000 hectares (217,000 acres) of rice were destroyed in
the province, officials said.
	   Babs also pounded areas around the Mount Pinatubo volcano with
heavy rain, unleashing 1.5 meter (5 foot) -high avalanches of
volcanic material from the mountain's slopes. Most of the material
was carried safely away by swollen rivers.
	   At midday, the storm was centered over Lingayen Gulf in
Pangasinan province, 200 kilometers (125 miles) north of Manila,
weather officials said. It had sustained winds of 120 kph (75 mph),
with gusts up to 150 kph (94 mph), and was on its way out to the
South China Sea.

France's star risks losing nation's top honors for bad behavior
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with details, background &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ One of France's best-known faces, actor Gerard
Depardieu, risks losing his coveted Legion of Honor award because
of drunken driving, the newspaper France-Soir reported Friday.
	   The daily quoted two top officials at the ``Grande
Chancellerie'' which oversees distribution of awards like the
Legion of Honor and the National Order of Merit honoring French
citizens, as saying the procedure punishing Depardieu is underway.
	   ``We have just sent a letter informing Mr. Depardieu of the
procedure that has just been opened against him ....,'' the paper
quoted a top aide at the Grande Chancellerie, Francois Sourd, as
saying.
	   ``It is obvious he can present his explanations (for his
behavior) ...,'' Sourd said, meaning Depardieu can defend himself.
	   Depardieu was convicted July 23 of driving drunk on his
motorcycle last May. A court gave him a three-month suspended
sentence and a 10,000-franc (dlrs 1,600) fine, and suspended his
driver's license for 15 months.
	   He was more than five times over the legal limit at the time of
the crash.
	   According to the code of the Grande Chancellerie, members of the
Legion of Honor convicted by a court of committing a dishonorable
act can be disciplined -- either censured or suspended or excluded
from the elite group.
	   The star of ``Cyrano de Bergerac,'' ``Green Card,'' and ``The
Return of Martin Guerre,'' suffered leg and facial injuries in the
accident. Depardieu has recently been hailed for his latest
performance in the made-for-television movie ``The Count of Monte
Cristo.''
	   Depardieu was among a parade of celebrities that included model
Claudia Schiffer and actress Claudia Cardinale who went to Slovakia
to stump for the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia, the governing
party, headed by Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar, in September.
	   Sourd said that was not a consideration in moving to discipline
Depardieu.
	   ``He didn't go saying ... `Look I have the Legion of Honor.' It
was a private, perhaps questionable choice,'' Sourd said, ``but not
contrary to the notion of honor.''

U.N. human rights envoy says Cambodia not addressing concerns
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodian strongman Hun Sen's
government has failed to stem human rights abuses and a climate of
impunity still reigns in the country, a top U.N. human rights
official said Friday.
	   Thomas Hammarberg, the U.N. Secretary General's special
representative on human rights in Cambodia, warned that
international donors are getting fed up with the government's
inability to improve its poor human rights record.
	   ``We haven't seen any signs of improvements and the situation
has been serious for quite some time now,'' he said upon his
arrival at Phnom Penh's international airport.
	   Hammarberg said he will meet with King Norodom Sihanouk and
government officials to encourage them to make human rights issues
a prominent plank in the next government's policy.
	   ``There is the need for the government to create a clear plan
that shows they are doing something,'' he said.
	   Since July elections, negotiations between Hun Sen's ruling
party and the two-party opposition to form a government have
yielded little progress.
	   It is the U.N. human rights envoy's first visit to Cambodia
since Hun Sen ordered a violent police crackdown last month against
anti-government demonstrations in Phnom Penh.
	   At least four people were killed when police used clubs,
electric cattle prods and guns to break up the opposition-led
protests against Hun Sen's narrow victory in the election.
	   In the aftermath of the crackdown, U.N. human rights workers
discovered more than 20 bodies _ many bearing signs of torture _ in
shallow graves, roadside ditches and floating in rivers.
	   The U.N. said at the time that it was too early to link the
deaths to the political unrest, but human rights workers have
speculated that the timing of the discoveries was not a
coincidence.
	   Hammarberg said he remained concerned about the post-election
violence and called on the government to investigate the killings.
	   The U.N. envoy also said work will continue during his trip on a
proposed international tribunal to try senior Khmer Rouge leaders
for the genocide of more than 1 million Cambodians during the
brutal guerrilla group's 1975-79 rule of Cambodia.
	   ``From the side of the U.N., we are now moving on this issue,''
he said, adding that a trial of the Khmer Rouge could be a
significant step in breaking the cycle of impunity from punishment
for abuses in Cambodia.
	   A team of legal experts will arrive in Cambodia on Nov. 14 to
review evidence that has been gathered against the Khmer Rouge and
propose further measures to bring its leadership to trial.
	   Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot died in April of an apparent heart
failure, but the majority of the guerrilla leadership still live
along Cambodia's border with Thailand.

an 8-under 136 total on the 7,151-yard, par-72 Sodegaura Country
Club Sodegaura course.
	   Shigeki Maruyama shot a 67, with six birdies against one bogey,
to climb into second place along with American Brandt Jobe, Shingo
Katayama and Nobuhito Sato, who fired 69s for the second straight
day.
	   Jobe, seeking his fourth victory this season, stands second on
the Japan PGA money earning list with 81.77 million yen (dlrs
693,000).
	   Overnight leader Tsuneyuki ``Tommy'' Nakajima slumped to 23rd
place after shooting a 4-over-par 76 with two double bogeys and a
bogey.
	   A total of 67 players advanced to the final two rounds of the
72-hole tournament.
	   The winner will receive 21.6 million yen (dlrs 183,000) from a

	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Tokyo Stock Exchange's main index fell Friday
on profit-taking following a five-day rally, while the U.S. dollar
climbed against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 150.86 points,
or 1.06 percent, closing the week at 14,144.70. The decline in the
Nikkei came after the average had gained a total of 1,300.19 points
in the previous five trading days, including Thursday's 79.23-point
gain, or 0.56 percent.
	   In late afternoon, the dollar bought 119.14 yen, up 1.42 yen
from late Thursday in Tokyo and also above its rate of 117.87 yen
in late New York trading overnight.
	   The Nikkei index opened higher but later reversed course as
investors began selling to take advantage of a 1,300.19-point gain
in the index over the past five trading days.
	   ``The market ran out of steam,'' said Yasuo Ueki, a general
manager at Nikko Securities.
	   Profit-taking in shares of NTT Mobile Communications Network
Inc., better known as NTT DoCoMo, which made a strong market debut
on Thursday, served as a signal for selling of the broad market,
dealers said.
	   DoCoMo, which closed up 19 percent from its initial public
offering price on Thursday, fell 200,000 yen (dlrs 1,694) to 4.45
million yen (dlrs 37,711) Friday.
	   Dealers said the government's decision Friday to temporarily
nationalize the troubled Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan had long
been expected and had no significant impact on the market. On
Friday, the Tokyo Stock Exchange suspended trading in shares of the
LTCB for the whole day.
	   Shares of LTCB, once a pillar of Japan's postwar financial
system that recently has struggled under a massive load of bad
loans, had fallen to a record low of 2 yen (dlrs 0.17) earlier this
week.
	   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi later approved the takeover and
announced the first nationalization of a Japanese bank since World
War II.
	   Earlier this month, Japan's Parliament passed the legislation
allowing government takeovers of foundering banks to fix them or
shut them down. It authorized the government to pump up to 60
trillion yen (dlrs 515 billion) in taxpayer funds into the ailing
banking system.
	   Trading was fairly active, with about 460 million shares
changing hands on the first section, down from Thursday's 863
million. Retreating issues outnumbered advancers 702 to 481, with
130 unchanged.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section closed down 6.14 points, or 0.57 percent, to
1,068.15. The TOPIX had risen 2.46 points, or 0.23 percent, the
previous day.
	   In currency trading, renewed concern about Japan's economy
promoted yen-selling, pushing the dollar higher above 119.00 yen
for the first time since Oct. 15, traders said.
	   Also supporting the dollar was Friday's announcement by credit
ratings agency Moody's Investors Service that it has placed the
credit ratings of four major Japanese banks on review for possible
downgrade, dealers said.
	   Moody's cited heightened concerns over the banks' exposure to
economic problems in Japan and other Asian nations, higher
borrowing costs overseas and declines in the value of their
stockholdings for the move.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 0.850 percent from Thursday's finish of 0.830 percent,
driving down its price to 108.46 yen from 108.66 yen.

Scientists: Pocket-sized device analyses DNA in minutes, cheaply
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By A.J. DICKERSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DETROIT (AP) _ Researchers are developing a device that is
powerful enough to analyze DNA samples in minutes and small enough
to fit in your pocket.
	   The ``lab on a chip'' is expected to be the key component in
simple, cheap, portable instruments that replace current DNA
technology, said geneticist David Burke, one of a team of
University of Michigan scientists working on the pocket-sized DNA
laboratory.
	   DNA testing can be crucial in police investigations or for
doctors trying to pinpoint a disease. Traditional tests in
laboratories can take days, cost hundreds of dollars and require
trained technicians.
	   A faster and cheaper alternative might be useful to doctors
deciding which antibiotic is best for treating an infection, said
Burke, co-author of a study on the device published this month in
the journal Science.
	   The device might also be useful for medical researchers in Third
World nations, where labs aren't easily set up, said Dr. Robert
Sikorski, a former National Cancer Institute researcher who runs a
biomedical information company and is a contributing editor at
Science.
	   The nearly ``hands-free'' Michigan device includes a kind of
silicon chip, a system for mixing and heating samples and
separating molecules by size. The entire device is about the size
of a pinkie finger.
	   The pocket lab requires a liquid sample so tiny that a drop of
liquid the size of a comma would be about 10 times larger than
necessary. The result comes out on a computer attached to the
machine's other end.
	   Several companies are working on similar technology. DNA pocket
labs could conceivably be marketed for home use, as well as for
research and labs, in about 15 years.
	   ``If any of these DNA devices are mass produced, billions would
be made and the cost would be significantly less,'' said Mark
Burns, an electrical engineer on the pocket lab research team and a
co-author of the study.
	   For now, however, the bugs in the device need to be worked out,
such as the possibility of samples evaporating. ``It's not ready
for prime time, or even day time yet,'' Burke said Thursday.
	   DNA, the material of genes, consists of long chain-like
sequences of nucleic acid. The links in the chain are called bases
and they are made up of pairs of chemical molecules. The pattern of
these pairings determines the function of the gene.
	   The University of Michigan's device was developed in five years
of research funded by National Institutes of Health grants.
	   The university combined technology from engineering, molecular
biology and the computer industry into one package and proved that
it can work, said Sikorski.

U.S. government says it will keep an ambassador in Cambodia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The U.S. State Department has
rejected an appeal from the Cambodian opposition for the U.S.
ambassador's post on Phnom Penh to be left vacant.
	   In a statement obtained from the U.S. Embassy on Friday, the
State Department confirmed that the current ambassador, Kenneth
Quinn, will be replaced at the end of his mission.
	   ``We are distressed that the leaders of Cambodia's opposition
have taken the stand that they did,'' the State Department said.
``It is important to have a U.S. ambassador in Cambodia in our
judgment.''
	   Opposition party leaders Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy
sent a letter last month to Jesse Helms, chairman of the U.S.
Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, urging Congress to leave the
post vacant to show displeasure with Cambodian leader Hun Sen.
	   The opposition charged in the letter that Hun Sen won a July
election by fraud and that he has maintained his power through
violence and corruption.
	   Most international observers of the election certified it as
sufficiently free and fair, but criticized election officials for
not doing more after the election to investigate the opposition's
allegations of fraud.
	   The State Department also maintained its support for the
candidacy of Kent Wiedemann, currently the U.S. charge d'affaires
in Myanmar, to replace Quinn.
	   The opposition expressed particular displeasure with Wiedemann's
nomination in the letter to Helms, saying they feared he ``may be
less than supportive of the cause of democracy in Cambodia.''
	   Wiedemann's nomination was allowed to expire Wednesday as the
Senate finished this year's session. However, the State Department
is expected to re-nominate him when a new Senate meets again next
year.
	   ``If confirmed by the Senate he will do a superb job as
ambassador in Phnom Penh in pursuing our objectives in support of
democracy and human rights,'' the State Department said of
Wiedemann.

Chairman of NEC Corp. resigns, but denies any role in scandal

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ An unfolding Japanese defense scandal claimed its
highest-profile victim yet Friday when the chairman of NEC Corp.
announced his resignation.
	   Chairman Tadahiro Sekimoto told reporters he knew nothing about
the scandal, but said he was stepping down because of the trouble
it had caused NEC customers, employees and shareholders.
	   ``I apologize deeply, and I decided to step down to draw the
line about ethical and social responsibilities. I hope NEC and its
group will now make a fresh start,'' he said.
	   However, Sekimoto said he remain a voting member of the
company's Board of Directors.
	   Prosecutors have recently raided two NEC subsidiaries and the
Tokyo headquarters of the Japanese Defense Agency in a widening
scandal involving corruption in military purchases.
	   A total of 13 officials from NEC Corp. and the two subsidiaries
_ Nico Electronics Co. and Toyo Communication Equipment Co. _ have
been arrested on suspicion of overcharging the Japanese military in
procurement contracts. Three of them are current NEC executives.
	   Prosecutors say the amount that the NEC affiliates overcharged
totals nearly 1.7 billion yen (dlrs 14.3 million).
	   Two Defense Agency officials also have been arrested, suspected
of winking at the inflated billings in exchange for the three
companies' providing jobs to retiring agency employees.
	   NEC president Hisashi Kaneko said on Friday that he would remain
with NEC, despite earlier reports that he too would resign.
	   ``I decided to remain as the president because it is also an
important management task to take measures to prevent the
recurrence of a similar incident, regain public trust and conduct
company reform,'' he said.
	   Neither Sekimoto nor Kaneko would explain those measures.
	   NEC, Japan's largest PC maker, is the world's second-largest
computer chip maker behind Intel Corp. It is owns more than 50
percent of California-based Packard Bell NEC, which controls about
10 percent of the world's computer market.
	   Also Friday, NEC announced that its sales in the first half of
fiscal 1998 ending September 30 fell to 2.113 trillion yen (dlrs
17.8 billion) from 2.372 trillion yen (dlrs 20 billion) during the
same period last year. The company also posted a net loss of 19.73
billion yen (dlrs 166 milion), down from 35.76 billion yen (dlrs
301 million) of profit the year earlier period.
	   Sekimoto's resignation came three days before prosecutors are
expected to press formal charges against a former NEC executive who
was arrested earlier this month, Hiroaki Shimayama.
	   A key figure in the scandal is Kenichi Ueno, former deputy
director of Defense Agency procurement, who was arrested Sept. 3 on
suspicion of conspiring with the affiliates.
	   Kaneko said NEC is conducting an internal investigation about
the defense scandal, but he said this may not be sufficient and
expressed willingness to cooperate with prosecutors.

Georgian police detain five more suspected mutineers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Police on Friday detained five more suspected
organizers of a recent one-day revolt against President Eduard
Shevardnadze, but the leader remained at large, an official said.
	   Akakiy Eliava and some of his supporters have been in hiding
since Tuesday, when the revolt failed and mutinous soldiers
returned to their garrison in western Georgia. Eliava and some of
his men have been charged with treason.
	   Police captured five suspected mutineers earlier in the week,
and five more were detained Friday, Georgia's State Security
Minister Dzhemal Gakhokidze said on national television.
	   Gakhokidze said Eliava was believed to be hiding in the forests
in western Georgia, not far from where the revolt took place.
	   Eliava is a military commander who supported the late Georgian
president, Zviad Gamsakhurdia.
	   Gamsakhurdia, Georgia's leader when it gained independence in
1991, was ousted in early 1992 and fought a short war in a bid to
return to power. He died under mysterious circumstances in 1994.
His followers remain bitterly opposed to Shevardnadze.

	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Indonesia's economy is likely to take
two to three years before returning to strong growth following the
Asian financial crisis, the regional head of the International
Finance Corporation said Friday.
	   ``I think we've seen the bottom of the turmoil, as long as there
is no more political instability,'' Rashad Kaldany, director of the
South and Southeast Asia Department of the IFC, told reporters in
Sri Lanka to open an office.
	   ``I noticed on a recent visit to Indonesia that the general mood
is better than a few months ago. People are more optimistic,''
Kaldany said.
	   The IFC, the World Bank's private sector development arm, has
about dlrs 1 billion invested in Indonesia's private sector.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Honda Motor Co. has decided against any mergers
with other automakers because it wants to stay small and quick,
President Hiroyuki Yoshino said Friday.
	   Yoshino, who became president and chief executive officer of
Japan's No. 3 carmaker in June, said he was confident Honda will
ride out Asia's economic turmoil by tailoring products to various
nations' tastes, yet staying small enough to respond quickly to
changing trends.
	   ``These are difficult days for the Japanese auto industry but
over the years Honda has thrived on tough challenges,'' he told a
new conference for foreign reporters.
	   Yoshino also made clear that Honda has rejected joining mergers
like the one between America's Chrysler Corp. and Daimler-Benz of
Germany.
	   Some see size as an advantage to survival in the global auto
market. But Yoshino es the same platform, or the basic structure on
which a car is built, but adapts the rest of the car on the popular
Accord sedan model, for instance, to meet European, Japanese and
American tastes.
	   Honda has also been able to compensate for lagging sales in Asia
by strong sales in the United States. For the three months from
March to June this year, Honda's profits rose 25.7 percent compared
to the same period last year to a record high 78.22 billion yen
(dlrs 659.6 million).

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Hitachi Ltd., Japan's largest electronics maker,
established a brokerage subsidiary on Friday, becoming the latest
non-finance company to try its hand in the country's liberalizing
securities industry.
	   Hitachi Credit Securities, capitalized at 1 billion yen (dlrs
8.5 million), will start operations on Dec. 1, said Hitachi
spokesman Kenichiro Mizoguchi.
	   Hitachi is the second of Japan's electronics giants to set up a
brokerage unit.
	   Sony Corp. announced earlier this year that it plans to enter
the brokerage industry, which is in the midst of sweeping
deregulation to allow new market entrants and greater competition.
	   Both companies chose December as a startup date because new
regulations taking effect then will make it easier to set up
brokerages.
	   Mizoguchi said the aim of Hitachi's new securities company will
to raise funds for group companies by issuing securities backed by
assets such as property. Hitachi Credit Corp., a consumer finance
subsidiary, will provide the capital for the new brokerage.
	   The Hitachi group comprises about 1,200 companies, including
some 900 that file annual earnings reports as part of Hitachi's
consolidated report.

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ A task force of senior bankers,
businessmen and government finance officials will arm Australia
with strategies to make it a regional leader in tackling the
international financial crisis, Prime Minister John Howard told the
group's first meeting Friday.
	   Howard has ordered the task force to give him a preliminary
report to take to the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum
meeting in Kuala Lumpur next month, where he has already said
Australia will press hard for continued trade liberalization and
more transparency and accountability in finance sectors in some

	   ``We have called this task force together because of the
importance of what is happening on the world financial scene,''
Howard told task force members. Howard told an international
conference of banking supervisors Thursday the world was
confronting an unprecedented degree of instability'' in
international finance markets, the impact of which on Asia had been
``colossal.''
	   ``We want Australia to be properly armed to make a contribution
to resolving some of the challenges,'' he told the meeting.
	   The task force is chaired by Treasurer Peter Costello and
members include Reserve Bank of Australia governor Ian Macfarlane
and the country's most senior economic bureaucrat, Treasury
Secretary Ted Evans. Private-sector bankers and companies
executives and the secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs

	   TOKYO (AP) _ An unfolding Japanese defense scandal claimed its
highest-profile victim yet Friday when the chairman of NEC Corp.
announced his resignation.
	   Chairman Tadahiro Sekimoto told reporters he knew nothing about
the scandal, but said he was stepping down because of the trouble
it had caused NEC customers, employees and shareholders.
	   ``I apologize deeply, and I decided to step down to draw the
line about ethical and social responsibilities. I hope NEC and its
group will now make a fresh start,'' he said.
	   However, Sekimoto said he remain a voting member of the
company's Board of Directors.
	   Prosecutors have recently raided two NEC subsidiaries and the
Tokyo headquarters of the Japanese Defense Agency in a widening
scandal involving corruption in military purchases.
	   A total of 13 officials from NEC Corp. and the two subsidiaries
_ Nico Electronics Co. and Toyo Communication Equipment Co. _ have
been arrested on suspicion of overcharging the Japanese military in
procurement contracts. Three of them are current NEC executives.
	   Prosecutors say the amount that the NEC affiliates overcharged
totals nearly 1.7 billion yen (dlrs 14.3 million).
	   Two Defense Agency officials also have been arrested, suspected
of winking at the inflated billings in exchange for the three
companies' providing jobs to retiring agency employees.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Credit ratings agency Moody's Investors Service
said Friday that it has placed the creditworthiness of four major
Japanese lenders, including top-ranked Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi
Ltd., under review for possible downgrades.
	   Moody's said the move was prompted by heightened concerns over
the banks' exposure to economic problems in Japan and other Asian
nations, higher borrowing costs overseas and declines in the value
of their stockholdings.
	   It also cited worries about potential undisclosed losses at
subsidiaries and affiliates of the banks.
	   In addition to the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, the action targeted
the Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd., Sanwa Bank Ltd. and Sumitomo
Bank Ltd.
	   The ratings agency welcomed the recent passage of legislation in
Japan which will allow banks to shore up their capital reserves
with public funds.
	   But it said many questions remain unanswered about how the
banking industry stabilization measures will be implemented.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ North Korea on Friday guaranteed
safety for South Koreans who go on sightseeing tours of a scenic
mountain in the reclusive communist country.
	   Hyundai, South Korea's largest conglomerate, plans to send by
ship up to 2,000 tourists a week for four-day tours of Diamond
Mountain on the North's east coast beginning in November.
	   But mutual distrust runs so deep between the two countries that
South Korea has demanded a North Korean guarantee on the safe
return of its citizens.
	   North Korea will ``guarantee safety and safe return of all
tourists and personnel concerned ... and will take necessary
measures in case there happens an accident or disaster,'' said an
unidentified spokesman of the North's Ministry of Public Security.
	   The statement was carried by the North's official Korean Central
News Agency.
	   The tourism project would mark the first major joint venture
between the two hostile Korean states and give Pyongyang a new
source of badly needed foreign currency.

	   	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
will seek stimulus measures to eke out a 1-percent growth rate when
he unveils the 1999 budget Friday.
	   The optimistic goal comes in the wake of 4.8 percent contraction
in the economy this year, provoking the first formal recession in
more than a decade.
	   Meanwhile, thousands of antigovernment demonstrators were
preparing to march on Parliament just as Mahathir presents the
budget to lawmakers. They intend to protest the jailing of ousted
finance minister Anwar Ibrahim on charges of corruption and illegal
homosexual activities.
	   Analysts expect the budget to include a large deficit as it
follows Mahathir's economic philosophy of spending more to boost
corporate health, spur recovery and create employment.
	   Earlier this month, Deputy Finance Minister Wong See Wah said
further expansionary policies would be introduced in the budget.
Government spending has already been raised by nearly 20 percent in
1998, after Malaysia turned its back on International Monetary
Fund-style, tight-money, low-spending policies.
	   Malaysia imposed capital controls last month, which curbed flows
of speculative funds, and effectively pegged the country's currency
at 3.80 ringgit to the dollar.
	   Mahathir hopes these measures, which allow the government to
boost spending without undermining the stability of the currency,
would make Malaysia the first country in Southeast Asia to recover
from the Asian economic crisis.

Palestinian representative in France wants European role in talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The Palestinian representative in France expressed
regret on Friday that Europeans were absent from Mideast
negotiations because their concept of peace is ``less police''
oriented.
	   ``The Europeans have been the silent partners of
peace-building,'' said Leila Shahid in an interview on Europe 1
radio. And they should ``take their place'' in the peace process.
	   Among European nations, France in particular has been keenly
interested in a role for Europe in the Middle East peace process.
	   In May, France and Egypt launched an initiative to save the
peace process, which had been blocked until negotiations were
seriously restarted nine days ago at Wye Plantation, under the
direction of President Clinton.
	   ``The news (from Wye) is good,'' Shahid said. But the 1997
Hebron accord ``stipulates exactly what the Wye Plantation accord
stipulates today'' on Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank.
	   When she spoke, negotiators in Wye were reported nearing an
accord.
	   Shahid said that Europeans have ``less of a police approach,
less of a CIA-style intelligence approach to peace.''

Chinese dissident sentenced to seven years, mother says

 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with comment from mother, rights

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A veteran Chinese dissident held for five months
without access to his family or a lawyer has been tried and
sentenced in secret to seven years in prison, his mother said
Friday.
	   Chen Zengxiang disappeared into police custody on May 23. His
family has since received only one notice from authorities, in
July, when he was formally arrested. The order did not list a
charge because police said the case concerned state secrets.
	   Chen's mother, Liu Shuyong, got word this week from another
member of eastern Shandong province's dissident community that her
son had been sentenced in secret. Liu called the Qingdao city
Intermediate People's Court on Wednesday and an official told her
Chen was given seven years in prison.
	   But the official did not tell her why or when Chen was sentenced
or where he is being held.
	   ``There's nothing I can do. I'm sick to death about this,'' the
mother said.
	   Chen is one of only a few dissidents known to have been tried in
secret in recent years. His case comes amid slow moves by China's
spotty, corrupt legal system to move toward international
standards. Early this month, China signed the International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, a U.N. human rights treaty.
	   Chen, now 44, began his democracy campaigning 20 years ago. As a
young worker in a paper factory, he edited an underground magazine
in the 1978-79 Democracy Wall movement.
	   Although Chen has continued to be politically active, his mother
said she did not know what he had done to anger authorities.
	   A U.S.-based opposition group, the Chinese Democracy and Justice
Party, said police questioned Chen about his membership in the
organization, which claims to have an underground network of
members in China.
	   In a statement, it suggested that Chen was sentenced to deter
any other would-be party members. Because the party operates
underground, Chinese authorities ``can only use scare tactics'' to
hinder its development, the party claimed.
	   A Hong Kong-based rights group said Chen was put on trial for
compiling a list of prisoners in Shandong jails arrested in the
nationwide crackdown that followed the army's assault on democracy
demonstrators in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 1989.
	   The Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement
noted that another dissident, Li Hai, was arrested and given a
closed trial in 1996 for violating the vague state secrets law. Li
too had been working on a list of political prisoners. He is
serving a nine-year sentence.

Russia urged to withdraw troops from Moldova
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANATOL GOLEA &QC;

<TEXT>
	   KISHINEV, Moldova (AP) _ The presidents of Moldova, Ukraine and
Romania have urged Russia to withdraw its troops from a breakaway
region in Moldova, an official statement said Friday.
	   ``We express our concern ... and plead for a peaceful and
definitive solution'' to the problems in the Trans-Dniester region,
said a document signed by the three presidents, who were holding a
summit meeting.
	   Presidents Petru Lucinschi of Moldova, Leonid Kuchma of Ukraine
and Emil Constantinescu of Romania said an agreement Thursday on
trilateral cooperation that expressed their concern about the
conflicts in the region.
	   The document did not recognize the self-proclaimed independence
of Trans-Dniester, saying it is a region ``inside the territory of
an independent, unitary and sovereign Moldova.''
	   Trans-Dniester, a sliver of land in eastern Moldova with a
population of 700,000 mainly ethnic Slavs, declared independence in
1990 fearing that Moldova, dominated by ethnic Romanians, would
seek to reunite with neighboring Romania.
	   A five-month war between Moldova and the separatists in 1992
claimed about 700 lives. Fighting ceased after Russia sent in 5,000
troops. Relations between the government and the separatists remain
tense.
	   The three presidents expressed their support for a mission from
the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe as ``an
instrument to prevent conflicts and solve the crisis.''
	   Lucinschi, Kuchma and Constantinescu signed also an agreement on
trilateral cooperation against the organized crime and agreed to
coordinate efforts against the illegal transport of weapons and
radioactive materials.

U.N. chief says U.S. debt threatens peace-keeping

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan said
Friday that Washington's failure to pay its dues to the United
Nations was jeopardizing the organization's peace-keeping
operations around the world.
	   The United Nations estimates Washington owes it dlrs 1.3 billion
in arrears, two-thirds of the total unpaid dues.
	   ``In some situations, governments who have in the past taken
part in peace-keeping operations refused to participate unless we
pay them what we owe for the past operations,'' Annan said. ``We
can not reimburse them unless members pay their dues.''
	   The U.N. chief made the appeal in a news conference shortly
before he received the dlrs 200,000 Seoul Peace Prize, a biennial
award set up in 1990 to commemorate the 1988 Seoul Olympics.
	   Annan was chosen as the recipient of this year's Seoul Peace
Prize for his contribution to world peace through international
diplomatic and humanitarian endeavors.
	   Past recipients include International Olympic Committee
President Juan Antonio Samaranch, former U.S. Secretary of State
George Shultz and the international relief organization, Doctors
Without Borders.
	   Annan said he will donate the prize money to a U.N. trust fund
for preventing armed conflicts around the world.
	   On his first trip to Seoul since assuming office, Annan met with
President Kim Dae-jung, Foreign Minister Hong Soon-young and other
South Korean leaders earlier Friday to discuss bringing peace to
the divided Korean Peninsula.
	   Annan, who arrived from Japan following a conference on African
Development in Tokyo, leaves for New York Saturday after receiving
an honorary doctoral degree from Seoul's Kyung Hee University.
	   On Wednesday, the Republican-dominated U.S. Congress approved a
budget bill that authorized a dlrs 197 million payment to the
United Nations, the minimum amount it needs to preserve its vote in
the 185-member General Assembly.
	   But Congress refused to release further payments until the
United Nations makes sweeping reforms that include streamlining the
organization. The United Nations contends those reforms have
largely been implemented.

Mob kills civilian who aided military in northern Indonesian
</HEADLINE>
province

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Police are investigating the mob
killing earlier this week of a civilian who helped the military
during a campaign against rebels in a northern province.
	   Hundreds of villagers beat a man to death on Monday in Aceh
province on Sumatra island, where the army has been accused of
widespread atrocities in the late 1980s and 1990s. Mass graves of
alleged victims of the military have been dug up.
	   Separatist rebel violence subsided years ago and the military
withdrew some troops from Aceh in a conciliatory gesture following
the resignation in May of authoritarian President Suharto.
	   But authorities worry that attacks like the Monday killing could
escalate as local residents, emboldened by a reduced security
presence, take revenge against those labeled collaborators.
	   It was not clear how the victim, 45-year-old Rusli Basyah,
helped the military. But hundreds of people aided the armed forces,
some of them acting as informants and helping to distribute
supplies.
	   Aceh's police chief, Col. Mohammad Rodja, urged people not to
settle scores and said that no arrests had been made in Basyah's
death.
	   ``There were so many people. We are still collecting information
and investigating who masterminded the killing,'' Rodja said
Friday. He did not confirm a report by the official Antara news
agency that a second man was killed.
	   At least 760 rebels, soldiers and civilians were killed during
military campaigns against rebels over the last decade in Aceh,
1,750 kilometers (1,100 miles) northwest of Jakarta.

Gooch unconcerned by Lillee blast
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PERTH, Australia (AP) _ England cricket manager Graham Gooch
shrugged off an opening blast from former Australian great Dennis
Lillee after arriving for the Ashes tour Friday.
	   Lillee, writing for the West Australian newspaper, criticized
England's decision not to include spinner Phil Tufnell and paceman
Andy Caddick in the 17-man party.
	   Lillee, a former world record holder, claimed England had ``shot
themselves in the foot'' and ``blundered badly.''
	   Gooch, fronting the first news conference of the tour Friday
afternoon following his team's early morning arrival after its
28-hour flight, predictably played a straight bat to Lillee's
comments.
	   ``We think that the guys that have been selected are the right
guys for the trip,'' said Gooch. ``We want to create a very
tight-knit team spirit and the guys that have been left behind are
unlucky.''
	   Lillee said England, ``have taken two giant steps backwards
before they even wander down to the practice nets to launch their
Ashes tour of Australia.''
	   Gooch said Lillee's comments would have no bearing on the
five-test series.
	   ``It's what happens when you walk over the white line that
counts,'' said Gooch.
	   Meanwhile Gooch said he would put the squad through two hard
training sessions a day in the leadup to the first test starting in
Brisbane on Nov. 20.
	   He said the players would have to work much harder than
Australia to continue the improvement started in a recent 2-1
series victory at home against South Africa.
	   ``The work starts now and if we want to win the Ashes we have
got to work harder than them at our cricket,'' Gooch said. ``We
know we can beat any side in the world but we have got to play at
our best to do that.
	   ``We have got four weeks to go until the first test and we have
got to build up and peak at the right time.''

Iranians vote in key assembly election amid fears of low turnout
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Khatami, Khamenei quotes; color; Polls scheduled
to close at 1430 GMT; first official results expected Saturday &QL;

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iranians voted Friday in nationwide
elections for a key assembly that is expected to be dominated by
hard-line clergymen who favor unhindered powers for the country's
supreme leader.
	   Turnout was low in the early hours after voting began at 8 a.m.
(0430 GMT) for the 86-seat Assembly of Experts, whose job is to
oversee the work of the supreme leader.
	   In practice the supreme leader has the final say in all matters,
and hard-line clergymen want to keep it that way. But moderate
clerics led by President Mohammad Khatami are calling for a more
accountable supreme leader in a political tug-of-war that has
gripped Iran since Khatami's election last year.
	   ``I am not very familiar with the candidates but I hope things
in the country will get better,'' said Mitra Qaemaqami, a housewife
clad in a brightly colored head scarf. She was among the 30 people
waiting to vote at a mosque in Fereshteh neighborhood.
	   Her husband, Farhad, chipped in: ``We want to have a say in our
destiny. I will vote for somebody who will have some kind of
influence over the (supreme) leader.''
	   But Khatami's camp appears to have lost this battle even before
the polls: a conservative supervisory council that vetted a list of
396 prospective candidates approved 161 contestants, only about 30
of them moderates.
	   Khatami, who was among the early voters, pointed that out to
reporters after casting his ballot in the Husseinieh Jamaarana
meeting hall attached to a mosque in northern Tehran.
	   ``Definitely, there could have been more qualified people than
were allowed, but nonetheless we still have a chance to choose our
favored candidates,'' said Khatami, who drove to the polling booth
dressed in the clergy's black robe and turban.
	   He shook hands and chatted with election officials before
sitting in front of a white ballot box to pick a 16-man panel for
the Tehran district from a list of 32 candidates.
	   The lack of competition has led to fears of a low turnout from a
disappointed public. Even hard-line newspapers estimated that only
about 39 percent of the 38 million eligible voters will show up.
	   ``I am not interested. I don't care. They will select whoever
they want. And my vote wouldn't make any difference,'' said a
smartly dressed woman, who identified herself only as Sima.
	   The voter apathy would be in sharp contrast to the 1997
presidential election when 20 million people voted for Khatami.
	   It would likely be seen as a rebuff of the hard-line policies of
supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the successor of the late
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini who led the 1979 Islamic Revolution to
install the rule of Shiite clergy in Iran.
	   ``The people should rush to the polling stations as soon as
possible,'' Khamenei said after casting his vote. His comments were
broadcast simultaneously on the state-controlled Iranian radio and
television.
	   Khatami's popular efforts to ease the social, political and
media restrictions imposed by the Islamic Revolution are opposed
bitterly by hard-liners who are loathe to give up their control
over Iran's key institutions such as the judiciary and security
agencies.
	   Voting in the 33,312 polling stations in the country's 28
provinces is scheduled to close at 6 p.m. (1430 GMT). First
official results are not expected until Saturday.

Groups say President Estrada should do more for human rights at
</HEADLINE>
home
 &UR; By OLIVER TEVES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine President Joseph Estrada's
calls for better treatment for jailed Malaysian opposition leader
Anwar Ibrahim have received rave reviews at home.
	   But Filipino human rights advocates say Estrada should do more
in the Philippines to practice what he preaches overseas.
	   Many Filipinos were surprised to hear Estrada, a former
supporter of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos, publicly urge
Malaysia to protect the human rights of Anwar, whom he considers a
friend.
	   Anwar, Malaysia's former deputy prime minister, was arrested
Sept. 20 after he began encouraging opposition to Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad. He has claimed in court appearances that he was
beaten in jail.
	   Estrada, a town mayor during Marcos' administration, did not
participate in the ``people's power'' revolt which forced Marcos
from office in 1986 and has rarely criticized the former strongman.
	   ``If President Estrada really meant what he said ... human
rights must then engage the president's priority at home,'' says
Teodoro Benigno, a political commentator who served as spokesman
for former President Corazon Aquino.
	   ``He will have to face history in the eye and further admit the
Marcoses and their cronies did this country wrong,'' Benigno said.
	   This week, members of the government's Human Rights Commission
were disappointed when Estrada failed to attend a ceremony at the
presidential palace marking the start of celebrations of the 50th
anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
	   ``I receive so many invitations for speaking engagements, I
cannot attend all of them,'' Estrada said Friday when asked about
his absence at the human rights meeting and other events.
	   ``If I see that I should give more priority and time for the
welfare of the people, I will forget about all these speaking
engagements no matter what others say,'' he said.
	   Estrada's record on human rights is mixed.
	   He scolded organizers of a conference on East Timor in Manila in
1994, saying they should be good neighbors and not interfere in
Indonesia's internal affairs.
	   Before taking his oath as president on June 30, Estrada agreed
to allow Marcos' burial at a heroes' cemetery. The plan was
strongly opposed by opponents of Marcos' rule and Estrada backed
down.
	   Since then, however, Estrada has said he favors giving more than
30 percent of the dlrs 540 million from Marcos' Swiss bank accounts
as compensation to 9,539 Filipinos who won a class action suit
against Marcos' estate for human rights abuses.
	   For years, the Philippine military has been the country's
biggest violator of human rights, according to the government's
Human Rights Commission.
	   A Catholic Church-backed human rights group, Task Force
Detainees of the Philippines, also has urged Estrada to order the
release of more than 100 people it says are political prisoners
from previous administrations.
	   The group said some of the prisoners have been forced to endure
worse treatment than Anwar.
	   Estrada's spokesman, Jerry Barican, said the administration is
determined to punish all human rights violations by soldiers and
other government officials.

Police fire into the air to forestall renewed Nigerian clashes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARRI, Nigeria (AP) _ Gunshots rang out through this southern
Nigerian town early Friday as soldiers and anti-riot police fired
guns into the air to keep feuding ethnic groups apart.
	   There were no immediate reports of clashes Friday, but a police
official said at least six people were killed the day before and
five houses were burned after renewed fighting erupted between
ethnic Ijaws and Itshekiris.
	   Most of the violence occurred near the town's port and its main
market.
	   On Friday, some 200 soldiers and anti-riot police set themselves
up between the two groups' neighborhoods, firing guns into the air
in a show of force to stop the fighting from beginning again.
	   The enmity between the two ethnic groups _ which sparks regular
clashes _ is rooted in a fight over control of oil-producing areas
and anger after a local government office was moved from an Ijaw
neighborhood to an Itshekiri part of town.
	   Their fights have become regular occurrences in this town, some
300 kilometers (180 miles) southeast of Lagos.
	   ``Warri has been changed by these people,'' said Efe Temienor, a
71-year-old security guard. ``Every day we wake up and the guns are
sounding.''
	   Ijaw youth have also repeatedly attacked Western oil
installations in the Niger River delta region in recent weeks,
demanding better roads, schools and political representation.
	   Warre is about 30 kilometers (20 miles) from the town of Jesse,
where at least 700 people were killed over the weekend when a
fireball tore through hundreds of people scavenging gasoline
spilling from a pipeline.
	   There was not believed to be any connection between the fireball
and the ethnic clash.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Echoing Western claims, Kosovo's
main ethnic Albanian leader said Friday that Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic has not fulfilled NATO's demands to remove his
troops from the province and that little progress has been made to
defuse the crisis.
	   Four days before NATO's latest deadline for compliance, Ibrahim
Rugova told reporters ``the Serbian forces have not yet withdrawn
from Kosovo'' despite Yugoslav claims to the contrary.
	   ``We cannot say any progress was made and NATO should maintain
its `activation order' and keep pressing the Belgrade government,''
Rugova said.
	   Yugoslavia has repeatedly insisted it has withdrawn all its
special troops sent after Feb. 28 to suppress an ethnic Albanian
revolt in Kosovo. The pro-government daily Vecernje Novosti quoted
unidentified police sources Thursday as saying that the only troops
still in Kosovo were those that had been there before the crackdown
began.
	   U.S. and other Western diplomats dispute this, warning that
continuing violence threatens the Serbian province's peace process
and raises the threat of NATO airstrikes.
	   ``We are not satisfied with the level of compliance,'' U.S.
envoy Christopher Hill told reporters Thursday. In Washington,
Defense Department spokesman Kenneth Bacon said all of the
paramilitary police are not out and roadblocks remain that ``we
don't believe are proper.''
	   The troop withdrawal is a key condition of the U.S.-brokered
agreement to achieve lasting peace in Kosovo, an overwhelmingly
Albanian area of the Yugoslav republic of Serbia.
	   There were further signs that tension remains high in the
province, despite the agreement reached Oct. 12 between Milosevic
and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke.
	   Laura Boldrini of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said
ethnic Albanians who returned two weeks ago to the village of
Poklek fled again this week because of intimidation by Serb police.
	   ``It's a never-ending story,'' Boldrini said.
	   International observers in the field said they heard increased
tank and artillery fire in some areas, after three days of relative
calm.
	   NATO has given Milosevic until Tuesday to comply with U.N.
demands or risk airstrikes. The demands include removing all
special troops sent to Kosovo during the crackdown and allowing
tens of thousands of ethnic Albanian refugees to return safely to
their homes.
	   American diplomat William Walker arrived in the Yugoslav capital
Belgrade late Thursday to oversee the establishment of a
2,000-member mission to make sure Milosevic honors the agreement.
	   Walker will head the mission under the direction of the
Vienna-based Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
	   State-controlled media said Yugoslavia's foreign minister,
Zivadin Jovanovic, assured Walker the government will stick by the
deal. Walker was headed later Friday to the Kosovo capital Pristina
to meet Rugova.
	   Milosevic also agreed to talks with ethnic Albanians on the
future of the province, which is part of Yugoslavia's largest
republic, Serbia. About 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million people are
Albanian, and most want independence or self-rule.
	   The rebel Kosovo Liberation Army has insisted it will not
abandon its goal of independence. The United States and the
Europeans reject independence but support some form of autonomy for
Kosovo.
	   Despite the tension, international officials report some
progress toward normalcy. Convoys of relief supplies, for example,
have traveled unhindered in recent weeks.
	   Two U.N. convoys totaling 16 trucks carried baby food, flour,
biscuits, mattresses and other supplies to Pec and Djakovica in
western Kosovo on Thursday.
	   At U.N. headquarters in New York, the U.N. Security Council is
working on a resolution endorsing the Kosovo peace deal. Russia
raised objections Thursday that the language might authorize
military action.
	   The draft paragraphs troubling Russia would give NATO the right
``to take steps'' to ensure full implementation of the deal and to
ensure the verification team's safety. Diplomats and U.N. officials
said the council was aiming for a vote on Friday.

	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ A surprise strike Friday by ground
personnel at Marseille-Provence airport forced cancellation of all
Air France domestic flights, officials said.
	   The cancellations include the Marseille-Paris shuttle. Long-haul
Air France flights were delayed, along with flights by other
companies.
	   According to Air France-Europe unions, strikers were protesting
work conditions and worker strength.
	   In the northern city of Lille, a strike by public transport
workers protesting attacks against personnel moved into its third
day, blocking all buses and tramways.
	   The number of strikes due to attacks on public transport workers
has been on the rise in France.
	   On Friday, bus drivers in the Bayonne-Biarritz region at the tip
of southwest France went on a 24-hour strike to protest an attack
Thursday night on a colleague.

Iraq accuses U.S. of holding up contracts for oil spare parts
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq is yet to receive ``a single spare
part'' for its ailing oil industry even though the U.N. allocated
dlrs 300 million for the purchases four months ago, the oil
ministry said in a statement published Friday.
	   A ministry spokesman accused the United States of blocking
approval at the United Nations for many contracts that Iraq signed
with international companies to purchase the spare parts.
	   The statement, issued Thursday, was published in government
newspapers, al-Iraq and al-Thawra.
	   The United States is a member of the U.N. sanctions committee,
which must approve every deal that Iraq signs for importing goods.
The system is aimed at preventing Iraq from buying material that
can be used to make weapons of mass destruction.
	   ``Iraq has not received a single spare part till now because of
the hampering of the American representative in the 661 (sanctions)
committee,'' said the statement.
	   The committee itself makes no ``efforts to speed up the
approvals for the contracts related to the oil industry,'' it said.
	   The accusation echoes similar Iraqi complaints in the past that
the United States and Britain deliberately hold up contracts for
most items, a charge the two countries deny.
	   Iraq was banned from selling oil freely under U.N. sanctions
imposed after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. But acknowledging the
hardships caused by the loss of revenue, the United Nations allowed
Iraq to sell limited quantities of oil to buy food, medicines and
other humanitarian goods since December 1996.
	   In July, the U.N. also agreed to let Iraq use dlrs 300 million
of its oil revenue to buy spare parts for its oil industry that has
fallen into disrepair.
	   The ministry statement said that until Oct. 19 Iraq had
submitted 197 contracts to the sanctions committee out of the 450
contracts signed with companies for supplying spare parts.
	   ``Only 55 contracts were approved while the American
representative put on hold 61 contracts under baseless reasons with
the intention of delaying the arrival of the spare parts,'' said
the statement.
	   Iraq will continue to remain under sanctions until the United
Nations is satisfied that it has dismantled its weapons of mass
destruction.

Malaysian budget to seek 1 percent growth next year
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to UPDATE throughout with details from budget, no
demonstrators making it to Parliament; ADDS byline &QL; 
 &UR; By BETH DUFF-BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
announced the 1999 budget Friday with stimulus measures he hoped
would eke out a 1 percent growth rate to bring the country out of
recession next year.
	   The optimistic goal comes in the wake of an estimated 4.8
percent contraction in the economy this year, provoking the first
formal recession in more than a decade.
	   The Southeast Asian country expects a budget deficit of 6
percent next year. Officials said they were confident the deficit
could be financed through domestic sources.
	   Mahathir reiterated his attack against foreign currency
speculators and Western financial experts, blaming their greed and
policies for much of the Asian economic crisis.
	   ``The interests of developing countries like Malaysia are not
important to them,'' he told members of Parliament. ``As such, we
cannot depend on their assistance _ our destiny is in our own
hands.''
	   Mahathir, also first finance minister following his sacking of
Anwar Ibrahim last month, announced a number of tax measures
designed to revive the flagging economy by helping some sectors and
penalizing others.
	   International trading companies, for example, would be given a
70 percent tax exemption in 1999. Income from domestic tour
packages involving at least 1,200 tourists annually would be exempt
from income tax.
	   Electronic goods companies will see an end to excise duties on
certain products. But levies on cigarettes, alcohol and gambling
will go up.
	   Mahathir noted the budget would formalize stimulus measures
implemented in the National Economic Recovery Plan announced in
August.
	   ``This plan aims at freeing Malaysia from the grip of the Asian
financial crisis and to place Malaysia's economy on a stronger
footing,'' he said.
	   The Finance Ministry said prospects for 1999 depend on the speed
of fiscal stimulus and looser monetary policy.
	   This includes 12 billion ringgit (dlrs 3.2 billion) in two
stimulus packages announced in August, as well as the introduction
of two new agencies to takeover the management of bad debts and
help recapitalize the banking sector.
	   Meanwhile, thousands of anti-government demonstrators were
prevented from marching on Parliament as Mahathir presented the
budget to lawmakers. They were protesting the jailing of Anwar, who
faces charges of corruption and illegal homosexual activities.
	   Mahathir was unhappy with Anwar's recent performance as finance
minister _ the ousted minister preferred higher interest rates and
tighter monetary policy _ but insists he did not sack him over
policy differences.
	   This year's budget follows Mahathir's philosophy of spending
more to boost corporate health, spur recovery and create
employment.
	   Government spending has been raised by nearly 20 percent in
1998, after Malaysia turned its back on International Monetary
Fund-style, tight-money, low-spending policies.
	   Next year's budget stands at 65.10 billion ringgit (dlrs 17.1
billion), with an overall deficit of 16.14 billion (dlrs 4.1
billion), which will be financed by government assets and
borrowing.

Russia urged to withdraw troops from Moldova

 &UR; EDs: ADDS three grafs on pension agreement. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   KISHINEV, Moldova (AP) _ The presidents of Moldova, Ukraine and
Romania have urged Russia to withdraw its troops from a breakaway
region in Moldova, an official statement said Friday.
	   ``We express our concern ... and plead for a peaceful and
definitive solution'' to the problems in the Trans-Dniester region,
said a document signed by the three presidents, who were holding a
summit meeting.
	   Presidents Petru Lucinschi of Moldova, Leonid Kuchma of Ukraine
and Emil Constantinescu of Romania said an agreement Thursday on
trilateral cooperation that expressed their concern about the
conflicts in the region.
	   The document did not recognize the self-proclaimed independence
of Trans-Dniester, saying it is a region ``inside the territory of
an independent, unitary and sovereign Moldova.''
	   Trans-Dniester, a sliver of land in eastern Moldova with a
population of 700,000 mainly ethnic Slavs, declared independence in
1990 fearing that Moldova, dominated by ethnic Romanians, would
seek to reunite with neighboring Romania.
	   A five-month war between Moldova and the separatists in 1992
claimed about 700 lives. Fighting ceased after Russia sent in 5,000
troops. Relations between the government and the separatists remain
tense.
	   The three presidents expressed their support for a mission from
the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe as ``an
instrument to prevent conflicts and solve the crisis.''
	   Lucinschi, Kuchma and Constantinescu signed also an agreement on
trilateral cooperation against the organized crime and agreed to
coordinate efforts against the illegal transport of weapons and
radioactive materials.
	   Also, Moldova and Ukraine signed an agreement that seeks to end
a lingering dispute over pension payments in the two countries.
	   The countries have agreed to pay the pensions of the thousands
of people who have moved from one country to the other.
	   During the Soviet era, thousands of Moldovans and Ukrainians
were moved from one republic to another for work projects. When the
Soviet Union collapsed, many people returned to their native lands,
but faced difficulties in collecting pensions.

	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index rose 159.17 points, or 1.6
percent, to 9,817.75. On Friday, the index had slipped 3.54 points.
	   Turnover amounted to 6.89 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
883 million), up from 5.69 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 729
million).
	   Brokers said share prices slumped in the morning session on
profit-taking following recent sharp gains. The key index has
gained 25 percent so far this month.
	   Prices rebounded late in the afternoon due to futures-related
buying, they said.

interest rates.

Lawmaker says North Korea may be producing plutonium
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAULINE JELINEK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A South Korean lawmaker said Friday
communist North Korea could be producing plutonium and could have
more secret underground nuclear facilities than already feared.
	   Without naming his source, Rep. Kim Deog-ryong of the
Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee said he had ``information''
that two underground facilities captured on U.S. spy satellite
photos may be nuclear plants.
	   He said in a Parliament session that one of them is believed to
already be producing plutonium and the other would be able to
produce enough for 10 nuclear bombs starting around 2004.
	   If true, the assertion paints a worse picture of suspected North
Korean nuclear activity than already made public.
	   Kim said he asked the government's Unification Ministry about
the issue earlier this week and was suspicious of its answer.
	   ``It was not sufficient or sincere, so I came to suspect that
the government is trying to hide the truth,'' Kim said in a
seven-page press release.
	   U.S. and South Korean officials said in August they had detected
a huge underground construction site on a mountainside 40
kilometers (25 miles) northeast of Yongbyon, the country's main
nuclear complex.
	   The United States has said it suspects the construction is
nuclear-related, though it has no evidence. North Korea has denied
it.
	   Kim, a lawmaker from the main opposition Grand National Party,
said there may actually be two underground facilities not far from
the Yongbyon complex.
	   It was activity at Yongbyon that prompted the United States to
negotiate a 1994 accord promising development of two light-water
reactors and fuel-oil shipments if North Korea would halt nuclear
weapons development.
	   At the time, North Korea was believed to have made enough
plutonium for one or two atomic bombs.
	   The Yongbyon complex, which houses a 500-megawatt laboratory
nuclear reactor, has been frozen under the 1994 accord.
	   Kim said Friday that one new facility is already operating and
the other is under construction and will be operational in four to
six years.
	   ``We estimate that the reactor will go on-line in 2002 or 2003,
enabling the production of enough plutonium to build one nuclear
weapon within six to 12 months,'' Kim said.
	   ``North Korea would be able to make sufficient plutonium to make
eight to 10 nuclear weapons every year after that.''
	   North Korea has said the underground construction is for
civilian use and not nuclear-related. It has offered to open the
facility to U.S. inspectors, but says Washington must pay
compensation if the facility is been proven to be for civilian use.

U.S. officials have informed Israel about missing Denver cult
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The United States has informed Israel that a
Colorado-based doomsday cult that may be planning mass suicide
could be en route to the Jewish state, a U.S. official said Friday.
	   The leader of the group, Monte Kim Miller, has said he will die
in Jerusalem in December 1999 and will reappear three days later.
	   Followers of Miller sold their belongings and left their homes
in the United States before Oct. 10, the day their leader predicted
Denver would be wiped out by an earthquake marking the beginning of
the apocalypse.
	   There have been recent indications that some cult members were
in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and planned to eventually reach
Jerusalem.
	   Larry Schwartz, spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv, said
U.S. officials have raised the issue with Israel's government.
	   ``Because there have been a number of reports in the media about
this organization, we have discussed this issue with our Israeli
counterparts through normal channels,'' Schwartz said.
	   ``I think it's safe to assume the Israeli authorities are aware
of this situation,'' Schwartz said.
	   ``We're following reports,'' said Akiva Tor, deputy spokesman
for Israel's Foreign Ministry. ``Of course, we'd act
appropriately.''
	   Israeli police spokeswoman Linda Menuhin refused comment when
asked about possible preparations to prevent cult members from
entering Israel. She said it was an intelligence matter.

Rose misses cut as rookie holds lead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ Englishman Justin Rose had a
disappointing introduction to Australia when he missed the cut in
the Aust dlrs 500,000 (U.S. dlrs 316,000) Ford South Australian
Open on Friday.
	   Rose, who turned professional earlier this year after finishing
equal fourth in the British Open, added a 76 to his opening round
77 for 153. The cut was at 150, 12 shots behind halfway leader
Nathan Green.
	   The Australian, playing his first tournament as a professional,
shot a second 69 on the par-72 Kooyonga Golf Club course for 138.
	   Green led Matthew King by a shot with German Open champion
Stephen Allan giving Australia the top three spots at 4-under.
	   ``Coming in I was just trying to make the cut, it's just a big
bonus to be where I am now,'' Green said. ``I'm very nervous, I'm a
little uncomfortable, I have never been near this sort of
situation, it's my first time as a pro.''
	   There were seven players at 141 including Robin Byrd of the
United States and New Zealander Simon Owen.
	   Frenchman Jean-Louis Guepy added a 71 to his first-round 71 to
be six off the pace.

Thousands defy police ban and hold reform rally

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Thousands of anti-government
demonstrators braved the threat of arrest Friday to gather at the
national mosque for a rally demanding political reforms.
	   Protesters waved their fists and shouted ``Reform!'', while
passing cars honked in rhythm with the opposition rally cry.
	   Hundreds hopped on motorcycles, their helmets over their white
caps donned for Friday afternoon prayers, and headed toward
Parliament, where Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad was unveiling the
1999 budget.
	   But they never made it. Dozens of riot police moved in and
dispersed the crowd with water cannon.
	   Police had warned those who joined the anti-government march
could face arrest under the Internal Security Act, which allows
indefinite detainment without trial.
	   The demonstrators are supporters of jailed dissident Anwar
Ibrahim, ousted as deputy prime minister and finance minister on
Sept. 2.
	   Police have declared illegal all demonstrations in support of
Anwar, who is awaiting trial on charges of graft and sexual
misconduct. So far, authorities have detained 262 people who have
attended anti-government rallies, releasing them on bail pending
trial.
	   City police chief Kamaruddin Ali said that no one had applied
for permit to hold Friday's demonstration, as required by law in
this Southeast Asian country.
	   ``We charged ... people on Wednesday for illegal assembly and
will not hesitate to do the same again,'' Kamaruddin was quoted as
saying in Friday editions of The Star.
	   On Wednesday, a local court ordered the trial of 127 people who
were arrested for participating in a demonstration that demanded
Mahathir's resignation.
	   Since Anwar's arrest last month, tens of thousands of Malaysians
have gathered regularly in the capital and other cities to demand
justice for the jailed politician.
	   Anwar, who showed up at his first court appearance bruised and
beaten, faces trial Nov. 2 on 10 counts of corruption and illegal
homosexual acts. He has condemned the charges as false and
politically motivated.
	   The political scandal and apparent police brutality against
Anwar have soured political relations with other nations. The
presidents of Indonesia and the Philippines have expressed sympathy
with the dissident.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton won't meet with Mahathir during the
APEC summit because of U.S. concerns over the handling of Anwar,
administration sources said Thursday.
	   The U.S. House International Affairs Committee released a letter
Thursday to Clinton from committee Chairman Benjamin Gilman and
Rep. Doug Bereuter urging the president to speak ``forcefully'
about human rights in Malaysia.
	   Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi called the
comments by the congressmen arrogant.
	   ``They should realize that they are the ones who are being
highly offensive towards Malaysia,'' he said.

Muslim faithful converge on capital, promise Islamic revolution
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KATHY GANNON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) - Thousands of Muslim faithful flocked
to the Pakistani capital on Friday in what organizers called the
start of an Islamic revolution to sweep from power a government
dogged by corruption scandals and a shattered economy.
	   ``This is the beginning,'' said Liaquat Baluch, a leader of
Jamaat-e-Islami, the right wing religious party organizing the
three-day rally that ends on Sunday.
	   ``The message is that we will go in to the streets, to the
villages, the countryside, the remote areas of the country and
awaken the people, '' he said and bring a new Islamic order to
Pakistan.
	   Jamaat's show of strength is an impressive one with hundreds of
brightly colored tents encasing the tree-lined boulevards of the
capital.
	   Green Jamaat-e-Islami flags emblazoned cars and buses and giant
banners urging the faithful to fight for their religion were strung
across the streets.
	   Throughout the day, scores of buses streamed into the capital
crammed with people, many of them hanging from the windows and
crowded onto the roof.
	   Hundreds of young boys with headbands with the inscription 'God
is Great' patrolled waving bamboo sticks to keep order among the
crowd.
	   As the call to prayer sounded men-- their heads wrapped in
turbans or checkered scarves -- knelt in prayer at Faisl Mosque, a
white marble mosque, whose four giant minarets dominate the skyline
of Islamabad.
	   Women climbed to the second floor where they laid mats on the
marble floor and prayed.
	   ``We need an Islamic revolution in Pakistan. . . that is the
only way,'' said Mohammed Uzari, stroking his wispy black beard.
``But it will be peaceful. The government will go.''
	   Behind him in the crowd some young men yelled: ``if the
government doesn't go peacefully we will force them to go.''
	   The last time Jamaat-e-Islami tried to hold its rally in the
capital, the government then led by Benazir Bhutto, resisted. She
deployed hundreds of police and ordered them to stop demonstrators
at the city limits. Three people were killed.
	   This time Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's government lent a
helping hand, deploying hundreds of traffic police and cooperating
with Jamaat-e-Islami organizers.
	   ``They should see how we cooperated and hold a peaceful rally,''
said Sheikh Rashid, a member of Sharif's Cabinet. ``We don't want
any trouble.''
	   Despite Sharif's attempts to pass a bill that would impose
Islamic law in Pakistan, Jamaat-e-Islami organizers say the prime
minister is not an ally.
	   ``They are not sincere,'' and because they are tarnished by
charges of corruption, ``they are not able to impose Shariat,''
said Baluch, referring to law based on the Koran.
	   Rashid said the government is aware of the increasingly powerful
religious lobby in Pakistan, and many people believe a desire to
tap into this is behind Sharif's drive to amend the constitution.
	   In a telephone interview, Rashid says the rise in the right wing
religious lobby to the collapsing economy, the fault, he says, of
international sanctions imposed after Pakistan replied to
neighboring India's nuclear tests with underground tests of its
own.
	   ``Economic sanctions have caused restrictions and people are
turning to religion . . . it doesn't have anything to do with
Islam, but it is a reaction to the poverty,'' said Rashid.

Euro: introduced not with a bang, but with two months changeover
</HEADLINE>
time &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Germany's Finance Ministry, banks and
businesses agreed Friday that Europe's future single currency, the
euro, will be brought into circulation slowly over a two month
period in 2000, rather than with a ``big bang'' as earlier planned.
	   Fifteen groups representing banks, the retail industry and
vending machine companies agreed with Germany's Finance Ministry
that the German mark will be eased out of circulation between Jan.
1-Feb. 28, 2002.
	   The decision affects only Germany, and it was not immediately
clear what impact it would have in the 10 other European nations
launching the single currency Jan. 1. As of that date, monetary
policy, including a unified interest rate, will no longer be set by
national central banks or by finance ministries, but by the
European Central Bank located in Frankfurt. The euro will function
as the official currency with a set exchange rate against the
national currencies being phased out.
	   The actual introduction of bills and coins is the last phase of
the union, officially set for New Year's Day 2002. The decision in
Germany allows businesses to continue accepting marks for two
months. The parties also included language encouraging flexibility
after Feb. 28, apparently to give businesses leeway to accommodate
customers struggling to make the transition.
	   Five national banking associations agreed that banks will German
mark notes and coins for over-the-counter transactions for the
first two months of 2002.
	   Likewise, shops will accept the national currency, although they
will only take coins up to the value of DM 20 (dlrs 12.5.)
	   Changing the technology for thousands of vending machines
selling subway tickets, sodas and a host of other items has been a
vexed question, and the meeting gave greater leeway.
	   Vending machines calibrated for marks may continue operation
until makers are able to finish the conversion.
	   Germany's Economic Ministry welcomed the agreement, saying it
will secure ``a successful entry'' to the euro.
	   ``Customers will get the necessary information and at the same
time complicated bureaucratic rules and costs will be avoided,''
the Economic Ministry said in a statement.

Iraq accuses U.S. of holding up contracts for oil spare parts
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq is yet to receive ``a single spare
part'' for its ailing oil industry even though the U.N. allocated
dlrs 300 million for the purchases four months ago, the oil
ministry said in a statement published Friday.
	   A ministry spokesman accused the United States of blocking
approval at the United Nations for many contracts that Iraq signed
with international companies to purchase the spare parts.
	   The statement, issued Thursday, was published in government
newspapers, al-Iraq and al-Thawra.
	   The United States is a member of the U.N. sanctions committee,
which must approve every deal that Iraq signs for importing goods.
The system is aimed at preventing Iraq from buying material that
can be used to make weapons of mass destruction.
	   ``Iraq has not received a single spare part till now because of
the hampering of the American representative in the 661 (sanctions)
committee,'' said the statement.
	   The committee itself makes no ``efforts to speed up the
approvals for the contracts related to the oil industry,'' it said.
	   The accusation echoes similar Iraqi complaints in the past that
the United States and Britain deliberately hold up contracts for
most items, a charge the two countries deny.
	   Iraq was banned from selling oil freely under U.N. sanctions
imposed after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. But acknowledging the
hardships caused by the loss of revenue, the United Nations allowed
Iraq to sell limited quantities of oil to buy food, medicines and
other humanitarian goods since December 1996.
	   In July, the U.N. also agreed to let Iraq use dlrs 300 million
of its oil revenue to buy spare parts for its oil industry that has
fallen into disrepair.
	   The ministry statement said that until Oct. 19 Iraq had
submitted 197 contracts to the sanctions committee out of the 450
contracts signed with companies for supplying spare parts.
	   ``Only 55 contracts were approved while the American
representative put on hold 61 contracts under baseless reasons with
the intention of delaying the arrival of the spare parts,'' said
the statement.
	   Iraq will continue to remain under sanctions until the United
Nations is satisfied that it has dismantled its weapons of mass
destruction.

period in 2002, rather than with a ``big bang'' as earlier planned.

Hattori takes lead in first round of Hisako Higuchi Classic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAIGOMURA, Japan (AP) _ Michiko Hattori fired a 4-under-par 68
to take the lead in the opening round of the Hisako Higuchi Kibun
Classic.
	   Hattori, who won the Japan LPGA Championship last month and has
two other tour victories this year, carded four birdies against no
bogeys on the 6,290-yard, par-72 Green Briar West Village course in
southwestern Japan.
	   One stroke behind was Taiwan's Huang Yu-chen, who sank three
birdies against no bogeys. Huang, 25, won her first career title in
June at the Dunlop Ladies Open.
	   In third place was Chihiro Furukawa, who shot a 2-under 70. Four
players _ Fuki Kido, Aki Nakano, Mikino Kubo and Yukiko Isiguro _
shared four place at 71.
	   A total of 108 players, including 16 foreigners, teed off in
cloudy weather.
	   The winner will receive 12.6 million yen (dlrs 106,000) from a
purse of 70 million yen (dlrs 588,000).

Rival gang kills crime boss, shows his head on a tray
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP)- The chief of a criminal gang in a small
town was blown up Thursday by a rival gang. His head was put on a
tray and toured around town, local media reported Friday.
	   Police sources confirmed the killing and identified the victim
as Artur Daja, 31, allegedly the head of one of the two biggest
criminal gangs in the town of Lushnja, 45 kilometers (28 miles)
south of Tirana.
	   Local media reported that Daja was dragged under a bridge
outside town and bombed to death. His head, on a tray, was taken to
all the families of the victims Daja had allegedly killed.
	   Since last year, when Albania exploded in chaos after the
collapse of pyramid schemes in which many Albanians lost their life
savings, the ``law of an eye for an eye'' rules in most of the
country.
	   Rival gangs in many towns demand money from businesmen for
protection and fight each other for spheres of influence.
	   Despite the efforts of the Socialist-led government to establish
order and the rule of law, crime remains high.
	   About a million guns remain in the hands of the people and are
often used to administer ``personal justice.''
	   In Lushnja, most people emptied the streets after the incident,
media said.
	   Interior Ministry spokesman Artan Bizhga said police had
identified the killers and were searching for them.

Salvadoran university officials criticize Nobel medicine prize
</HEADLINE>
selection &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) _ Officials from the University
of El Salvador have criticized the awarding of the Nobel Prize in
Medicine to three Americans, saying a Salvadoran made the
discoveries that led to the award.
	   Not giving the Nobel prize to Salvador Moncada ``puts in doubt
its credibility,'' Eduardo Espinoza, dean of the university's
medical faculty, said Thursday.
	   In Stockholm, Sweden, Agneta Sjoevall, a spokeswoman for the
Nobel Committee of the Karolinska Institute, declined comment on
the Moncada dispute, saying the committee as a matter of principle
does not comment on complaints about whom it chooses for the prize.
	   This is standard procedure for all the Nobel-awarding bodies.
	   The prize was awarded this month to Robert F. Furchgott, Louis
J. Ignarro and Dr. Ferid Murad for discovering that the body uses
nitric oxide gas to make blood vessels relax and widen _ a finding
that helped lead to the anti-impotency drug Viagra and could also
result in treatments for heart disease.
	   Salvadoran university officials said Moncada made the discovery
six months before the U.S. researchers did.
	   In a telephone interview from London, where he is a professor at
University College, Moncada said he was pleased that scientists in
his field were awarded the Nobel. He said Fuchgott ``deserved the
honor fully'' and praised the other two winners as ``very
significant researchers.''
	   He said the prize was not a top priority for him and that it was
more important to have made contributions to the nitric oxide
research and to be recognized by his peers.
	   ``Certainly a Nobel prize for a Latin American investigator is
important for Latin America. But I feel very relaxed in terms of my
own contribution, which has been fundamental,'' he said.
	   Dr. Jonathan Stamler of the Duke University Medical Center and
the Howard Hughes Medical Institute said Moncada and the three
prize winners all made major contributions to the field. Which ones
deserve the prize ``depends on the criteria being judged,'' he
said.

Taiwan to again send stand-in for Lee at APEC
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Again bowing to Chinese pressure, Taiwan
will send its chief economic planner to represent President Lee
Teng-hui at November's Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation forum
summit in Kuala Lumpur, the Foreign Ministry said Friday.
	   Lee decided to send Chiang Pin-kung to the informal leaders
summit on Nov. 17-18 after ``giving much thought'' to an invitation
from Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, the ministry said.
	   Presentation of an invitation to Lee by the host nation _ with
the understanding that it will be politely refused _ is an annual
formality that allows Taiwan to maintain a semblance of dignity and
the host to avoid controversy with China.
	   Beijing's threat to boycott APEC's annual meeting if Lee attends
has forced him to send a stand-in every year since the inaugural
summit in 1993.
	   China claims Taiwan as a breakaway province and argues that only
sovereign nations are allowed to send their heads of state.
	   APEC groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong,
Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua
New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and the
United States. Russia, Vietnam and Peru will join in November.

Yeltsin returns to Kremlin, meets with top lawmaker
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with lawmaker criticizing bill on Yeltsin's health,
Yeltsin commenting on Kosovo, other details. &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin said Friday that Russia was starting
to ``crawl out'' of its economic crisis and he called for better
relations with lawmakers who have often quarreled with the
president.
	   Yeltsin, who has spent most of the past two weeks at a country
residence recovering from a respiratory infection, was in the
Kremlin on Friday for talks with Yegor Stroyev, the chairman of
parliament's upper house, the Federation Council.
	   ``The situation is difficult, but we are starting to crawl out a
bit,'' Yeltsin was quoted as saying by Russian news agencies.
	   The Russian economy is not experiencing the daily shocks that it
suffered when the crisis hit with full force in August, but the
economic prognosis is still grim.
	   Already high prices continue to rise, millions of Russians are
out of work and millions more get paid months late. Yeltsin has
made only occasional comments on the crisis and the new government
led by Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov has focused only on stop-gap
measures to stabilize the economy and has not produced a long-term
recovery plan.
	   Yeltsin and Stroyev discussed payments of overdue wages, the
development of an anti-crisis program and cooperation between the
Cabinet, Central Bank and parliament, Yeltsin spokesman Dmitry
Yakushkin said.
	   Meanwhile, Yeltsin's latest illness has prompted his many
critics to again question his fitness to govern. Yeltsin, 67, has
suffered health problems for years, including heart bypass surgery
in 1996.
	   The president has fought constantly with the lower house of
parliament, the State Duma, where Communists make up the largest
faction.
	   The Duma plans to consider a bill that would require Yeltsin's
chief doctor to report to parliament on the state of the
president's health. Debates on the bill have been scheduled for
November, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Stroyev criticized the bill during the meeting with Yeltsin,
saying the interest in the president's health ``should not be
brought to the level of the absurd.''
	   The president has had far better relations with the upper house,
which usually supports Yeltsin. However, nearly half the Federation
Council supported a non-binding resolution last week that called on
the president to resign.
	   But Yeltsin said he was still on good terms with Stroyev.
	   ``I like working with him,'' Yeltsin told reporters before the
meeting with Stroyev. ``We work in a friendly way.''
	   Yeltsin insists that he will serve out the final two years of
his term and denies speculation that he has serious health
problems.
	   The president also touched upon the situation in Kosovo, saying
Friday that it remained ``difficult.'' He reiterated Russia's
intention to ``achieve a political settlement'' of the conflict in
the Yugoslavian province, Yakushkin said.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Echoing Western claims, Kosovo's
main ethnic Albanian leader said Friday that Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic has not fulfilled NATO's demands to remove his
troops from the province and that little progress has been made to
defuse the crisis.
	   Although fighting has all but ceased, tension remains high in
Kosovo, despite the agreement reached Oct. 12 between Milosevic and
U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke to avert NATO airstrikes.
	   The U.N. refugee agency said Friday that only a ``trickle'' of
refugees are returning to their homes because of fear and
intimidation by Serb police.
	   ``The impression our staff got on the ground is while some
people trickle back to their ruined homes, widespread destruction
of housing and fear of the continued Serb military and police
presence prevent signigicant return,'' U.N. spokesman Kris Janowski
said in Geneva, Switzerland.
	   In Kosovo's capital Pristina, ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim
Rugova told reporters that ``Serbian forces have not yet withdrawn
from Kosovo,'' despite Yugoslav claims to the contrary.
	   ``We cannot say any progress was made and NATO should maintain
its `activation order' and keep pressing the Belgrade government,''
Rugova said.
	   Yugoslavia has repeatedly insisted it has withdrawn all its
special troops sent after Feb. 28 to suppress an ethnic Albanian
revolt in Kosovo. The pro-government daily Vecernje Novosti quoted
unidentified police sources Thursday as saying that the only troops
still in Kosovo were those that had been there before the crackdown
began.
	   U.S. and other Western diplomats dispute this, however, warning
that continuing violence threatens the Serbian province's peace
process and raises the threat of NATO airstrikes. NATO has extended
the deadline until Tuesday for Milosevic to comply.
	   ``We are not satisfied with the level of compliance,'' U.S.
envoy Christopher Hill told reporters Thursday. In Washington,
Defense Department spokesman Kenneth Bacon said all of the
paramilitary police are not out and roadblocks remain that ``we
don't believe are proper.''
	   The troop withdrawal is a key condition of the U.S.-brokered
agreement to achieve lasting peace in Kosovo, an overwhelmingly
Albanian area of the Yugoslav republic of Serbia.
	   NATO has given Milosevic until Tuesday to comply with U.N.
demands or risk airstrikes. The demands include removing all
special troops sent to Kosovo during the crackdown and allowing
tens of thousands of ethnic Albanian refugees to return safely to
their homes.
	   ``The military and police presence is there,'' Janowski said.
``Even though people trickle back during the day, they hear shots
at night and they're off again.''
	   Laura Boldrini of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said
ethnic Albanians who returned two weeks ago to the village of
Poklek fled again this week because of intimidation by Serb police.
	   ``It's a never-ending story,'' Boldrini said.
	   International observers in the field said they heard increased
tank and artillery fire in some areas, after three days of relative
calm.
	   American diplomat William Walker arrived in the Yugoslav capital
Belgrade late Thursday to oversee the establishment of a
2,000-member mission to make sure Milosevic honors the agreement.
	   Walker will head the mission under the direction of the
Vienna-based Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
	   State-controlled media said Yugoslavia's foreign minister,
Zivadin Jovanovic, assured Walker the government will stick by the
deal. Walker was headed later Friday to the Kosovo capital Pristina
to meet Rugova.
	   Milosevic also agreed to talks with ethnic Albanians on the
future of the province, which is part of Yugoslavia's largest
republic, Serbia. About 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million people are
Albanian, and most want independence or self-rule.
	   The rebel Kosovo Liberation Army has insisted it will not
abandon its goal of independence. The United States and the
Europeans reject independence but support some form of autonomy for
Kosovo.
	   At U.N. headquarters in New York, the U.N. Security Council is
working on a resolution endorsing the Kosovo peace deal. Russia
raised objections Thursday that the language might authorize
military action.
	   Diplomats and U.N. officials said the council was aiming for a
vote on Friday.

Troops kill 69 Kurdish rebels in Turkey
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DIYARBAKIR, Turkey (AP) _ Turkish troops killed 69 Kurdish
rebels in eastern Turkey in clashes that also left 10 solders dead,
officials said Friday.
	   Fighting started Wednesday in the regions of Van, Siirt and
Sirnak, which border Iraq and Iran.
	   Kurdish rebels, fighting for autonomy in Turkey's southeast,
often wage cross-border operations from camps in Iraq, Iran and
Syria.
	   Turkish officials claim that Syria has agreed to shut down rebel
camps in Syria and in Syrian-controlled parts of Lebanon. The
agreement followed a Turkish-Syrian crisis that raised fears of a
regional conflict.
	   Some 37,000 people have been killed since the Kurdish insurgency
began in 1984.

German Red Cross to fly water treatment equipment to Sudan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany will fly water purification and
medical equipment this weekend to Sudan to help people suffering
from war, flood and famine.
	   The German Red Cross said they hoped to provide drinkable water
for 50,000 people in southern Sudan. Experts from Germany, Sweden,
Finland and Austria would work in the region for at least three
months.
	   Two-thirds of the program's 1.2 million marks (dlrs 750,000)
cost was covered by the federal government, the rest from
donations.

Murder of Saudi diplomat was not politically motivated, police say
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Investigators are almost certain the
murder of a senior Saudi diplomat who was found last week in his
apartment with his throat cut was not politically motivated, police
said Friday.
	   ``My belief is that if it was some sort of political crime, they
would have done it outside the embassy,'' Detective Sergeant Greg
Ranse said.
	   ``If it's a political crime, it's a very silent protest.''
	   Abdullah Al-Ghamdi, 54, first secretary at Saudi Arabia's
Embassy in Canberra, was found dead on the kitchen floor of his
apartment in Australia's capital on Oct. 13.
	   Police are appealing for help from the public to solve the case.
	   Ranse Friday said investigators want to speak to a woman whose
car broke down outside Al-Ghamdi's apartment some time in the days
before his death.
	   A tow truck driver has identified the dead diplomat as one of
three people seen with helping the woman whose car had broken down
near his apartment.

Ministry confirms fourth Dutch mad cow disease case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HEETEN, Netherlands (AP) _ Agriculture Ministry investigators on
Friday were tracing cattle related to the fourth Dutch animal
confirmed as being infected with mad cow disease.
	   The infected cow, called Trix-9, was found on a farm in this
eastern village earlier this month. The farm was immediately sealed
off and all its livestock, 85 cows and five goats, will be
destroyed following confirmation Thursday of mad cow disease in the
herd, the ministry said in a press release.
	   The discovery was the second this year of a cow infected with
bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in the Netherlands. Two
other cases were discovered in March and April 1997.
	   Research has linked consumption of beef from BSE-infected cattle
to the fatal Creutzfeld-Jakob brain disease in humans.

Woods lurking behind Waldorf's 63
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAKE BUENA VISTA, Florida (AP) _ Tiger Woods doesn't always
measure success by how many tournaments he wins, which explains his
outlook on 1998.
	   ``It's been a great year for me,'' Woods said Thursday after a
6-under-par 66 left him tied for second, 3 strokes behind Duffy
Waldorf at Disney's National Car Rental Classic.
	   ``I'm very pleased at my entire development over the entire
year, how much improvement,'' he said. ``I'd like to end it on a
good note.''
	   Assuming that means adding another victory or two, Woods is
certainly off to a good start.
	   His only lapse was a three-putt on his 15th hole, but he quickly
got back another birdie and joined Jesper Parnevik and Len Mattiace
at 66.
	   The Disney Classic typically produces low scores on the resort
courses. Wide fairways put the driver into the players' hands,
which is always a big advantage for Woods.
	   For Waldorf, the best club in his bag was his shortest _ and
latest.
	   Unhappy with his putting in recent weeks, Waldorf tried a Tear
Drop Zebra on Wednesday.
	   ``I was rolling it nice,'' he said.
	   After a two-putt birdie on the first hole of the Palm course,
Waldorf knocked in a 5-footeditions _ swirling, 20 mph winds that caused players
to second-guess club selection; dry, hard conditions that made it
tough to hold the greens and control the speed of downhill putts.
	   ``It was a fun day to play,'' Waldorf said. ``I don't know if
everyone else was having fun, but I thought it was.''
	   But then, not everyone is in Waldorf's shoes.
	   The final full-field tournament of the PGA Tour has a lot riding
on it for players trying to finish in the top 30 on the money list
to get into the lucrative Tour Championship next week, and
particularly those trying to get in the top 125 to keep their
exempt status for next year.
	   Waldorf is one of those players in the middle _ at No. 102 in
money, he is too low to make the top 30, too high to worry about
losing his card.
	   ``This week is great,'' he said. ``I'm going to Blizzard Beach
as soon as I leave here.''
	   He wasn't alone.
	   Of the top 12 players on the leader board after the first round,
only Canadian Glen Hnatiuk was in desperate need of a good week.
Hnatiuk is 172nd on the money list and will have to finish no worse
than fourth to keep his card.
	   ``There are a few guys right on the line of keeping their cards,
so they might not go on Space Mountain as many times as the other
ones do,'' Parnevik said.
	   John Huston, the 1992 champion, and 51-year-old Larry Nelson, a
two-time Disney winner, were at 67. Defending champion David Duval
bogeyed the last two holes for a 68, while PGA champion Vijay Singh
was in a large group at 69.
	   Mark O'Meara chopped out a 71 and Phil Mickelson, making his
first Disney appearance since his rookie season of 1992, was at 73.
	   Mattiace has been on the 125-bubble before. A tie for fifth at
The Players Championship earned him dlrs 146,000, and two other
top-10s this year has left him 68th on the money list, the best
he's ever been.
	   ``There's not a lot of pressure this week _ fortunately and
unfortunately,'' he said. ``I'd like to be 35th or 30th or even
better.''
	   Waldorf, Woods and Parnevik played the Palm course, which played
about a half-stroke easier than the Magnolia. After two days of a
pro-am format, the final two rounds will be played on Magnolia.

Ukraine's president signs decree to reduce barter deals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's President Leonid Kuchma signed a
decree that aims to sharply reduce the number of barter
transactions in the economy, officials said Friday.
	   Enterprises that cut the share of barter deals in their total
turnover by 1 percent would automatically have their tax bills cut
by 1 percent as well, Kuchma's economic aide Pavlo Haidutsky said.
	   The companies whose share of barter deals exceeds permitted
levels are to be fined 20 percent of the total value of products,
which they sold by barter above the allowed margin, Haidutsky said.
	   He said the decree, which would be implemented experimentally in
several selected industries in the first half of 1999, should give
businessmen incentives to reduce barter transactions that have
become widespread in the Ukrainian economy in recent years.
	   Over 40 percent of deals in the domestic economy are currently
conducted on a barter basis, and the figure has remained unchanged
since last year, despite the government's efforts, Haidutsky said.
	   ``There was hardly anything that did more harm to our major
industries than barter,'' he added.
	   Many enterprises in the former Soviet republic, whose economy is
suffering from high taxes and lack of structural reforms, have
resorted to barter to evade taxation.
	   In another step intended to make barter less attractive, Kuchma
recently imposed the value-added tax on barter operations, which
previously had been tax exempt, Haidutsky said.

82 dead as Typhoon Babs ravages northern Philippines
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with typhoon leaving the Philippines for southern
China, two more deaths, 102 people injured in Sorsogon

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Eighty-two people were confirmed dead
Friday as Typhoon Babs pummeled the northern Philippines with heavy
winds and rain, submerging parts of Manila and forcing many
businesses to shut down for a second day.
	   At least 53 people were killed in landslides on Catanduanes
island, where the typhoon first hit land Thursday, Office of Civil
Defense director Renato Arevalo said. Seventeen others died in
landslides in nearby Camarines Sur province, he said.
	   Arevalo said 102 people were injured by flying debris in
Sorsogon province, also part of the Philippines' impoverished Bicol
region, but no one was killed.
	   More than a hundred thousand people in Bicol were forced to flee
their homes, Red Cross officials said.
	   Roads throughout the central and northern Philippines were
flooded or blocked by landslides. Many people were homeless after
strong winds tore the roofs or walls off their simple bamboo
houses.
	   Tens of thousands of others were stranded as ports were shut and
ships forbidden to sail.
	   The storm also damaged telephone relay towers, cutting
communications to much of the region.
	   The fatalities included six drownings, two girls buried by
landslides in Iloilo province, two people hit by falling trees, a
man who died of shock, and a fireman pinned to death after his van
overturned on a slippery road, officials said.
	   In Manila, most government offices closed at noon because of the
storm, with the exception of relief agencies. President Joseph
Estrada ordered a forced evacuation of slum dwellers living near
swollen rivers.
	   About 15,700 people were evacuated from low-lying areas in the
capital, officials said.
	   ``Despite the situation, some people still refuse to leave their
homes to guard their meager property,'' said Jesusa Villanueva,
principal of a school being used as an evacuation center.
	   Some people, cradling chickens and dogs, stood on the roofs of
their flooded houses, a few possessions piled next to them. Others
used tire tubes to float toward safer ground.
	   Hundreds of people living along a seawall near the oceanside
U.S. Embassy were evacuated because of high waves. In suburban
Marikina, about 4,500 people living on the bank of the swollen
Marikina River were also moved to evacuation centers.
	   At least 12 domestic flights and one international flight were
canceled.
	   After skirting Manila, Babs veered north toward the area
devastated last week by Super Typhoon Zeb, which killed at least 74
people in the Philippines and 43 more in Taiwan and Japan.
	   In northern Nueva Ecija province, more than 50 people crowded
onto the roof of a house in the town of Gapan to escape Babs'
floodwaters. About 88,000 hectares (217,000 acres) of rice were
destroyed in the province, officials said.
	   Babs also pounded areas around the Mount Pinatubo volcano with
heavy rain, unleashing 1.5 meter (5 foot) -high avalanches of
volcanic material from the mountain's slopes. Most of the material
was carried safely away by swollen rivers.
	   At late afternoon, the storm was centered over the South China
Sea, 140 kilometers (88 miles) west-northwest of Dagupan City in
Pangasinan province, weather officials said. It had sustained winds
of 120 kph (75 mph), with gusts up to 150 kph (94 mph), and was
headed toward southern China.

Ukrainian miner killed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A young coal miner was killed by a falling
wagon at a mine in eastern Ukraine, bringing to 305 the number of
Ukrainian coal industry workers killed on the job so far this year,
officials said Friday.
	   The fatal accident involving the 20-year-old miner occurred at
the Kosmonantiv mine in the coal-rich Luhansk region, the Emergency
Situations Ministry reported.
	   Ukraine's troubled coal industry lacks the funds needed to
modernize mine equipment and improve safety conditions, and
work-related fatalities have been increasing steadily in recent
years.

Asian stock markets close generally mixed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets ended the week generally
mixed Friday, with share prices falling in Tokyo but rising in Hong
Kong.
	   Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 150.86
points, or 1.06 percent, closing the week at 14,144.70. The decline
in the Nikkei came after the average had gained a total of 1,300.19
points in the previous five trading days, including Thursday's
79.23-point gain, or 0.56 percent.
	   The Nikkei index opened higher but later reversed course as
investors began selling to take advantage of a 1,300.19-point gain
in the index over the past five trading days.
	   Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 119.14 yen, up 1.42 yen
from late Thursday in Tokyo and also above its rate of 117.87 yen
in late New York trading overnight.
	   Prices on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange closed sharply higher in
moderate trading.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index rose 159.17 points, or 1.6
percent, to 9,817.75. On Friday, the index had slipped 3.54 points.
	   Brokers said share prices slumped in the morning session on
profit-taking following recent sharp gains. The Hang Seng Index has
gained 25 percent so far this month.
	   Prices rebounded late in the afternoon due to futures-related
buying, they said.
	   Philippine stocks shares closed at a new two-month high,
shrugging off their early lethargy to breach the 1,500-point mark
with the help of a stronger peso.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index rose 29.36 points,
or 2.0 percent, to 1,523.98 after gaining 26.93 points Wednesday.
	   In currency trading, the dollar averaged 42.245 pesos, down from
Wednesday's average of 42.754 pesos. The peso hit a three-month
high of 41.900 pesos to the dollar, a level last reached on July
29.
	   Malaysian shares closed slightly lower in subdued trading as
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad announced the 1999 budget, with
stimulus measures he hoped would eke out a 1 percent growth rate
for the country next year.
	   The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange's benchmark Composite Index
slipped 1.84 points, or 0.43 percent, to 419.72.
	   The Thai market was closed for a holiday.
	   Elsewhere:
	   TAIPEI: Share prices closed higher, boosted by local interest
rates announced earlier this week by many banks. The market's key
Weighted Stock Price Index rose 67.67 points, or 0.96 percent, to
7,055.46.
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed slightly higher. The
NZSE-40 Capital Index rose 1.27 points to 1,843.45.
	   SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed slightly lower. The All
Ordinaries Index slipped 1.3 points to 2,543.9.
	   SEOUL: Share prices closed lower on profit-taking. The Korea
Composite Index fell 3.69 points, or 0.9 percent, to 378.83.
	   SINGAPORE: Share prices closed mostly lower. The Straits Times
Index fell 3.91 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,113.59.
	   JAKARTA: Share prices closed lower on profit-taking. The
Composite Index fell 3.380 points, or 1.0 percent, to 313.415.

Singapore Airlines net profit down 24 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore Airlines on Friday reported a 24
percent fall in net profit for the first half of the fiscal year
and said prospects are poor for a turnaround in the Asian travel
market.
	   Net profit for the six-month period ending Sept. 30 was 468.3
million Singapore dollars (dlrs 289.3 million), the airline said.
	   For the rest of the financial year, ``prospects for an early
recovery of the travel market in North and Southeast Asia are
poor,'' the airline said in a statement. ``Passenger yields will
continue to be under pressure as price competition among airlines
intensifies.''
	   Pretax profit plunged 28 percent, to 495.4 million Singapore
dollars (dlrs 306 million). Revenue also slid, by 3.6 percent to
3.77 billion Singapore dollars (dlrs 2.33 billion).
	   Singapore Airlines, one of the most expensive in Asia, has been
shopping for stakes in other regional carriers as the economic
crisis has forced sales.
	   Singapore's government-controlled national carrier had said
earlier that it may have to delay purchases of new aircraft and cut
back on employee costs, but that layoffs would be a last resort.

Two Ukrainians killed in rainstorms
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Two people were killed in eastern Ukraine
by strong winds and rainstorms that swept the area in the past two
days, the Emergency Situations Ministry said Friday.
	   The storm also damaged more than 800 houses and left 26
settlements without electricity in the regions of Luhansk,
Zaporizhia and Donetsk, the ministry said.
	   Many areas in the former Soviet republic have suffered in
previous months from various natural disasters, which left hundreds
of settlements flooded and thousands of buildings damaged.

Nebiolo says sprinter can now `rest in peace'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MONTE CARLO, Monaco (AP) _ Florence Griffith Joyner can ``rest
in peace'' now that an autopsy has indicated that her death was not
linked to drugs, world track and field czar Primo Nebiolo said
Friday.
	   The American sprinter died last month at the age of 38, fueling
speculation that she succumbed to the long-term effects of
performance-enhancing drugs.
	   But California coroner's invesigators said Thursday that
Griffith Joyner suffered an epileptic seizure that caused her to
die of asphyxiation.
	   Dr. Barbara Zaias, who took part in the post-mortem
investigation, said the seizure was probably triggered by a brain
lesion known as a cavernous angioma, a congenital abnormality she
might have been born with.
	   The abnormality has never been associated in medical research
with steroids or any other drugs, Fukumoto said.
	   ``This report ensures that Florence Griffith Joyner will be able
to rest in peace,'' Nebiolo, president of the International Amateur
Athletic Federation, said in a statement.
	   Nebiolo accused the media of tarnishing the sprinter's
reputation with unfounded reports that alleged drug use contributed
to her death.
	   ``These campaigns of misinformation serve not only to damage
individual athletes and our sport as a whole, but also have a
negative impact on the multi-million dollar anti-doping campaign to
which the IAAF has been committed for many years,'' he said.
	   Griffith Joyner won three Olympic gold medals at the 1988 Seoul
Games and set world records that still stand in the 100- and
200-meter dashes.

Hamas, Jewish settlers denounce emerging agreement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli and Palestinian hardliners on Friday
were quick to condemn the emerging land-for-security agreement
being negiotated at a Mideast summit at Wye Plantation.
	   Jewish settler leader Aharon Domb accused Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu of breaking promises to his right-wing
constituents.
	   ``The agreement that is being put together in Washington is a
betrayal of the ideas and people that asked Netanyahu to safeguard
the Land of Israel,'' Domb said in a statement.
	   Domb warned that Netanyahu would ``face the gravest
consequences'' when he returns, but did not elaborate.
	   Sheik Ahmed Yassin, the founder of the Islamic militant group
Hamas, dismissed the deal as a sellout. ``Our people are paying
more than they are getting from this agreement,'' Yassin told The
Associated Press at his Gaza City home.
	   As part of the agreement being worked out, the CIA would play a
stronger role in the Palestinian Authority's campaign against
Islamic militants, mainly Hamas which has carried out more than a
dozen suicide attacks in Israel.
	   Yassin said a new crackdown could perhaps restrict the
activities of the Hamas military wing temporarily, but would not
prevent attacks against Israelis.
	   ``It cannot erase Hamas,'' said Yassin. ``It is an illusion to
think the agreement will put an end ot our military work.''

Cambodia ruling party wants resumption of talks with opposition
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS remarks about safety guarantees in grafs 7-8 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The president of Cambodia's ruling
party called on Friday for opposition members of parliament to
return to the country and resume stalled negotiations to form a new
government.
	   Chea Sim, the president of strongman Hun Sen's Cambodian
People's Party, said in a faxed statement that a new round of talks
should be limited to the ruling party and the senior opposition
party led by Prince Norodom Ranariddh.
	   Ranariddh has insisted that any talks also include the junior
opposition party led by Sam Rainsy.
	   After Hun Sen narrowly won a July election, Ranariddh and Sam
Rainsy led a gradual exodus of opposition politicians to Bangkok
after a ceremonial convening of parliament in September.
	   The two-party opposition says Hun Sen has threatened to arrest
its leaders, making it impossible for them to negotiate inside
Cambodia.
	   Chea Sim dismissed the opposition's demand for talks outside the
country as ``political extortion'' and an attempt to overturn the
results of the election.
	   But in his bid to encourage opposition lawmakers to return, the
ruling party president said the government would guarantee
opposition lawmakers' safety upon their return.
	   ``The royal government will insure for these representatives
full protection for safety, devoid of threat and intimidation and
of any other kinds of provocation,'' Chea Sim said.
	   Despite general approval of the election as relatively free and
fair by most international observers, the opposition has claimed
the CPP achieved its victory through fraud and intimidation.
	   It insists its allegations must be thoroughly investigated
before agreeing to any coalition.
	   Chea Sim said that no matter what an investigation showed, the
ruling party would not accept a change in the results of the
election.
	   Chea Sim did hint that there was still room for compromise in a
new round of talks, saying, ``the Cambodian People's Party is
considering avenues to serve the interests of our nation.''
	   The ruling party president said he held hope negotiations could
lead to a summit of top party leaders chaired by King Norodom
Sihanouk in Phnom Penh.
	   But the aging monarch, noting that the three parties could not
even agree on a venue for the summit, has since declined to chair
the meeting.

India accounts for largest number of child workers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ASHOK SHARMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ A leading Indian activist on Friday
accused the United Nations of being soft on his government, saying
it has ``failed miserably'' in eliminating child labor in the
country.
	   Top U.N. representatives heard Swami Agnivesh, a speaker at the
launch of a U.N. paper on child labor in India, as saying that he
was disappointed with the U.N. document because it glossed over the
Indian government's problems.
	   ``The United Nations must speak out,'' said Agnivesh, who is
well-known in India for his campaigns against child labor.
	   L. Mishra, a top bureaucrat of the federal labor ministry, said
the fault lay with the state governments. Eight major states,
Mishra said, including Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya
Pradesh, are against adopting laws banning child labor in India
because officials there say it is not the best way to tackle the
problem.
	   Mishra said some states even have laws legalizing employment at
age 12; the International Labor Organization, a U.N. partner,
suggests a cutoff at age 15. In much of India, a person able to
work is often no longer considered a child, and small-town
societies rarely frown on poor children helping their families earn
money, even if it means they do not go to school.
	   Agnivesh won assurances from Brenda Gael McSweeney, the U.N.
Resident Coordinator, that his views will be duly considered by the
U.N. organizations.
	   ``The U.N. System In India: Position Paper On Child Labor,'' was
released jointly Friday by 16 U.N. offices in New Delhi. It said
India had the largest number of child workers in the world with
estimates by voluntary agencies ranging between 40-100 million.
	   Most work in agriculture, carpet industry, making fireworks,
stitching footballs, working in restaurants, child prostitution and
bonded labor in brick kilns.
	   The United Nations said providing education, particularly
elementary education, was the principal means of preventing and
eliminating child labor in India.
	   ``Nearly half of existing schools in the country, especially in
villages, don't have teachers and proper infrastructure,'' said
Shanta Sinha Anand, another activist working in southern India.
	   The U.N. document said the world body can support Indian
agencies and institutions in generating a sustainable and wide mass
movement against child labor and for universal elementary
education. But it said India must take the lead.

5-year-old girl dies after being bitten by dog
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ A 5-year-old girl was killed after
being bitten by a dog in an accident that snowballed when a police
car crashed while escorting her two sisters to the hospital.
	   The dog attack occurred Thursday afternoon when the girl was
playing with her two sisters at their neighborhood playground in
northern Amsterdam. The girl, whose name was not released, later
died in the hospital from her wounds.
	   Authorities have seized the dog, which was identified as an
Italian mastiff breed related to the pit bull terrier. The public
prosecutor will decide whether it will be destroyed, authorities
said Friday.
	   The tragedy took another twist when the police squad car
bringing the sisters to the hospital treating the bite victim was
hit from behind by another car along the way.
	   The police car smashed into a lamppost, and the two girls had to
be freed from the jammed car by firemen.
	   One of the girls and a police officer involved in the accident
remained hospitalized Friday.

One American, three South Koreans receive press freedom award

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ One American and three South Koreans
were cited Friday for their contribution to the enhancement of the
freedom of the press in South Korea.
	   The ``Ahn Jong-pil'' award was given to Don Oberdorfer, a former
Tokyo correspondent of The Washington Post; K.P. Hong of The
Associated Press; Shim Jae-hoon, a former reporter of The New York
Times and Chung Ho-sang, a former reporter of Japan's Asahi
Shimbun.
	   The organizers of the award said the four risked arrest as they
actively covered South Korean reporters' struggle against the
dictatorial government of President Park Chung-hee in the 1970s
which suppressed freedom of speech.
	   The award was established this year in memory of Ahn Jong-pil, a
former reporter of the Dong-A Ilbo, a major South Korean newspaper,
who died while serving a long prison sentence stemming from his
critical reporting about the Park government.
	   About 200 reporters from Dong-A and another major domestic
newspaper, Chosun Ilbo, were expelled by their management in the
mid-1970s for their struggle for press freedom.
	   The award was initiated by expelled Dong-A reporters who have
formed the ``committee for the protection of press freedom.''

Schumacher, Irvine confident about decisive Grand Prix in Japan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) - Michael Schumacher completed tests of his
Ferrari car for the last race of the season in Japan and said he
had ``the feeling'' he will return from Suzuka as world Formula One
champion.
	   ``It's difficult to explain why, but I have the feeling I'm
going to win, that I'll come back as world champion,'' the German
driver told the Turin sports daily Tuttosport.
	   Schumacher, a two-time world champion, goes into the Nov. 1 race
four points behind standings leader Mika Hakkinen, the Finnish
driver of McLaren-Mercedes.
	   Schumacher and Ferrari's No.2 driver, Eddie Irvine, completed
tests at the Fiorano track Thursday. The cars were being shipped to
Japan this weekend.
	   ``We did the best possible work to prepare the best possible
cars,'' Irvine said.
	   He said he hoped to finish second behind Schumacher, thus
depriving Hakkinen of precious points.
	   First place awards 10 points. Four points go to the runnerup.
	   Schumacher, who recently extended his contract with Ferrari in
one of the most expensive F-1 deals, would clinch his third world
title if he wins and Hakkinen does not place better than third.

Ronaldo returns, but only for 45 minutes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Ronaldo is back, just in time to try to rescue
Inter Milan's faltering bid for Champions Cup glory on Wednesday.
	   But the Brazilian star warned Tuesday he may only play half of
the game against Spartak Moscow, the only team among the 24 with a
perfect record from two games.
	   Tendinitis in both knees has meant that the world's top player
has played in only one of Inter's five Serie A games. But even 45
minutes of Ronaldo is welcome after Saturday's 5-3 loss to Lazio
and with tough games against Spartak and Juventus to come.
	   ``I have recovered, and I'm ready to play,'' the Brazilian
striker said on the eve of the game at San Siro. ``For sure I'll
not play the entire match because I must be cautious.''
	   Inter beat Spartak twice in last season's UEFA Cup semifinal,
with Ronaldo scoring twice in the second leg. The Italian club
needs the Brazilian now but doesn't want to rush him into 90
minutes of knee-jarring action.
	   Ronaldo's fitness, both psychological and physical, has been in
doubt since his pre-World Cup final breakdown and his poor
performance in the 3-0 loss to France in Paris.
	   After his long absence, he knows he's in the spotlight once
again.
	   ``I hope my return to action is going to end all controversies
and allegations,'' said Ronaldo, who was barely noticed in the 2-0
Group C loss to Real Madrid in September.
	   With Roberto Baggio still sidelined, he likely will team up with
rising Italian Nicola Ventola, French forward Youri Djorkaeff, with
Chilean veteran Ivan Zamorano as substitute.
	   Yegor Titov, who scored Spartak's matchwinning goal in the 2-1
victory at Real Madrid, misses the game through suspension.
	   An Inter loss at halfway in the group stage of the championship
will virtually mean elimination for the Italian giant.
	   Spartak would then have nine points to Inter's three and
defending champion Real Madrid, having already beaten Inter, is a
hot favorite to beat last place and pointless Sturm Graz of Austria
to take its total to six.
	   Only the group winner is guaranteed a place in the quarterfinal
and Spartak isn't the only surprise leader after two rounds of
matches.
	   Olympiakos heads Group A ahead of Ajax on goal difference and
the two teams meet in Athens Wednesday with the Dutch team forced
to field several stars who are carrying injuries.
	   Twins Frank and Ronald de Boer, defenders Ole Tobiasen and
Sunday Oliseh, right winger Tijani Babangida and Ajax's all-time
top scorer in European competition, Jari Litmanen, face the Greeks
despite fitness problems.
	   Ajax coach Morten Olsen blamed the injury list on his players'
international duties last week, although Georgian internationals
Shota Arveladze and Georgi Kinkladze were able to test the form of
the Olympiakos stars in the Euro 2000 game against Greece.
	   Turkish club Galatasaray tops Group B with Italy's Juventus and
Norway's Rosenborg two points behind. The Turks go to Rosenborg
while Juve, with Alessandro Del Piero returning to form with two
Euro 2000 goals for Italy last week, needs a win at Athletic de
Bilbao to mount a stronger challenge after two drawn games so far.
	   After a tie at Manchester United and victory over Denmark's
Brondby, Barcelona heads Group D with four points and goes to last
place Bayern Munich, which has one.
	   Although trailing, Bayern is racing ahead in the German
Bundesliga under new coach Ottmar Hitzfeld with seven wins and a
tie. Like Inter, however, the German club daren't lose on
Wednesday.
	   ``If we don't win against Barcelona, that means we can write off
the Champions League,'' said Brazilian striker Giovane Elber.
	   Manchester United goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel, whose late
blunder cost his team a victory in a 2-2 tie Munich, hopes to
return from a stomach muscle injury to face his former club,
Brondby, which is second with three points.
	   England internationals David Beckham and Nicky Butt are
suspended as United tries to improve on two ties.
	   Top of Group E, Arsenal hosts last place Dynamo Kiev at Wembley
with coach Arsene Wenger wary of the Kiev strike partnership of
Andrei Shevchenko and Sergei Rebrov, who scored 11 goals between
them in last season's Champions Cup.
	   ``The fact that they have started this season so badly surprises
me but I still consider them a serious threat to our chances to our
chances of reaching the last eight,'' said the Gunners manager,
whose team has four points.
	   Second place Panathinaikos is a point behind and goes to French
champion Lens, which has two from two draws.
	   Though struggling in seventh place in the Bundesliga, 12 points
behind Bayern, Kaiserslautern tops Group F with four points from a
win and a tie and hasn't conceded a goal.
	   The German titlist crosses into the Netherlands to visit second
place PSV Eindhoven with Bobby Robson's Dutch team missing
virtually its entire first choice defense through injury or
suspension.
	   Benfica, back at the top of the Portuguese league after a spell
in the shadow of FC Porto, is behind PSV on goals scored with both
teams tied on three points and hopes for a win at winless HJK
Helsinki.
	   Veteran striker Joao Pinto, who scored twice in Portugal's 3-0
Euro 2000 qualifying victory at Slovakia Saturday, is doubtful with
a toe injury.

Nokia reports surging sales, profit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MATTI HUUHTANEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Nokia showed a near-doubling of
cellular phone sales in the third quarter and a 75-percent increase
in pretax profit of 9.6 billion markkaa (dlrs 1.9 billion) for the
first nine months of the year, the company reported Friday.
	   Net sales for all Nokia's divisions jumped to 53.3 billion
markkaa (dlrs 10.6 billion) compared with 36.7 billion markkaa for
the january-September period last year.
	   During the third quarter, sales of mobile phones surged to 12.9
billion markkaa (dlrs 2.58 billion) from 6.6 billion markkaa in
1997, and for the nine-month period were up to 31.9 billion markkaa
(dlrs 6.38 billion) from 20 billion markkaa last year.
	   Nokia's profit was 1 billion markkaa higher than market analysts
had predicted, and the group's president Jorma Ollila said the
results had surpassed the company's own expectations.
	   ``We now feel confident in declaring that we have significantly
increased our market share in mobile phones to become the largest
manufacturer of mobile phones worldwide,'' Ollila said.
	   Last year, Nokia sold 21 million cellular hand sets, making it
the world's second largest mobile phone maker after Motorola Inc.,
based in Schaumburg, Illinois.
	   Ollila said preliminary market data indicate Nokia has now
overtaken Motorola.
	   Earlier this month, Motorola reported a loss of dlrs 42 million
during the third quarter and a net loss of dlrs 1.2 billion for the
first nine months of the year.
	   Ericsson, the Swedish telecommunications giant, reported
Thursday a 19-percent increase of net sales to 56.08 billion kronar
(dlrs 7.2 billion) for the nine month period, but said sales of
mobile phones during the third quarter fell by 2 percent to 10.8
billion kronar (dlrs 1.39 billion).
	   Nokia's good result was mainly due to ``lower than anticipated
price erosion in mobile phones, and rapid digitalization in the
Americas,'' Ollila said.
	   He said the company expected strong growth to continue for the
rest of the year in China, Europe and in its main market, the
United States, and predicted a good overall result for the year.
	   Last month, Nokia predicted 1 billion cellular phone subscribers
worldwide by 2005, and estimated 250 million global mobile phone
subscribers at mid-year 1998.
	   Nokia is a world leader in digital mobile phone technology, and
has supplied GSM equipment to 67 operators in 35 countries. It has
sales in 130 countries, and employs 42,000 people.
	   Nokia's total pretax profit last year more than doubled to a
record 8.37 billion markkaa (dlrs 1.67 billion) and net sales
amounted to 52.6 billion markkaa (dlrs 10.4 billion).

Lewis likes Madison Square Garden as venue
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Lennox Lewis says Madison Square Garden would be a
fitting site for a heavyweight unification fight early next year
against Evander Holyfield.
	   Reports Thursday in London said the fight would be held March 13
with the historic New York venue paying dlrs 8.5 million to be the
host.
	   ``That's where Muhammad Ali fought and there have been some
great fights there,'' Lewis said. ``It will be part of history to
fight Holyfield in those surroundings. Hopefully when I go to the
Garden, I'll feel the same aura those guys felt.''
	   Holyfield, the WBA and IBF champion, has signed for the bout and
WBC champion Lewis is expected to sign shortly. Other possible
venues include Las Vegas and Atlantic City.
	   ``There are no major problems with the fight, there are just a
couple of legal things to sort out. The television is all agreed,''
Lewis' manager, Frank Maloney, said.
	   ``If the fight does take place at Madison Square Garden it will
be a great privilege,'' Maloney added. ``Most people remember the
other great heavyweight fight of modern times there between
Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier in 1971.''
	   Reports suggest Holyfield will pick up about dlrs 20 million
with dlrs 8 million for Lewis.
	   ``He's going to get more money than me,'' Lewis said. ``It has
to be _ he's got two titles.''
	   Then the Englishman took a small swipe at the American.
	   ``I think Holyfield was showing his age in his last fight
(against Vaughn Bean),'' he said. ``I feel very confident. I think
it's going to be a good fight. I don't think it's going to be
easier than a lot of my fights.''

Schumacher, Irvine confident about decisive Grand Prix in Japan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) - Michael Schumacher completed tests of his
Ferrari car for the last race of the season in Japan and said he
had ``the feeling'' he will return from Suzuka as world Formula One
champion.
	   ``It's difficult to explain why, but I have the feeling I'm
going to win, that I'll come back as world champion,'' the German
driver told the Turin sports daily Tuttosport.
	   Schumacher, a two-time world champion, goes into the Nov. 1 race
four points behind standings leader Mika Hakkinen, the Finnish
driver of McLaren-Mercedes.
	   Schumacher and Ferrari's No.2 driver, Eddie Irvine, completed
tests at the Fiorano track Thursday. The cars were being shipped to
Japan this weekend.
	   ``We did the best possible work to prepare the best possible
cars,'' Irvine said.
	   He said he hoped to finish second behind Schumacher, thus
depriving Hakkinen of precious points.
	   First place awards 10 points. Four points go to the runnerup.
	   Schumacher, who recently extended his contract with Ferrari in
one of the most expensive F-1 deals, would clinch his third world
title if he wins and Hakkinen does not place better than third.

Hamas, Jewish settlers denounce emerging agreement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli and Palestinian hardliners on Friday
were quick to condemn the emerging land-for-security agreement
being negiotated at a Mideast summit at Wye Plantation.
	   Jewish settler leader Aharon Domb accused Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu of breaking promises to his right-wing
constituents.
	   ``The agreement that is being put together in Washington is a
betrayal of the ideas and people that asked Netanyahu to safeguard
the Land of Israel,'' Domb said in a statement.
	   Domb warned that Netanyahu would ``face the gravest
consequences'' when he returns, but did not elaborate.
	   Sheik Ahmed Yassin, the founder of the Islamic militant group
Hamas, dismissed the deal as a sellout. ``Our people are paying
more than they are getting from this agreement,'' Yassin told The
Associated Press at his Gaza City home.
	   As part of the agreement being worked out, the CIA would play a
stronger role in the Palestinian Authority's campaign against
Islamic militants, mainly Hamas which has carried out more than a
dozen suicide attacks in Israel.
	   Yassin said a new crackdown could perhaps restrict the
activities of the Hamas military wing temporarily, but would not
prevent attacks against Israelis.
	   ``It cannot erase Hamas,'' said Yassin. ``It is an illusion to
think the agreement will put an end ot our military work.''

Pressures building for stronger legislative action

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Things are far from rosy as Vietnam's
National Assembly prepares to open a monthlong session next
Wednesday.
	   There's uncertainty over what will happen next in the Asian
financial crisis, along with growing pressures to speed up economic
reforms and unravel red tape.
	   Vietnam has acted cautiously to cushion the brunt of the
regional finance problems. But while the tactic has avoided the
major devaluations that devastated other countries, the fallout is
taking its toll.
	   Officials say they are concerned about slowdowns in economic
growth, foreign investment and exports, and increases in inflation
and unemployment.
	   Vu Mau, chairman of the National Assembly Office, said there is
a ``very urgent'' need to create 1 million to 1.2 million jobs next
year.
	   ``That is the task we have to tackle,'' he told a news
conference Friday. ``How to do it is the question.''
	   The country's competitive edge _ cheap labor and a market of 78
million people _ has largely evaporated as the pool of available
venture capital dries up and other countries with more transparent
legal and financial systems become more attractive.
	   The annual target of 9 percent economic growth has been scaled
down to 6 percent for 1999 and called a goal, not a must-reach
figure. Analysts say it will be hard to achieve.
	   With no easy solutions to the country's challenges, there have
been rumors of rifts that party officials _ eager to affirm the
country's style of politics by concensus _ are quick to deny.
	   At a plenum by the powerful Communist Party Central Committee
just before the legislative session, the main topic by far was
economics.
	   The National Assembly used to be largely a rubber stamp for the
party _ and still is in many ways _ but it has become increasingly
independent.
	   It will face a tangle of issues: land reform, education reform,
mobilization of domestic resources for investment, the fight
against rampant corruption and rewrites of conflicting laws and
rules that foster graft by giving officials too much leeway.
	   All are needed to reassure international investors and trading
partners, who are growing weary of government assertions that it's
doing its best and learning on the job while implementing
decade-old economic reforms.
	   There also will be an emphasis on helping agriculture after
drought and flooding hurt crops this year and raised concerns about
food security at a time that the country depends on exports of
rice, coffee and other crops.
	   A government source said the plenum, recognizing the role of
agriculture in helping Vietnam avoid the political and social
turmoil seen in some countries in the region, recommended doubling
spending on farming.
	   But that means other sectors of the economy face cuts.
	   Final action is planned on delayed legislation on how to deal
with complaints from the public about official misconduct. Lack of
government response has been blamed for unrest in several provinces
over corruption by local officials.

Kosovo Albanian leader pledges for continued NATO pressure on
</HEADLINE>
Milosevic

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Echoing Western claims, Kosovo's
main ethnic Albanian leader said Friday that Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic has not fulfilled NATO's demands to remove his
troops from the province and that little progress has been made to
defuse the crisis.
	   Although fighting has all but ceased, tension remains high in
Kosovo, despite the agreement reached Oct. 12 between Milosevic and
U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke to avert NATO airstrikes.
	   The U.N. refugee agency said Friday that only a ``trickle'' of
refugees are returning to their homes because of fear and
intimidation by Serb police.
	   ``The impression our staff got on the ground is while some
people trickle back to their ruined homes, widespread destruction
of housing and fear of the continued Serb military and police
presence prevent signigicant return,'' U.N. spokesman Kris Janowski
said in Geneva, Switzerland.
	   In Kosovo's capital Pristina, ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim
Rugova told reporters that ``Serbian forces have not yet withdrawn
from Kosovo,'' despite Yugoslav claims to the contrary.
	   ``We cannot say any progress was made and NATO should maintain
its `activation order' and keep pressing the Belgrade government,''
Rugova said.
	   Yugoslavia has repeatedly insisted it has withdrawn all its
special troops sent after Feb. 28 to suppress an ethnic Albanian
revolt in Kosovo. The pro-government daily Vecernje Novosti quoted
unidentified police sources Thursday as saying that the only troops
still in Kosovo were those that had been there before the crackdown
began.
	   U.S. and other Western diplomats dispute this, however, warning
that continuing violence threatens the Serbian province's peace
process and raises the threat of NATO airstrikes. NATO has extended
the deadline until Tuesday for Milosevic to comply.
	   ``We are not satisfied with the level of compliance,'' U.S.
envoy Christopher Hill told reporters Thursday. In Washington,
Defense Department spokesman Kenneth Bacon said all of the
paramilitary police are not out and roadblocks remain that ``we
don't believe are proper.''
	   The troop withdrawal is a key condition of the U.S.-brokered
agreement to achieve lasting peace in Kosovo, an overwhelmingly
Albanian area of the Yugoslav republic of Serbia.
	   NATO has given Milosevic until Tuesday to comply with U.N.
demands or risk airstrikes. The demands include removing all
special troops sent to Kosovo during the crackdown and allowing
tens of thousands of ethnic Albanian refugees to return safely to
their homes.
	   ``The military and police presence is there,'' Janowski said.
``Even though people trickle back during the day, they hear shots
at night and they're off again.''
	   Laura Boldrini of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said
ethnic Albanians who returned two weeks ago to the village of
Poklek fled again this week because of intimidation by Serb police.
	   ``It's a never-ending story,'' Boldrini said.
	   International observers in the field said they heard increased
tank and artillery fire in some areas, after three days of relative
calm.
	   American diplomat William Walker arrived in the Yugoslav capital
Belgrade late Thursday to oversee the establishment of a
2,000-member mission to make sure Milosevic honors the agreement.
	   Walker will head the mission under the direction of the
Vienna-based Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
	   State-controlled media said Yugoslavia's foreign minister,
Zivadin Jovanovic, assured Walker the government will stick by the
deal. Walker was headed later Friday to the Kosovo capital Pristina
to meet Rugova.
	   Milosevic also agreed to talks with ethnic Albanians on the
future of the province, which is part of Yugoslavia's largest
republic, Serbia. About 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million people are
Albanian, and most want independence or self-rule.
	   The rebel Kosovo Liberation Army has insisted it will not
abandon its goal of independence. The United States and the
Europeans reject independence but support some form of autonomy for
Kosovo.
	   At U.N. headquarters in New York, the U.N. Security Council is
working on a resolution endorsing the Kosovo peace deal. Russia
raised objections Thursday that the language might authorize
military action.
	   Diplomats and U.N. officials said the council was aiming for a
vote on Friday.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 1100 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets ended the week generally
mixed Friday, with share prices falling in Tokyo but rising in Hong
Kong. Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 150.86
points, or 1.06 percent, closing the week at 14,144.70. The decline
in the Nikkei came after the average had gained a total of 1,300.19
points in the previous five trading days. Prices on the Hong Kong
Stock Exchange closed sharply higher in moderate trading. The
blue-chip Hang Seng Index rose 159.17 points, or 1.6 percent, to
9,817.75 on an afternoon rebound due to futures-related buying.
Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 119.14 yen, up 1.42 yen
from late Thursday in Tokyo. Elsewhere, Philippine stocks shares
closed at a new two-month high, shrugging off their early letharutter
duties have fallen from 20 to 15 percent, the Interfax news agency
said. Food imports have fallen sharply fallen since Russia's
economic crisis hit in mid-August. The country has not experienced
any food shortages, but the government wants to make sure that
stocks are plentiful for the winter. The lower duties will help
bring down prices a bit, but the main problem is the weak Russian
currency. Imports are now two to three times more expensive than
before the crisis because the ruble's value has fallen from 6 to
the dollar to about 17 to the dollar. Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov ordered the lower duties on Wednesday, the agency said.
(RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Japanese government said Friday that it will
take control of one of Japan's largest banks, in a move applauded
by analysts as showing Tokyo's resolve to finally clean up its
debt-ridden financial system. In announcing the first
nationalization of a Japanese bank since World War II, Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi said he approved the takeover of the
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd., whose recent troubles had
shaken world confidence in Japan's banking system and prompted
heated debate about a taxpayer bailout. The takeover will be the
first test for newly passed legislation aimed at revitalizing the
financial system and lifting Japan out of its worst recession in
half a century. The 60 trillion yen (dlrs 515 billion) package,
approved last week, allows the government to ease out ailing
lenders and help healthier ones rid themselves of a crushing burden
of bad loans that some analysts say total a trillion dollars.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ An unfolding Japanese defense scandal claimed its
highest-profile victim yet Friday when the chairman of NEC Corp.
announced his resignation. Chairman Tadahiro Sekimoto told
reporters he knew nothing about the scandal, but said he was
stepping down because of the trouble it caused NEC customers,
employees and shareholders. Prosecutors recently raided two NEC
subsidiaries and the Tokyo headquarters of the Japanese Defense
Agency in a widening scandal involving corruption in military
purchases. A total of 13 officials from NEC Corp. and the two
subsidiaries _ Nico Electronics Co. and Toyo Communication
Equipment Co. _ have been arrested on suspicion of overcharging the
Japanese military in procurement contracts. Three of them are
current NEC executives. Prosecutors say the amount that the NEC
affiliates overcharged totals nearly 1.7 billion yen (dlrs 14.3
million). Two Defense Agency officials also have been arrested,
suspected of winking at the inflated billings in exchange for the
three companies' providing jobs to retiring agency employees.

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ A leading Indian activist on Friday
accused the United Nations of being soft on his government, saying
it has ``failed miserably'' in eliminating child labor in the
country. Swami Agnivesh spoke during the release of a U.N. report
on child labor in India, which he said glossed over the Indian
government's problems. ``The United Nations must speak out,'' said
Agnivesh, who is well-known in India for his campaigns against
child labor. The U.N. report said India had the largest number of
child workers, which are believed to number from 40-100 million. L.
Mishra of the federal labor ministry, blamed state governments,
which he said oppose federal laws banning child labor in India and
which have legalized employment at ages as young as 12.

have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   QUEENSTOWN, Maryland (AP) _ Israelis and Palestinians were
``very close'' to sealing a complete West Bank land-for-peace deal
that would eliminate anti-Israel language in a Palestinian charter
and free scores of alleged Arab political prisoners, a U.S.
official said early Friday. The official, speaking on condition of
anonymity said things were looking positive for an agreement. The
potential breakthrough came as President Bill Clinton shepherded
marathon talks stretching overnight into a ninth day and as
officials from the two sides claimed to have resolved most key
issues. White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Clinton was pushing
hard to seal the deal. An Israeli official said gaps remained,
centered on last-minute haggling over how the Palestinians will go
about taking up the issue of reforming the convenant, which calls
for Israel's destruction. Still unresolved, however, were a U.S.
call for a timeout in Israeli settlement expansion on the West Bank
and Gaza and the establishment of a Palestinian airport.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Eighty-two people were confirmed dead
Friday as Typhoon Babs pummeled the northern Philippines with heavy
winds and rain, submerging parts of Manila and forcing many
businesses to shut down for a second day. At least 53 people were
killed in landslides on Catanduanes island, where the typhoon first
hit land Thursday, Office of Civil Defense director Renato Arevalo
said. Seventeen others died in landslides in nearby Camarines Sur
province, he said. Arevalo said 102 people were injured by flying
debris in Sorsogon province, also part of the Philippines'
impoverished Bicol region, but no one was killed. More than a
hundred thousand people in Bicol were forced to flee their homes,
Red Cross officials said. Roads throughout the central and northern
Philippines were flooded or blocked by landslides. Many people were
homeless after strong winds tore the roofs or walls off their
simple bamboo houses. (PHILIPPINES-TYPHOON)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A court sentenced a former top member of the Aum
doomsday cult to death on Friday for murdering four people in two
separate attacks, including one that strangled an anti-cult lawyer,
his wife and their infant son. It was the first time Japan used
capital punishment against the Aum Shinri Kyo cult, which is
accused of gassing the Tokyo subway system in 1995, in an attack
that killed a dozen people. In issuing the ruling, the Tokyo
District Court said former cult member Kazuaki Okazaki, 38,
deserved the death penalty because of the brutality of the crimes.
Okazaki and four other top cultists strangled Tsutsumi Sakamoto,
his wife, and their infant son on November 4, 1989, at their home
in Yokohama, just south of Tokyo at the request of AUM leader Shoko
Asahara, police say. In the other killing, Okazaki was found guilty
of murdering a cult member who had tried to quit the religious
group in February 1989. (JAPAN-DOOMSDAY CULT)
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iranians voted Friday in nationwide
elections for a key assembly that is expected to be dominated by
hard-line clergymen who favor unhindered powers for the country's
supreme leader. Turnout was low in the early hours for the 86-seat
Assembly of Experts, whose job is to oversee the work of the
supreme leader. In practice the supreme leader has the final say in
all matters, and hard-line clergymen want to keep it that way. But
moderate clerics led by President Mohammad Khatami are calling for
a more accountable supreme leader in a political tug-of-war that
has gripped Iran since Khatami's election last year. But Khatami's
camp appears to have lost this battle even before the polls: a
conservative supervisory council that vetted a list of 396
prospective candidates approved 161 contestants, only about 30 of
them moderates. The lack of competition has led to fears of a low
turnout from a disappointed public. Even hard-line newspapers
estimated that only about 39 percent of the 38 million eligible
voters will show up. (IRAN-ELECTIONS)

Russian lawmaker proposes paying hit men to stop killing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The speaker of Russia's parliament has a plan to
stop hired killers: pay them double if they refuse to carry out
their hit.
	   Gennady Seleznyov, the speaker of the lower house of parliament,
came up with the odd proposal during a visit to the Ural Mountains
city of Chelyabinsk earlier this week, the daily Moscow Times
reported Friday.
	   Seleznyov's aide Mikhail Osherov was shot in the head by an
unidentified attacker in the city of St. Petersburg last week, and
police suspect it may have been a contract shooting.
	   Contract killings are often used to settle business disputes in
Russia, and such hits have become increasingly widespread in recent
years. Police rarely catch the killers.
	   ``If a contract killer does not complete the job, but instead
turns himself in to the police and discloses the name of the person
who ordered the murder, the government should pay him double the
amount he would have received for committing the murder,''
Seleznyov was quoted as saying.
	   Seleznyov said he supported a new law to codify his proposal.
	   The suggestion was ridiculed in the Russian media.
	   ``After such an amendment is passed, the number of contract
killers in Russia would probably grow in a geometric progression,
because not all Russian citizens would not be able to resist the
temptation of making several thousand dollars for `turning in' a
disliked boss or neighbor as the person who commissioned a
murder,'' the daily Kommersant said Thursday.
	   ``But the speaker's desire to find new ways of providing
financial assistance to low-income compatriots is certainly
commendable,'' it added sarcastically.
	   Anatoly Naumov, deputy director of the Institute of State and
Law at the Russian Academy of Science, tried to smooth over
Seleznyov's remarks, saying it was meant as a ``metaphor'' to draw
attention to the problem, the Moscow Times reported.
	   ``He didn't literally mean the government should pay criminals.
It was simply a way of emphasizing the problem,'' Naumov was quoted
as saying.

Queen goes up in smoke on new stamp
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Queen Elizabeth II's head goes up in smoke on a
newly minted British stamp, and that has not gone unnoticed at
Buckingham Palace.
	   The first stamp in a new Royal Mail series recognizing great
inventors includes the traditional silhouette of the queen's head _
except, on this one, she seems to be floating above a
smoke-belching industrial chimney.
	   The queen was quick to note the unfortunate juxtaposition when
she was reviewing the stamp designs, Buckingham Palace spokeswoman
Penny Russell-Smith said Friday.
	   ``She gave her formal approval, but she did note that on one of
the stamps her head appeared to be coming out of a chimney,'' Ms.
Russell-Smith said.
	   The queen's distaste never reached the point of asking the Royal
Mail to scrap the design, though a spokeswoman said the post office
would indeed have canceled the stamp if the queen had objected.
	   The stamp, designed by artist Peter Howson and depicting the
invention of steam power, goes on sale Jan. 12.

Minister Yosfiah denies involvement in killings of journalists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ An Indonesian government official was
quoted Friday as denying any involvement in the killings of five
foreign journalists during the invasion of East Timor in 1975.
	   ``The allegation is not true. How I could do it, even their
faces I did not know,'' Indonesian Minister of Information Yunus
Yosfiah was quoted as saying by the Suara Pembaruan newspaper.
	   Yosfiah, an army lieutenant general who was then an officer,
told the afternoon daily Thursday that he had never received any
report on the killings.
	   Reporter Malcolm Rennie, 28, and cameraman Brian Peters, 29,
both British citizens, Australian reporter Greg Shackleton, 27,
Australian soundman Tony Stewart, 21, and New Zealand cameraman
Gary Cunningham, 27, were killed in an attack on Balibo village on
Oct. 16, 1975.
	   ``I also don't know about their graves,'' Yosfiah said.
	   He also disclosed that there was a fake ``scenario'' suggested
he had entered their house and killed one of the five with a gun
before ordering an attack by troops.
	   ``I say that the accusation is very untrue. Because as long as I
was on duty in East Timor I never saw the faces of the
journalists,'' he said.
	   Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said Wednesday on
plans to reopen the investigation based on new evidence from an
eyewitness, Olandino Maia Guterres, who said the journalists had
been shot by the Indonesian military under the orders of Yosfiah.
	   Downer said he would ask former government lawyer Tom Sherman to
review the account. Sherman reported in 1996 that there was no
deliberate attempt by Indonesian forces to eliminate the men.
	   Meanwhile, Ghafar Fadyl, a spokesman of the Indonesian foreign
ministry, said the government hopes that the case will not harm
bilateral relations.
	   ``For the Indonesia, the case has been closed, but if Australia
wants to reopen, it is up to them,'' Ghafar said Thursday.
	   Indonesia annexed East Timor a year after the invasion and named
the former Portuguese colony its 27th province. The United Nations,
however, still considers Portugal the administering power.

Russia urged to withdraw troops from Moldova
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Kuchma offering to help negotiate between Russia
and Moldova. &QL; 
 &UR; By ANATOL GOLEA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KISHINEV, Moldova (AP) _ The presidents of Moldova, Ukraine and
Romania have urged Russia to withdraw its troops from a breakaway
region in Moldova, an official statement said Friday.
	   ``We express our concern ... and plead for a peaceful and
definitive solution'' to the problems in the Trans-Dniester region,
said a document signed by the three presidents, who were holding a
summit.
	   Presidents Petru Lucinschi of Moldova, Leonid Kuchma of Ukraine
and Emil Constantinescu of Romania said an agreement signed
Thursday on trilateral cooperation expressed their concern about
the conflicts in the region.
	   The document did not recognize the self-proclaimed independence
of Trans-Dniester, saying it is a region ``inside the territory of
an independent, unitary and sovereign Moldova.''
	   Trans-Dniester, a sliver of land in eastern Moldova with a
population of 700,000 mainly ethnic Russians and Ukrainians,
declared independence in 1990 fearing that Moldova, dominated by
ethnic Romanians, would seek to reunite with neighboring Romania.
	   A five-month war between Moldova and the separatists in 1992
claimed about 700 lives. Fighting ceased after Russia sent in 5,000
troops. Relations between the government and the separatists remain
tense.
	   The three presidents expressed their support for a mission from
the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe as ``an
instrument to prevent conflicts and solve the crisis.''
	   Kuchma offered Friday to help speed negotiations between Moldova
and Russia over the troop withdrawal. Kuchma said after meeting
with Moldova's president and Igor Smirnov, the leader of
Trans-Dniester, that he would contact Russian President Boris
Yeltsin with ``concrete proposals to settle the conflict.''
	   Smirnov said he would consider Kuchma's offer and said ``some
negotiations might take place.''
	   Lucinschi, Kuchma and Constantinescu signed also an agreement on
cooperation against the organized crime and agreed to coordinate
efforts against the illegal transport of weapons and radioactive
materials.
	   Also, Moldova and Ukraine signed an agreement that seeks to end
a lingering dispute over pension payments in the two countries.
They agreed to pay the pensions of the thousands of people who have
moved from one country to the other.
	   During the Soviet era, thousands of Moldovans and Ukrainians
were moved from one republic to another for work projects. When the
Soviet Union collapsed, many people returned to their native lands,
but faced difficulties in collecting pensions.

British Minister: Singapore, Britain to expand joint investment in
</HEADLINE>
China

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore and British companies are looking
into expanding their joint investment in China, British Trade
Minister Brian Wilson said Friday.
	   ``Partnership with companies in Singapore can ease political
access and cultural access'' to business opportunities in China, he
said. ``That is the concept that has been developing recently and
has great potential for both our countries.''
	   Singapore's 3.1 million people are predominantly ethnic Chinese.
	   Wilson met with several Singapore ministers and businessmen
since his arrival Thursday from the Philippines, the other
destination of his Asian trip.
	   Wilson, who is promoting British investment in Asia, is
traveling with nine officials from British power companies National
Power, Powergen, National Grid, ALSTOM, AMEC, Balfour Beatty,
British Gas, Rolls Royce and Cinergy.
	   Wilson emphasized the need for Southeast Asian governments to
adhere to the principles of free trade regardless of the severe
economic crisis in the region.
	   ``My general message is that the way to overcome the economic
problems of the region and in the world is to continue trading,
continue investing under all circumstances,'' Wilson said.
	   He said it was vital ``to ensure that the liberalization of
trade continues, and that there is no retreat into protectionism in
this difficult situation.''
	   Singapore's economy has withstood economic problems better than
any other country in the region, Wilson said, praising its ``sound
banking sector'' and strong fundamentals.
	   He added Singapore should be playing a leading role in the
regional recovery.
	   Addressing British Chamber of Commerce earlier Friday, Wilson
said that ``recent investment by British companies in Singapore
confirm their faith in this country and the region.''
	   British companies like Rolls Royce, RS Components and GKN have
all opened new operations in Singapore recently.

Family reunion awaits `El Duque'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in top 4 grafs with report of family's arrival. Minor
edits throughout. &QL; 
 &UR; By JUDIE GLAVE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ El Duque, the Cuban star pitcher who brought
triumph to the New York Yankees' championship team, was reunited
early Friday with the family he hasn't seen in nearly a year.
	   Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez embraced his mother, two
daughters and ex-wife at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey, where
they arrived on the private jet of team owner George Steinbrenner.
Hernandez and his mother wept and hugged each other as friends
stood by with bottles of champagne.
	   Daughters Steffi and Yahumara wore Yankees T-shirts, one
emblazoned with a photograph of her father's face, and one with the
name ``El Duque.''
	   The family arrived just in time for Friday's parade in New York
City to commemorate the Yankees' World Series victory over the San
Diego Padres.
	   The four were granted permission by Cuba to fly to the United
States on Thursday night. The U.S. State Department said the
family, which includes Hernandez's daughters Steffi, 3, and
Yahumara, 8, were to have a brief visit before returning to Cuba.
	   In Havana, Steffi and Yahumara danced on the porch of their
cement block home and neighbors hugged the girls' mother, Manzo
Ibanez, after they found out they would be reunited with Hernandez.
	   They arrived in the New York area after a stop in Miami on the
charter flight from Cuba. They planned to attend Friday's World
Series parade, said Maria Cubas of Miami, whose husband helped
Hernandez defect.
	   Their trip to the United States was much easier than the one
taken by Hernandez, who fled Cuba 10 months ago by climbing onto a
rickety raft with his current wife, Noris Bosch, and six others.
They landed on a remote Bahamian island and were rescued by the
U.S. Coast Guard.
	   Hernandez was signed by the Yankees and pitched them to a 9-3
victory Sunday in Game 2 of the World Series, which New York won in
a sweep of San Diego on Wednesday night. He was one of their best
pitchers during the regular season, finishing 12-4 with a 3.13
earned run average.
	   New York's Cardinal John O'Connor got involved in the effort to
get the family to New York after he received a letter from
Hernandez on Tuesday asking for the church to intervene with the
Cuban government, said Joe Zwilling, a spokesman for the Roman
Catholic Archdiocese of New York.
	   The cardinal then sent a message to Cuban President Fidel Castro
on Wednesday morning on behalf of the baseball player. By the
evening, the Cuban ambassador to the United Nations called O'Connor
and said Castro would let the Hernandez family travel to the United
States, Zwilling said.
	   The cardinal called Yankees owner George Steinbrenner during the
first inning of Wednesday's game to give him the news. Steinbrenner
notified Hernandez and arranged for a plane to fly the family from
Miami to New York.
	   Hernandez's half-brother, Livan, also played baseball in Cuba
and defected during a team trip to Mexico in 1995. He was the 1997
World Series MVP for the Florida Marlins, and his mother was
allowed to fly from Cuba to Miami to visit him just before Game 7.
Livan and Orlando have the same father, but different mothers.
	   Orlando Hernandez, who signed a four-year dlrs 6.6 million
contract with the Yankees in March, was banned from playing in Cuba
for dealing with American major league scouts.
	   ``I'm very happy. I'm very proud of my son,'' said 52-year-old
Maria Julia Pedroso Cruz, 52. ``He hasn't changed, in spite of the
fact that he has all that money.''
	   Since her son left, she said, ``it has been very difficult for
us, but we have survived.''

Aid situation in Guinea-Bissau said to be critical due to fighting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BARRY HATTON &QC;

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ About half Guinea-Bissau's 1 million
people have fled their homes to avoid the fighting between
government forces and insurgents, creating a humanitarian crisis
that has aid workers and diplomats alarmed.
	   ``We estimate that about half a million people are now
internally displaced,'' World Food Program spokesman Wadgi Othman
said.
	   The Portuguese Ambassador in Bissau, the capital of the West
African country, said food stocks were very low and the fighting
prevented more aid from being moved around the country.
	   ``The (humanitarian) situation is very, very serious, and it'll
probably get worse,'' Ambassador Fernando Henriques da Silva told
Portuguese state radio Antena 1.
	   Fighting between a breakaway army faction and government forces
supported by troops from neighboring Senegal resumed on Sunday,
ending a three-month truce in the former Portuguese colony.
	   The rebels, mostly army veterans angered by poor pay and
conditions, have overrun the second-largest city Bafata and the
third-largest, Gabu, since the fighting restarted. They now control
most of the impoverished country.
	   Henriques da Silva said sporadic automatic weapons and mortar
fire could be heard Friday in Bissau where the rebels have held the
main army garrison and airport in the western outskirts of the city
since the rebellion began June 7.
	   Bissau, which had a population of 300,000, is almost deserted,
Othman said from Abidjan, Ivory Coast, where he is in radio contact
with aid teams inside Guinea-Bissua. Bafata reportedly was calm, he
said.
	   The WFP will ship 100 tons of rice next week to the Bisagos
islands, some 50 kilometers (30 miles) off the coast, where
thousands of people have gathered to escape the fighting, Othman
said.
	   President Joao Bernardo Vieira announced a unilateral cease-fire
by government forces Wednesday, but the rebels mistrust him and
want guarantees before entering into peace talks, Ambassador
Henriques da Silva said.
	   The breakaway military faction has been fighting about 3,000
heavily-armed Senegalese troops who crossed over the border to
support Vieira.
	   The foes had entered a cease-fire July 26 brokered by
negotiators from west African and Portuguese-speaking countries.
The mediators discussed the deployment of a peacekeeping force and
military observers, but no deal was reached.

	   LYON, France (AP) _ World No. 1 Pete Sampras withdrew from the
Lyon Grand Prix on Friday before his quarterfinal match, citing a
back injury.
	   Sampras was to face Germany's Tommy Haas in the quarterfinal of
the dlrs 750,000 event.
	   Details of Sampras' back injury were not immediately available,
but it could hurt his chances of finishing the year at No. 1.
	   On Thursday, Sampras had appeared in top form as he fired 10
aces in a decisive 6-2, 6-4 second-round win over Australia's Todd
Woodbridge.
	   Sampras is a three-time winner of the Lyon event.

	   Facts about the West Bank, the territory at the core of the
Israeli-Palestinian dispute:
	   ___ &QC; 
	   HISTORY: Part of Ottoman and later British Palestine, area was
earmarked for the heart of an Arab Palestinian state in 1947 U.N.
plan partitioning the region between Arabs and Jews. Jordan seized
West Bank in 1948 war; Israel took it in 1967 war. Area was under
Israeli military occupation until peace process began in 1993.
	   AREA: 2,300 square miles (5,957 square kilometers).
	   POPULATION: Estimated 1.6 million Palestinians live in eight
major towns, including Nablus, Ramallah, Jericho, Bethlehem and
Hebron, as well as hundreds of villages. About 155,000 Israelis
live in 144 settlements, largest of which are Maaleh Adumim, Ariel
and Kiryat Arba.
	   BREAKDOWN OF CONTROL: Full Palestinian control over 3 percent of
West Bank, including major cities and 80 percent of Hebron. More
than a half-million Palestinians live in that land, known as Area
A. Another 24 percent of land, Area B, has Palestinian population
of 600,000-plus and mainly includes towns and villages around major
cities. Palestinians run civilian affairs, share responsibility
with Israel for security matters. Remaining 73 percent, Area C,
under full Israeli control and military occupation, includes rural
areas and Jewish settlements. Reportedly has an Arab population of
30,000.

American team puts out fire in Nigeria

	   JESSE, Nigeria (AP) _ Suffocating the flames with a thick layer
of foam, an American firefighting company on Friday extinguished
the gasoline-fed pipeline blaze that has been flaring since it
exploded into an inferno over the weekend, killing hundreds.
	   Workmen from the Houston, Texas-based company BJ Services spent
about 45 minutes shooting nitrogen-rich foam from hoses onto the
pipeline before finally choking out the fire. A company official
said they had extensive experience in oil fires, and had approached
the government about putting out the Jesse blaze.
	   The explosion and fire tore through this southern Nigerian town
Saturday, while up to 1,000 people were trying to collect gasoline
spilling from the damaged government-owned pipeline.
	   State radio has put the death toll at 700, but some local
officials expect it will eventually reach 1,000.
	   Hundreds of people were believed to have been injured, but many
had refused medical care or fled local hospitals, fearing they
might be arrested for either causing the fire or scavenging gas.
	   On Wednesday, a town crier was sent into Jesse, promising that
none of the injured would be arrested.
	   At least 18 patients had returned to area hospitals after the
town crier went in, and reportedly many more.
	   Aid workers from a number of United Nations agencies, the Red
Cross and foreign doctors had flown in to help, local officials
said.
	   Whether charges will be filed in the incident remains unclear.
Local officials have promised there would be no arrests, but the
powerful state petroleum corporation has reportedly demanded that
whoever cracked open the pipeline be prosecuted.
	   It also remains unclear what caused the explosion. Government
officials have said they believe scavengers' tools set it off,
while some news reports have blamed a lit cigarette.
	   Firefighters stopped fighting the flames Monday, waiting for the
fuel remaining in the Jesse section of the pipeline to burn itself
out. The entire pipeline runs about 600 kilometers (380 miles),
from the southeastern city of Warri to the northern city of Kano.
	   Despite being the world's sixth-largest oil producer, Nigeria
remains a fuel-starved country, its petroleum industry is hobbled
by corruption and mismanagement. Refineries are in desperate need
of repair, black-market gasoline is often marked up 1,000 percent
and lines at gas pumps can last for days.

Russia to cut import duties to make food more affordable
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Amid concerns about food supplies, the Russian
government has lowered duties on food imports in order to maintain
the flow of foreign products, a news report said Friday.
	   Import duties on meat have been cut from 15 percent to 10
percent, milk duties have been trimmed from 10 percent to 5
percent, and butter duties have fallen from 20 to 15 percent, the
Interfax news agency said.
	   Food imports have fallen sharply fallen since Russia's economic
crisis hit in mid-August. The country has not experienced any food
shortages, and is not expected to, but the government wants to make
sure that stocks are plentiful for the winter.
	   The lower duties will help bring down prices a bit, but the main
problem is the weak Russian currency. Imports are now two to three
times more expensive than before the crisis because the ruble's
value has fallen from 6 to the dollar to about 17 to the dollar.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov ordered the lower duties on
Wednesday, saying the measure was aimed at ``stabilizing the food
market and supporting domestic industry.''
	   The new rates will be effective for at least the next six month,
the report said.
	   Russia has more land than any other country _ including plenty
of good farmland _ yet the weak agricultural sector cannot meet the
country's food needs.
	   Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov said Thursday that the country
does not need humanitarian aid, but it does want additional loans
from international lenders.
	   Meanwhile, the government continued talks Friday with a mission
from the International Monetary Fund. Few details have been
released, but the IMF top representative in Russia, Martin Gilman,
has said that the question of further IMF loan installments has not
come up.
	   A dlrs 22.6 billion loan package, put together by the IMF before
the crisis, was frozen in September after the first dlrs 4.8
billion installment was provided.
	   In other economic news, Russia's gold production is expected to
total 120 tons this year, deputy Finance Minister German Kuznetsov
said. The government plans to buy 50 tons of gold from local
companies and has allocated 7 billion rubles (dlrs 411 million) in
next year's budget for the purpose. Russia will not export any gold
from government reserves next year, he said.
	   Also, the government has finalized plans to sell a 2.5 percent
state in natural gas giant Gazprom. The stake is valued at 10-15
billion rubles (dlrs 588 million to 882 million). The state
currently holds a 40 percent stake in Gazprom.

Palestinian top cop: ready to cooperate with CIA

<TEXT>
	   JERICHO, West Bank (AP) _ Snacking on plump red grapes in his
desert compound, Jibril Rajoub is the West Bank's top cop, a
pivotal figure in the war against Islamic militants whose acts of
bloodletting have kept peace from taking root.
	   Rajoub says he believes the involvement of the U.S. Central
Intelligence Agency will be helpful in overcoming mistrust that has
all but ended Israeli-Palestinian cooperation, in an interview with
The Associated Press before Friday's agreement reached by Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat.
	   Under the agreement, CIA overseas operatives would resolve
Israeli-Palestinian disputes over the arrest of suspected
terrorists, the management of border checkpoints and other security
issues.
	   Israel demanded a major crackdown on militants and their
infrastructure as part of any agreement. But when it comes to what
he will do to contain the enemies of peace, Rajoub prefers not to
comment and let recent actions speak louder than words.
	   His agents summoned 20 members of the Iran-backed Islamic Jihad
on Wednesday night, told them they were being watched closely and
warned them not to carry out attacks during the third anniversary
of the assassination of their leader, Fathi Shekaki, an act widely
attributed to Israel. They also issued stern warnings to activists
of the larger Hamas group that Palestinian security forces would
not tolerate any violence.
	   Rajoub views the conflict with Hamas as a low-intensity
guerrilla campaign, one in which his forces summon militant leaders
every few weeks and remind them they are being watched.
	   It doesn't always work, as witnessed earlier in the week when a
Hamas member threw two grenades into a crowd of Israelis at a bus
station in Beersheba. After the attack, in which more than 60
Israelis were wounded, Rajoub's Preventive Security agents detained
15 Hamas members.
	   Swiveling in a black leather chair in his crisply air
conditioned office on Thursday, Rajoub said he had zero tolerance
for violence, but at the same time, made clear the Palestinians
would jealously guard their right to call the shots.
	   Rejecting Israel's claim that militant groups are heavily armed
and flaunt their weapons in public, Rajoub said: ``No one carries
an unlicensed weapon in our territories. We won't allow this to
happen.''
	   However, almost everyone in the Palestinian lands who wants a
gun already has one.
	   Israel maintains there is a ``revolving door'' in which
militants are arrested after attacks occur and then let go when the
pressure from the United States and Israel fades. It has insisted
Palestinians suspected of committing terror attacks be extradited
to Israel.
	   ``No Palestinian will be handed to Israel,'' declared Rajoub,
who personally broke off contact with the Israelis and the CIA to
protest what he said was Israel's abduction of two of his
prisoners. He withdrew from the negotiations on a new security
agreement, while other Palestinian security officials participated
in the talks.
	   ``Any Palestinian who commits a violation is processed through
the Palestinian judicial system. There needs to be respect for that
system,'' he said.
	   Israel also claims Palestinians involved in attacks on Israelis
have been inducted into the 40,000-member Palestinian police force.
	   Rajoub dismisses Israel's argument, noting that he was a former
guerrilla who spent 17 years in Israeli jails. Members of the
security forces, he said, are not longer a threat.
	   ``They pledge and commit to follow the laws and politics of the
Palestinian Authority and not to engage in armed activities either
for personal or political gains,'' he said.
	   Rajoub said he would welcome the involvement of the U.S. Central
Intelligence Agency as an arbiter in the dispute with Israel over
how to wage the struggle against militants. The CIA's monitoring of
who remains in jail was a key compromise reportedly offered at the
Wye summit to resolve the security issue.
	   The CIA will be ``a needed witness to balance Israel's claims of
non-Palestinian compliance,'' Rajoub said.
	   But he also cautioned that the Palestinians would have the final
say on who is arrested.
	   ``American participation must not be on our expense,'' he said.
``Partnership and understanding of our commitment to our people is
the base. Without this no agreement can work.''
	   Rajoub signals that he is ready to renew cooperation with
Israel, saying he was ready to work in the context of a
CIA-supervised effort with Israel. But Rajoub doesn't miss the
opportunity to take a swipe at Israel's own security performance.
	   Rajoub says he has a videotaped statement made before the
Beersheba attack by Salem Rajab Sarsour, the Hamas member who was
arrested after throwing the grenades.
	   In it, Sarsour said he had been approached several times by a
captain in Israel's Shin Bet security service who gave him money
and a mobile phone to relay information about Hamas. Israeli
newspapers quoted unidentified Shin Bet officials as saying that
the agency had approached Sarsour and offered him to work as an
informer.
	   Rajoub said Sarsour regretted taking the money and felt he had
disgraced his family. Determined to make up for his lapse, Sarsour
carried out the Beersheba attack, anticipating that he would be
killed in the effort. Instead, he was captured by Israeli civilians
at the scene.

Hamas, Jewish settlers denounce emerging agreement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with reaction from Israeli president, leading rabbi;

 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli and Palestinian hardliners on Friday
condemned a land-for-security agreement reached after nine days of
intense negotiations led by U.S. President Bill Clinton.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's right-wing
constituents, foremost among them Jewish settlers, were deeply
disappointed Friday and accused him of breaking his promises.
	   Jewish settler leader Aharon Domb intially accused Netanyahu of
``treason,'' but later toned his accusations and said the prime
minister had negotiated to an ``agreement of surrender.''
	   Domb warned that Netanyahu would ``face the gravest
consequences'' when he returns, but did not elaborate.
	   For the past three days, Jewish settlers have been blocking West
Bank intersections to Palestinian motorists to protest the emerging
deal. On Friday morning, several hours before it was announced in
Washington that a deal had been reached, several dozen settlers
blocked two main West Bank highways leading to Jerusalem, briefly
stopping traffic.
	   Hardliner leaders have warned that Netanyahu's coalition will
collapse if he returns with a West Bank withdrawal agreement.
	   Rabbi Mordechai Eliyahu, a spiritual leader of the National
Religious Party, hinted that the party would quit the coalition.
	   He said that those following Jewish law ``cannot cooperate with
those who endanger lives and endanger peace and security in
Israel.''
	   On the Palestinian side, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, the founder of the
Islamic militant group Hamas, dismissed the deal as a sellout.
	   ``Our people are paying more than they are getting from this
agreement,'' Yassin told The Associated Press at his Gaza City
home.
	   As part of the agreement, the CIA would play a stronger role in
the Palestinian Authority's campaign against Islamic militants,
mainly Hamas which has carried out more than a dozen suicide
attacks in Israel.
	   Yassin said a new crackdown could perhaps restrict the
activities of the Hamas military wing temporarily, but would not
prevent attacks against Israelis.
	   ``It cannot erase Hamas,'' said Yassin. ``It is an illusion to
think the agreement will put an end ot our military work.''

British Minister: Singapore, Britain to expand joint investment in
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING &QL; 
China

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore and British companies are looking
into expanding their joint investment in China, British Trade
Minister Brian Wilson said Friday.
	   ``Partnership with companies in Singapore can ease political
access and cultural access'' to business opportunities in China, he
said. ``That is the concept that has been developing recently and
has great potential for both our countries.''
	   Singapore's 3.1 million people are predominantly ethnic Chinese.
	   Wilson met with several Singapore ministers and businessmen
since his arrival Thursday from the Philippines, the other
destination of his Asian trip.
	   Wilson, who is promoting British investment in Asia, is
traveling with nine officials from British power companies National
Power, Powergen, National Grid, ALSTOM, AMEC, Balfour Beatty,
British Gas, Rolls Royce and Cinergy.
	   Wilson emphasized the need for Southeast Asian governments to
adhere to the principles of free trade regardless of the severe
economic crisis in the region.
	   ``My general message is that the way to overcome the economic
problems of the region and in the world is to continue trading,
continue investing under all circumstances,'' Wilson said.
	   He said it was vital ``to ensure that the liberalization of
trade continues, and that there is no retreat into protectionism in
this difficult situation.''
	   Singapore's economy has withstood economic problems better than
any other country in the region, Wilson said, praising its ``sound
banking sector'' and strong fundamentals.
	   He added Singapore should be playing a leading role in the
regional recovery.
	   Addressing British Chamber of Commerce earlier Friday, Wilson
said that ``recent investment by British companies in Singapore
confirm their faith in this country and the region.''
	   British companies like Rolls Royce, RS Components and GKN have
all opened new operations in Singapore recently.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli and Palestinian hardliners on Friday
condemned a land-for-security agreement reached after nine days of
intense negotiations led by U.S. President Bill Clinton.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's right-wing
constituents, foremost among them Jewish settlers, were deeply
disappointed Friday and accused him of breaking his promises.
	   Jewish settler leader Aharon Domb intially accused Netanyahu of
``treason,'' but later toned his accusations and said the prime
minister had negotiated to an ``agreement of surrender.''
	   Domb warned that Netanyahu would ``face the gravest
consequences'' when he returns, but did not elaborate.
	   For the past three days, Jewish settlers have been blocking West
Bank intersections to Palestinian motorists to protest the emerging
deal. On Friday morning, several hours before it was announced in
Washington that a deal had been reached, several dozen settlers
blocked two main West Bank highways leading to Jerusalem, briefly
stopping traffic.
	   Hardliner leaders have warned that Netanyahu's coalition will
collapse if he returns with a West Bank withdrawal agreement.
	   Rabbi Mordechai Eliyahu, a spiritual leader of the National
Religious Party, hinted that the party would quit the coalition.
	   He said that those following Jewish law ``cannot cooperate with
those who endanger lives and endanger peace and security in
Israel.''
	   On the Palestinian side, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, the founder of the
Islamic militant group Hamas, dismissed the deal as a sellout.
	   ``Our people are paying more than they are getting from this
agreement,'' Yassin told The Associated Press at his Gaza City
home.
	   As part of the agreement, the CIA would play a stronger role in
the Palestinian Authority's campaign against Islamic militants,
mainly Hamas which has carried out more than a dozen suicide
attacks in Israel.
	   Yassin said a new crackdown could perhaps restrict the
activities of the Hamas military wing temporarily, but would not
prevent attacks against Israelis.
	   ``It cannot erase Hamas,'' said Yassin. ``It is an illusion to
think the agreement will put an end ot our military work.''

Russian scientist denies finding missing remains of czar's
</HEADLINE>
children &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Russian scientist denied Friday that he had
found the missing remains of two of the last czar's children and
said another expedition would search for them next summer.
	   Alexander Avdonin found the remains of Russia's last czar,
Nicholas II, most of his family and their servants in a pit in the
central Russian city of Yekaterinburg in 1991.
	   The Bolsheviks dumped their burned remains in the pit after
executing the royal family on July 17, 1918. The remains were
buried in St. Petersburg this past July, after seven years of
genetic testing and debate.
	   The Moskovksy Komsomolets newspaper reported earlier this week
that Avdonin had recently found two sets of remains that had been
missing _ those of Alexei, the hemophiliac heir to the throne, and
one of his sisters, either Maria or Anastasia.
	   Moskovsky Komsomolets said researchers had also found four topaz
beads of the kind that had been presented each year to Maria on her
birthday, and some bones.
	   Avdonin confirmed that the beads had been found, but called the
rest of the newspaper report a ``provocation'' that must be
``refuted immediately because this is a subject of international
significance,'' the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Avdonin said the two childrens' remains had not been found, but
that another expedition would take place next summer because so far
only one bonfire site had been examined.
	   He said searchers are using the latest equipment, including
radar, to search to a depth of five meters (yards).
	   Avdonin said searchers also found metal buttons, hooks from what
it believed to be a woman's corset, a bullet from a handgun,
fragments of gold jewelry and bones from a big animal.

Anti-smoking bill clears first hurdle in South Africa
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ A drastic anti-smoking bill
cleared its first hurdle in Parliament on Friday, paving the way
for clamp downs on advertising and tobacco use at work and public
places.
	   A health committee approved the bill that has been fiercely
opposed by the tobacco industry, media and advertising groups and
some unions.
	   Opponents are likely to mount a constitutional challenge to the
law, which is expected to be passed by full Parliament early next
month.
	   The panel approved minor amendments that include permission for
tobacco logos to be displayed on clothing.
	   The top fine for smoking at work or in public places would be
200 rand (dlrs 35). Advertising violations could generate fines of
up to 200,000 rand (dlrs 35,000).

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Tajikistan is prepared to help the United Nations
settle the conflict in neighboring Afghanistan, Tajik President
Emomali Rakhmanov said Friday.
	   Rakhmanov made the offer during a meeting with the U.N. envoy to
Tajikistan, Lakhdar Brahimie.
	   Rakhmanov and Brahimie held ``a fruitful discussion'' on
developments in Afghanistan and possible solutions, the Tajik
president's spokesman, Zafar Saidov, told the Interfax news agency.
	   Tajikistan and other former Soviet republics in Central Asia
fear an influx of refugees and weapons from Afghanistan, as well as
a spillover of the fighting there.

U.S. provides documents for extradition of terror suspect
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ The United States has delivered all the
necessary files to support its extradition request for an alleged
top aide of Saudi terrorist suspect Osama bin Laden, officials said
Friday.
	   A court in Munich will review the evidence against Mamdouh
Mahmud Salim, 40, of Sudan, before deciding whether to approve the
extradition request, said Gerhard Zierl, spokesman for the Bavarian
Justice Ministry.
	   It was not known when the court would rule. However, the federal
government has the final word on any extradition.
	   Salim has been jailed since his arrest near Munich on Sept. 16
by Bavarian authorities acting on a U.S. warrant.
	   U.S. authorities charge Salim helped finance, train and arm
members of a terrorist organization, including the alleged bombers
of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.

NATO sends 2 top military commanders to Belgrade for Kosovo talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - NATO decided on Friday to send two top
military commanders to Belgrade this weekend to press Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic he has few days left comply with the
Kosovo agreement.
	   NATO's top military commander in Europe, U.S. Gen. Wesley Clark
and German General Klaus Naumann, who heads NATO's panel of chiefs
of staffs, are to insist that more Yugoslav special police units
return to their barracks and take weapons with time on their way
out of Kosovo, a NATO official said.
	   ``We have seen great progress but we are still far from adequate
compliance,'' said the NATO official who demanded anonymity.
	   NATO is maintaining the threat of airstrikes against Serbia
until at least next Tuesday in an attempt to make sure Milosevic
abides by the Kosovo peace deal struck two weeks ago with the Serb
authorities.

Russia urged to withdraw troops from Moldova
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW grafs 9-10 with Russian comment on proposed troop
withdrawal. &QL; 
 &UR; By ANATOL GOLEA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KISHINEV, Moldova (AP) _ The presidents of Moldova, Ukraine and
Romania have urged Russia to withdraw its troops from a breakaway
region in Moldova, an official statement said Friday.
	   ``We express our concern ... and plead for a peaceful and
definitive solution'' to the problems in the Trans-Dniester region,
said a document signed by the three presidents, who were holding a
summit.
	   Presidents Petru Lucinschi of Moldova, Leonid Kuchma of Ukraine
and Emil Constantinescu of Romania said an agreement signed
Thursday on trilateral cooperation expressed their concern about
the conflicts in the region.
	   The document did not recognize the self-proclaimed independence
of Trans-Dniester, saying it is a region ``inside the territory of
an independent, unitary and sovereign Moldova.''
	   Trans-Dniester, a sliver of land in eastern Moldova with a
population of 700,000 mainly ethnic Russians and Ukrainians,
declared independence in 1990 fearing that Moldova, dominated by
ethnic Romanians, would seek to reunite with neighboring Romania.
	   Moldova and the separatists fought a brief war in 1992. After
the fighting ceased, Russia sent in 5,000 troops. Relations between
the Moldovan government and the separatists remain tense.
	   The three presidents expressed their support for a mission from
the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe as ``an
instrument to prevent conflicts and solve the crisis.''
	   Kuchma offered Friday to help speed negotiations between Moldova
and Russia over the troop withdrawal. Kuchma said after meeting
with Moldova's president and Igor Smirnov, the leader of
Trans-Dniester, that he would contact Russian President Boris
Yeltsin with ``concrete proposals to settle the conflict.''
	   A Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman said the troop withdrawal
call from the three presidents ignores the fact that Russia and
Moldova signed an agreement in 1994 saying Russian troops would
leave when there are signs of progress in resolving
Trans-Dniester's conflict.
	   ``Russian leaders have repeatedly expressed their allegiance to
it (the agreement),'' said spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin, according
to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Also, Moldova and Ukraine signed an agreement that seeks to end
a lingering dispute over pension payments in the two countries.
They agreed to pay the pensions of the thousands of people who have
moved from one country to the other.
	   During the Soviet era, thousands of Moldovans and Ukrainians
were moved from one republic to another for work projects. When the
Soviet Union collapsed, many people returned to their native lands,
but faced difficulties in collecting pensions.

American who spied for Israel to be released, says radio
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with radio saying Netanyahu may bring Pollard with him
upon his return to Israel &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel radio said Friday that Jonathon Pollard,
who is serving a life sentence for spying for Israel, will be
released by the United States.
	   Pollard's release was negotiated by Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu during the Mideast summit at Wye Plantation that was
hosted by U.S. President Bill Clinton.
	   Quoting sources in the Israeli delegation, the radio said that
Netanyahu might bring Pollard back with him when he returns from
the United States, probably Sunday.
	   The release of Pollard has been a frequent demand raised in
right-wing circles in Israel, and Netanyahu might be able to blunt
some of the opposition to a West Bank pullback by getting Pollard
out of prison and bringing him to Israel.
	   The Netanyahu government granted Pollard Israeli citizenship.
	   Previous governments tried to distance themselves from the
American Jewish naval intelligence officer who was convicted of
passing large amounts of sensitive information to Israel.
	   He was apprehended by American authorities as he pounded on the
gates of the Israeli Embassy in Washington in the mid-1980s. Since
then, Pollard has been charging that Israel has not done enough to
win his release.
	   Pollard was sentenced to life in prison for treason and
espionage. Several requests to grant him a pardon have been denied
by American presidents.

Taiwanese investment in China plunges over floods, safety fears
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwanese investment in China plunged 82
percent to U.S. dlrs 34.5 million in September, with businesses
discouraged by heavy flooding and the murders of several Taiwanese
there, the government said Friday.
	   Only 15 investment projects in China were approved by the Taiwan
government, compared to 36 projects in September 1997, the
Economics Ministry said in a statement.
	   Taiwanese have invested U.S. dlrs 35 billion in China over the
past decade _ even though the government bars them from putting
money into infrastructure deals or other big projects.
	   The restrictions are meant to prevent Taiwan's economy from
being absorbed by China.
	   China was devastated by floods this year. The threat of violence
has also dampened Taiwanese enthusiasm for investment in China.
Taiwanese statistics record at least 10 Taiwanese murdered in China
so far this year, against 5 for all of 1997.
	   Business and trade disputes between Taiwanese businessmen and
Chinese have also been on the rise.
	   Also during September, the ministry approved U.S. dlrs 446.7
million in investment overseas, led by projects in British Virgin
Islands, Thailand, the United States, Singapore and Hong Kong. It
marked an 82 percent increase from the same month last year.
	   Financial turmoil in Indonesia and the Philippines kept
Taiwanese investment out of those countries last month, the
ministry said.

Di Canio awaits lengthy ban from English soccer
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: WILL be updated with decision

<TEXT>
	   SHEFFIELD, England (AP) _ Sheffield Wednesday striker Paolo Di
Canio appeared before a Football Association disciplinary panel
Friday to face a possible lengthy ban for pushing a referee to the
ground in a Sept. 26 match.
	   The 30-year-old Italian arrived for the hearing dressed in a
conservative suit. The three-man committee was expected to issue
its verdict later in the day.
	   Di Canio, who was suspended immediately after the home match by
his Sheffield club, is reported to be facing a possible ban of up
to six months from the English game.
	   British Sports Minister Tony Banks has called for a heavy
punishment. Di Canio has said he expects to be punished severely.
	   Alcock was pushed to the ground after he gave Di Canio a red
card for his part in a brawl in the final minutes of the first half
of the game against Arsenal.
	   Arsenal's Martin Keown was also sent off as a melee among a
dozen players broke out following a tussle between Arsenal's
Patrick Vieira and Wim Jonk.
	   Di Canio later suggested Alcock play-acted and compared him to a
player diving to draw a penalty.
	   ``I pushed (the ref) in the stomach,'' Di Canio said last month.
``He took 3-4 steps sideways and fell like a player'' who dives for
a penalty.
	   Alcock, who denied Di Canio's allegation, said he considered
quitting the sport after the incident but had since changed his
mind.
	   ``I am certainly not going to let something like this beat me,''
Alcock said Thursday. ``I was caught totally by surprise and the
shock caused me to lose my balance.''
	   ``I thought on the way home whether I really need the pressure
of this particular incident and I have thought over the past two or
three weeks whether I need to carry on.
	   ``But at the end of the day I am certainly not going to let an
incident like that stop me refereeing.''

Fighting in Guinea-Bissau drives 500,000 people from homes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BARRY HATTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ About half Guinea-Bissau's 1 million
people have fled their homes to avoid fighting between government
forces and insurgents that has created a humanitarian crisis,
diplomats and aid workers warned Friday.
	   Fighting between a breakaway army faction and government forces
supported by troops from neighboring Senegal resumed Sunday, ending
a three-month truce in the former Portuguese colony.
	   World Food Program spokesman Wadgi Othman said Friday that about
half a million people had been driven from their homes.
	   The Portuguese Ambassador in Bissau, capital of the West African
country, said food stocks were low and the fighting prevented more
aid from being moved around the country.
	   ``The (humanitarian) situation is very, very serious, and it'll
probably get worse,'' Ambassador Fernando Henriques da Silva said
Friday on Portuguese state radio Antena 1.
	   The rebels, mostly army veterans angered by poor pay and
conditions, have overrun the second-largest city, Bafata, and the
third-largest, Gabu, since the fighting restarted. They now control
most of the impoverished country.
	   Henriques da Silva said sporadic automatic weapons and mortar
fire could be heard Friday in Bissau where the rebels have held the
main army garrison and airport in the western outskirts of the city
since the rebellion began June 7.
	   Bissau, which had a population of 300,000, is almost deserted,
Othman said from Abidjan, Ivory Coast, where he is in radio contact
with aid teams inside Guinea-Bissua. Bafata reportedly was calm, he
said.
	   The WFP will ship 100 tons of rice next week to the Bisagos
islands, some 50 kilometers (30 miles) off the coast, where
thousands of people have gathered to escape the fighting, Othman
said.
	   President Joao Bernardo Vieira announced a unilateral government
cease-fire Wednesday, but the rebels mistrust him and want
guarantees before entering into peace talks, Ambassador Henriques
da Silva said.
	   Rebels from a breakaway military faction has been fighting about
3,000 heavily-armed Senegalese troops who crossed over the border
to support Vieira.
	   The foes entered a July 26 cease-fire brokered by negotiators
from west African and Portuguese-speaking countries. The mediators
discussed the deployment of a peacekeeping force and military
observers, but no deal was reached.

Turkey grants Syria two weeks to end support to Kurdish rebels
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey has given Syria a two-week deadline
to end its support of Kurdish rebels following an agreement signed
between the two neighbors, reports said Friday.
	   The daily Milliyet quoted State Minister Ahat Andican as saying
that the government decided in a Cabinet meeting Thursday to grant
Damascus two weeks to implement the agreement signed earlier this
week.
	   Turkish officials claim that Syria has agreed to shut down rebel
camps in Syria and in Syrian-controlled parts of Lebanon.
	   In the past, Syria has denied it supported the PKK. In a first
step in implementing the agreement, Syria's official news agency
Tuesday called the autonomy-seeking Kurdish group an ``illegal and
unlicensed party.''
	   It was unclear what Turkey would do if it still deemed Damascus'
actions against the rebels as insufficient when the deadline comes.

Iranians vote in key assembly election amid fears of low turnout
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with official media reporting heavy
turnout, new quotes; TRIMS; Polls scheduled to close at 1430 GMT;

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iranians voted Friday to elect a key
assembly that is expected to be dominated by hard-line clergymen
who favor unhindered powers for the country's supreme leader.
	   The state-controlled media reported an ``unprecedented and
unique'' turnout but gave no figures. However, Associated Press
reporters who toured polling stations in Tehran found many of them
empty and some with 30-40 people.
	   The election is for the 86-seat Assembly of Experts, whose job
is to oversee the work of the supreme leader, a post currently held
by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
	   In practice the supreme leader has the final say in all matters,
and hard-line clergymen want to keep it that way. But moderate
clerics led by President Mohammad Khatami are calling for a more
accountable leader in a political tug-of-war that has gripped Iran
since Khatami's election last year.
	   ``We want to have a say in our destiny. I will vote for somebody
who will have some kind of influence over the (supreme) leader,''
said Farhad Qaemaqami, waiting with about 30 others to vote at a
mosque in the upscale Fereshteh neighborhood.
	   But Khatami's camp appears to have lost this battle even before
the polls: a conservative supervisory council that vetted a list of
396 prospective candidates approved 161 contestants, only about 30
of them moderates.
	   Khatami, who was among the early voters, pointed that out to
reporters after casting his ballot in the Husseinieh Jamaran
meeting hall attached to a mosque in northern Tehran.
	   ``Definitely, there could have been more qualified people than
were allowed, but nonetheless we still have a chance to choose our
favored candidates,'' said Khatami, who drove to the polling booth
dressed in the clergy's black robe and turban.
	   He shook hands and chatted with election officials before
sitting in front of a white ballot box to pick a 16-man panel for
the Tehran district from a list of 32 candidates.
	   Tehran radio said people queued in long lines to vote and
authorities expect to run out of ballot papers. ``People voted for
Islam ... people's participation is unprecedented and unique,'' the
radio said.
	   In Bojnourd and Astaneh Ashrafiyeh cities in the north, people
braved heavy rains and strong winds to stand in long lines at
polling stations, the official Islamic Republic News Agency said.
	   The upbeat reports contrasted with predictions of low voter
turnout from a disappointed public that had little to choose from,
unlike in the 1997 presidential polls when 20 million people voted
for the reformist Khatami.
	   A hard-line newspapers had said only about 39 percent of the 38
million eligible voters are expected to show up for Friday's vote.
	   ``They are all liars. I am powerless to do anything against them
so it's best to keep quite,'' said Siavaash Mohseni, 24, a
university student who said he didn't vote. ``It makes no
difference. They have already selected the people they want to put
in the assembly.''
	   A low turnout would likely be seen as a rebuff of the hard-line
policies of Khamenei, who succeeded the late Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, the leader of the 1979 Islamic Revolution that installed
the rule of Shiite clergy in Iran.
	   Khatami's popular efforts to ease the revolution's social,
political and media restrictions are opposed bitterly by
hard-liners who are loathe to give up their control over Iran's key
institutions such as the judiciary and security agencies.
	   Voting in the 33,312 polling stations in the country's 28
provinces is scheduled to close at 6 p.m. (1430 gmt). First
official results are not expected until Saturday.

	   BRUSSELS: Serb authorities.
	   ``We still believe Milosevic is able to go faster and do more,''
the official said.
	   NATO also stressed much progress had already been made on the
ground in Kosovo. It estimated there were only 10,000 refugees left
without shelter now, compared with some 50,000 just a few weeks
ago.
	   The two generals are expected to have talks with Milosevic
either Saturday or Sunday before returning to Belgium, where they
will brief the ambassadors of the 16 NATO nations on Monday.
	   The ambassadors are expected to decide on Monday whether to
extend the airstrikes deadline. The threat of airstrikes is used to
maintain the pressure on the Yugoslav leadership to respect the
Kosovo peace deal.
	   ``It is now a calmer situation but unfortunately still not
without incident,'' the official said. ``We expect a lot more
between now and the deadline.''
	   The NATO alliance maintained too many units remained in the
field, especially special police forces. Under the agreement,
Milosevic is supposed to reduce his forces in Kosovo to the levels
they were at before the crackdown against ethnic Albanian rebels
started in February.

Belarusian leader says bringing back USSR will end economic crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The restoration of the Soviet Union is the only
way to end the political and economic turmoil in its former
republics, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said Friday.
	   ``I am certain that reunification will occur sooner or later,
now or when our grandchildren grow up,'' Lukashenko said during a
visit to Russia's coal-mining Kemerovo region of Siberia.
	   Lukashenko has long advocated the revival of the Soviet Union,
which collapsed in 1991. He has done little in his country to
disband the Soviet command economy or to promote human rights and
democracy.
	   Belarus and Russia have signed a union treaty for closer
economic, military and other cooperation, but it stops well short
of reintegrating the two neighbors as a single state.
	   Lukashenko also said Friday that Russian President Boris Yeltsin
was keeping a low profile so as not to interfere in his
government's efforts to overcome an economic crisis.
	   Doctors have said Yeltsin, 67, had a respiratory infection that
forced him to spend much of the last two week at his country
residences outside Moscow.
	   ``Yeltsin is not interfering with the work of the new
government,'' Lukashenko said, according to the Interfax news
agency. ``Let the new, good, normal government work.''
	   He urged Russian politicians to ``stop toying with the idea of
Yeltsin's resignation.''
	   Yeltsin has said repeatedly that he will serve out the remaining
two years of his term, but will not seek re-relection in 2000.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Echoing Western claims, Kosovo's
main ethnic Albanian leader said Friday that Yugoslavia has not
removed its troops from the province and that little progress has
been made to defuse the crisis.
	   With NATO's latest deadline for compliance only four days away,
the Alliance decided Friday to send its supreme commander Gen.
Wesley Clark and German General Klaus Naumann to Belgrade this
weekend to insist that Yugoslavia speed the troop drawdown in
Kosovo.
	   ``We have seen great progress but we are still far from adequate
compliance,'' a NATO official told reporters in Brussels, Belgium,
on condition of anonymity.
	   Fighting has all but ceased in the southern Serbian province,
but tension remains high here despite the agreement reached Oct. 12
between Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke to avert NATO
airstrikes.
	   Diplomatic observers reported hearing heavy tank fire Thursday
in the Drenica region southwest of Pristina. The U.N. refugee
agency said Friday that only a ``trickle'' of refugees are
returning to their homes because of fear and intimidation by Serb
police.
	   ``The impression our staff got on the ground is while some
people trickle back to their ruined homes, widespread destruction
of housing and fear of the continued Serb military and police
presence prevent significant return,'' U.N. spokesman Kris Janowski
said in Geneva, Switzerland.
	   More than 10 days after Holbrooke and Milosevic reached the
agreement, ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova told reporters
``the Serbian forces have not yet withdrawn from Kosovo,'' despite
Yugoslav claims to the contrary.
	   ``We cannot say any progress was made and NATO should maintain
its 'activation order' and keep pressing the Belgrade government,''
Rugova said.
	   Yugoslavia insists it has met NATO demands to withdraw troops to
the levels they were at before Milosevic began his crackdown in
February to suppress an ethnic Albanian revolt in Kosovo.
	   U.S. and other Western diplomats dispute this, however, warning
that continuing violence threatens the Serbian province's peace
process and raises the threat of NATO airstrikes. NATO has extended
the deadline until Tuesday for Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic to comply.
	   Hundreds have been killed and hundreds of thousands driven from
their homes by the violence. The majority of Kosovo's 2 million
inhabitants are ethnic Albanians, and most favor independence.
	   Laura Boldrini of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said
ethnic Albanians who returned two weeks ago to the village of
Poklek fled again this week because of intimidation by Serb police.
	   ``It's a never-ending story,'' Boldrini said.
	   But the Serb regional governor, Veljko Odalovic, accused ethnic
Albanian rebels of provoking government troops by attacking police.
Odalovic said that since Oct. 12, five policemen had been killed,
12 wounded and two Serbian journalists kidnapped by the rebels.
	   ``It's clear the terrorsts want to provoke new conflicts and to
involve large numbers of police and army where they can, and the
international community knows that,'' he said.
	   In efforts to reinforce the Oct. 12 accord, American diplomat
William Walker arrived in the Yugoslav capital Belgrade late
Thursday to oversee the establishment of a 2,000-member mission to
make sure Milosevic honors the agreement.
	   Walker will head the mission under the direction of the
Vienna-based Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
	   State-controlled media said Yugoslavia's foreign minister,
Zivadin Jovanovic, assured Walker the government will stick by the
deal. Walker met Milosevic on Friday morning and was to leave for
the Kosovo capital Pristina to meet Rugova.
	   Milosevic also agreed to talks with ethnic Albanians on the
future of the province, which is part of Yugoslavia's largest
republic, Serbia.
	   The rebel Kosovo Liberation Army has insisted it will not
abandon its goal of independence. The United States and the
Europeans reject independence but support some form of autonomy for
Kosovo.
	   At U.N. headquarters in New York, the U.N. Security Council is
working on a resolution endorsing the Kosovo peace deal.

	   He was apprehended by U.S. authorities as he pounded on the
gates of the Israeli Embassy in Washington in the mid-1980s. Since
then, Pollard has said that Israel has not done enough to win his
release.
	   Pollard was sentenced to life in prison for treason and
espionage in 1987. U.S. presidents have denied several requests to
pardon him.
	   Previous Israeli governments tried to distance themselves from
the American Jewish naval intelligence officer who was convicted of
passing large amounts of sensitive information to Israel.
	   It emerged later that he was recruited to spy for Israel by a
shadowy Israeli intelligence-gathering body in the United States.
Until recently, Israeli governments disavowed Pollard, and called
his espionage a ``rogue operation.''
	   However, the Netanyahu government granted Pollard Israeli
citizenship and acknowledged him as an Israeli agent. Many Israeli
officials, including Cabinet ministers, have visited him in prison
in Butner, North Carolina.

Father gasses self and children after custody dispute in Australia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PERTH, Australia (AP) _ A man drove his three young children to
a remote field in Western Australia state and gassed them and
himself to death after a custody dispute with his wife, police said
Friday.
	   The bodies of Ronald Jonker, 32, and his children David, 7,
Aaron, 5, and Ashlee, 17 months, were found in his car late
Thursday about 55 miles (90 kilometers) north of Perth, the state
capital.
	   Jonker was angry with a Family Court decision that awarded his
wife principal custody of the children, reducing the amount of time
he would be able to spend with them, said Inspector Geoff Maloney.
	   Maloney said police began looking for Jonker on Wednesday, after
Jonker's estranged wife Elise received letter from him saying
good-bye and telling her he was going to take the kids with him.
	   Jonker, a lawn mowing contractor, had arranged to meet his wife
at Gin Gin, north of Perth, on Wednesday evening. However, police
went to the meeting destination instead.
	   Police sighted Jonker's car and chased him for a short distance,
giving up because of fears about the children's safety.
	   Maloney on Friday defended the decision to stop the car chase.
	   ``That was a decision made by that sergeant and I'm certainly
not going to be critical of that decision that he made on that
evening ... I back his decision to the full,'' he said.
	   An air force plane then joined the search for the car and
spotted the vehicle Thursday evening parked by a country road.
Police reached the car about within two hours and found everyone
inside dead.
	   ``Everybody was found in a sleeping position,'' Maloney said.
	   A coroner will investigate the deaths, which police are treating
as murder-suicide.

Thousands defy police ban and hold reform rally

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with joint press statement from 18 non-governmental

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Thousands of anti-government
demonstrators braved the threat of arrest Friday to gather at the
national mosque for a rally demanding political reforms.
	   Protesters waved their fists and shouted ``Reform!'', while
passing cars honked in rhythm with the opposition rally cry.
	   Hundreds hopped on motorcycles, their helmets over their white
caps donned for Friday afternoon prayers, and headed toward
Parliament, where Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad was unveiling the
1999 budget.
	   But they never made it. Dozens of riot police moved in and
dispersed the crowd with water cannon.
	   Police had warned those who joined the anti-government march
could face arrest under the Internal Security Act, which allows
indefinite detainment without trial.
	   The demonstrators are supporters of jailed dissident Anwar
Ibrahim, ousted as deputy prime minister and finance minister on
Sept. 2.
	   Police have declared illegal all demonstrations in support of
Anwar, who is awaiting trial on charges of graft and sexual
misconduct. So far, authorities have detained 262 people who have
attended anti-government rallies, releasing them on bail pending
trial.
	   City police chief Kamaruddin Ali said that no one had applied
for permit to hold Friday's demonstration, as required by law in
this Southeast Asian country.
	   ``We charged ... people on Wednesday for illegal assembly and
will not hesitate to do the same again,'' Kamaruddin was quoted as
saying in Friday editions of The Star.
	   Meanwhile, 18 non-governmental groups issued a joint statement
Friday condemning police of ``flagrant abuse of power'' by using
batons and canes to injure bystanders and onlookers.
	   ``We demand that the police cease all harassment of loyal
Malaysians who are increasingly aware of their rights and are
committed to non-violent social and political changes,'' the
statement said.
	   On Wednesday, a local court ordered the trial of 127 people who
were arrested for participating in a demonstration that demanded
Mahathir's resignation.
	   Since Anwar's arrest last month, tens of thousands of Malaysians
have gathered regularly in the capital and other cities to demand
justice for the jailed politician.
	   Anwar, who showed up at his first court appearance bruised and
beaten, faces trial Nov. 2 on 10 counts of corruption and illegal
homosexual acts. He has condemned the charges as false and
politically motivated.
	   The political scandal and apparent police brutality against
Anwar have soured political relations with other nations. The
presidents of Indonesia and the Philippines have expressed sympathy
with the dissident.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton won't meet with Mahathir during the
APEC summit because of U.S. concerns over the handling of Anwar,
administration sources said Thursday.
	   The U.S. House International Affairs Committee released a letter
Thursday to Clinton from committee Chairman Benjamin Gilman and
Rep. Doug Bereuter urging the president to speak ``forcefully'
about human rights in Malaysia.
	   Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi called the
comments by the congressmen arrogant.
	   ``They should realize that they are the ones who are being
highly offensive towards Malaysia,'' he said.

Ford threatens to scale down operations in the Philippines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Ford Motor Co. said Friday it may
scale down its planned operations in the Philippines if the U.S.
auto maker does not receive duty-free import privileges.
	   In a statement, Terry Emrick, president of Ford Motor Co.
Philippines, said the company has not yet made any changes to its
proposed investments.
	   ``If, however, the capital equipment that it proposes to import
continues to be subjected to tariff, that could result in changes
to the scope of the investment,'' Emrick said. ``But nothing
definite has been concluded at this stage.''
	   Manila newspapers said the company plans to bring in dlrs 50
million of capital equipment as part of its dlrs 333 million
investment in the Philippines over 10 years.
	   They quoted Curtis Magleby, Ford's regional director, as saying
the company is paying as much as 20 percent in tariffs for capital
goods in the Philippines that are duty-free in other countries.
	   ``If we cannot be competitive, can we continue to put in more
investments?'' Curtis was quoted saying. ``We're not holding the
government hostage, but we try to move the government to a policy
that moves industry in general.''
	   As an investor brought in by the Philippine Export Processing
Zone Authority, Ford was given a six-year holiday on all income
taxes early this year.
	   After the sixth year, it will be exempted from all national and
local income taxes in exchange for a 5 percent tax on its gross
income and tax deductions on personnel training.
	   Other foreign car companies in the Philippines have protested
Ford's favorable tax treatment.
	   Ford's car assembly plant in Laguna province south of Manila, to
be operational by September 1999, will assemble cars, pick up
trucks and vans for the Philippine market. It also will produce car
parts for export.
	   Rep. Joey Sarte Salceda, an economist and financial analyst,
criticized Ford's statement, saying the company will lose ``a lot
of goodwill'' from the Philippine Congress.
	   ``In a period of fiscal consolidation, Congress is definitely
not in the mood to grant incentives that can puncture new leakages
in the government's weak revenue structure,'' he said.

 &UR; Anti-smoking bill clears key hurdle in South Africa &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ A drastic anti-smoking bill
cleared a key legislative hurdle in Parliament on Friday, paving
the way for clamp downs on advertising and tobacco use at work and
public places.
	   A health committee approved the bill that has been fiercely
opposed by the tobacco industry, media and advertising groups and
some unions.
	   The planned law, one of the toughest in the world, bans all
tobacco advertising.
	   It outlaws smoking in public and the workplace, but provides
exemptions where well ventilated and separate facilities are
created for workers desperate for a puff.
	   Bars and restaurants with designated smoking areas also would
escape the ban, said committee member Ruth Rabinowitz.
	   A lawmaker with the minority Zulu nationalist Inkatha Freedom
Party, Rabinowitz said she abstained from voting because her party
had not taken a position on the bill.
	   But she said she personally considers the bill too extreme.
	   ``Its intentions are good, but it is not good law making,'' she
said ``Some of it is far too draconian.''
	   Opposition lawmakers oppose the bill, but the ruling African
National Congress' overwhelming majority guarantees passage of its
bills through all committees.
	   Tobacco industry groups and their supporters are likely to mount
a constitutional challenge to the law, which is expected to be
passed by full Parliament early next month.
	   The panel approved minor amendments to lighten the bill, such as
granting permission for tobacco logos to be displayed on clothing.
	   But it tightened other areas, banning all advertising from
showing tobacco use, even if the product is not tobacco related.
	   The top fine for smoking at work or in public places would be
200 rand (dlrs 35). Advertising violations could generate fines of
up to 200,000 rand (dlrs 35,000).

Croatia likely won't accept extradition of former Nazi guard
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ The Zagreb government is unlikely to
accept Ferdinand hammer, a former Nazi concentration camp guard the
United States is planning to deport to Croatia, the Croatian
ambassador to the United States said Friday.
	   The ambassador, Miomir Zuzul, said Croatian law forbids
extradition of non-Croatian citizens to the former Yugoslav
republic.
	   Zuzul, talking in Washington D.C. to Mark Richards, an assistant
to a U.S. state prosecutor, also said that it was ``questionable''
whether Hammer, who has a German-sounding name, was indeed of
Croatian origin.
	   On Thursday, the U.S. Board of Immigration Appeals upheld an
order to deport 77-year-old Hammer, a retired foundry supervisor,
for covering up his past as a guard at Nazi concentration camps
during World War II.
	   The order said Hammer, of Sterling Heights, Michigan, was to be
deported to Croatia, his native land. He was stripped of his
naturalized U.S. citizenship for concealing his Nazi past when
applying for it in 1963.
	   Hammer's lawyer said he would appeal the ruling.
	   Hammer has admitted he was a member of the World War II German
army's Waffen-SS, but denied being part of an SS battalion that
served at concentration camps.
	   But the U.S. Office of Special Investigations, which hunts Nazi
war criminals residing in the United States, charged that Hammer,
as an armed SS guard, participated in the persecution of unarmed
civilians at Auschwitz and another concentration camp in Poland. He
also is charged with serving as an armed guard on inhumane
transports of inmates between Nazi camps.
	   Zuzul said that Croatia was ``surprised and discontent'' with
the U.S. decision to deport Hammer to Croatia.
	   ``Croatia likely won't accept Hammer's deportation,'' he said,
according to the Croatian state-run HINA news agency.
	   Judicial officials in Zagreb have not commented on the case to
date.
	   Croatia is already preparing a trial of a World War II suspect:
76-year-old Croat Dinko Sakic, who ran the country's notorious
concentration camp of Jasenovac, is currently in Zagreb's prison
awaiting a trial on war crimes charges.
	   Tens of thousands of Serbs, Jews, Gypsies and Croat insurgents
perished in Jasenovac.
	   Sakic was extradited from Argentina in June. His wife Nada, also
charged with war crimes, is to be extradited by Nov. 7.
	   Zuzul and Richards agreed that a group of Croatian judges, who
are working on the Sakic case, will travel to the United States to
learn more about how that country's judical system deals with such
cases.

Iberia warns it may cancel Airbus order
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The Spanish airline Iberia has told its
pilots that if a salary agreement is not reached this month it will
have to cancel an order to buy 11 jetliners from Airbus Industrie,
the European manufacturing consortium.
	   The Spanish carrier announced in September it would buy 11
Airbus long-range aircraft to replace its DC-10s, an agreement
worth some dlrs l.39 billion. The planes would be used mainly on
its routes to Latin America.
	   Airbus is the main competitor for U.S.-based Boeing Co., the
world leader in airplane manufacturing. Boeing has acquired
McDonnell Douglas, the builders of the DC-10.
	   Iberia chief executive Xabier de Irala sent a letter to the
pilots about its plans, company spokesman Felix Ortega said Friday.
The SEPLA pilots union and Iberia broke off 18 months of
negotiations in September when Iberia rejected union demands for an
18 percent salary increase.
	   The union claims that Iberia has refused to reach agreement with
the pilots during negotiations to work out a deal giving American
Airlines and British Airways a stake in the state-owned carrier.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A last-minute argument over the release of
Israeli spy Jonathan Pollard is holding up the signing of a new
Mideast peace agreement, Israel radio said Friday.
	   The radio, citing a senior Israeli official, said the United
States had promised to release Pollard as part of an
Israeli-Palestinian land-for-security deal that was negotiated over
nine days at Wye Plantation in Maryland.
	   However, the United States withdrew the promise at the last
minute and Netanyahu decided not to attend a White House signing
ceremony that had been tentatively scheduled for noon EST (1600

Judge gives man four years for punching soccer fan to death
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A judge sentenced a man to four years in jail
Friday for killing a soccer fan when he punched him in an incident
seven months ago at a second division English game.
	   Barry Andrew Cullen, 31, was sentenced at the Royal Courts of
Justice in London for killing Matthew Fox, 24, at the
Gillingham-Fulham March 28 in southern England.
	   Cullen had pleaded guilty to manslaughter charges at a hearing
in July.
	   ``The sort of scenes this court saw on video of the events at
and after the Gillingham vs. Fulham match... are sadly only too
familiar in a sport that is cursed by the gratuitous violence,''
Judge David Herbert Penry-Davey said in issuing the sentence.
	   ``It is said on your behalf that you are no football hooligan,''
the judge went on.
	   ``Even if it is right, which I accept... instead of moving away
and having nothing to do with it you ran towards it and joined in
with a will for no good reason and the young man, who tragically
died at your hands, had not acted aggressively towards you or
threatened you in any way.''

	   There was no immediate U.S. comment.
	   Israel radio had said earlier Friday that Pollard's release was
negotiated by Netanyahu and U.S. President Bill Clinton during the
Wye summit.
	   The release of Pollard has been a frequent demand raised in
right-wing circles in Israel, and Netanyahu would be able to blunt
some of the opposition to a West Bank pullback by getting Pollard
out of prison and bringing him to Israel.

citizenship.

American Jewish naval intelligence officer who was convicted of
passing large amounts of sensitive information to Israel.

gates of the Israeli Embassy in Washington in the mid-1980s. Since
then, Pollard has been charging that Israel has not done enough to
win his release.
	   Pollard was sentenced to life in prison for treason and
espionage. Several requests to grant him a pardon have been denied
by American presidents.

Last-minute argument over Pollard holding up agreement

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A last-minute argument over the release of
Israeli spy Jonathan Pollard is holding up the White House signing
of a new Mideast peace agreement, Israel radio said Friday.
	   The radio, citing a senior Israeli official, said the United
States had promised to release Pollard as part of an
Israeli-Palestinian land-for-security deal that was negotiated over
nine days at Wye Plantation in Maryland.
	   However, the United States withdrew the promise at the last
minute and Netanyahu decided not to attend a White House signing
ceremony that had been tentatively scheduled for noon EST (1600
gmt) Friday, the radio said.
	   There was no immediate U.S. comment.
	   The release of Pollard has been a frequent demand raised in
right-wing circles in Israel, and Netanyahu would be able to blunt
some of the opposition to a West Bank pullback by getting Pollard

Finnish government wins confidence vote in banking scandal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ The five-party coalition government on
Friday overwhelmingly won a vote of confidence in Parliament over
the handling of a bank affair, for the second time within a year.
	   Lawmakers approved by a 130-53 vote Prime Minister Paavo
Lipponen's handling of the case, in which one minister resigned
last year. Seventeen lawmakers in the 200-member Parliament
abstained or were absent.
	   The main opposition Center Party called a motion of
no-confidence on Wednesday saying it believed Lipponen and a former
taxation minister had misled lawmakers in the affair.
	   Last year, Taxation Minister Arja Alho was forced to resign
after she revealed that she had lowered a 9-million-markkaa (dlrs
1.83 million) fine imposed by the Supreme Court on bank manager Ulf
Sundqvist for negligence in granting loans.
	   Opposition members accused Alho of giving preferential treatment
to Sundqvist, a fellow party member and former chairman of the
Social Democratic Party, now led by Lipponen.
	   Alho said she had consulted Lipponen in the matter and
maintained she acted legally, but opposition members and pressure
from within her own party forced her to step down.
	   Recently, Finnish media reported that according to taped
conversations acquired by them, Alho said that Lipponen had not
been speaking the truth when he told lawmakers he was not behind
Sundqvist's fine reduction.
	   Lipponen maintained that he didn't lie, but told lawmakers on
Thursday that the Sundqvist deal might be reviewed.
	   With less than six months to national elections, it is likely
that the ``Sundqvist affair'' _ as it is known in the Finnish media
_ will cost the Social democrats some political points, Lipponen in
particular.
	   In October 1997, the opposition failed to gain support for a
similar vote of no confidence when lawmakers approved _ by 136 to
57 _ Lipponen's handling of the Sundqvist case.
	   It was the ninth vote of confidence won by the five-party
``rainbow'' coalition which includes the Social Democrats,
Conservatives, Left-Wing Alliance, the Swedish People's Party and
the Greens. They control 145 seats in Parliament.

Interior minister, coma and heart attack victim, leaves hospital
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement,
who spent a week in a coma due to an allergic reaction to
anesthesia, left the Val de Grace military hospital on Friday, more
than six weeks after entering.
	   Chevenement's heart had stopped after he was administered
curare, a muscle relaxant known to cause allergic reactions in some
patients, just ahead of planned gall bladder surgery on Sept. 2.
	   The French press had painted a grim picture of the chances of
full recovery for the 59-year-old Chevenement. On Friday, the
left-leaning newspaper Liberation called his recovery ``a
miracle.''
	   It had been reported Chevenement would leave the hospital this
week.
	   A one-line statement from the hospital confirmed Chevenement
left Friday to begin a two-month period of convalescence.
	   Chevenement, a key figure in Socialist Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin's Cabinet, is expected to return to his post by the start of
next year.
	   In his first interview since the accident, published earlier
this week in Paris Match, Chevenement quashed lingering questions
about how the prestigious team of military doctors at Val de Grace
could have administered curare without knowing in advance that he
would prove allergic.
	   ``What happened to me ... was as unpredictable as an auto
accident,'' Chevenement told Paris Match magazine in his first
interview since the Sept. 2 operation.
	   ``Certain people are susceptible to (allergic) reactions,
generally less violent than mine, but just as unforeseeable,'' he
said.
	   Chevenement spent weeks on a respirator and dialysis. Terse
medical statements gave the impression his recovery was in doubt.
	   Instead, the minister entered a period of steady recovery. He
told Paris match that he had re-read ``War and Peace'' and ``Don
Quixote,'' and walked in the hospital garden.
	   Chevenement has held several ministry portfolios, including
industry, education and defense. He resigned as defense minister in
1991 to protest France's involvement in the Gulf War.
	   As interior minister, he is responsible for the nation's police
and security forces. Jean-Jack Queyranne, minister in charge of
overseas territories, is holding Chevenement's post during the
minister's absence.

Clubs give favorable response to UEFA reforms
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Plans by European soccer's governing body UEFA to
reform its club competitions in a bid to fend off a rival proposed
Super League got the backing of 12 of Europe's top clubs Friday.
	   Representatives from AC Milan, Real Madrid and other major clubs
said at a meeting with UEFA that its proposals for modifying the
European Champions League are acceptable.
	   They also appeared to distance themselves from the breakaway
Super League proposed by private Italian sports management company
Media Partners, saying the project is now ``lying dormant.''
	   ``UEFA has come up with practical proposals and I think we can
say the meeting has historical importance,'' Adriano Galliani, the
vice president of AC Milan, told a news conference after the
meeting.
	   At a meeting in Lisbon, Portugal earlier this month, UEFA
revealed plans to extend next season's European Champions' League
to include 32 clubs playing in eight groups of four teams in the
first stage. The competition currently comprises 24 teams.
	   The new format will include more teams from Europe's top-ranking
soccer nations while also incorporating more teams from smaller
nations, broadening the potential television audience for games.
	   The UEFA Cup and Cup Winners Cup will be merged into one
competition, called the UEFA Cup. Details still have to be worked
out.
	   The proposed reforms are part of UEFA's bid to dissuade Europe's
top clubs from defecting to Media Partners' Super League.
	   The Milan-based firm is enticing the continent's top clubs with
a payout of some dlrs 1.2 billion for participation in its Super
League _ far more than the dlrs 322 million generated by the
Champions League in 1997-98, of which only dlrs 157 million went to
the clubs.
	   Some clubs had feared Media Partners' plan would make the rich
clubs richer and the poor clubs poorer.
	   Galliani said the 12 clubs were ready to accept in principle
UEFA's Champions League proposals.
	   He said the Media Partners proposal had been of considerable
interest to the clubs, but said they currently don't have contact
with the firm and the project is at the moment ``lying dormant.''
	   President of Real Madrid, Lorenzo Sanz, told reporters the 12
clubs at the meeting are ready to cooperate with UEFA not just in
their own interests but for the whole of European soccer.
	   He said the clubs had been surprised by UEFA's ``good footwork''
and congratulated the body for the ``excellent headway'' it had
made in drawing up the reforms.
	   ``The situation is quite good and I am sure there will be good
cooperation in the future,'' he said.
	   Clubs represented at the meeting also included Bayern Munich of
Germany, FC Barcelona of Spain, AFC Ajax of Holland, Borussia
Dortmund of Germany, Internazionale and Juventus of Italy,
Manchester United and Liverpool from England, FC Porto of Portugal
and Olympique Marseille of France.
	   UEFA representatives included UEFA Senior Vice President Antonio
Matarrese and Gerhard Aigner, UEFA general secretary.

Mahathir brushes off Clinton's decision to skip courtesy call
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's prime minister on
Friday brushed off U.S. President Bill Clinton's decision not to
pay a courtesy call on him during a regional trade meeting in Kuala
Lumpur next month.
	   Clinton is scheduled to visit Malaysia next month for a meeting
of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum.
	   But U.S. officials said Clinton will not pay the usual courtesy
visit on the head of the host country because of U.S. concerns over
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's ordered jailing of dissident
Anwar Ibrahim.
	   ``I did not ask for it,'' Mahathir said of the courtesy call.
``I must emphasize that APEC is all about economic cooperation. It
has nothing to do with political issues.''
	   Several countries have expressed support for Anwar since he was
arrested on charges of corruption and illegal homosexual acts and
later appeared in court with a black-eye and other injuries.
	   The U.S. House International Affairs Committee released a letter
Thursday to Clinton from committee Chairman Benjamin Gilman and
Rep. Doug Bereuter urging the president to speak ``forcefully'
about human rights in Malaysia.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel radio said Friday that Jonathan Pollard,
who is serving a life sentence for spying for Israel, would be
released from a U.S. prison.
	   There was no immediate comment from U.S. officials.
	   Pollard's release was negotiated by Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu during the Mideast summit at Wye Plantation that was
hosted by U.S. President Bill Clinton, Israel Radio said.
	   The release of Pollard has been a frequent demand raised in
right-wing circles in Israel, and Netanyahu might be able to blunt
some of the opposition to a West Bank pullback by getting Pollard
out of prison and bringing him to Israel.
	   He was apprehended by U.S. authorities as he pounded on the
gates of the Israeli Embassy in Washington in the mid-1980s. Since
then, Pollard has said that Israel has not done enough to win his
release.
	   Pollard was sentenced to life in prison for treason and
espionage in 1987. U.S. presidents have denied several requests to
pardon him.
	   Previous Israeli governments tried to distance themselves from
the American Jewish naval intelligence officer who was convicted of
passing large amounts of sensitive information to Israel.
	   It emerged later that he was recruited to spy for Israel by a
shadowy Israeli intelligence-gathering body in the United States.
Until recently, Israeli governments disavowed Pollard, and called
his espionage a ``rogue operation.''
	   However, the Netanyahu government granted Pollard Israeli
citizenship and acknowledged him as an Israeli agent.

Singapore Jehovah's Witness teacher loses case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ A High Court judge has ruled that the
constitutional rights of a Jehovah's Witness were not violated when
he was fired from his teaching job for refusing to sing the
national anthem or recite the national pledge.
	   ``This is one case where the interest of the state in the
education system must prevail over those of the individual,'' Judge
Tan Lee Meng said in his ruling, made available Friday.
	   He ruled that Peter Nappalli, who was fired in 1994 after 10
years as a teacher at a technical school, should have known before
he sought the job that it required practices that Jehovah's
Witnesses find objectionable.
	   Nappalli, 37, who sued the Institute of Technical Education in
1995, seeking reinstatement and back pay, argued that no law in
Singapore requires any citizen to sing the anthem or recite the
pledge.
	   He said the the school violated the constitution by imposing
such regulations and deprived him of his rights by giving him the
choice of keeping his job or breaking the tenets of his religion.
	   The case was heard in early August.
	   Judge Tan, in a ruling completed Thursday, said no compulsion
was involved, because Nappalli voluntarily sought the teaching job.
	   Nappalli, or anyone who has attended school in Singapore, knows
that the pledge and the anthem are requirements, the ruling said.
	   The judge also said Nappalli had not been ``forthright'' in
filling out his application because he did not state that he was a
Jehovah's Witness and withheld the fact that he had served three
years in a prison camp for refusing to serve in the armed services
because of his religion.
	   Judge Tan said that the school had the right to require teachers
to participate in the ceremonies, as part of its duty to promote
patriotism among students.
	   He quoted a 1994 case in which Singapore's Chief Justice Yong
Pung How said, the ``sovereignty, integrity and unity of Singapore
are undoubtedly the paramount mandate of the constitution and
anything, including religious beliefs and practices which tend to
run counter to these objectives, must be restrained. ''
	   Despite a constitutional guarantee of freedom for individuals to
profess, practice and propagate their faith, laws in Singapore
restrict those rights. For example, the Jehovah's Witness
denomination has been banned since 1972 from meeting as a group and
owning land for a sanctuary. Individuals have been prosecuted under
criminal law for possessing the Jehovah's Witness version of the
Bible.
	   Jehovah's Witnesses estimate there are 1,400 to 1,600 adherents
in Singapore, while government estimates have ranged up to 2,000.

Iranians vote in key assembly election amid fears of low turnout

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iranians voted Friday to elect a key
assembly expected to be dominated by hard-line clergymen who favor
unhindered powers for Iran's supreme leader.
	   The state-controlled media reported an ``unprecedented and
unique'' turnout but gave no figures. However, Associated Press
reporters found many polling stations empty and others with few
voters.
	   Friday's election is for the 86-seat Assembly of Experts, whose
job is to oversee the work of the supreme leader, a post currently
held by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
	   In practice, the supreme leader has the final say in all matters
_ and hard-line clergymen want to keep it that way. But moderate
clerics led by President Mohammad Khatami are calling for a more
accountable leader in a political tug-of-war that has gripped Iran
since his election last year.
	   ``We want to have a say in our destiny,'' said Farhad Qaemaqami,
who waited with about 30 others to vote at a mosque in the upscale
Fereshteh neighborhood. ``I will vote for somebody who will have
some kind of influence over the (supreme) leader.''
	   But Khatami's camp appeared to have lost this battle even before
the polls: a conservative supervisory council that vetted a list of
396 prospective candidates approved 161 contestants, only about 30
of them moderates.
	   Khatami, who was among the early voters, pointed that out to
reporters after casting his ballot in the Husseinieh Jamaran
meeting hall attached to a mosque in northern Tehran.
	   ``Definitely, there could have been more qualified people than
were allowed, but nonetheless we still have a chance to choose our
favored candidates,'' said Khatami, who drove to the polling booth
dressed in the clergy's black robe and turban.
	   He shook hands and chatted with election officials before
sitting in front of a white ballot box to pick a 16-man panel for
the Tehran district from a list of 32 candidates.
	   Tehran radio said people queued in long lines to vote and
authorities expect to run out of ballot papers. ``People voted for
Islam,'' the radio said. ``People's participation is unprecedented
and unique.''
	   In Bojnourd and Astaneh Ashrafiyeh cities in the north, people
braved heavy rains and strong winds to stand in long lines at
polling stations, the official Islamic Republic News Agency said.
	   The upbeat reports contrasted with predictions of low voter
turnout from a disappointed public that had little to choose from,
unlike in the 1997 presidential polls when 20 million people voted
for the reformist Khatami.
	   A hard-line newspapers had said only about 39 percent of the 38
million eligible voters are expected to show up for Friday's vote.
	   ``They are all liars. I am powerless to do anything against them
so it's best to keep quiet,'' said Siavaash Mohseni, 24, a
university student who said he didn't vote. ``They have already
selected the people they want to put in the assembly.''
	   A low turnout would likely be seen as a rebuff of the hard-line
policies of Khamenei, who succeeded the late Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, the leader of the 1979 Islamic Revolution that installed
the rule of Shiite clergy in Iran.
	   Khatami's popular efforts to ease the revolution's social,
political and media restrictions are opposed bitterly by
hard-liners loathe to give up control over Iran's judiciary,
security agencies and other key institutions.
	   Voting in the 33,312 polling stations in the country's 28
provinces is scheduled to close at 6 p.m. (1430 GMT). First
official results are not expected until Saturday.

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Parliament's lower house passed a
resolution Friday that backs plans to build a Roman Catholic church
honoring Poland's democratic tradition, a project first envisioned
more than 200 years ago.
	   Roman Catholic leaders recently have appealed to parliament to
revive plans for the sanctuary long delayed by history: Poland's
partition, World War II, a communist regime. Polish-born Pope John
Paul II, credited for inspiring Poland's return to democracy after
more than 40 years of communism, is expected to dedicate the church
during his visit next summer.
	   ``The Holy Providence Church will be a symbol of the nation's
gratitude for regaining freedom in 1989, for Pope John Paul II's 20
years as pontiff, and for 2,000 years of Christianity,'' said the
resolution supported by 243 center and right-wing deputies.
	   Some 20 leftist, arguing that parliament should not be involved
in religious matters, voted against, while 72 others abstained.
	   Poland's last king, Stanislaw August Poniatowski, laid the
cornerstone for the original church intended to dedicate Poland's
first democratic constitution, enacted May 3, 1791. It was the
first drafted in the tradition of the U.S. constitution.
	   The project was halted when Poland was partitioned in 1795 by
Austria, Russia and Prussia. After regaining independence following
World War I, Poland's parliament renewed the pledge, but the
project was never carried out.
	   Parliament's upper house, the Senate, revived the plans in 1991,
two years after Poland again adopted democracy following four
decades of communism. The Senate approved the plans in June.
	   A small monument stands at the site where the church originally
was to be built, now in the Botanical Gardens. The new church,
based on modern plans, will be locate in the southern residential
suburb of Wilanow and funded by private donations in this
predominantly Catholic nation.
	   Poland's 1,000-year-old Catholic church is credited with
preserving the national culture during long periods of occupation
and lending its authority to help the Solidarity trade union,
overthrow the communist system.
	   However, after 1989, when church leaders pushed through an
abortion ban and introduced religion classes in schools, more and
more people argue that the church should stay away from public
affairs.

Jewish settlers threaten to shut down West Bank, topple Netanyahu
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with settlers threatening to shut down West
Bank and bring down Netanyahu government, opposition saying it will
provide safety net to Netanyahu throughout withdrawal period &QL; 
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Jewish settlers said Friday they will shut down
the West Bank with street protests and try to topple Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu over the land-for-security agreement he
negotiated with the Palestinians.
	   However, Israel's dovish opposition pledged to back Netanyahu on
the peace accord and make sure he is not brought down by parliament
during the 12 weeks Israel has been allotted to withdraw troops
from 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   Islamic militants, meanwhile, dismissed the deal reached during
a nine-day Mideast summit at Wye Plantation in Maryland as a
sellout and said they would continue plotting attacks in Israel.
	   Jewish settlers said Netanyahu had broken his promises to his
right-wing constituents. Jewish settler leader Aharon Domb said the
prime minister had negotiated to an ``agreement of surrender.''
	   However, the news of the agreement came just several hours
before the start of the Jewish Sabbath at sundown Friday and
settler leaders had little time to organize their protests.
	   Shlomo Filber, a leader of the Jewish settlement movement, said
that on Sunday, protesters were to block every West Bank junction
to Palestinian traffic. The settlers will also work to bring down
the Netanyahu coalition, Filber said.
	   At least a dozen hardline coalition members have said they would
vote against a peace agreement in parliament, enough to rob the
prime minister of his parliamentary majority.
	   However, the dovish opposition said it would counter those votes
and make sure Netanyahu will remain in power until the troop
withdrawal has been carried out.
	   ``We will give him a safety net for the coming weeks,'' said
Yossi Beilin of the opposition Labor Party, one of the architects
of the 1993 breakthrough agreement between Israel and the
Palestinians.
	   On the Palestinian side, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, the founder of the
Islamic militant group Hamas, said the agreement brought the
Palestinians little. ``Our people are paying more than they are
getting from this agreement,'' Yassin told The Associated Press at
his Gaza City home.
	   As part of the agreement, the CIA would play a stronger role in
the Palestinian Authority's campaign against Islamic militants,
mainly Hamas which has carried out more than a dozen suicide
attacks in Israel.
	   Yassin said a new crackdown could perhaps restrict the
activities of the Hamas military wing temporarily, but would not
prevent attacks against Israelis.
	   ``It cannot erase Hamas,'' said Yassin. ``It is an illusion to
think the agreement will put an end ot our military work.''

Four peacekeepers injured in road accidents in South Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ Three U.N. peacekeeping soldiers from Nepal
were injured Friday when their jeep flipped over in a Lebanese
village. A U.N. ambulance rushing to the site overturned on the
way, injuring the driver, also a Nepalese, officials said
	   The four soldiers from the United Nations Interim Force in
Lebanon, or UNIFIL, were taken to hospital in a second ambulance,
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   The soldiers who suffered light to moderate injuries were in
stable condition, he said. No other details were available.
	   The first accident occurred in the village of Jbal al-Botom,
around 10 kilometers (six miles) southeast of this southern port
city.
	   A total of 222 peacekeepers have been killed since UNIFIL was
deployed in South Lebanon in March 1978 after a brief Israeli
incursion.
	   Nine nations contribute to the 4,500-member UNIFIL force. They
are Finland, Italy, France, Poland, Norway, Ghana, Ireland, Nepal
and Fiji.
	   An Indian contingent is expected to replace the Norwegian troops
within the next few months.

Sampras withdraws from Lyon due to back injury

<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) _ Pete Sampras' hopes of retaining his world
No. 1 spot at the end of the year took a knock Friday when a back
injury forced him to withdraw from the Lyon Grand Prix.
	   Sampras pulled out of the dlrs 750,000 event before he was due
to face Germany's Tommy Haas in a quarterfinal match.
	   On Thursday, Sampras had appeared in top form as he fired 10
aces in a decisive 6-2, 6-4 second-round win over Australia's Todd
Woodbridge.
	   But the three-time winner of the Lyon event started to feel pain
Friday morning, and said he had no choice but to withdraw.
	   ``I felt a pain originally in the first set against Todd Martin
in the first round,'' a dejected Sampras told reporters at a news
conference.
	   ``I continued to play on but I felt it getting worse, and last
night and this morning I had pretty substantial spasms,'' he said.
``It's best to rest and hopefully take care of the problem over the
next few days.''
	   Sampras will fly immediately to Stuttgart, where the Eurocard
Open begins on Monday.
	   Sampras said he was frustrated, after having come back to top
form in recent weeks.
	   ``I have never had back problems like this. It's unfortunate, I
was playing well,'' he said.
	   Sampras currently has 4,327 points on the ATP tour, ahead of
Marcelo Rios with 3,674 and Patrick Rafter with 3,593 points.
	   The Lyon Grand Prix winner gets 200 points.
	   To hold on to the year-end No. 1 spot he's held for the past
five years, ``the next two weeks are very important,'' he said.
	   ``I would have loved to carry on the roll I am on now, but
sometimes you have to listen to your body as much as your mind. But
I am not panicked. I hope to get this thing better by next week.''
	   ``If I played on I might get a serious injury that might
jeopardize the rest of the year and I don't want to do that,''
Sampras said. ``A body isn't meant to play tennis as much as I play
tennis. It's just a matter of getting through.''
	   Sampras has a vertebral injury midway down his back, said
tournament doctor Claude de Roche.
	   ``It is difficult to say whether he will be fit for Stuttgart,''
de Roche told The Associated Press.
	   ``At this time we do not know the gravity of the injury. But a
player doesn't get to be No. 1 for five years by being fragile,''
he said.
	   De Roche added that the very hard surface in Lyon could have
contributed to the injury.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Typhoon Babs headed toward southern
China Friday after battering the central and northern Philippines
with heavy winds and rain that killed at least 82 people, flattened
crops, and drove more than 100,000 people from their homes.
	   The toll was expected to rise as contacts are restored with
remote areas where roads were blocked by landslides and flooding,
and telephone service was knocked out by strong winds.
	   Among the worst-hit areas was the impoverished Bicol region
along the Philippines' eastern coast.
	   At least 53 people were killed in landslides on Catanduanes
island, where Babs first hit land Thursday, Office of Civil Defense
director Renato Arevalo said. Seventeen others died in landslides
in nearby Camarines Sur province, he said.
	   Another 102 people were injured by flying debris in Sorsogon
province, also part of the Bicol region, Arevalo said.
	   More than 100,000 people in the area were forced to flee their
homes, Red Cross officials said. Tens of thousands of others were
stranded as ports were shut and ships forbidden to sail.
	   The fatalities included six drownings, two people hit by falling
trees, two girls buried by landslides in central Iloilo province, a
man who died of shock, and a fireman crushed after his van
overturned on a slippery road, officials said.
	   In Manila, most government offices closed at noon because of the
storm. President Joseph Estrada ordered a forced evacuation of slum
dwellers living near swollen rivers.
	   About 15,700 people were removed from low-lying areas in the
capital, officials said.
	   ``Despite the situation, some people still refuse to leave their
homes to guard their meager property,'' said Jesusa Villanueva,
principal of a school being used as an evacuation center.
	   Some people, cradling chickens and dogs, stood on the roofs of
their flooded homes, a few possessions piled next to them. Others
used tire tubes to float toward safer ground.
	   Hundreds of people living along a seawall near the oceanside
U.S. Embassy were evacuated because of high waves. In suburban
Marikina, about 4,500 people living on the bank of the swollen
Marikina River were also moved to evacuation centers.
	   At least 12 domestic flights and one international flight were
canceled.
	   In northern Nueva Ecija province, more than 50 people crowded
onto the roof of a house in the town of Gapan to escape Babs'
floodwaters. About 88,000 hectares (217,000 acres) of rice were
destroyed in the province, officials said.
	   Babs also pounded areas around the Mount Pinatubo volcano with
heavy rain, unleashing 1.5 meter (5 foot) -high avalanches of
volcanic material from the mountain's slopes. Most of the material
was carried safely away by swollen rivers.
	   Late Friday, the storm was centered over the South China Sea,
140 kilometers (88 miles) west-northwest of Dagupan City in
Pangasinan province, weather officials said. It had sustained winds
of 120 kph (75 mph), with gusts up to 150 kph (94 mph), and was
headed toward southern China.
	   It was second devastating storm in the Philippines in a week.
Last week, Super Typhoon Zeb killed at least 74 people in the
northern Philippines and 43 more in Taiwan and Japan.

Russia plans `space mirror' experiment to light cities from orbit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian space agency is preparing an extravagant
experiment with a space mirror that would illuminate sun-starved
northern cities and act as a ``solar sail,'' officials said on
Friday.
	   The Znamya (Banner) experiment is to be launched next February
and envisages unfolding a space mirror made of a membrane covered
by a metal layer. In theory, the mirror is to work like the moon,
reflecting sunlight onto some northern parts of Russia during the
long nights.
	   The mirror, around 100 feet (30 meters) in diameter, would serve
as a prototype for even larger models that may go up later,
provided the cash-strapped space agency comes up with funds, said
Mission Control spokesman Valery Lyndin.
	   ``Of course, longer-term prospects are unclear, given the
current fund shortage,'' Lyndin said in a telephone interview.
	   According to the plan, the folded membrane is to be attached to
a Progress cargo ship, which is scheduled to blast off for the Mir
space station on Sunday and dock with it on Tuesday.
	   The Progress will unfold the mirror in February, when the cargo
ship will be undocked from the Mir. Usually, it would be discarded.
The station's crew will guide the cargo ship using manual controls
to see how the mirror performs.
	   Lyndin said that the scientists will also study the membrane as
a potential ``solar sail,'' a feature that might allow spaceships
of the distant future to sail through space using solar wind.
	   In February 1993, Russia ran a similar experiment, but the
mirror was barely visible on Earth, Lyndin said. The new Znamya
also would be visible only in good weather and to those who knew
its precise position in orbit. It would resemble a shooting star,
not a large object such as the moon.
	   The mirror had been scheduled to be taken to the orbit earlier,
but the experiment has been delayed due to the fund shortage.
	   The money crunch has also led to the postponement of the new
Progress launch, which had been originally planned for Oct. 15.
	   Along with the mirror, which weighs only about 4 kilograms (less
than nine pounds), the cargo ship will deliver some 2.5 tons of
regular cargo, including fuel, food, water, equipment and other
supplies to the Mir, Lyndin said.
	   Among the equipment is a French-made device to study a stream of
micro-meteorites bombarding Mir's surface.
	   Russian cosmonauts Gennady Padalka and Sergei Avdeyev will go on
a spacewalk tentatively scheduled for Nov. 11 to attach the gauge
to the station's outer surface, Lyndin said.
	   Space officials initially planned to keep the 12-year-old Mir in
orbit through the end of 1999, but the last crew is now expected to
depart next June because of the money shortage.

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ With an eye on dark clouds overhead,
nine test playing nations inaugurate the mini world cup cricket
tournament Saturday, with the powerful South Asian teams hoping the
muggy weather may give them a home advantage for the dlrs 100,000
Wills International Cup.
	   The teams gathering at Dhaka's Bangabandhu national stadium are
Zimbabwe, New Zealand, India, Australia, England, South Africa,
Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. They will probably be seeded
according to their status in world cricket.
	   Sri Lankan captain Arjuna Ranatunga considers his side as one of
the favorites to win.
	   ``No one can predict anything for such a tough tournament, but
India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka are ahead as they are familiar with
the environment and the wickets in the region,'' Ranatunga told
reporters on his arrival in the Bangladesh capital on Thursday.
	   The veteran left-hander, who led his side to victory in the 1996
World Cup, said his team was strong in all departments. ``We are in
an upbeat mood as we defeated England recently in a one-day series
as well as one-off test.''
	   This knockout tournament, the only meet before the World Cup in
England next year, will be significant because the tie-breaker rule
will be introduced in international cricket. Never tested in world
cricket before, the bowl-out formula _ the official name of the
tie-breaker _ will produce clear results in a match where there is
a tie or the minimum number of overs per side have not been bowled.
	   For the tie-breaker, five bowlers from each side will bowl to
break the bails without any batsmen or fielders. Bowling will
continue till the fate of the match is decided, said match refree
Raman Subba Row.
	   Many teams appeared to be confused about the procedure of the
bowl-out. Though they have agreed to play by the rules set by the
International Cricket Council, they feel the bowl-out should have
been tested before being applied in a major international
tournament like this championship.
	   But the all pervasive apprehension in Dhaka is that rains will
ruin the game. It has been raining off and on in the city and the
Bangabandhu stadium has been virtually reduced to a pool of slush.
	   But the city woke to a sunny morning Friday and ground staff
worked feverishly to bring the ground back to its lush green self.
Pitch covers and super soppers to soak water from the outfield have
already arrived from Calcutta in neighboring India.
	   New Zealand and Zimbabwe, who will set the ball rolling Saturday
with a day and night encounter in the floodlit stadium, have
already started warm-up practice with Bangladesh's national team.
But there is lack of international class practice facilities and
teams have to content themselves to fielding practice.
	   New Zealand are favorites for a quarterfinal win against Sri
Lanka, but Zimbabwe, flush with their recent test win against
India, will be no push over. Skipper Alistair Cambell has an
experienced team under him and the Kiwis will have to fight hard to
beat them.
	   The Bangabandhu stadium looks full of runs, and if nature does
not play spoilsport, the locals may see some entertaining batting
on Saturday.
	   The tournament also promises to be a technical marvel for
television viewers. There will be 18 cameras to provide details of
action on the field. This is four more than what World Tel used for
the Independence Cup earlier this year. There will be five
slow-motion cameras as well.

NATO sends 2 top military commanders to Belgrade for Kosovo talks
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - NATO decided on Friday to send two top
military commanders to Belgrade this weekend to warn Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic he has only a few days left to comply
with the Kosovo agreement.
	   NATO's two top military commanders in Europe, U.S. Gen. Wesley
Clark and German General Klaus Naumann, will insist more Yugoslav
special police units return to their barracks and take their heavy
weapons with them, a NATO official said.
	   ``Some units have been withdrawn from Kosovo but they are not
back in their barracks,'' said the NATO official who requested
anonymity.
	   ``We have seen great progress but we are still far from adequate
compliance. It is now a calmer situation but unfortunately still
not without incident. We expect a lot more between now and the
deadline,'' he said.
	   NATO is maintaining the threat of airstrikes against Serbia
until at least next Tuesday in an attempt to make sure Milosevic
abides by a peace agreement reached Oct. 12 between Milosevic and
U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke.
	   ``We still believe Milosevic is able to go faster and do more,''
the official said.
	   NATO stressed much progress had already been made on the ground
in Kosovo, estimating thousands of refugees had been able to return
home. Many of these homes however have been largely destroyed and
have no heat, water or power.
	   The two generals are expected to have talks with Milosevic on
Saturday and be back in Brussels by Sunday to brief the ambassadors
of the 16 NATO nations. The ambassadors will meet Monday to assess
the generals' report.
	   Under the Oct. 12 agreement, Milosevic is supposed to reduce his
forces in Kosovo to the levels they were at before the crackdown
against ethnic Albanian rebels started in February.

Greek warplanes, vessels in Cyprus war games

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Greek warplanes and navy vessels Friday
joined the Cypriot military on the fourth day of joint military
exercises that have underlined the potential for conflict on this
war-divided Mediterranean island.
	   A total of 10,000 Greek Cypriot troops, including 8,000
reservists, tanks and helicopters are taking part in the six-day
war games, which will end Sunday.
	   ``Its an exercise that makes us all proud,'' said President
Glafcos Clerides whose government in the only internationally
recognized administration on the island.
	   The war games are held regularly with Greek forces under the
provisions of a 1993 defense pact between Cyprus and Greece. Four
Greek air force jets and five navy ships are taking part this time.
	   The exercises are aimed at sending a message to Turkey, which
invaded Cyprus in 1974 and occupied the northern third portion. A
breakaway Turkish Cypriot republic in the occupied area _
recognized only by Ankara _ was declared in 1983.
	   Cyprus' Greek and Turkish communities have been living apart
since the 1974 Turkish invasion and repeated efforts by the United
Nations and others to reunite the island have so far failed.
	   In the midst of the war games, Greece and Cyprus accused Turkish
warplanes of violating the Cypriot air space Tuesday and Wednesday.
Turkey denied the charges.
	   Last March, tension rose on the island when Ankara dispatched
warplanes and navy vessels to northern Cyprus in response to the
use by Greek jets for the first time of a controversial air base
near the resort town of Paphos in western Cyprus.
	   In Friday's exercises, Greek navy vessels blasted mock targets
off the waters of the Mediterranean south of the island, while
Greek Cypriot troops used live ammunition and fired
ground-to-ground missiles.
	   Four Greek jets _ two F-16 fighter-jets and two A-7 Corsair
bombers _ later joined the fray, firing at mock ground targets.
	   It was the Greek air force's second day of involvement in the
exercises. The Cypriot authorities are not saying whether the Greek
jets are using the Paphos air base or not.
	   The Paphos facility, which was completed in February, was built
for the use of Greek warplanes since the Greek Cypriots don't have
an air force of their own.

 &UR; Pakistan top batsmen collapse in front of paceman McGrath &QL; 
 &UR; By RIZWAN ALI &QC;

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Paceman Glenn McGrath polished off
Pakistan's top order batting lineup to give Australia an edge on
the second day of the third and final cricket Test Friday.
	   In a fiery 10-over opening spell, McGrath, 28, claimed three
wickets and then returned to bag Moin Khan's scalp as Pakistan
finished the day at 170 for six _ still 110 runs behind Australian
first innings of 280.
	   Pakistan skipper Aamir Sohail, who desperately needs a win at
the National Stadium to square the three match series, fought a
lone battle and was unbeaten on a fine 83 when stumps were drawn.
He lifted leg-spinner Stuart MacGill for a big six over mid-wicket
during his 226 minutes of stay at the wicket, besides hitting 11
boundaries.
	   Together with Wasim Akram, who was still playing at 19, Sohail
had so far put on 54 runs for the seventh wicket. Akram survived a
close leg before appeal off Gavin Robertson's last ball of the day
and survived last hour without further damage with Shail.
	   McGrath returned with impressive figures of 4-41 off 15 overs
while Robertson bowled a steady 12 overs giving away just 23 runs.
	   The home team batting crumbled in front of McGrath's pace, but
they only have themselves to blame for throwing their wickets.
Debutant Shahid Afridi, who earlier in the day took five wickets in
Australian first innings total of 280, stroked McGrath to cover
boundary off the very first delivery he faced in Test cricket.
	   However, Afridi, 18, known for his pinch-hitting in one-day
cricket, played an ambitious stroke off McGrath to give Mark Taylor
a sharp catch in first slip.
	   Ijaz Ahmed (5) needlessly tried to pull McGrath's short delivery
and got a leading edge to wicketkeeper Ian Healy while Inzamamul
Haq (9) gently pushed McGrath to Darren Lehmann at short cover.
	   With Pakistan struggling at 51 for three, veteran Salim Malik
chased a wide delivery of leg-spinner Stuart MacGill and got a top
edge as Pakistan went for tea at a hopeless 54 for four.
	   Off-spinner Gavin Robertson further reduced Pakistan to 69 for
five when he bowled Yousaf Youhanna before wicketkeeper batsman
Moin Khan and Sohail put on 47 runs in 53 minutes for the sixth
wicket.
	   However, McGrath returned for his second spell and Michael
Slater took a well judged catch at square leg to end Khan's of
20-run knock.
	   Earlier, veteran Ian Healy and No. 10 batsman Stuart MacGill
frustrated Pakistan with a half-century partnership before
Australia's first innings folded at 280 at stroke of lunch.
	   Leg-spinner Shahid Afridi finished with five wickets for 52,
claiming the wickets of Gavin Robertson (5) and last man Glenn
McGrath (6). He took three wickets on Thursday. He became the fifth
Pakistani after Arif Butt, Nazir Junior, Shahid Nazir and Muhammad
Zahid to claim five wickets in his debut Test innings.
	   After resuming at the overnight total of 207 for six, Healy (47)
and MacGill added a precious 55 runs for the ninth wicket in 105
minutes.
	   MacGill, who scored his first run after nearly half an hour,
remained unbeaten on 23 in 128 minutes.
	   Pakistan took the second new ball after 112 overs. The score was
244 for eight when the new ball came into play.
	   Off-spinner Arshad Khan finally broke the partnership when Healy
was ruled out by South African umpire Dave Orchard after he was
caught behind. However, TV replays suggested that the ball might
have missed the outside edge of Healy's bat.
	   Earlier, Afridi claimed his fourth wicket of the innings when
overnight batsman Gavin Robertson was caught at silly point by a
diving Yousaf Youhanna in his second over of the day.
	   And when Wasim Akram knocked back Collin Miller's off stump, at
the total of 211, it looked like Australia's innings might fold

	   However, Healy and MacGill dug in and pushed the total beyond
250-run mark.
	   Besides Afridi's 5-52, Arshad Khan claimed 3-72 while Akram and
Shoaib Akhtar chipped in with one wicket each, for 51 and 39 runs
respectively.

Investigators search yard of house where embassy bomb believed

	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ Police and soldiers on Friday
blocked off the street in front of a house where members of a
terrorist gang are believed to have assembled the bomb that blew up
the U.S. Embassy, killing 11 people.
	   Wearing gloves and masks, detectives from the Tanzanian Criminal
Investigation Division could be seen searching the yard of the
house that is surrounded by a high fence.
	   Residents, who were questioned Thursday by Tanzanian police and
FBI agents, told reporters Friday there were four regular visitors
to the house. They all came at night and used a white 1989 Suzuki
Samuri, which is in police custody.
	   Two men, Tanzanian Rashid Saleh Hemed and Egyptian Mustafa
Mahmoud Said Ahmed, have been formally charged by a Tanzanian
magistrate in the Aug. 7 embassy bombing.
	   Police are looking for two other suspects identified Ahmad
Khalfan, a Tanzanian of Omani origin and Fahad, a Kenyan of Yemeni
origin.
	   A relative of Hemed told The Associated Press the house in the
Bungoni neighborhood of Ilala district had been rented by Ahmad
Khalfan.
	   The house is south of the center of Dar es Salaam and about 6.5
kilometers (4 miles) southwest of the embassy building.
	   The relative, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said in
addition to Khalfan, the three other visitors to the house were
Fahad, Ahmed and Hussein. He did not furnish second names for them,
and it was not clear whether Ahmed was the same Egyptian charged in
the Dar es Salaam bombing.
	   Residents said police showed them photographs, but they were not
able to identify them because it was always dark when they arrived
and left. But all were able to identify the Suzuki vehicle.
	   Officials believe a 1987 Nissan Atlas refrigerator truck
actually carried the bomb into the embassy compound. It has been
identified by its chassis, all that remains.
	   There has been speculation that two men in the Suzuiki used a
remote control device to detonate the bomb.
	   A nearly simultaneous attack in neighboring Kenya killed 213
people, including 12 Americans, at the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi.
	   U.S. authorities have charged four people in connection with the
Nairobi blast. Three are in custody in New York, and a fourth is a
fugitive.
	   Mohamed Sadeek Odeh, one of the three men in custody in the
United States for the Nairobi bombing, told police in Pakistan
where he was arrested after arriving from Nairobi Aug. 7 that Ahmad
Khalfan was a member of the group responsible for the bombing in
Dar es Salaam.
	   According to the same Pakistani police sources, Odeh identified
Fahad as being involved in the Nairobi embassy bombing.

<TEXT>
	   SHEFFIELD, England (AP) _ Sheffield Wednesday striker Paolo Di
Canio was banned for 11 games and fined 10,000 pounds (dlrs 16,900)
Friday for pushing a referee to the ground in a Sept. 26 match.
	   The 30-year-old Italian learned of his punishment after
appearing before a three-man Football Association disciplinary
panel.
	   Di Canio, who was suspended immediately after the home match by
his Sheffield club, had reportedly faced a possible ban of up to
six months from the English game.
	   ``I'm very, very sorry for what happened,'' he said at a news
conference after the verdict was announced. ``I had a fair hearing
and I accept that.''
	   The club said there would be no appeal.
	   The suspension is likely to keep Di Canio out of the game until
early January.
	   The 11-match ban includes an automatic three-game suspension for
receiving a red card. Di Canio has already served one game of the
suspension and will now miss another 10 before returning to action.
	   Referee Paul Alcock was pushed to the ground after he gave Di
Canio a red card for his part in a brawl in the final minutes of
the first half of the game against Arsenal.
	   Arsenal's Martin Keown was also sent off as a melee among a
dozen players broke out following a tussle between Arsenal's
Patrick Vieira and Wim Jonk.
	   Di Canio later suggested Alcock play-acted and compared him to a
player diving to draw a penalty.
	   ``I pushed (the ref) in the stomach,'' Di Canio said last month.
``He took 3-4 steps sideways and fell like a player'' who dives for
a penalty.
	   Alcock, who denied Di Canio's allegation, said he considered
quitting the sport after the incident but had since changed his
mind.
	   ``I am certainly not going to let something like this beat me,''
Alcock said Thursday. ``I was caught totally by surprise and the
shock caused me to lose my balance.''
	   ``I thought on the way home whether I really need the pressure
of this particular incident and I have thought over the past two or
three weeks whether I need to carry on.
	   ``But at the end of the day I am certainly not going to let an
incident like that stop me refereeing.''

Jewish settlers threaten to shut down West Bank, topple Netanyahu
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with settlers threatening to shut down West
Bank and bring down Netanyahu government, opposition saying it will
provide safety net to Netanyahu throughout withdrawal period. &QL; 
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Jewish settlers said Friday they will shut down
the West Bank with street protests and try to topple Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu over the land-for-security agreement he
negotiated with the Palestinians.
	   However, Israel's dovish opposition pledged to back Netanyahu on
the peace accord and make sure he is not brought down by parliament
during the 12 weeks Israel has been allotted to withdraw troops
from 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   Islamic militants, meanwhile, dismissed the deal reached during
a nine-day Mideast summit at Wye Plantation in the eastern U.S.
state of Maryland as a sellout and said they would continue
plotting attacks in Israel.
	   Jewish settlers said Netanyahu had broken his promises to his
right-wing constituents. Jewish settler leader Aharon Domb said the
prime minister had negotiated to an ``agreement of surrender.''
	   However, the news of the agreement came just hours before the
start of the Jewish Sabbath at sundown Friday and settler leaders
had little time to organize their protests.
	   Shlomo Filber, a leader of the Jewish settlement movement, said
that on Sunday protesters would block every West Bank junction to
Palestinian traffic. The settlers will also work to bring down the
Netanyahu coalition, Filber said.
	   At least a dozen hard-line coalition members have said they
would vote against a peace agreement in parliament, enough to rob
the prime minister of his parliamentary majority.
	   However, the dovish opposition said it would counter those votes
and make sure Netanyahu will remain in power until the troop
withdrawal has been carried out.
	   ``We will give him a safety net for the coming weeks,'' said
Yossi Beilin of the opposition Labor Party, one of the architects
of the 1993 breakthrough agreement between Israel and the
Palestinians.
	   On the Palestinian side, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, the founder of the
Islamic militant group Hamas, said the agreement brought the
Palestinians little. ``Our people are paying more than they are
getting from this agreement,'' Yassin told The Associated Press at
his Gaza City home.
	   As part of the agreement, the CIA would play a stronger role in
the Palestinian Authority's campaign against Islamic militants,
mainly Hamas which has carried out more than a dozen suicide
attacks in Israel.
	   Yassin said a new crackdown could perhaps restrict the
activities of the Hamas military wing temporarily, but would not
prevent attacks against Israelis.
	   ``It cannot erase Hamas,'' said Yassin. ``It is an illusion to
think the agreement will put an end ot our military work.''

Interior minister, coma and heart attack victim, leaves hospital

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement,
who fell into a coma after his heart stopped due to an allergic
reaction to anesthesia, left the Val de Grace military hospital on
Friday, more than seven weeks after entering.
	   Chevenement's heart had stopped for nearly an hour after he was
administered curare, a muscle relaxant known to cause allergic
reactions in some patients, just ahead of planned gall bladder
surgery on Sept. 2. He spent eight days in a coma.
	   The French press had painted a grim picture of the chances of
full recovery for the 59-year-old Chevenement. On Friday, the
left-leaning newspaper Liberation called his recovery ``a
miracle.''
	   It had been reported Chevenement would leave the hospital this
week.
	   A one-line statement from the hospital confirmed Chevenement
left Friday to begin a two-month period of convalescence.
	   Doctors had said the minister would suffer ``neither physical
nor neurological aftereffects.''
	   Chevenement, a key figure in Socialist Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin's Cabinet, is expected to return to his post by the start of
next year.
	   In his first interview since the accident, published earlier
this week in Paris Match, Chevenement, describing his coma, said he
had ``reached the other bank,'' a reference to his flirt with
death.
	   Chevenement also quashed questions about how the prestigious
team of military doctors at Val de Grace could have administered
curare without knowing in advance that he would prove allergic.
	   ``What happened to me ... was as unpredictable as an auto
accident,'' Chevenement told Paris Match magazine in his first
interview since the Sept. 2 operation.

Slovenia to invite Pope for second visit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LJUBLJANA, Slovenia (AP) _ The Slovene government will invite
Pope John Paul II for a second visit to the southern Alpine nation,
a government spokesman said Friday.
	   The government approved Archbishop Edmond Farhat's request to
invite the pope on Thursday and Foreign Minister Boris Frlec is to
officially extend the invitation during a visit to the Vatican on
Oct. 29, said Branko Vidrih, a government spokesman.
	   Relations between the government and the Catholic Church in
Slovenia have been strained since the country gained independence
from the former Yugoslavia in 1991.
	   The Pope last visited Slovenia in May 1996, as part of a tour of
the former Yugoslavia.

New left-wing line-up seeks to tackle EU's problems
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL AMES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   POERTSCHACH, Austria (AP) _ The new left-wing lineup of European
Union leaders gathers in this lakeside resort Saturday for a
weekend's brainstorming to map out the EU's future, but
here-and-now problems like Kosovo and the global economic crisis
are sure to intrude.
	   The opening day of the two-day summit marks the EU debut of
Germany's Social Democratic Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder, and
Italy's new Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema, a former Communist who
now heads the Democratic Left party.
	   Their arrival means all but four of the 15 EU governments are
headed by left-leaning prime ministers. Two others are coalitions
with socialists in top positions, and only in Ireland and Spain are
socialists in opposition.
	   Although some of the faces have changed, the problems facing the
EU leaders have a nagging familiarity:
	   _ how to maintain Europe's economic recovery and tackle
unemployment in the face of spreading international turmoil.
	   _ how to reduce Europe's dependence on the United States when
bloody conflicts flares up on the EU's doorstep.
	   _ how to streamline the EU's ponderous decision-making process
and make the EU more efficient ahead of next decade's planned
expand of the membership from 15 to 21.
	   Forecasts released by the EU this week show the crisis sweeping
though Asia, Russia and Latin America dragging growth in the
15-nation bloc down to 2.4 percent next year, from the previously
predicted 3 percent.
	   Although EU officials insist the slowdown will be temporary,
pressure is growing for a more hands-on approach from governments
to encourage growth by increasing public investment or cutting
interest rates to boost business.
	   ``The competitiveness of our companies .... must be further
bolstered. The government intends to see to that,'' French Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin said this week in Paris. ``A decline in
interest rates is essential to that end.''
	   Schroeder and other euro-Socialist leaders have also indicated
rates should be lower, but central bank governors have resisted
calls to cut, arguing rates in the EU's core economies, such as
France and Germany, are already among the world's lowest.
	   Jospin may have more success seeking support for a plan to raise
state funding for job-creating public-works projects. The outgoing
German administration of Chancellor Helmut Kohl quashed that idea
last time it came up, Schroeder may be more sympathetic.
	   Britain's Labor Prime Minister Tony Blair this week indicated he
may be prepared to drop the long-standing opposition of his
Conservative predecessors to giving the EU a military capability.
	   ``We need to allow fresh thinking in this, and it is important
for Britain to be part of this thinking,'' Blair was quoted telling
The Times of London.
	   His spokesman Alistair Campbell explained Blair wanted European
countries to be able to mount peacekeeping or combat operations to
deal with crises like Bosnia or Kosovo.
	   ``We could put together an operation with, say, France, Belgium,
Italy and Spain, in a way that meant we did not have to rely the
whole time on the Americans,'' Campbell said.
	   The leaders will also debate plans to raise the Union's
international political profile by naming a permanent envoy to
coordinate EU foreign affairs, although nobody is likely to be
appointed until the next euro-summit December in the Austrian
capital, Vienna.
	   This weekend's summit was originally called to allow the leaders
to hold an informal chat in a relaxed Alpine atmosphere on ways to
overhaul the EU, making it more efficient and more relevant to its
370 million citizens as it prepares to take on Poland, Hungary, the
Czech Republic, Cyprus, Estonia and Slovenia as new members over
the next few years.
	   ``Poertschach provides an excellent opportunity to relaunch the
debate on the future of the Union,'' said EU Commission President
Jacques Santer, in a letter to the leaders. ``Europe must rid
itself of its cliched image of an economic giant but political
dwarf.''

In major move by Japan, troubled bank to be nationalized

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's government put its long-awaited
bank-bailout-plan into action Friday by taking over one of the
country's biggest lenders, the debt-ridden Long-Term Credit Bank of
Japan.
	   The takeover _ the first nationalization of a Japanese bank
since World War II _ avoided a full-scale collapse of LTCB, which
would have further eroded confidence in Japan's banking system and
shaken world markets.
	   The government took over the bank under a recently approved set
of laws aimed at revitalizing the financial system and lifting
Japan out of its worst recession in half a century.
	   The laws, which went into effect Friday, also open a line of 60
trillion yen (dlrs 515 billion) in public money to the banking
industry. The government can use the money to bail out weak banks
or help healthy ones rid themselves of a crushing burden of bad
loans.
	   Estimates of the size of Japan's bad-loan problem run as high as
a dlrs 1 trillion, much of it left over from the collapse of
Japan's high-flying speculative ``bubble economy'' of the 1980s.
	   Announcing the move, Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi sought to
assure the bank's jittery clients and customers _ and international
markets.
	   ``The government will continue to take all possible measures to
protect depositors and others, to maintain an orderly financial
system, and to stabilize financial markets at home and abroad,''
Obuchi said.
	   The takeover was seen as a clear signal that Tokyo is at last
willing to end the so-called convoy system, where the government
offered unconditional protection to banks, and begin allowing
market forces to sift out winners and losers.
	   ``We wanted to see if the government would be willing to close
down non-viable banks,'' said James Fiorillo, a senior analyst at
ING Baring Securities in Tokyo.
	   One group that stood to suffer was LTCB's shareholders. The
stock last traded at 2 yen (2 cents). Though the government would
have to buy the shares as part of the nationalization plan, they
were expected to pay only about 1 yen (1 cent).
	   Japan's taxpayers, who will now have to pick up the tab for the
bank's bad loans, also stood to lose. Government auditors said
Friday that as much as 4.62 trillion yen (dlrs 39.8 billion) of
LTCB's loans may be irrecoverable.
	   The auditors, from the Financial Supervisory Agency, also said
LTCB liabilities exceeded its assets by some 340 billion yen (dlrs
2.9 billion) _ meaning the bank is insolvent.
	   LTCB issued an apology and said all of its directors would
resign once the government had appointed new managers.
	   The government didn't say what was in store for the bank in the
long-run but the takeover seemed likely to spell the end of LTCB's
46-year history.
	   Founded in the aftermath of Japan's military defeat to provide
cheap, long-term loans to industry, the bank helped lead the
country's spectacular rise to economic superpower status.
	   But like the U.S. savings and loan industry a decade ago,
changes in regulations and the economy made specialized lenders
like LTCB obsolete.
	   Desperate for new customers, the bank increasingly lent to
riskier enterprises such as real estate developers until property
prices crashed in the 1990s.
	   The most likely outcome for the bank, said analysts, would be
for the government to keep control for one year while its bad loans
are sold and another company is found to absorb its healthy
operations.
	   A possible partner would be Sumitomo Trust and Banking Co.,
which agreed to merge with LTCB earlier this year but then backed
out as the size of LTCB's troubles became known.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Echoing Western claims, Kosovo's
main ethnic Albanian leader said Friday that Yugoslavia has not
removed its troops from the province and that little progress has
been made to defuse the crisis.
	   With NATO's latest deadline for compliance only four days away,
the Alliance decided Friday to send its supreme commander Gen.
Wesley Clark and German General Klaus Naumann to Belgrade this
weekend to insist that Yugoslavia speed the troop withdrawal in
Kosovo.
	   ``We have seen great progress but we are still far from adequate
compliance,'' a NATO official told reporters in Brussels, Belgium,
on condition of anonymity.
	   Fighting has all but ceased in the southern Serbian province,
but tension remains high here despite the agreement reached Oct. 12
between President Slobodan Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard
Holbrooke to avert NATO airstrikes.
	   Diplomatic observers reported hearing heavy tank fire Thursday
in the Drenica region southwest of Pristina, the provincial
capital. The U.N. refugee agency said Friday that only a
``trickle'' of refugees are returning to their homes because of
fear and intimidation by Serb police.
	   ``The impression our staff got on the ground is while some
people trickle back to their ruined homes, widespread destruction
of housing and fear of the continued Serb military and police
presence prevent significant return,'' U.N. spokesman Kris Janowski
said in Geneva, Switzerland.
	   More than 10 days after Holbrooke and Milosevic reached the
agreement, ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova told reporters
``the Serbian forces have not yet withdrawn from Kosovo,'' despite
Yugoslav claims to the contrary.
	   ``We cannot say any progress was made and NATO should maintain
its 'activation order' and keep pressing the Belgrade government,''
Rugova said.
	   Yugoslavia insists it has met NATO demands to withdraw troops to
levels before the February crackdown Milosevic ordered to suppress
an ethnic Albanian revolt in Kosovo.
	   U.S. and other Western diplomats dispute this, however, warning
that continuing violence threatens the Kosovo peace process and
raises the threat of NATO airstrikes. NATO has extended the
deadline until Tuesday for Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to
comply.
	   Hundreds have been killed and hundreds of thousands driven from
their homes by the violence. The majority of Kosovo's 2 million
inhabitants are ethnic Albanians, and most favor independence.
	   Milosevic has agreed to talks with ethnic Albanians on the
future of the province in Serbia, Yugoslavia's largest republic.
	   The rebel Kosovo Liberation Army has insisted it will not
abandon its goal of independence. The United States and the
Europeans reject independence but support some form of autonomy for
Kosovo.
	   Laura Boldrini of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said
ethnic Albanians who returned two weeks ago to the village of
Poklek fled again this week because of intimidation by Serb police.
	   ``It's a never-ending story,'' Boldrini said.
	   But the Serb regional governor, Veljko Odalovic, accused ethnic
Albanian rebels of provoking government troops by attacking police.
Odalovic said that since Oct. 12, five policemen had been killed,
12 wounded and two Serbian journalists kidnapped by the rebels.
	   ``It's clear the terrorists want to provoke new conflicts and to
involve large numbers of police and army where they can, and the
international community knows that,'' he said.
	   In efforts to reinforce the Oct. 12 accord, U.S. diplomat
William Walker was in the Yugoslav capital Belgrade to oversee the
establishment of a 2,000-member mission to make sure Milosevic
honors the agreement.
	   Walker will head the mission under the direction of the
Vienna-based Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
	   State-controlled media said Yugoslavia's foreign minister,
Zivadin Jovanovic, assured Walker that the government will stick by
the deal. Walker met Milosevic on Friday morning and was to leave
for Pristina to meet Rugova.
	   At U.N. headquarters in New York, the Security Council is
working on a resolution endorsing the Kosovo peace deal.

New harsh media law is implemented: two editors, one publisher
</HEADLINE>
summoned to court &QL; 
 &UR; By JOVANA GEC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) - Two prominent independent editors
and a publisher were summoned to court Friday for criticizing
President Slobodan Milosevic, becoming the first victims of a new
harsh media law.
	   Editors Slavko Curuvija and Dragan Bujosevic were ordered to
appear in court to be tried Friday for several articles in the
current edition of the Evropljanin (European) weekly, which
criticizes Milosevic and his ``repressive'' policies.
	   The publisher of Evropljanin, Ivan Tadic, was also to be tried
at the same Belgrade district court on charges filed by an obscure
pro-state group, which calls itself ``the Patriotic Union of
Belgrade.''
	   Proceedings started with about 100 independent journalists
following the three to the downtown court building in a show of
support.
	   According to the new media law passed last Tuesday, the three
face fines of dinars 400,000 to 800,000 (dlrs 41,000 to dlrs
82,000) each for allegedly ``trying to undermine the constitutional
order'' of Yugoslavia by criticizing Milosevic and his rule.
	   Milosevic exploited public anti-Western sentiments about
possible NATO intervention in Serbia's Kosovo province to pass the
new law banning broadcasts of Serbo-Croatian language programs by
foreign media.
	   The law also empowers authorities to determine which reports
break the law and are against the constitution and further
restricts working permits for news organizations.
	   Independent legal experts and journalists say the law reimposes
censorship, which Serbia formally abandoned in the late 1980s, and
drags the country back toward single-party dictatorship.
	   At a news conference Friday, Information Minister Aleksandar
Vucic said the law presented ``the best confirmation ... of the
freedom of information, the ban of censorship ... but it also
introduces the right balance between the freedom and responsibility
of informing.''
	   Vucic, of the ultra-nationalist Radical Party, blasted the White
House for criticizing the law, calling it ``hypocrisy.''
	   ``They called this law draconian, while their own measures and
threats of retaliation, bombardment and ... destruction of our
nation they call democratic, peaceful and good enough,'' Vucic
said.
	   The Evropljanin article, entitled ``What Next, Milosevic ?'' and
written in a form of a letter to the Yugoslav president, blasts him
for introducing ``dictatorship'' and leading the country into
political, economic and social chaos.
	   The charges filed by the Patriotic Union against the editors and
the publisher include two pictures published in Evropljanin, one of
an ethnic Albanian rebel Kosovo Liberation Army soldier and one
from the Romanian anti-Communist revolution, with the caption
saying ``That's the way it ended in Romania.''
	   The Patriotic Union, believed to be run by supporters of
Milosevic's neo-communist wife Mirjana Markovic, complained to the
court that the KLA soldier is shown in a ``hero position'' and has
not been called a ``terrorist.''
	   Before the trial started, Curuvija said the weekly was printed
before the law was adopted, adding the summons represents an
``illegal, unconstitutional reprisal ... only because we said what
we think of (Milosevics') rule.''
	   ``They want to strangle the independent media, the last
remaining point of resistance, with draconian punishments,
spreading fear among the Serbs,'' said Aleksandar Tijanic, a former
Serbian information minister and a Evropljanin commentator.
	   The court action comes a day after leading neo-communist
official Ivan Markovic blasted Evropljanin, Curuvija and Tijanic as
being financed from abroad like ``foreign mercenaries.''

Di Canio banned for 11 games, fined 10,000 pounds
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS Sheffield Wednesday comment; clarifies return by late
December &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SHEFFIELD, England (AP) _ Sheffield Wednesday striker Paolo Di
Canio was banned for 11 games and fined 10,000 pounds (dlrs 16,900)
Friday for pushing a referee to the ground in a Sept. 26 match.
	   The 30-year-old Italian learned of his punishment after
appearing before a three-man Football Association disciplinary
panel.
	   Di Canio, who was suspended immediately after the home match by
his Sheffield club, had reportedly faced a possible ban of up to
six months from the English game.
	   ``I'm very, very sorry for what happened,'' he said at a news
conference after the verdict was announced. ``I had a fair hearing
and I accept that. I'll see the Sheffield Wednesday fans on Boxing
Day (Dec. 26), the first game after my suspension.''
	   The club said there would be no appeal.
	   ``During the hearing Paolo apologized,'' said a club spokesman
said. ``He apologizes to the commission, he apologizes to the
referee, he apologizes to the club and its fans.
	   ``The club is now looking forward to having him back playing
with us before the end of 1998.''
	   The 11-match ban includes an automatic three-game suspension for
receiving a red card. Di Canio has already served one game of the
suspension and will now miss another 10 before returning to action.
	   Referee Paul Alcock was pushed to the ground after he gave Di
Canio a red card for his part in a brawl in the final minutes of
the first half of the game against Arsenal.
	   Arsenal's Martin Keown was also sent off as a melee among a
dozen players broke out following a tussle between Arsenal's
Patrick Vieira and Wim Jonk.
	   Di Canio later suggested Alcock play-acted and compared him to a
player diving to draw a penalty.
	   ``I pushed (the ref) in the stomach,'' Di Canio said last month.
``He took 3-4 steps sideways and fell like a player'' who dives for
a penalty.
	   Alcock, who denied Di Canio's allegation, said he considered
quitting the sport after the incident but had since changed his
mind.
	   ``I am certainly not going to let something like this beat me,''
Alcock said Thursday. ``I was caught totally by surprise and the
shock caused me to lose my balance.''
	   ``I thought on the way home whether I really need the pressure
of this particular incident and I have thought over the past two or
three weeks whether I need to carry on.
	   ``But at the end of the day I am certainly not going to let an
incident like that stop me refereeing.''

Germany calls for European measures against illegal immigration
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Germany's outgoing Interior Minister
called Europe's program for eliminating inner border controls a
success Friday, but said common efforts toward fighting crime and
illegal immigration are needed to keep it working.
	   In a report to be presented to a European Union conference in
Vienna on Oct. 29-30, Interior Minister Manfred Kanther praised the
so-called Schengen agreement, which has done away with passport
checks for people traveling between nine of the 15 European Union
countries.
	   ``Schengen is a success story of the European integration,'' he
said.
	   But he noted it would only stay that way if member states keep
close tabs on their outer borders to prevent criminals and illegal
immigrants from entering.
	   ``European integration would go easier and be better accepted by
the people if it is tied to an increase in inner security, the
fight against crime and in the blocking of illegal immigration to
Europe,'' he said.
	   Kanther's office reported Thursday that Germany had snared
35,205 foreigners seeking to enter the country illegally last year
_ 30 percent more than 1996.
	   Most _ 23,089 _ were caught on Germany's eastern border with
Poland and the Czech Republic, not members of the Schengen pact.
	   Kanther said statistics for 1998 so far were running almost 14
percent higher than last year.
	   Of those caught last year, 8,288 were smuggled into Germany by
criminal gangs, compared with 7,364 in 1996.
	   The Schengen countries are Germany, Austria, France, Belgium,
Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal and Spain.

Austrian chief denies doping accusations
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SOELDEN, Austria (AP) _ Austria's top ski official on Friday
denied accusations that his team's World Cup success last season
was due to the use of banned performance-enhancing drugs.
	   Austrian alpine director Hans Pum expressed anger over a recent
article in the Swiss daily paper ``Sport'' which quoted Swiss ski
boss Theo Nadig questionning the rapid physical development and
supremacy of Austrian star Hermann Maier and others.
	   ``I cannot understand how someone can make such a statement so
carelessly expecially at such a sensitive time,'' Pum said during
the annual pre-season International Ski Federation conference.
``For years I've seen Switzerland beat us and while it was a bitter
pill we accepted it as fair.
	   ``These statements were said at a time to destabilize our team
but we won't be ruffled.''
	   ``Sport'' quoted Nadig as saying that a diet of pasta and
granola could not explain Maier's rapid gain of muscle mass.
	   ``... Even if you train a lot, an athlete can only gain about 3
1/2 to 4 1/4 kilos (7-8.5 pounds) of muscle mass, and even that's a
lot,'' Nadig said in the article. ``But when you hear what's said
about Hermann Maier's development, you get suspicious. Alone, pasta
and Muesli won't achieve that.''
	   FIS said Friday it would investigate the matter, and that Nadig
could face sanctions for making accusations without supporting
evidence.
	   ``We must see and study the article,'' said newly appointed FIS
president Gian Franco Kasper, who is Swiss.
	   ``If he's really accusing the Austrians without proof we might
have to take severe sanctions against him. If he has proof, he
should have gone through the proper channels and come to us.''
	   On Friday, Nadig told The Associated Press he felt such measures
would be unfair.
	   ``If I'm sanctioned for saying I want tougher drug control,
well, that doesn't sound right to me,'' he said. ``Three Swiss
cyclists were involved and admitted to taking banned substances
(during the Tour de France), so in Switzerland we're now very
sceptical.
	   ``I think doping exists in skiing and if we want to prevent what
happened in cycling we must take the proper measures now,'' Nadig
said. ``The reasons are there for skiers to turn to such methods.''
	   In a heated confrontation between the two officials during the
conference, Nadig eventually softened his statements.
	   ``I'm not accusing anybody,'' he said. ``I was just curious.
Hermann Maier is the reference point and as the head of the Swiss
team it's my job to find the best ways to train my skiers and
provide them with the best training possible.
	   ``I don't think that kind of muscle mass can be developed just
from pasta and Muesli (granola) and I was curious to know what they
were doing.''
	   Speculation over Maier began rumbling last season, when he
emerged from obscurity to win two Olympic gold medals, the giant
slalom and super-g World Cup titles as well as the overall World
Cup crown.
	   In addition, Maier's name has been linked with doctor Bernd
Pansold, the last coach of the Eastern German women's swimming
team.
	   Asked about Maier's alleged visits to the Obertouern independent
Olympic training center in Austria where Pansold works, Pum said he
exercised no control over where the skier trained.
	   Over the summer, some 450-500 out-of-competition drug tests were
carried out, FIS said, and none were positive.
	   The FIS will convene Nov. 28-29 to discuss the issue of drugs in
skiing with other winter sports federations, before attending the
world conference on doping organized by the International Olympic
Committee in February.
	   ``FIS follows the Olympic movement with doping controls,''
Kasper said. ``The FIS wants to take a hardline on doping.''

Report: Pinochet unaware being detained
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Augusto Pinochet, detained by police in a
London clinic, is not fully aware of his predicament because his
family and aides shielding him from the details for fear he would
fly into a rage that could kill him, the Madrid daily El Mundo
reported Friday.
	   The newspaper's reporter accompanied Chilean politicians seeking
Pinochet's release when they went to the clinic Thursday. The
reporter said he talked briefly to Pinochet's wife, Lucia Hiriart,
and daughter Veronica.
	   ``If Augusto knew the truth, he would have an attack of rage and
die,'' El Mundo quoted Hiriart as saying to others in the London
Clinic waiting room, where she was waiting for permission from
Scotland Yard to visit her husband on the eighth floor.
	   The former Chilean dictator was arrested in London on Oct. 16 at
the request of Spanish magistrate Baltasar Garzon, who wants to
extradite Pinochet on genocide, terrorism and torture charges.
	   El Mundo reported that the family has asked police guards to
stand outside the former dictator's room and stay out of sight when
anyone goes inside.
	   The newspaper said that despite having received an arrest order
last Friday from two policemen who visited his room, Pinochet is
convinced it was a mistake and he is protected by diplomatic
immunity.
	   His wife said she does not want to let him know how serious his
situation is because he is suffering from a urinary infection,
heart problems and diabetes, the newspaper reported.
	   She said there is no television, radio or telephone in his room.
	   ``He's very depressed,'' she said. ``This is humiliating,'' the
newspaper quoted her as saying.

German railway looks to build the stations of the future
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo STU501 &QL; 
 &UR; By OLIVER SCHMALE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ With an eye toward competing better
with planes flying up above, the German railway is looking to move
its train stations underground.
	   That doesn't mean dark and dirty, though. On the drawing board
are clean, safe, impressive ``transportation cathedrals'' offering
shopping and style at ground level and easy, high-speed connections
down below.
	   ``The whiff of the underdog, of the inferior mode of transport
must be banished from the train stations,'' said Andreas Hempel,
head of the federation of German architects.
	   His group is part of the German railway's ``Stations of the
Future'' project, which includes an ambitious plan to revamp train
stations in 21 German cities for the 21st century.
	   By redesigning the approaches to the stations, railway officials
hope trains can pass through quicker, helping them draw travelers
away from planes and even cars.
	   City planners also hope to use the freed-up space above ground
to revitalize inner cities with new apartments and shops.
	   The new stations ``have the best chance today to again become
the place where things happen in the middle of the cities,'' said
former railway chief Heinz Duer.
	   Some work has already started on a 5 billion mark (dlrs 3.1
billion) project in Stuttgart, although the main digging isn't
expected to begin until 2001.
	   Neu-Ulm and Saarbruecken in southern Germany are next on the
list. Feasibility studies are underway in Frankfurt, Munich,
Mannheim, Lindau and Magdeburg.
	   Some stations have already gotten makeovers in recent years,
like the glittering shopping arcade added to the imposing, prewar
hall in Leipzig.
	   German railway boss Johannes Ludewig says the railway intends to
spend 1.2 billion marks (dlrs 750 million) over the next three
years modernizing stations nationwide to make them more customer
friendly.
	   It hopes to cover 60 percent of the cost by leasing the
renovated space to shops and other commercial enterprises.
	   Work has begun in Bremen, Weimar and Mainz, he said, where ``the
renaissance of the train stations is already taking form.''
	   In Stuttgart, home of Daimler-Benz, workers have begun building
apartments and shops on an unused section of railway.
	   When the eight tracks are finally moved underground _ by 2008 _
city officials hope to have an entirely new neighborhood on 100
hectares (250 acres) up above, with homes for 11,000 people and
jobs for 24,000.
	   ``Freeing up the old tracks and railyards offers the chance of
the century to create a new city quarter with a high degree of
style and innovation,'' said Stuttgart Mayor Wolfgang Schuster.
	   The railway calculates it will earn 2.1 billion marks (dlrs 1.3
billion) through the sale of land it no longer needs. The rest of
the project is to be financed by loans and grants from government.
	   Official also want to connect Stuttgart to the French TGV
high-speed network.
	   ``The project is not only binding our city to the international
high-speed train network, but will givt a completely new impulse to
public transportation,'' Schuster said.

NATO nominated for 1999 Nobel Peace Prize
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ NATO was nominated for the 1999 Nobel Peace
Prize on Friday by two Norwegian Conservatives to mark the
alliance's 50th anniversary as a key force in promoting peace and
stability in Europe.
	   Members of Parliament Ingvald Godal and Bjorn Haernes, both of
the Conservative Party, said a peace prize would also recognize
NATO's expected expansion into the former East Bloc .
	   ``NATO, through 50 years, has proved to be a completely central
security policy instrument for member countries when it comes to
peace and freedom. The alliance has shown a non-aggressive attitude
and a duty to find peaceful solutions,'' said the nomination, which
was released by the lawmakers Friday.
	   The alliance celebrates its 50th Anniversary in April 1999.
	   The Norwegian Nobel Committee, which awards the peace prize,
accepts nominations postmarked by Feb. 1 for each year's prize,
which it usually announces in mid-October. The committee does not
reveal the names of candidates, only their number, a record 139
this year.
	   Members of most national legislatures can make nominations for
the prize, as can past laureates, the awards committee and its
staff, and professors of history, philosophy, political science and
jurisprudence.
	   This year's prize, announced a week ago, went to John Hume and
David Trimble for seeking a peaceful solution to the Northern
Ireland conflict.

Pollard's wife: couple treat news of his release as rumors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Jonathan Pollard, who is serving a life term in
the United States for spying for Israel, told his wife Friday to
consider news of his imminent release as a rumor.
	   At this stage, ``we give this rumor no credence,'' Esther
Pollard said after speaking to her husband by phone Friday.
	   ``I will not believe it until his feet touch the ground in
Israel,'' Mrs. Pollard told The Associated Press from Toronto,
Canada, where she lives.
	   Mrs. Pollard said she has not received any official word that
her husband was being released.
	   Earlier Friday, an Israeli official said the United States had
agreed to Pollard's immediate release, but then backed off.
	   Israeli media reports said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu told U.S. President Bill Clinton on Friday that without
Pollard's release, Israel would not sign the land-for-security
agreement negotiated over nine days at Wye Plantation in Maryland.

Trial of game warden charged with killing British tourist opens
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ A former game warden told the High Court
Friday he did not kill British tourist Julie Ward in the Maasai
Mara game reserve a decade ago.
	   ``I am not guilty. I am very innocent, your lordship,'' Simon
ole Makallah told Judge Onyango Otieno on the opening day of his
murder trial as he entered his plea of not guilty.
	   Makallah is charged with killing Ward between Sept. 6 and 13,
1988.
	   The 49-year-old Makallah, who is currently assitant director of
the Kenya Wildlife Service, was a warden in the reserve at the time
of Ward's death.
	   Otieno said the trial would resume Oct. 28. Both the prosecution
and the defense requested that it be scheduled to run on a daily
basis.
	   The prosecution said it would need about a month to call the 43
witnesses it has assembled.
	   It is the second trial for Ward's murder. In June 1992, two park
rangers were acquitted, and Justice Fidahussein Abdullah criticized
the police for conducting a flawed investigation.
	   Makallah's attorneys say they will call 12 witnesses.
	   Makallah was arrested July 17 in connection with the slaying of
the 28-year-old Ward, whose mutilated and charred remains were
found Sept. 13, 1988 in reserve near the Tanzanian border.
	   Officials first claimed she had been attacked and killed by wild
animals.
	   Although Attorney General Amos Wako told a news conference with
Ward's father, John, a day after the arrest that there was
sufficient evidence to hold Makallah, he was not formally charged
until two months later and was denied bail.

Canadian official stresses need for NATO back-up in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ A senior Canadian official said Friday
that his country would deploy personnel in Kosovo to monitor the
peace deal only if the United Nations authorizes a tough NATO
response to transgressions.
	   Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy said the safety of
monitors verifying the Oct. 12 peace deal in the Serb province is
``absolutely essential.''
	   ``NATO has got to be a partner in this thing, because otherwise
I think the verification mission loses its credibility,'' Axworthy
told The Associated Press.
	   ``We've been through some pretty harrowing experiences ... when
we were in Bosnia about the way people can be manipulated or used
as hostages,'' he said during a visit to Lisbon.
	   Canadians are a part of the 36,000 troops serving in the
multinational NATO-led peace force in Bosnia.
	   Axworthy said he got reassurances Thursday from American
diplomat William Walker that there would be a ``robust NATO
back-up'' for the Kosovo operation.
	   Walker is leading efforts to organize a team to verify
compliance with the Kosovo peace deal.
	   He has hit snags because would-be contributor nations want the
U.N. Security Council to endorse the plan, including the threat of
NATO action against Serb and ethnic Albanian transgressors, before
they commit personnel.
	   Axworthy said he was ``very encouraged'' by progress made
Thursday at the U.N. Security Council on a resolution endorsing the
Kosovo peace pact.
	   Russia and China have opposed any language threatening Serbs and
ethnic Albanians with force if they don't comply with the
agreement, which averted NATO strikes on Serb targets.

Thousands defy police ban and hold reform rally

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Thousands of anti-government
demonstrators braved the threat of arrest Friday to gather at the
national mosque for a rally demanding political reforms.
	   Protesters waved their fists and shouted ``Reform!'', while
passing cars honked in rhythm with the opposition rally cry.
	   Hundreds hopped on motorcycles, their helmets over their white
caps donned for Friday afternoon prayers, and headed toward
Parliament, where Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad was unveiling the
1999 budget.
	   But they never made it. Dozens of riot police moved in and
dispersed the crowd with water cannon.
	   Police detained six people including a Malaysian TV cameraman
working for an Australian television station for obstructing the
police in discharging their duties, the national news agency
Bernama reported.
	   Police had warned those who joined the anti-government march
could face arrest under the Internal Security Act, which allows
indefinite detainment without trial.
	   The demonstrators are supporters of jailed dissident Anwar
Ibrahim, ousted as deputy prime minister and finance minister on
Sept. 2.
	   Police have declared illegal all demonstrations in support of
Anwar, who is awaiting trial on charges of graft and sexual
misconduct. So far, authorities have detained 262 people who have
attended anti-government rallies, releasing them on bail pending
trial.
	   City police chief Kamaruddin Ali said that no one had applied
for permit to hold Friday's demonstration, as required by law in
this Southeast Asian country.
	   ``We charged ... people on Wednesday for illegal assembly and
will not hesitate to do the same again,'' Kamaruddin was quoted as
saying in Friday editions of The Star.
	   Meanwhile, 18 non-governmental groups issued a joint statement
Friday condemning police of ``flagrant abuse of power'' by using
batons and canes to injure bystanders and onlookers.
	   Since Anwar's arrest last month, tens of thousands of Malaysians
have gathered regularly in the capital and other cities to demand
justice for the jailed politician.
	   Anwar, who showed up at his first court appearance bruised and
beaten, faces trial Nov. 2 on 10 counts of corruption and illegal
homosexual acts. He has condemned the charges as false and
politically motivated.
	   The political scandal and apparent police brutality against
Anwar have soured political relations with other nations. The
presidents of Indonesia and the Philippines have expressed sympathy
with the dissident.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton won't meet with Mahathir during the
APEC summit because of U.S. concerns over the handling of Anwar,
administration sources said Thursday.
	   The U.S. House International Affairs Committee released a letter
Thursday to Clinton from committee Chairman Benjamin Gilman and
Rep. Doug Bereuter urging the president to speak ``forcefully'
about human rights in Malaysia.
	   Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi called the
comments by the congressmen arrogant.
	   ``They should realize that they are the ones who are being
highly offensive towards Malaysia,'' he said.

Weeklong talks set to end in agreement to return UN to Kabul
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KATHY GANNON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ After a week of talks, the United
Nations was set to sign an agreement Friday with Afghanistan's
hard-line Taliban religious militia to return to the war-shattered
country, Taliban and U.N. sources said.
	   The United Nations pulled its 50 international staff out of
Afghanistan in August after three of its employees were killed.
	   ``We want the U.N. to return to Afghanistan and they want to
return, but they are concerned about their security,'' said Sher
Mohammed Stanikzai, a Taliban negotiator and deputy minister of
public health.
	   ``We are only talking security,'' he said. ``We are not talking
human rights or programs ... not with this group.''
	   The two sides were hammering out the details of a joint
statement to be issued later Friday, Taliban officials said.
	   Relations between the Taliban army, which controls roughly 90
percent of Afghanistan, and the United Nations have been strained
for months. The world body has been at loggerheads with Taliban
administrators over aid distribution and lack of equal access for
women and girls.
	   The international community has isolated the Taliban since it
forced women off the job, forced them to wear the all-enveloping
burqa, and closed schools for girls. Women often are publicly
beaten for traveling outside their home unaccompanied by a male
relative.
	   It was not immediately possible to get a comment from the United
Nations on when issues, other than security, would be on the agenda
for talks with the Taliban.
	   However, a U.N. official, who requested anonymity, said dialogue
with the Taliban would continue _ but from within Afghanistan.
	   U.N. programs in areas controlled by the Taliban's opposition
have been suspended for nearly one year because of the relentless
lawlessness and fighting. U.N. warehouses in opposition-run areas
have been ransacked, vehicles stolen and premises invaded.
	   The opposition leaders, led by former military chief Ahmed Shah
Massood and former Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani, say they
cannot guarantee security.

 &UR; EDS: CORRECTS Oceania representative to New Zealand. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ World Cup champion France withdrew from January's
Confededrations Cup on Friday, casting a shadow over the tournament
many European leagues complained about due to its timing.
	   French league president Noel Le Graet the Confederations Cup was
``just for fun,'' noting that Brazil was only sending its ``B''
team and some club owners _ notably of Italian teams _ had said
they weren't going to release their players.
	   That leaves the Jan. 8-20 event in Mexico, billed as FIFA's
tournament of continental champions, with Brazil, Mexico, Bolivia,
the United States, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and New Zealand.
	   Some federations and particularly European leagues regard the
event as an unneeded, one that exhausts already burned out players,
and comes in the middle of the European season.
	   France's ``Les Bleus'' were scheduled to represent Europe in the
competition.
	   Roger Lemerre, the new coach of the French team, had been in
favor of the French team's participation, which would have allowed
him to test new players.
	   There was no immediate comment from FIFA or Mexican organizers.
But having the World Cup champions withdraw is a blow to FIFA,
which could respond with sanctions.
	   January's tournament will be the fourth edition of the
championship, first contested in 1992 and always previously held in
Saudi Arabia.

Euro: introduced not with a bang, but with two months changeover

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Germany's Finance Ministry, banks and
businesses agreed Friday that Europe's future single currency, the
euro, will be eased into circulation over two months in 2002,
rather than with a ``big bang'' as earlier suggested.
	   Fifteen groups representing banks, the retail industry and
vending machine companies agreed with Germany's Finance Ministry
that the German mark will be eased out of circulation between Jan.
1-Feb. 28, 2002.
	   The decision was largely taken to ease the burden on vending
machine companies. The industry estimates refitting the country's 2
million vending machines to accept the euro will cost about one
billion marks (dlrs 625 million.)
	   The agreement affects only Germany, one of 11 of the European
Union's 15 countries that will merge monetary policy on Jan. 1.
From that day, policy decisions shift from national central banks
or finance ministries to a governing council of the European
Central Bank in Frankfurt. The euro will have a set exchange rate
against the national currencies being phased out.
	   The actual introduction of bills and coins is the last phase of
the union, set for New Year's Day 2002. According to agreements,
countries may draw up their own timetable for switching, provided
it's done over six months from January to June, 2002.
	   In Germany, five national banking associations agreed that banks
will accept German mark notes and coins for over-the-counter
transactions for the first two months of 2002.
	   Likewise, shops will accept the national currency, although they
will only take coins up to the 20 marks (dlrs 12.50) in total
value.
	   Germany's Economic Ministry welcomed the agreement, saying it
will secure ``a successful entry'' to the euro. ``Customers will
get the necessary information and at the same time complicated
bureaucratic rules and costs will be avoided,'' the Economics
Ministry said in a statement.
	   The agreement was a ``pretty sensible compromise,'' said Jens
Ulbrich, European monetary analyst at the Dresdner Bank.
	   With a big bang approach, ``they would have had to close off the
entire circulation of the mark in one go. And then in one go,
create a new circulation for the euro,'' said Ulbrich.
	   ``I doubt if they even have enough money transport vans to do
it. What would they do, ask the army to help?'' Ulbrich asked.
	   Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank, believes the big bang
could have worked. They have some experience: in July 1990, months
after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the bank overnight brought West
Germany's mark to the five new states of communist East Germany.
Three months later the two Germanies were united politically.
	   Vending machine companies still regard the agreement as the best
of a bad deal.
	   ``This is going to cost a lot of money and we're not going to
get any of it back. I'm not sure I'm that happy,'' said Gerhard
Trost-Heutmerkers, managing director of the Federal Association of
Vending Machine Companies.
	   The decision allows businesses to continue accepting marks for
two months, but in a nod to the size of the task, the agreement
also called for ``flexibility'' after Feb. 28, apparently giving
leeway to ordinary citizens mastering the transition.

Clinton, Arafat brief Mubarak on talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt said Friday
that the new Israeli-Palestinian deal should include clear measures
for ensuring its implementation.
	   Mubarak's comments came during telephone conversations with U.S.
President Bill Clinton and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat during
peace negotiations at Wye Plantation in Maryland, Egypt's Middle
East News Agency said.
	   It said Clinton spoke with Mubarak twice. Arafat, who is in
frequent contact with Mubarak, called once to brief him on the
outcome of the negotiations over the last two days, MENA said.
	   It was not clear if the calls were made before or after the deal
was reached.
	   MENA also quoted Egypt's ambassador to France as saying that
contacts at the highest levels were going on between Cairo and
Paris over the deal.
	   Meanwhile in Syria, the Democratic Front for the Liberation of
Palestine, a hard-line group opposed to Israeli-Palestinian peace,
blasted the deal, saying it would increase tension in the
Palestinian territories.
	   The agreement is a ``dictate deal'' and Palestinian negotiators
have ``met Israeli demands for security, which are needed more by
the Palestinian people,'' said a statement issued by the group
Friday.
	   DFLP followers also demonstrated at the entrance of a
Palestinian refugee camp in Beirut, Lebanon, shouting anti-American
and anti-Israel slogans.
	   In a statement, the DFLP described the agreement as ``merely a
dictation made by the strong on the weak under an American
supervision biased towards the Israeli arrogant policy.''

China, Vietnam drawn together for Asia 2000 qualifying
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Ancient adversaries China and Vietnam
were drawn together Friday and will face off in qualifying for the
12th Asian Cup in 2000.
	   The two, which most recently fought a war in 1979, will play in
Group Nine with the Philippines and Guam. Qualifying is scheduled
for January to June 2000 for the 12-team finals in Lebanon Oct.
12-29 later that year.
	   A record 44 teams were drawn into 10 groups, with 1992 champion
Japan placed in Group 10 with Singapore, Macao and Brunei; and
South Korea, the other regional power and World Cup qualifier,
bundled with Myanmar (Burma), Laos and Mongolia in Group Six.
	   Defending and three-time champion Saudi Arabia and host Lebanon
are exempt from qualifying. Only the group winners advance to the
finals.
	   The United Arab Emirates, losers in the 1996 final to Saudi
Arabia, was drawn into Group 3 with Uzbekistan, India, Sri Lanka
and Bangladesh.
	   The 44-nation participation includes every country in the Asian
Football Confederation except Afghanistan.
	   ``We are very encouraged by the excellent partcipation,'' AFC
secretary general Peter Velappan said. ``The numbers reflect the
growing interest not just in football amongst our members but is

Nokia reports surging sales, profit

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Nokia's cellular phone sales nearly
doubled in the third quarter, helping to fuel a 75 percent increase
in pretax profit for the first nine months of the year, to 9.6
billion markkaa (dlrs 1.9 billion).
	   Net sales for all Nokia's divisions jumped to 53.3 billion
markkaa (dlrs 10.6 billion) compared with 36.7 billion markkaa for
the January-September period last year.
	   During the third quarter, sales of mobile phones surged to 12.9
billion markkaa (dlrs 2.58 billion) from 6.6 billion markkaa in
1997, and for the nine-month period were up to 31.9 billion markkaa
(dlrs 6.38 billion) from 20 billion markkaa last year.
	   Nokia's profit was 1 billion markkaa higher than market analysts
had predicted, and the group's president Jorma Ollila said the
results had surpassed the company's own expectations.
	   ``We now feel confident in declaring that we have significantly
increased our market share in mobile phones to become the largest
manufacturer of mobile phones worldwide,'' Ollila said.
	   Last year, Nokia sold 21 million cellular hand sets, making it
the world's second largest mobile phone maker after Motorola Inc.,
based in Schaumburg, Illinois.
	   Ollila said preliminary market data indicate Nokia has now
overtaken Motorola.
	   Nokia's good result was mainly due to ``lower than anticipated
price erosion in mobile phones, and rapid digitalization in the
Americas,'' Ollila said.
	   He said the company expected strong growth to continue for the
rest of the year in China, Europe and in its main market, the
United States, and predicted a good overall result for the year.
	   Nokia is a world leader in digital mobile phone technology, and
has supplied GSM equipment to 67 operators in 35 countries. It has
sales in 130 countries, and employs 42,000 people.

	   GENEVA (AP) _ A private Italian firm's plan for a breakaway
European soccer Super League looked virtually dead Friday after the
continent's top clubs rejected it in favor of reforms to existing
competitions proposed by the sport's European governing body UEFA.
	   Representatives from AC Milan, Real Madrid and 10 other major
clubs said after a meeting with UEFA officials that they would
forego benefits of Milan-based Media Partners' planned Super League
in order to stay within UEFA.
	   The private Italian sports management company's project is now
``lying dormant.'' UEFA's proposals for changing its European
Champions League are acceptable in principle, the officials added.
	   ``UEFA has come up with practical proposals and I think we can
say the meeting has historical importance,'' Adriano Galliani, the
vice president of AC Milan, told a news conference after the
meeting.
	   At a meeting in Lisbon, Portugal earlier this month, UEFA
revealed plans to extend next season's European Champions' League
to include 32 clubs playing in eight groups of four teams in the
first stage. The competition currently comprises 24 teams.
	   The new format will include more teams from Europe's top-ranking
soccer nations while also incorporating more teams from smaller
nations, broadening the potential television audience for games.
	   The UEFA Cup and Cup Winners Cup will be merged into one
competition, called the UEFA Cup. Details still have to be worked
out.
	   The proposed reforms are part of UEFA's bid to dissuade Europe's
top clubs from defecting to Media Partners' Super League.
	   The firm is enticing the continent's top clubs with a payout of
some dlrs 1.2 billion for participation in its league _ far more
than the dlrs 322 million generated by the Champions League in
1997-98, of which only dlrs 157 million went to the clubs.
	   Some clubs had feared Media Partners' plan would make the rich
clubs richer and the poor clubs poorer.
	   UEFA, which has run European soccer for decades and is keen to
ensure the loyalty of European clubs, has threatened to suspend
clubs and players who opt into the proposed Super League.
	   Galliani said the Media Partners proposal had been of
considerable interest to the 12 clubs, but said they currently
don't have contact with the firm and the project is at the moment
``lying dormant.''
	   President of Real Madrid, Lorenzo Sanz, told reporters they are
ready to cooperate with UEFA not just in their own interests but
for the whole of European soccer.
	   He said the clubs had been surprised by UEFA's ``good footwork''
and congratulated the body for the ``excellent headway'' it had
made in drawing up the reforms.
	   ``The situation is quite good and I am sure there will be good
cooperation in the future,'' he said.
	   ``The tone of the meeting was extremely positive,'' Peter
Kenyon, deputy chief executive of England's Manchester United,
said.
	   In order to finance the revamped league, UEFA has said it would
investigate the possibility of pay per view and pay TV, but said
broadcasting contracts and marketing would remain under its
control. UEFA remains unwilling to allow national leagues to take
control of domestic TV rights.
	   At Friday's meeting, Galliani said UEFA had discussed details of
TV ownership rights and how much money would be at stake, but
declined to give details.
	   Sanz said clubs would have a go-between role in facilitating
cooperation between TV companies and UEFA, but also refused to be
specific.
	   UEFA representatives at the meeting included Senior Vice
President Antonio Matarrese and General Secretary Gerhard Aigner,
general secretary.
	   ``It seems to me we have been able to build up a mutual trust
today,'' Aigner said.
	   Clubs represented at the meeting also included Bayern Munich of
Germany, FC Barcelona of Spain, AFC Ajax of Holland, Borussia
Dortmund of Germany, Internazionale and Juventus of Italy,
Liverpool from England, FC Porto of Portugal and Olympique
Marseille of France.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Police found a video studio for copying
pornographic films at a defense plant in Nizhny Novgorod, Russia's
third-largest city, the ITAR-Tass news agency said Friday.

Talks make slow progress on procedural issues
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ North and South Korea, the United States and China
inched forward Friday with talks on a permanent peace treaty for
the divided and tense Korean peninsula.
	   Progress was made toward setting up two sub-committees to
discuss how to replace the current armistice and how to build
confidence between the longtime foes, officials said.
	   Disagreement over procedures has held up progress in two earlier
rounds of talks and highlighted how long and tricky the
negotiations are likely to be.
	   North Korea previously demanded that the four countries agree on
an agenda _ including its demands for withdrawal of the 37,000 U.S.
troops from South Korea _ before setting up working groups.
	   Park Kun-woo, leader of the South Korean delegation and chairman
of the current meeting, said a morning session on the procedural
issues was ``constructive.''
	   Asked whether agreement was near on the two sub-committees, he
replied:
	   ``We are going in this direction,'' Park said.
	   Agreement on procedures is vital because only after that can the
Geneva talks address the substance of a full peace treaty to
replace the armistice that ended the 1950-53 Korean war.
	   The border between the Koreas is the world's most heavily armed,
with nearly 2 million troops deployed on both sides.
	   Annual military maneuvers held jointly by South Korean forces
and their U.S. allies are scheduled to begin Monday.
	   Tensions flared this year after Pyongyang's Aug. 31 launch of a
small satellite, which was originally thought to be a ballistic
missile.
	   The launch showed the North's reclusive communist government had
developed a more advanced missile technology system than the United
States and its allies had previously believed.
	   At talks in New York earlier this month, North Korea rebuffed a
U.S. demand that it stop testing and exporting long-range missiles.
	   However, North Korea is under pressure to make some compromises
as it desperately needs foreign food aid to feed its 23 million
people.
	   Decades of economic mismanagement have led to chronic shortages,
aggravated by three years of flooding and drought. Some U.S.
experts have estimated that 2 million North Koreans may have died
in the famine.

Lions beat BayStars 4-2, even series
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKOROZAWA, Japan (AP) _ Domingo Martinez slammed a game-winning
homerun Friday as the Seibu Lions beat the Yokohama BayStars 4-2 to
even Japan's professional baseball championship series at two games
to two.
	   Seibu starter Takashi Ishii, who gave up the fewest homeruns in
the Pacific League during the regular season, took a three-hitter
into the ninth inning and picked up the win before 31,000
spectators at Seibu Dome.
	   With the game tied 2-2 in the bottom of the sixth, Martinez
blasted his two-run shot into the left field bleachers after
infielder Taisei Takagi's single.
	   Martinez, of the Dominican Republic, formerly played for
Rochester in the U.S. Triple-A Leagues. He was a .283 hitter with
30 home runs in the regular season _ and hitless in the first three
games of the Japan Series.
	   Coming off a 7-2 win at home the previous night, the Lions
maintained their momentum and drew first blood Friday with a
two-run homer in the second by catcher Satoshi Nakajima.
	   The BayStars evened the score in the fourth when outfielder
Takanori Suzuki cracked a two-run homer off an Ishii fastball.
	   The BayStars trounced Seibu in the opening games of the series
and many expected the Central League champs to walk away with the
championship. But a sloppy pitching effort in Game 3 _ in which
Yokohama allowed 11 walks that led to 6 runs _ put the Lions back
into contention.
	   The Lions survived a scare Friday in the ninth when stopper
Yukihiro Nishizaki walked two to load the bases, but Nishizaki
struck out Takahiro Saeki for the last out.
	   The BayStars reached the best-of-seven series by winning their
first Central League Pennant in 38 years, and only their second
ever. They won the Japan Series in 1960.
	   The Pacific League champion Lions have won the Japan Series
eight times, but lost last year to the Yakult Swallows, four games
to one.
	   Game 5 is scheduled for Saturday at Seibu Dome.

Austrian chief denies doping accusations
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INSERTS Maier comments in grafs 17-18; fixes spelling of
training center in 20th graf &QL; 
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SOELDEN, Austria (AP) _ Austria's top ski official on Friday
denied accusations that his team's World Cup success last season
was due to the use of banned performance-enhancing drugs.
	   Austrian alpine director Hans Pum expressed anger over a recent
article in the Swiss daily paper ``Sport'' which quoted Swiss ski
boss Theo Nadig questionning the rapid physical development and
supremacy of Austrian star Hermann Maier and others.
	   ``I cannot understand how someone can make such a statement so
carelessly expecially at such a sensitive time,'' Pum said during
the annual pre-season International Ski Federation conference.
``For years I've seen Switzerland beat us and while it was a bitter
pill we accepted it as fair.
	   ``These statements were said at a time to destabilize our team
but we won't be ruffled.''
	   ``Sport'' quoted Nadig as saying that a diet of pasta and
granola could not explain Maier's rapid gain of muscle mass.
	   ``... Even if you train a lot, an athlete can only gain about 3
1/2 to 4 1/4 kilos (7-8.5 pounds) of muscle mass, and even that's a
lot,'' Nadig said in the article. ``But when you hear what's said
about Hermann Maier's development, you get suspicious. Alone, pasta
and Muesli won't achieve that.''
	   FIS said Friday it would investigate the matter, and that Nadig
could face sanctions for making accusations without supporting
evidence.
	   ``We must see and study the article,'' said newly appointed FIS
president Gian Franco Kasper, who is Swiss.
	   ``If he's really accusing the Austrians without proof we might
have to take severe sanctions against him. If he has proof, he
should have gone through the proper channels and come to us.''
	   On Friday, Nadig told The Associated Press he felt such measures
would be unfair.
	   ``If I'm sanctioned for saying I want tougher drug control,
well, that doesn't sound right to me,'' he said. ``Three Swiss
cyclists were involved and admitted to taking banned substances
(during the Tour de France), so in Switzerland we're now very
sceptical.
	   ``I think doping exists in skiing and if we want to prevent what
happened in cycling we must take the proper measures now,'' Nadig
said. ``The reasons are there for skiers to turn to such methods.''
	   In a heated confrontation between the two officials during the
conference, Nadig eventually softened his statements.
	   ``I'm not accusing anybody,'' he said. ``I was just curious.
Hermann Maier is the reference point and as the head of the Swiss
team it's my job to find the best ways to train my skiers and
provide them with the best training possible.
	   ``I don't think that kind of muscle mass can be developed just
from pasta and Muesli (granola) and I was curious to know what they
were doing.''
	   Speculation over Maier began rumbling last season, when he
emerged from obscurity to win two Olympic gold medals, the giant
slalom and super-g World Cup titles as well as the overall World
Cup crown.
	   In a recent interview in the Austrian sports magazine
``Sportmagazin,'' Maier called the accusations ``not very funny''
and urged more drug testing in skiing.
	   ``Naturally, I want to know if other athletes are clean,'' he
said. ``I know that I am. Therefore, I find it important that in
ski sport there are more (doping) controls, so the uncertainty will
fall away.''
	   In addition, Maier's name has been linked with doctor Bernd
Pansold, the last coach of the Eastern German women's swimming
team.
	   Asked about Maier's alleged visits to the Obertauern independent
Olympic training center in Austria where Pansold works, Pum said he
exercised no control over where the skier trained.
	   Over the summer, some 450-500 out-of-competition drug tests were
carried out, FIS said, and none were positive.
	   The FIS will convene Nov. 28-29 to discuss the issue of drugs in
skiing with other winter sports federations, before attending the
world conference on doping organized by the International Olympic
Committee in February.
	   ``FIS follows the Olympic movement with doping controls,''
Kasper said. ``The FIS wants to take a hardline on doping.''

Serb reporters held by rebels soon to be released
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Two Serb reporters held by ethnic
Albanian rebels are soon to be released, the political
representative of the Kosovo Liberation Army said Friday.
	   KLA representative Adem Demaci told media that he had been aware
since Wednesday night that the two missing reporters from the
state-run Tanjug news agency were in rebel hands.
	   ``We were all glad they had been found and were in safe hands,''
Demaci said, adding the rebel army would go through a necessary
investigation to determine if the two had been involved in any
crimes against ethnic Albanians.
	   Vladimir Dobricic and Nebojsa Radosevic, a journalist and
photographer for Tanjug, disappeared Sunday near the village of
Magura, 25 kilometers (15 miles) southwest of Pristina.
	   The ethnic Albanian guerrilla, fighting Serb and Yugoslav
government forces for independence of Kosovo, said in a statement
distributed Thursday that the two were detained after a KLA patrol
ran across them.
	   Demaci said that the two Tanjug reporters attempted to conceal
their identity from the KLA and had tried to escape. He pledged to
use his influence with the KLA to speed up the release.
	   ``The international community and the public need not worry
about these two gentlemen ... they will be released, provided they
have not committed any unforgivable crime,'' Demaci concluded.
	   The release of the two reporters was expected to be organized
through the International Committee of the Red Cross. (ICRC).

NATO sends top military commanders to Belgrade for Kosovo talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO decided Friday to send two top
military commanders to Belgrade this weekend to warn Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic he has only a few days left to comply
with the Kosovo agreement.
	   NATO's two top military commanders in Europe, U.S. Gen. Wesley
Clark and German General Klaus Naumann, will insist that more
Yugoslav special police units return to their barracks and take
their heavy weapons with them, a NATO official said.
	   The NATO official, who requested anonymity, said the government
had withdrawn some units from Kosovo, but that it was far from
adequate compliance.
	   NATO is maintaining the threat of airstrikes against Serbia
until at least Tuesday to make sure Milosevic abides by an Oct. 12
peace agreement to reduce his forces in Kosovo to the levels before
the February crackdown against ethnic Albanian rebels.
	   The two generals are expected to meet Milosevic on Saturday and
return to Brussels by Sunday to brief the ambassadors of the 16
NATO nations. The ambassadors will meet Monday to assess the
generals' report.

Greek Culture Ministry: Clerics demand return of Archimedes Text
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ELENA BECATOROS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greek Orthodox clerics are demanding the
return of the only known copy of a text by the ancient Greek
scientist Archimedes due to be auctioned next week, Greece's
culture ministry said Friday.
	   But if the manuscript's current holders _ a French family _ do
not return the 1,000-year-old copy, the Orthodox Patriarchate of
Jerusalem would consider taking legal measures, Culture Minister
Evangelos Venizelos said.
	   ``According to the Jerusalem Patriarchate, the manuscript has
been stolen,'' Venizelos said.
	   An auction for the 174-leaf text has been set for Oct. 29 at
Christie's in New York. It includes transcriptions of writings on
geometry and physics by the 3rd century BC theoretician and
inventor. Christie's anticipated it could fetch between dlrs
800,000 to dlrs 1.2 million.
	   Officials at Christie's could not immediately be reached for
comment. But the auction house previously said it would call off
the sale if there were compelling challenges to its ownership.
	   Venizelos originally appealed to several Greek groups and
businesses to pool funds to bid on the text.
	   But then questions were raised the ownership of the manuscript,
which was lost when the Patriarchate's library was transferred to
Athens from Constantinople _ now Istanbul _ after World War I. It
had been housed earlier in Orthodox monasteries in Palestine.
	   If the Jerusalem Patriarchate can prove its ownership, the
manuscript _ known as the Archimedes Palimpsest _ will be housed in
Athens' National Library, Venizelos said.
	   A palimpsest is a manuscript whose pages have been written on
twice. When writing materials were in short supply, the original
text would be washed away when no longer deemed useful.
	   A U.S. lawyer for the Jerusalem Patriarchate, Simos Dimas,
drafted a letter to Christie's to demand the manuscript's return,
Venizelos said. Christie's has not released the name of the family
that placed the text up for auction.
	   According to a statement by Felix de Marez Oyens, the head of
the auction house's Books and Manuscripts Department, Christie's is
satisfied it ``has been legitimately owned by a French family for
the last three-quarters of a century.''
	   If the auction goes ahead, the Greek government will bid for it,
Venizelos stresses.
	   ``If the outcome is negative for legal issues _ because
historically and morally, there is no doubt that the Patriarchate
is right _ of course we will return to our efforts of purchasing
this manuscript,'' he said.

Duma: Russia should offer Serbs weapons in case of NATO strikes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian lawmakers on Friday warned NATO against
airstrikes on Yugoslavia, saying that would prompt Moscow to offer
weapons to Serbs.
	   The statement from parliament's lower house, the State Duma, has
little practical meaning, since Russia's foreign and defense policy
is shaped entirely by President Boris Yeltsin.
	   The Kremlin has strongly opposed NATO's proposed airstrikes, but
never suggested it would go as far as to respond to them by helping
Serbs with weapons.
	   The Duma called on Yeltsin to take steps at the United Nations
and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to
persuade NATO to drop its threat of air raids against the Serbs.
	   If NATO still proceeds with airstrikes, Russia should consider
itself free of obligations under the U.N. embargo on arms sales to
Yugoslavia and ``provide weapons and other military hardware if
Yugoslavia asks for it,'' the Duma said.
	   Russia shares Slavic roots and the Orthodox Christian religion
with Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
	   NATO is maintaining the threat of airstrikes against Serbia
until at least next Tuesday in an attempt to make sure Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic abides by a peace agreement he reached
on Oct. 12 with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke and withdraws troops
from Kosovo.

Yugoslav high school student killed in scuffle with police

	   SALONICA, Greece (AP) _ A Yugoslav high school student on a
class trip was shot and killed Friday by a police officer who
suspected he was a purse snatcher.
	   According to police reports, 17-year-old Marco Bulatovic was
shot at point-blank range by a plainclothes officer in a crowded
shopping district.
	   Bulatovic was part of a group of 210 students from a Belgrade
technical high school in Greece for a week-long trip. According to
media reports quoting the students, the class was not in the city
at the time of the alleged purse snatching.
	   After spending a few days of the Ioanian Sea island of Corfu,
the students stopped in the northern city of Salonica for
last-minute shopping before heading for the nearby Macedonian
border.
	   Police had received a phone call from a woman who said her purse
snatched by a foreign teen-ager. She directed uniformed officers,
accompanied by a plainclothes member of the security police, to a
group of five students who were window shopping.
	   Police said the plainclothes officer drew his pistol and asked
the group to freeze. His pistol allegedly fired by accident, police
said.
	   An initial examination by a city coroner indicated there were
powder burns on the teen-ager's shirt, which would be caused by a
pistol going at very close range.

Will Nobel strengthen Trimble's hold over divided Ulster Unionist
</HEADLINE>
Party? &QL; 
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Protestant leader David
Trimble, far from basking in an uncritical glow from his Nobel
Peace Prize, is feeling pressure from all sides as his feuding
Ulster Unionist Party prepares for its annual conference Saturday.
	   Trimble, credited with delivering a bare majority of Protestant
support for April's accord on Northern Ireland, last week shared
this year's prize with Catholic moderate John Hume.
	   But even Trimble's compromise-minded supporters question whether
the international acclaim _ unprecedented for a leader of the
north's British Protestant majority _ will strengthen or complicate
his ability to keep his party from splitting over the next steps in
peacemaking.
	   Leaders of Sinn Fein, political allies of the outlawed Irish
Republican Army, are blaming Trimble for the current gridlock in
forming a new cross-community government for Northern Ireland, the
intended bedrock of the agreement.
	   Although a legislative Assembly was elected in June and
nominated Trimble to head a new administration, Trimble has
insisted he won't agree to form any government involving Sinn Fein
unless the IRA starts disarming first.
	   Hume's Social Democratic and Labor Party, the major
representative of the north's Irish Catholics, says Trimble is
wrong to insist on disarmament now, since the agreement specifies
only that it should happen by mid-2000.
	   But many Ulster Unionists are determined not to sit down in
government with Sinn Fein as long as the IRA, 15 months into a
truce, reserves the right to hold stockpiled weaponry.
	   Trimble can't afford to lose many votes in the Assembly, where
he commands support from just 30 of 58 unionists.
	   ``The Nobel is a great personal honor for David Trimble. But the
Ulster Unionist grassroots would be suspicious of what Mr. Trimble
may have had to give away in exchange for that prize,'' said Peter
Weir, a former Trimble ally who broke with his leader on the eve of
the agreement.
	   Sinn Fein leaders dismiss others' fears that Trimble could be
toppled and replaced by a politician hostile to the accord. They
argue that the Ulster Unionist chief should wield the Nobel honor
as a weapon against his critics.
	   ``He must tell them that they have had their day,'' said Martin
McGuinness, a reputed former IRA commander, who is tipped as likely
to be one Sinn Fein's two representatives in any new adminstration.

Russia plans `space mirror' experiment to light cities from orbit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS lead to restore dropped word `The,' UPDATES with more
details in new grafs 5-6, 9. &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian space agency is preparing an
extravagant experiment with a space mirror that would illuminate
sun-starved northern cities and act as a ``solar sail,'' officials
said on Friday.
	   The Znamya (Banner) experiment is to be launched next February
and envisages unfolding a space mirror made of a membrane covered
by a metal layer. In theory, the mirror is to work like the moon,
reflecting sunlight onto some northern parts of Russia during the
long nights.
	   The mirror, around 100 feet (30 meters) in diameter, would serve
as a prototype for even larger models that may go up later,
provided the cash-strapped space agency comes up with funds, said
Mission Control spokesman Valery Lyndin.
	   ``Of course, longer-term prospects are unclear, given the
current fund shortage,'' Lyndin said in a telephone interview.
	   Russia also plans to discard the Mir next year, making further
experiments with space mirror unlikely in the foreseeable future,
he added.
	   Lyndin also acknowledged that building larger mirrors of several
hundreds feets (meters) in diameter would be a much more complex
technical task, because they would be much harder to unfold and
maneuver in orbit.
	   According to the plan, the folded membrane is to be attached to
a Progress cargo ship, which is scheduled to blast off for the Mir
space station on Sunday and dock with it on Tuesday.
	   The Progress will unfold the mirror in February, when the cargo
ship will be undocked from the Mir. Usually, it would be discarded.
In this case, the station's crew will guide the cargo ship using
manual controls for a while to see how the mirror performs.
	   Lyndin wouldn't say exactly how long the experiment would last.
Eventually, the cargo ship would be allowed to burn in the
atmosphere as usual.
	   He said that the scientists will also study the membrane as a
potential ``solar sail,'' a feature that might allow spaceships of
the distant future to sail through space using solar wind.
	   In February 1993, Russia ran a similar experiment, but the
mirror was barely visible on Earth, Lyndin said. The new Znamya
also would be visible only in good weather and to those who knew
its precise position in orbit. It would resemble a shooting star,
not a large object such as the moon.
	   The mirror had been scheduled to be taken into orbit earlier
this year, but the experiment was delayed due to the fund shortage.
	   The money crunch also led to the postponement of the new
Progress launch, which had been originally planned for Oct. 15.
	   Along with the mirror, which weighs only about 4 kilograms (less
than nine pounds), the cargo ship will deliver some 2.5 tons of
regular cargo, including fuel, food, water, equipment and other
supplies to the Mir, Lyndin said.
	   Among the equipment is a French-made device to study a stream of
micro-meteorites bombarding Mir's surface.
	   Russian cosmonauts Gennady Padalka and Sergei Avdeyev will go on
a spacewalk tentatively scheduled for Nov. 11 to attach the gauge
to the station's outer surface, Lyndin said.
	   Space officials initially planned to keep the 12-year-old Mir in
orbit through the end of 1999, but the last crew is now expected to
depart next June because of the money shortage.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Echoing Western claims, Kosovo's
main ethnic Albanian leader said Friday that Yugoslavia has not
removed its troops from the province and that little progress has
been made to defuse the crisis.
	   With NATO's latest deadline for compliance only four days away,
the Alliance decided Friday to send its supreme commander Gen.
Wesley Clark and German General Klaus Naumann to Belgrade this
weekend to insist that Yugoslavia speed the troop drawdown in
Kosovo.
	   ``We have seen great progress but we are still far from adequate
compliance,'' a NATO official told reporters in Brussels, Belgium,
on condition of anonymity.
	   Fighting has all but ceased in the southern Serbian province,
but tension remains high here despite the agreement reached Oct. 12
between Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and U.S. envoy
Richard Holbrooke to avert NATO airstrikes.
	   State-run Tanjug news agency reported Friday one Yugoslav army
soldier was killed Thursday and another seriously wounded when
ethnic Albanians attacked an army supply convoy traveling on the
main artery from the provincial capital Pristina to the
southwestern town of Pec.
	   The report says the army unit responded to the attack, but gave
no further details. The statement corresponds with diplomatic
observers' report of hearing heavy tank fire in the surrounding
Drenica region, also Thursday.
	   In efforts to reinforce the Oct. 12 accord, American diplomat
William Walker arrived in the Yugoslav capital Belgrade late
Thursday to oversee the establishment of a 2,000-member mission to
make sure Milosevic honors the agreement.
	   Walker will head the mission under the direction of the
Vienna-based Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
Walker met Milosevic early Friday and was to leave for the Kosovo
capital Pristina to meet Rugova.
	   Following talks with Walker, the Yugoslav president said in a
statement that he ``expects successful cooperation'' between the
OSCE mission and the Yugoslav coordinating commission which will be
headed by one of his top aides, Nikola Sainovic.
	   Milosevic also expressed hopes the OSCE mission would help in
the ``intensifying of the political process ... which should secure
peaceful solution of the existing problems,'' said the statement,
carried by Tanjug.
	   The rebel Kosovo Liberation Army has insisted it will not
abandon its goal of independence. The United States and the
Europeans reject independence but support some form of autonomy for
Kosovo.
	   The U.N. refugee agency said Friday that only a ``trickle'' of
refugees are returning to their homes because of fear and
intimidation by Serb police.
	   ``The impression our staff got on the ground is while some
people trickle back to their ruined homes, widespread destruction
of housing and fear of the continued Serb military and police
presence prevent significant return,'' U.N. spokesman Kris Janowski
said in Geneva, Switzerland.
	   More than 10 days after Holbrooke and Milosevic reached the
agreement, ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova told reporters
``the Serbian forces have not yet withdrawn from Kosovo,'' despite
Yugoslav claims to the contrary.
	   ``We cannot say any progress was made and NATO should maintain
its 'activation order' and keep pressing the Belgrade government,''
Rugova said.
	   Yugoslavia insists it has met NATO demands to withdraw troops to
the levels they were at before Milosevic began his crackdown in
February to suppress an ethnic Albanian revolt in Kosovo.
	   U.S. and other Western diplomats dispute this, however, warning
that continuing violence threatens the Serbian province's peace
process and raises the threat of NATO airstrikes. NATO has extended
the deadline until Tuesday for Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic to comply.
	   Hundreds have been killed and hundreds of thousands driven from
their homes by the violence. The majority of Kosovo's 2 million
inhabitants are ethnic Albanians, and most favor independence.
	   Laura Boldrini of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said
ethnic Albanians who returned two weeks ago to the village of
Poklek fled again this week because of intimidation by Serb police.
	   ``It's a never-ending story,'' Boldrini said.
	   But the Serb regional governor, Veljko Odalovic, accused ethnic
Albanian rebels of provoking government troops by attacking police.
Odalovic said that since Oct. 12, five policemen had been killed,
12 wounded and two Serbian journalists kidnapped by the rebels.
	   ``It's clear the terrorists want to provoke new conflicts and to
involve large numbers of police and army where they can, and the
international community knows that,'' he said.

Di Canio banned for 11 games, fined 10,000 pounds
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS spokesman for Premier League referees saying punishment
too lenient &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SHEFFIELD, England (AP) _ Sheffield Wednesday striker Paolo Di
Canio was banned for 11 games and fined 10,000 pounds (dlrs 16,900)
Friday for pushing a referee to the ground in a Sept. 26 match.
	   The 30-year-old Italian learned of his punishment after
appearing before a three-man Football Association disciplinary
panel.
	   Di Canio, who was suspended immediately after the home match by
his Sheffield club, had reportedly faced a possible ban of up to
six months from the English game.
	   ``I'm very, very sorry for what happened,'' he said at a news
conference after the verdict was announced. ``I had a fair hearing
and I accept that. I'll see the Sheffield Wednesday fans on Boxing
Day (Dec. 26), the first game after my suspension.''
	   The club said there would be no appeal.
	   ``During the hearing Paolo apologized,'' said a club spokesman
said. ``He apologizes to the commission, he apologizes to the
referee, he apologizes to the club and its fans.
	   ``The club is now looking forward to having him back playing
with us before the end of 1998.''
	   The 11-match ban includes an automatic three-game suspension for
receiving a red card. Di Canio has already served one game of the
suspension and will now miss another 10 before returning to action.
	   However, former World Cup referee Philip Don, who serves as a
spokesman for the Premier League referees, said the punishment was
too lenient.
	   ``There were 340 assaults on park referees last season,'' Don
said. ``What message does this punishment send out to them and what
confidence will they have in the FA?
	   ``It is fair to say I am disappointed with the verdict because I
thought it would be longer. ``Paolo Di Canio has been found guilty
of a major disciplinary issue and I don't think the punishment is
correct.''
	   Referee Paul Alcock was pushed to the ground after he gave Di
Canio a red card for his part in a brawl in the final minutes of
the first half of the game against Arsenal.
	   Arsenal's Martin Keown was also sent off as a melee among a
dozen players broke out following a tussle between Arsenal's
Patrick Vieira and Wim Jonk.
	   Di Canio later suggested Alcock play-acted and compared him to a
player diving to draw a penalty.
	   ``I pushed (the ref) in the stomach,'' Di Canio said last month.
``He took 3-4 steps sideways and fell like a player'' who dives for
a penalty.
	   Alcock, who denied Di Canio's allegation, said he considered
quitting the sport after the incident but had since changed his
mind.
	   ``I am certainly not going to let something like this beat me,''
Alcock said Thursday. ``I was caught totally by surprise and the
shock caused me to lose my balance.''
	   ``I thought on the way home whether I really need the pressure
of this particular incident and I have thought over the past two or
three weeks whether I need to carry on.
	   ``But at the end of the day I am certainly not going to let an
incident like that stop me refereeing.''

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Echoing Western claims, Kosovo's
main ethnic Albanian leader said Friday that Yugoslavia has not
removed its troops from the province and that little progress has
been made to defuse the crisis.
	   With NATO's latest deadline for compliance only four days away,
the Alliance decided Friday to send its supreme commander Gen.
Wesley Clark and German General Klaus Naumann to Belgrade this
weekend to insist that Yugoslavia speed the troop withdrawal in
Kosovo.
	   ``We have seen great progress but we are still far from adequate
compliance,'' a NATO official told reporters in Brussels, Belgium,
on condition of anonymity.
	   Fighting has all but ceased in the southern Serbian province,
but tension remains high here despite the agreement reached Oct. 12
between President Slobodan Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard
Holbrooke to avert NATO airstrikes.
	   State-run Tanjug news agency reported Friday one Yugoslav army
soldier was killed and another seriously wounded when ethnic
Albanians attacked an army supply convoy traveling on the main
artery from the provincial capital, Pristina, to the southwestern
town of Pec.

Turkey intensifies lobbying for Turkish route for Caspian oil
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ As the deadline approaches for a decision
on which route will link the Caspian's rich oil fields to Europe,
Turkey pressed Friday for companies to choose the Turkish route.
	   News reports have claimed that oil companies have discarded the
project to link the Azeri capital of Baku to the Turkish
Mediterranean port of Ceyhan as too costly.
	   The companies are said to favor shorter and cheaper routes,
including pipelines already built from Azerbaijan to the port of
Supsa, on Georgia's Black Sea coast or an enlarged pipeline on the
same route. The oil would then be transferred by tankers through
Istanbul's Bosporus strait.
	   But Turkish officials insisted Friday that any route implying an
increase of oil tanker traffic in the Bosporus was out of the
question.
	   ``We cannot sacrifice 12 million people and 3,000 years of
history to an oil tanker,'' State Minister in charge of maritime
affairs, Burhan Kara, was quoted as saying by the Anatolia news
agency.
	   Ankara says an increase in tanker traffic would also increase
the odds of accidents in the narrow strait.
	   Energy Minister Cumhur Ersumer said Friday that the procedures
to realize Baku-Ceyhan were ``being realized step by step.''
	   An announcement of a decision could come next week.
	   Meanwhile, the U.S. Embassy in Ankara denied reports claiming
that Washington had shelved the Turkish project.
	   The reports said that U.S. government officials had agreed in a
meeting in Washington Thursday with oil company executives that the
Baku-Ceyhan project was not commercially viable for the time being.
	   The Embassy said that on the contrary U.S. officials ``strongly
reaffirmed our commitment to make Baku-Ceyhan a reality.''
	   Next wek the U.S. Trade and Development Agency is to sign a dlrs
823,000 grant for consultation services related to the pipeline.
	   Turkish officials had mistakenly identified the TDA grant as a
U.S. Export-Import Bank loan of dlrs 827,000, later correcting
their statement.

Clubs like proposed European cups changes; Super League ``lying

dormant'' &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos GEV102-106 &QL; 
 &UR; By PHILIP WALLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Plans for a European Super League looked virtually
dead Friday after the continent's top clubs rejected proposals from
Italian media concern in favor of reforms to existing UEFA
competitions.
	   Representatives from AC Milan, Real Madrid and 10 other major
clubs said after a meeting with UEFA officials that they would
forego benefits of Milan-based Media Partners' planned Super League
in order to stay within UEFA.
	   The private Italian sports management company's project is now
``lying dormant,'' according to one club official. UEFA's proposals
for changing its European Champions League are acceptable in
principle, the officials added.
	   ``UEFA has come up with practical proposals and I think we can
say the meeting has historical importance,'' Adriano Galliani, the
vice president of AC Milan, told a news conference after the
meeting.
	   At a meeting in Lisbon, Portugal earlier this month, UEFA
revealed plans to extend next season's European Champions' League
to include 32 clubs playing in eight groups of four teams in the
first stage. The competition currently comprises 24 teams.
	   The new format will include more teams from Europe's top
soccer-playing nations while also incorporating more teams from
smaller nations, broadening the potential television audience for
games.
	   The UEFA Cup and Cup Winners Cup will be merged into one
competition, called the UEFA Cup. Details still have to be worked
out.
	   The proposed reforms are part of UEFA's bid to dissuade Europe's
top clubs from defecting to Media Partners' Super League.
	   The firm had tried to entice the continent's top clubs with
offers of some dlrs 1.2 billion _ far more than the dlrs 322
million generated by the Champions League in 1997-98, of which only
dlrs 157 million went to the clubs.
	   Some clubs had feared Media Partners' plan would make the rich
clubs richer and the poor clubs poorer.
	   UEFA, which has run European soccer since 1954, is keen to
ensure the loyalty of European clubs and had threatened to suspend
clubs and players who opt into the proposed Super League.
	   Galliani said the Media Partners proposal had been of
considerable interest to the 12 clubs, but said they currently
don't have contact with the firm and the project is at the moment
``lying dormant.''
	   President of Real Madrid, Lorenzo Sanz, told reporters they are
ready to cooperate with UEFA not just in their own interests but
for the whole of European soccer.
	   He said the clubs had been surprised by UEFA's ``good footwork''
and congratulated the body for the ``excellent headway'' it had
made in drawing up the reforms.
	   ``The situation is quite good and I am sure there will be good
cooperation in the future,'' he said.
	   ``The tone of the meeting was extremely positive,'' Peter
Kenyon, deputy chief executive of England's Manchester United,
said.
	   In order to finance the revamped league, UEFA has said it would
investigate the possibility of pay-per-view and pay TV, but said
broadcasting contracts and marketing would remain under its
control. UEFA remains unwilling to allow national leagues to take
control of its domestic television rights.
	   At Friday's meeting, Galliani said UEFA had discussed details of
TV ownership rights and how much money would be at stake, but
declined to give details.
	   Sanz said clubs would have a go-between role in facilitating
cooperation between TV companies and UEFA, but also refused to be
specific.
	   UEFA representatives at the meeting included Senior Vice
President Antonio Matarrese and General Secretary Gerhard Aigner,
general secretary.
	   ``It seems to me we have been able to build up a mutual trust
today,'' Aigner said.
	   Clubs represented at the meeting also included Bayern Munich of
Germany, FC Barcelona of Spain, AFC Ajax of Holland, Borussia
Dortmund of Germany, Internazionale and Juventus of Italy,
Liverpool from England, FC Porto of Portugal and Olympique
Marseille of France.

New left-wing line-up seeks to tackle EU's problems
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL AMES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   POERTSCHACH, Austria (AP) _ The new left-wing lineup of European
Union leaders gathers Saturday in an Austrian lakeside resort for a
weekend of brainstorming to map out the EU's future, but
here-and-now crises in Kosovo and the global economy are sure to
intrude.
	   The opening day of the two-day summit marks the EU debut of
Germany's Social Democratic Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder, and
Italy's new Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema, a former Communist who
now heads the Democratic Left party.
	   Their arrival means all but four of the 15 EU governments are
headed by left-leaning prime ministers. Two others are coalitions
with socialists in top positions, and only in Ireland and Spain are
socialists in opposition.
	   Although some of the faces have changed, the problems facing the
EU leaders have a nagging familiarity:
	   _ How to maintain Europe's economic recovery and tackle
unemployment in the face of spreading international turmoil.
	   _ How to reduce Europe's dependence on the United States when
bloody conflicts flares up on the EU's doorstep.
	   _ How to streamline the EU's ponderous decision-making process
and make the EU more efficient ahead of next decade's planned
expand of the membership from 15 to 21.
	   Forecasts released by the EU this week show the crisis sweeping
though Asia, Russia and Latin America dragging growth in the
15-nation bloc down to 2.4 percent next year, from the previously
predicted 3 percent.
	   Although EU officials insist the slowdown will be temporary,
pressure is growing for government action to encourage growth by
increasing public investment or cutting interest rates to boost
business.
	   ``The competitiveness of our companies ... must be further
bolstered. The government intends to see to that,'' French Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin said this week in Paris. ``A decline in
interest rates is essential to that end.''
	   Schroeder and other Socialist leaders have also indicated rates
should be lower, but central bank governors have resisted calls to
cut, arguing rates in the EU's core economies, such as France and
Germany, are already among the world's lowest.
	   Jospin may have more success seeking support for a plan to raise
state funding for job-creating public-works projects. The outgoing
German administration of Chancellor Helmut Kohl quashed that idea
last time it came up, Schroeder may be more sympathetic.
	   Britain's Labor Prime Minister Tony Blair this week indicated he
may be prepared to drop the long-standing opposition of his
Conservative predecessors to giving the EU a military capability.
	   ``We need to allow fresh thinking in this, and it is important
for Britain to be part of this thinking,'' Blair was quoted telling
The Times of London.
	   His spokesman Alistair Campbell explained Blair wanted European
countries to be able to mount peacekeeping or combat operations to
deal with crises like Bosnia or Kosovo.
	   ``We could put together an operation with, say, France, Belgium,
Italy and Spain, in a way that meant we did not have to rely the
whole time on the Americans,'' Campbell said.
	   The leaders will also debate plans to raise the Union's
international profile by naming a permanent envoy to coordinate EU
foreign affairs, although nobody is likely to be appointed until a
December summit in the Austrian capital, Vienna.
	   This weekend's summit was originally called to let leaders hold
an informal chat in a relaxed Alpine atmosphere on ways to overhaul
the EU, making it more efficient and more relevant to its 370
million citizens as it prepares to take on Poland, Hungary, the
Czech Republic, Cyprus, Estonia and Slovenia as new members over
the next few years.
	   ``Poertschach provides an excellent opportunity to relaunch the
debate on the future of the Union,'' said EU Commission President
Jacques Santer, in a letter to the leaders. ``Europe must rid
itself of its cliched image of an economic giant but political
dwarf.''

<TEXT>
	   GABORONE, Botswana (AP) _ Police Friday were searching for the
driver of a truck believed to be carrying 18 would-be migrants who
apparently suffocated while trying to enter South Africa.
	   The bodies were found in the Botswanan bush near the South
African border, and police suspect they were migrants who
suffocated in the back of a truck.
	   Eight of the dead were Zimbabwean, and the rest were not
immediately identified, The Star of Johannesburg, South Africa,
said.
	   Botswana is a major conduit for poor Zimbabweans seeking work in
South Africa. The sparsely populated nation lies between the two
countries.
	   Botswana repatriates more than 1,000 illegal immigrants a month,
the South African Press Association quoted an immigration official
here as saying.
	   Some migrants are killed by crocodiles or hippos or drown in
rivers that form Botswana's borders between South Africa and
Zimbabwe.
	   Two people who turned up at a nearby police station said they
found themselves among the bodies Tuesday night. They victims
apparently had fallen asleep in the truck and suffocated, police
told The Star.
	   The couple said they had left Bulawayo in Zimbabwe on Monday and
passed through Gaborone, Botswana, which is just outside the South
African border.
	   The bodies were found by an elderly couple walking through the
veld about 5 kilometers (3 miles) from Gaborone.
	   South Africa, with its relatively large economy, has become a
magnet for illegal immigrants since the fall of apartheid in 1994.
Most of the arrivals are from Mozambique, followed by Zimbabwe.
	   Officials estimate up to 4.1 million illegal immigrants are in
the country, which has a population of 40.6 million, at any one
time.

Outgoing chancellor gives office aquarium to caretaker
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOE F. BODENSTEIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Helmut Kohl, busy cleaning out his office
after 16 years as chancellor, has given a 240-liter (63 gallon)
aquarium and all his fish to a faithful guard who tended it for
years.
	   ``I'm very happy about the decision and feel honored,''
Hans-Jochen Brecht, a police commissioner with the federal border
patrol, said Friday.
	   Brecht had taken care of the aquarium since it was given to Kohl
14 years ago following a visit to the Berlin aquarium. Kohl
remarked then that he had had an aquarium as a child that he was
very fond of; soon after, one showed up in his office back in Bonn.
	   Kohl used to gaze at the aquarium when he was reflecting in his
office and compared the antics of the exotic South American fish to
politics, Brecht said.
	   But the 68-year-old chancellor, who steps aside on Tuesday when
Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder takes office, hasn't got enough
room for the big tank at home, Brecht said.
	   So he gave it to Brecht, who in turn is giving it to an aquarium
club in his home town of Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler near Bonn.
	   Brecht, 58, is the vice-chairman of the club, and says Kohl's
fish will be in good hands there.
	   ``It's going to be a real attraction,'' Brecht said. ``We hope
that one day the former chancellor will visit his fish at the
club.''

European Commission president favors extradition of Pinochet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHANNA TUCKMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with European Commission president favoring
extradition &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Europe's top official said Friday that he
hoped former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet would be extradited
to Spain to be tried for crimes committed during his 17-year rule.
	   ``Sometimes it should be made clear that crimes, wherever they
take place, cannot be left unpunished,'' European Commission
President Jacques Santer said.
	   Pinochet was detained by British police in London on Oct. 16 by
request of a Spanish magistrate as a first step toward his
extradition to stand trial for genocide and terrorism.
	   ``The dictatorship caused great suffering and sent many citizens
into exile,'' Santer said, referring to the 1973-90 Pinochet
regime.
	   Santer was speaking to reporters in the northern Spanish city of
Oviedo where he was due to receive the Prince of Asturias Prize for
social science _ one of the eight annual prizes named after the
heir to the Spanish throne.
	   Meanwhile, a Spanish newspaper reported Friday that Pinochet is
not fully aware of his predicament.
	   Daily El Mundo said the ailing retired general's family and
aides have been shielding him from the details for fear he would
fly into a rage that would kill him.
	   Pinochet was detained in the London clinic while recovering from
back surgery. El Mundo said it reporter accompanied Chilean
politicians seeking his release during a visit to the clinic
Thursday.
	   The reporter said he talked briefly to Pinochet's wife, Lucia
Hiriart, and daughter Veronica.
	   ``If Augusto knew the truth, he would have an attack of rage and
die,'' El Mundo quoted Hiriart as saying to others while waiting
for permission from Scotland Yard to visit her husband on the
eighth floor of the clinic.
	   El Mundo reported that the family had asked police guards to
stand outside the former dictator's room, and stay out of sight
when anyone goes inside, and there is no television, radio or
telephone in his room.
	   The newspaper said that despite having received an arrest order
last from two policemen who visited his room, Pinochet is convinced
it was a mistake and that he is protected by diplomatic immunity.
	   His wife said she was keeping the seriousness of his situation
from him because he is also suffering from a urinary infection,
heart problems and diabetes, the newspaper reported.
	   ``He's very depressed,'' she said. ``This is humiliating,'' the
newspaper quoted her as saying.

Under unclear regulation, computer users could be lawbreakers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Computer buffs in Sweden may find their
web-surfing more exciting on Saturday, when a new law takes effect
that could make some of what they do illegal.
	   The looming law, which puts limits on the dissemination of
personal information, has left Swedes confused about what they can
and cannot do. Even former Prime Minister Carl Bildt says he
doesn't know what to do.
	   The regulations were passed by Parliament to put Swedish law in
line with European Union directives on releasing personal
information. But critics complain the legislation phrased
unclearly.
	   In broad terms, the new law prohibits anyone from releasing
information about another person without that person's permission.
That could affect a wide range of activities, from online chat
services to genealogy homepages to information provided by local
governments.
	   Although Swedes are generally careful about being law-abiding,
the confusion has prompted many to be a bit rebellious. Chat
service operators, including telecommunications companies Telia and
Tele 2, say they'll continue to provide their services until
they're told something's illegal.
	   Bildt, leader of the main opposition Moderates party, took a
similar stance regarding the weekly letter that he sends by E-mail
and posts on the party's homepage.
	   The letter ''every week contains the names and assessments of a
large number of different people within and outside Sweden. There
is hardly any possibility to get these people's permission in
advance.''
	   The government on Thursday ordered the national Data Inspection
Agency to investigate whether local governments could be excepted
from the regulations.

OECD says global investment accord must include France
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A global agreement on direct investment can't
logically go ahead without France, the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development said Friday, justifying a waiting
period before further negotiations.
	   ``There is a general understanding that any (multilateral trade)
framework must include all major OECD countries,'' OECD Deputy
Secretary General Victor Schloegl said after a news conference.
	   French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin last week pulled his country
out of the negotiations for the OECD-piloted Multilateral Agreement
On Investment, known as MAI, citing concerns about national
sovereignty.
	   OECD countries decided to take some time to take stock of
concerns about sovereignty, protection of labor rights, the
environment and culture before meeting again, U.S. Undersecretary
of State and Chairman of the OECD's Executive Committee in Special
Session, Stuart Eizenstat, said.
	   ``France wasn't the only country concerned about these issues,''
he added.
	   France wants the negotiations to be held under the auspices of
the Geneva-based World Trade Organization, as does Canada.
	   Negotiations on the MAI were interrupted six months ago to allow
for consultations on these issues, The next meeting is scheduled
for December. It follows a meeting earlier this week.
	   Eizenstat declined to speculate about whether the additional
discussion time is aimed at bringing France back into the MAI fold.
	   ``I have learned not to presume anything,'' Eizenstat said,
adding that it took years to rally the OECD's 29 member countries
around some of its successful agreements such as the anti bribery
convention of 1997.
	   The MAI negotiations, launched in 1995, were meant to create an
international set of rules for cross-border investment in the hopes
of facilitating direct international investment and
nondiscrimination for foreign firms.
	   OECD Secretary General Donald Johnston said the premise of the
MAI isn't being called into question.
	   ``What is encouraging is that everyone agrees on the need for an
international agreement. The only question is about how to get
there from here,'' he said.
	   The OECD added that it would sponsor a new study in support of
open markets and continued liberalization in developing countries.
	   The OECD member countries also said they agreed on the need for
more cooperation and information sharing with the International
Monetary Fund, World Bank and World Trade Organization.

Salvadoran university officials criticize Nobel medicine prize

 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to CORRECT that Moncada is Honduran, but grew
up in Salvador, UPDATES with British researcher also criticizing
decision and CLARIFIES that discovery helps research for
treatments. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) _ Officials from the University
of El Salvador have criticized the awarding of the Nobel Prize in
Medicine to three Americans, saying one of its professors made the
discoveries that led to the award.
	   Not giving the Nobel prize to Salvador Moncada ``puts in doubt
its credibility,'' Eduardo Espinoza, dean of the university's
medical faculty, said Thursday. Moncada, a native of Honduras, grew
up in El Salvador and attended the University of El Salvador.
	   In Stockholm, Sweden, Agneta Sjoevall, a spokeswoman for the
Nobel Committee of the Karolinska Institute, declined comment on
the Moncada dispute, saying the committee as a matter of principle
does not comment on complaints about whom it chooses for the prize.
	   This is standard procedure for all the Nobel-awarding bodies.
	   The prize was awarded this month to Robert F. Furchgott, Louis
J. Ignarro and Dr. Ferid Murad for discovering that the body uses
nitric oxide gas to make blood vessels relax and widen _ a finding
that helped lead to the anti-impotency drug Viagra and research
that could result in new treatments for heart disease.
	   Salvadoran university officials said Moncada made the discovery
six months before the U.S. researchers did.
	   In a telephone interview from London, where he is also a
professor at University College, Moncada said he was pleased that
scientists in his field were awarded the Nobel. He said Fuchgott
``deserved the honor fully'' and praised the other two winners as
``very significant researchers.''
	   He said the prize was not a top priority for him and that it was
more important to have made contributions to the nitric oxide
research and to be recognized by his peers.
	   ``Certainly a Nobel prize for a Latin American investigator is
important for Latin America. But I feel very relaxed in terms of my
own contribution, which has been fundamental,'' he said.
	   Cesar Milstein of the Medical Research Council Laboratory of
Molecular Biology in Cambridge, England, who shared a Nobel prize
in medicine in 1984, said he believed it was wrong to leave Moncada
out of this year's prize.
	   The award can't be shared by more than three people, Milstein
noted Friday, and ``if there were three, he should have been one.''
	   Dr. Jonathan Stamler of the Duke University Medical Center and
the Howard Hughes Medical Institute said Moncada and the three
prize winners all made major contributions to the field. Which ones
deserve the prize ``depends on the criteria being judged,'' he
said.

Pakistan top batsmen collapse in front of paceman McGrath

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Paceman Glenn McGrath took four wickets
for 41 runs, including the top of Pakistan's batting lineup, to
help restrict the hosts to 170 for six Friday after Australia was
bowled out for 280 on the second day of their third test.
	   In a 10-over opening spell, the 28-year-old McGrath claimed
three wickets and then returned to get Moin Khan as Pakistan
finished the day 110 runs behind Australian.
	   Pakistan skipper Aamir Sohail, who needs a victor at National
Stadium to square the three-match series, fought a lone battle and
was unbeaten on 83 when stumps were drawn. He lifted leg-spinner
Stuart MacGill for a six over mid-wicket during his 226 minutes of
stay at the wicket, in addition to 11 boundaries.
	   Together with Wasim Akram, who was still batting at 19, Sohail
had put on 54 runs for the seventh wicket. Akram survived a close
leg before appeal off Gavin Robertson's last ball of the day and
survived last hour without further damage with Sohail.
	   McGrath returned with impressive figures of four for 41 off 15
overs while Robertson bowled a steady 12 overs giving away just 23
runs.
	   The home team batting crumbled in front of McGrath's pace.
Debutante Shahid Afridi, who earlier in the day took five wickets
in the Australian innings, stroked McGrath to cover boundary off
the very first delivery he faced in test cricket.
	   However, the 18-year-old, known for his pinch-hitting in one-day
cricket, played an ambitious stroke off McGrath to give Mark Taylor
a sharp catch in first slip.
	   Ijaz Ahmed (5) needlessly tried to pull McGrath's short delivery
and got a leading edge to wicketkeeper Ian Healy, while Inzamamul
Haq (9) gently pushed McGrath to Darren Lehmann at short cover.
	   With Pakistan struggling at 51 for three, veteran Salim Malik
chased a wide delivery of leg-spinner MacGill and got a top edge as
Pakistan went for tea at a hopeless 54 for four.
	   Off-spinner Robertson further reduced Pakistan to 69 for five
when he bowled Yousaf Youhanna before Khan and Sohail put on 47
runs in 53 minutes for the sixth wicket.
	   However, McGrath returned for his second spell and Michael
Slater took a well judged catch at square leg to end Khan's of
20-run knock.
	   Earlier, Healy and No. 10 batsman MacGill frustrated Pakistan
with a half-century partnership before Australia's first innings
folded at 280 at stroke of lunch.
	   Leg-spinner Afridi finished with five wickets for 52, claiming
the wickets of Robertson (5) and last man McGrath (6). He took
three wickets on Thursday. He became the fifth Pakistani after Arif
Butt, Nazir Junior, Shahid Nazir and Muhammad Zahid to claim five
wickets in his debut test innings.
	   After resuming at the overnight total of 207 for six, Healy (47)
and MacGill added a precious 55 runs for the ninth wicket in 105
minutes.
	   MacGill, who scored his first run after nearly half an hour,
remained unbeaten on 23 in 128 minutes.
	   Pakistan took the second new ball after 112 overs. The score was
244 for eight when the new ball came into play.
	   Off-spinner Arshad Khan finally broke the partnership when Healy
was ruled out by South African umpire Dave Orchard after he was
caught behind. However, TV replays suggested that the ball might
have missed the outside edge of Healy's bat.
	   Earlier, Afridi claimed his fourth wicket of the innings when
overnight batsman Robertson was caught at silly point by a diving
Youhanna in his second over of the day.
	   And when Akram knocked back Collin Miller's off stump, at the
total of 211, it looked like Australia's innings might fold before
220.
	   However, Healy and MacGill dug in and pushed the total beyond
250-run mark.
	   Besides Afridi's five for 52, Arshad Khan claimed three for 72
while Akram and Shoaib Akhtar chipped in with one wicket each, for
51 and 39 runs respectively.

Tie-breaker rule to be used in Wills International Cup

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ With an eye on dark clouds overhead,
nine test playing nations inaugurate the mini world cup cricket
tournament Saturday, with the powerful South Asian teams hoping the
muggy weather may give them a home advantage for the dlrs 100,000
Wills International Cup.
	   The teams gathering at Dhaka's Bangabandhu national stadium are
Zimbabwe, New Zealand, India, Australia, England, South Africa,
Pakistan, Sri Lanka and West Indies. They will probably be seeded
according to their status in world cricket.
	   Bangladesh, the host, will not take part in the tournament
because it does not have Test status.
	   Sri Lankan captain Arjuna Ranatunga considers his side as one of
the favorites to win.
	   ``No one can predict anything for such a tough tournament, but
India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka are ahead as they are familiar with
the environment and the wickets in the region,'' Ranatunga told
reporters on his arrival in the Bangladesh capital on Thursday.
	   The veteran left-hander, who led his side to victory in the 1996
World Cup, said his team was strong in all departments. ``We are in
an upbeat mood as we defeated England recently in a one-day series
as well as one-off test.''
	   This knockout tournament, the only meet before the World Cup in
England next year, will be significant because the tie-breaker rule
will be introduced in international cricket. Never tested in world
cricket before, the bowl-out formula _ the official name of the
tie-breaker _ will produce clear results in a match where there is
a tie or the minimum number of overs per side have not been bowled.
	   For the tie-breaker, five bowlers from each side will bowl to
break the bails without any batsmen or fielders. Bowling will
continue till the fate of the match is decided, said match refree
Raman Subba Row.
	   Many teams appeared to be confused about the procedure of the
bowl-out. Though they have agreed to play by the rules set by the
International Cricket Council, they feel the bowl-out should have
been tested before being applied in a major international
tournament like this championship.
	   But the all pervasive apprehension in Dhaka is that rains will
ruin the game. It has been raining off and on in the city and the
Bangabandhu stadium has been virtually reduced to a pool of slush.
	   But the city woke to a sunny morning Friday and ground staff
worked feverishly to bring the ground back to its lush green self.
Pitch covers and super soppers to soak water from the outfield have
already arrived from Calcutta in neighboring India.
	   New Zealand and Zimbabwe, who will set the ball rolling Saturday
with a day and night encounter in the floodlit stadium, have
already started warm-up practice with Bangladesh's national team.
But there is lack of international class practice facilities and
teams have to content themselves to fielding practice.
	   New Zealand are favorites for a quarterfinal win against Sri
Lanka, but Zimbabwe, flush with their recent test win against
India, will be no push over. Skipper Alistair Cambell has an
experienced team under him and the Kiwis will have to fight hard to
beat them.
	   The Bangabandhu stadium looks full of runs, and if nature does
not play spoilsport, the locals may see some entertaining batting
on Saturday.
	   The tournament also promises to be a technical marvel for
television viewers. There will be 18 cameras to provide details of
action on the field. This is four more than what World Tel used for
the Independence Cup earlier this year. There will be five
slow-motion cameras as well.

Report: Japan average weekly working hours falls below 40 for first
</HEADLINE>
time

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The minimum work week for full-time employees in
Japan in 1997 fell below 40 hours for the first time since the
government started tracking the statistic, a news report said
Friday.
	   Weekly fixed working hours at private companies that responded
to a Labor Ministry survey fell on average 1 hour and 14 minutes
from 1996 to 39 hours 31 minutes, Kyodo news agency reported.
	   The labor ministry attributed the decline to more companies
limiting the work week to 40 hours and adopting a five-day, rather
than six, workweek, the report said. The ministry has kept records
on working hours since 1966.
	   The study measured companies' official work week, though
employees in general work longer hours _ in many cases much longer.
	   The report did not mention if Japan's recession _ the deepest in
50 years _ had an impact. The sluggish economy has already forced
many companies to limit overtime.
	   In the past most Japanese companies required their employees to
work Saturday. By last year, a third of the companies surveyed had
completely adopted a five-day workweek while 90 percent gave their
employees a two-day weekend once or more a month, the report said.
	   The ministry sent surveys to 5,300 private-sector companies with
30 or more employees, of which 90.4 percent replied.
	   By industry, employees in the financial and insurance sectors
had the shortest minimum working hours, at 37 hours and 9 minutes
per week, the report said. The longest working hours per week were
seen in the mining and construction sectors, at 39 hours and 52
minutes.

Greens torn by strife on eve of joining German government

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany's Greens are about to join the
government, but not without the kind of squabbling dear to the
former protest party since its founding 18 years ago.
	   After last month's election victory by the Social Democrats,
Greens leaders swiftly grasped power at the national level for the
first time, sealing a coalition pact after surprisingly smooth
negotiations.
	   Both parties are expected to ratify the deal this weekend at
special conventions in Bonn, clearing final hurdles for Germany's
first left-leaning government in 16 years.
	   While the Social Democrats' vote is likely to go smoothly,
Greens leaders may face resistance from members who resent the fact
that Schroeder nixed radical goals such as a sharp hike in gasoline
taxes and a timetable for scrapping nuclear power.
	   Still, the Greens were expected to back the coalition in the end
as the best deal they could get as junior partner.
	   Many Greens activists are still reconciling their
anti-establishment roots with the new reality, and that was
expected to lead to controversy at their meeting starting Friday.
	   Hours before delegates gathered, the three Greens tapped for
Cabinet posts faced accusations by some party members that they are
amassing power.
	   By wanting to hold on to their parliamentary seats, the critics
argued, the future ministers are acting too much like the
traditional politicians the Greens once abhorred.
	   Designated foreign minister Joschka Fischer, the most prominent
Greens leader, has already hinted he'll turn down the Cabinet post
if delegates vote Saturday to bar the dual role.
	   Party co-chairman Juergen Trittin, in line to be environment
minister, agreed Friday. Denying Green ministers a foot in
parliament would weaken the party compared to the Social Democrats,
he said.
	   ``We have to make a choice between pragmatism and principles,''
he said.
	   But Peter Swane, the party's leader in Schleswig-Holstein state,
kept up the pressure.
	   ``I know from talking with many colleagues in the national party
that this issue is a very sensitive point,'' he said on German
radio. ``This topic is almost more important than some points that
may be controversial in the coalition agreement.''
	   Founded in 1980 by pacifists, anti-nuclear activists and
feminists, the Greens gave themselves two days to argue before
voting on the coalition deal and the power-splitting issue
Saturday.
	   Schroeder is to be sworn in Tuesday, a day after the new
parliament convenes.
	   Social Democrats and Greens have promised shifts on several
fronts. Chief projects are to work toward shutting down nuclear
plants, cut taxes for people with low and medium incomes, and allow
more foreigners to become citizens.

Opposition forces promise fierce battle against D'Alema's new

 &UR; EDS: Confidence vote result expected about 1830 gmt &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy's opposition forces, led by former Premier
Silvio Berlusconi, on Friday promised a fierce battle against the
new, center-left government of former Communist Premier Massimo
D'Alema.
	   D'Alema appeared assured of winning a required confidence vote
expected later Friday in the Chamber of Deputies, Italy's lower
house.
	   Opposition deputies engaged in a filibuster to drag out pre-vote
debate on the new government, Italy's 56th since the end of World
War II.
	   Berlusconi's Freedom Alliance called supporters to march in
protest in Rome on Saturday.
	   The Senate, where the government has a more comfortable
majority, votes next week.
	   D'Alema would like to have as broad as support as possible to
pass the 1999 budget as well as to revive efforts to reform Italy's
bureaucratic institutions and an electoral system that rewards
small parties and feeds the country's chronic government
instability.
	   The opposition contends that D'Alema's coalition, which ranges
from a small centrist party of former Christian Democrats now loyal
to ex-president Francesco Cossiga to Communists holding ministry
posts for the first time in five decades, fails to respect the
choices made by voters in the 1996 elections.
	   Many of the centrist deputies were elected to Parliament in 1996
on the center-right Freedom Alliance ticket, not on the center-left
Olive Tree group which proposed Romano Prodi as premier.
	   Prodi's 2 1-2 year-old coalition, Italy's second longest-lasting
since the end of the war, collapsed after some Communists, then
outside the government but usually supportive of Prodi, refused to
back the government in a confidence vote Oct. 9.
	   President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, who asked D'Alema to form a new
government, rejected Berlusconi's criticism by saying he can't
prevent lawmakers from defecting.
	   ``It would have been a blow to the constitution if I had refused
to appoint a candidate presented by a majority of political
forces,'' Scalfaro said.
	   The confidence vote was scheduled for the eve of D'Alema's first
international appearance as premier. He was expected in Austria for
a European Union summit.
	   D'Alema has promised to pursue the strict economic policies
imposed by Prodi, which allowed Italy to qualify for Europe's
single currency.

Central Banker predicts collapse of hundreds of banks
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By LESLIE SHEPHERD &QC;

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's chief banker predicted Friday that only a
fraction of the country's commercial banks would survive the
current economic crisis, even with help from the Central Bank.
	   ``We reckon that only a small number of banks will be able to
stay afloat in the current situation,'' said Central Bank chairman
Viktor Gerashchenko.
	   ``I expect that 200-300 banks will be able to cope with the
financial problems,'' he said, according to the Interfax news
agency.
	   The Central Bank recently estimated there were 1,700 commercial
banks in Russia, although the Profil business weekly said only 905
remained profitable after the crisis erupted in mid-August.
	   Russian entrepreneurs rushed to open banks in the post-Soviet
era, but few of the enterprises ever established a solid financial
footing or offered western-style retail services. Many collapsed in
the wake of the crisis or froze accounts.
	   Dealing among other banks all but stopped, due to the plummeting
ruble, a lack of capital and potential losses resulting from huge
investments in the treasury bills the government defaulted on.
	   The Central Bank said Thursday that 61 billion rubles (dlrs
3.58) would be needed to bail out the country's banking system. It
said it would help the most viable and important banks, as well as
key banks in the regions.
	   Meanwhile, the government lowered import duties Friday on meat,
milk and other staples in an effort to prevent any shortages this
winter.
	   Russia relies heavily on imports, which have fallen since the
crisis as become more expensive as the ruble loses value.
	   The country has not experienced any food shortages, and is not
expected to. But the government wants to make sure there is plenty
of food on hand for the winter.
	   The Interfax news agency said the import duties on meat have
been trimmed from 15 percent to 10 percent, on milk from 10 percent
to 5 percent and on butter, from 20 percent to 15 percent. Duties
on other foods, such as soybeans, also were lowered.
	   The government continued talks Friday with officials from the
International Monetary Fund. Few details have been released, but
the IMF top representative in Russia, Martin Gilman, has said that
the question of further IMF loan installments has not come up.
	   A dlrs 22.6 billion loan package, put together by the IMF before
the crisis, was frozen in September after the first dlrs 4.8
billion installment was provided.
	   The IMF has said it will not release more money until it sees
Russia's plan for coping with the economic crisis and signs that it
is being implemented.
	   Russia has already indicated it is putting together only
short-term measures, rather than a comprehensive, long-term plan.

European Commission president favors extradition of Pinochet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHANNA TUCKMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Europe's top official said he hoped that
former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet would be extradited to
Spain for trial on charges of human rights abuses during his
campaign to squelch dissent during his 17-year rule.
	   ``Sometimes it should be made clear that crimes, wherever they
take place, cannot be left unpunished,'' European Commission
President Jacques Santer said.
	   Pinochet was detained by British police in London on Oct. 16 by
request of a Spanish magistrate as a first step toward his
extradition to stand trial for genocide and terrorism.
	   ``The dictatorship caused great suffering and sent many citizens
into exile,'' Santer said, referring to the 1973-90 Pinochet
regime.
	   Santer was speaking to reporters in the northern Spanish city of
Oviedo where he was due to receive the Prince of Asturias Prize for
social science _ one of the eight annual prizes named after the
heir to the Spanish throne.
	   Meanwhile, a Spanish newspaper reported Friday that Pinochet is
not fully aware of his predicament.
	   Daily El Mundo said the ailing retired general's family and
aides have been shielding him from the details for fear he would
fly into a rage that would kill him.
	   Pinochet was detained in the London clinic while recovering from
back surgery. El Mundo said it reporter accompanied Chilean
politicians seeking his release during a visit to the clinic
Thursday.
	   The reporter said he talked briefly to Pinochet's wife, Lucia
Hiriart, and daughter Veronica.
	   ``If Augusto knew the truth, he would have an attack of rage and
die,'' El Mundo quoted Hiriart as saying to others while waiting
for permission from Scotland Yard to visit her husband on the
eighth floor of the clinic.
	   El Mundo reported that the family had asked police guards to
stand outside the former dictator's room, and stay out of sight
when anyone goes inside, and there is no television, radio or
telephone in his room.
	   The newspaper said that despite having received an arrest
warrant from two policemen who visited his room, Pinochet is
convinced it was a mistake and that he is protected by diplomatic
immunity.
	   His wife said she was keeping the seriousness of his situation
from him because he is also suffering from a urinary infection,
heart problems and diabetes, the newspaper reported.
	   ``He's very depressed,'' she said. ``This is humiliating,'' the
newspaper quoted her as saying.

Yeltsin returns to Kremlin, meets with top lawmaker

serve out his term despite health problems, other details. Trims. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin is battling to serve out his
presidential term despite health problems, his spokesman said
Friday in a marked departure from the Kremlin's earlier assurances
that Yeltsin was in fine health.
	   ``He has a very clear goal: work through his term and step down
in the year 2000,'' spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said.
	   ``He has obvious strength of character _ you can call it Urals
or Siberian character _ the wish to fight against any feelings of
sickness. Thus his wish to continue working visits, even while
doctors advise against that,'' Yakushkin told reporters.
	   Yeltsin, 67, has suffered health problems for years, including
heart bypass surgery in 1996. After spending most of the past two
weeks at a country residence recovering from a respiratory
infection, Yeltsin was in the Kremlin on Friday for talks with
Yegor Stroyev, the chairman of parliament's upper house, the
Federation Council.
	   The Russian president sounded hopeful about the prospects of the
nation's economy during the televised meeting.
	   ``The situation is difficult, but we are starting to crawl out a
bit,'' Yeltsin said, imitating a crawling movement with his hand.
	   The Russian economy is not experiencing the daily shocks that it
suffered when the crisis hit with full force in August. But prices
continue to rise, millions of Russians are out of work and millions
more get paid months late.
	   The government, led by Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, has
focused only on stop-gap measures to stabilize the economy and has
not produced a long-term recovery plan.
	   Meanwhile, Yeltsin's latest illness has prompted his many
critics to again question his fitness to govern.
	   The president has fought constantly with the lower house of
parliament, the State Duma, where Communists make up the largest
faction.
	   ``Our relations with the upper house have developed well from
the start,'' Yeltsin said. ``Unfortunately, is has not been so with
the State Duma.''
	   The Duma plans to consider a bill that would require Yeltsin's
chief doctor to report to parliament on the state of the
president's health. Debates on the bill have been scheduled for
November, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Stroyev criticized the bill during the meeting with Yeltsin,
saying the interest in the president's health ``should not be
brought to the level of the absurd.''
	   The president has had far better relations with the upper house,
which usually supports him. However, nearly half the Federation
Council supported a non-binding resolution last week that called on
the president to resign.
	   Yeltsin said he was still on good terms with Stroyev. ``I like
working with him,'' Yeltsin told reporters before the meeting with
Stroyev. ``We work in a friendly way.''
	   Yeltsin insists that he will serve out the final two years of
his term and denies speculation that he has serious health
problems.

3 arrested in connection with Germany's Reemtsma kidnapping
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   EUPEN, Belgium (AP) _ Belgian authorities have arrested three
people charged with laundering ransom money from the 1996
kidnapping of German millionaire cigarette heir Jan Philipp
Reemtsma, judicial officials said Friday.
	   The three, a couple in their thirties and their 73-year-old
aunt, are accused of trying to exchange part of the 30 million
marks (dlrs 18 million) ransom in other currencies, a judicial
official who demanded anonymity said.
	   The three were arrested in eastern Belgium, close to the German
border in September and have been detained for five weeks already.
They deny any involvement in the case.
	   Reemtsma was held in a cellar for 33 days after his kidnapping
in March 1996 from his Hamburg home. He was released after a ransom
was paid.
	   Two men have already been convicted of the kidnapping, and a
third is being held in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
	   The prosecutor's office said the three Belgian suspects had
direct contact with the entourage of the man held in Argentina. The
three are part of the east Belgian drug scene, the official said.
	   It was unclear how much money the three were trying to launder,
he said.
	   The Hamburg-based Reemtsma cigarette company is Germany's
second-largest, manufacturing several brands, including Peter
Stuyvesant.

Hill in Albanian for talks with Albanian government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) -- The special U.S. envoy for Kosovo,
Christopher Hill, urged Albanian leaders Friday to support the
Kosovo peace deal and briefed them on steps underway to ensure
compliance with the agreement.
	   ``In fact we have made some progress but we still have a long
way to go,'' Hill told reporters. ``I explained the fact that we
will have an OSCE mission in Kosovo. There have already been
recruitments of about 1,500 verifiers.''
	   Hill acknowledged that ``we still have a lot of differences
outstanding, but we are going to pick up the pace in the next days
and weeks...We will try to push ahead in the next few days.''
	   He added that Washington is ``looking for full compliance. We'd
like to see full compliance. I don't want to predict when exactly
we'll see it but we are working very hard to ensure that.''
	   Prime Minister Pandeli Majko said the Albanian government was
also working with the international community ``to reach a final
peaceful solution.''
	   ``The Kosovo political factors are the ones that will finally
decide Kosovo's fate. We'll be by their side,'' said Majko.

Former cultist sentenced to death for murders in Japan

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A former doomsday cult leader was sentenced Friday
to hang for killing four people, in the first death penalty given
to a member of the cult blamed in the 1995 nerve gas attack on the
Tokyo subway.
	   Kazuaki Okazaki, 38, of the Aum Shinri Kyo cult, was convicted
of strangling an anti-cult lawyer, his wife and their 1-year-old
son. He was also convicted of a separate killing of a wayward cult
member.
	   In issuing the ruling, the Tokyo District Court said Okazaki
deserved the death penalty because of the brutality of the crimes.
The court rejected his lawyers' request for leniency, national
broadcaster NHK reported.
	   As always, the court confirmed the penalty the defendant
received, but refused to discuss details of the sentencing.
	   Okazaki and four other top cultists strangled Tsutsumi Sakamoto,
his wife, and their infant son on November 4, 1989, at their home
in Yokohama, just south of Tokyo at the request of AUM leader Shoko
Asahara, police say. The four other cult members involved in the
attack are being tried separately.
	   The bodies of the Sakamoto family, buried by the cultists in
remote mountains of central Japan, were not discovered until after
the March 1995 nerve gas attack on the Tokyo subways, when
investigators began a thorough investigation.
	   Sakamoto was preparing a lawsuit against the cult when he was
murdered, accusing Aum of luring youngsters into the group.
	   In the other killing, Okazaki was found guilty of murdering a
cult member who had tried to quit the religious group in February
1989. The victim, Shuji Taguchi, was strangled with a rope.
	   Asahara, who is accused of masterminding the subway gas attacks
that killed 12 people and sickened thousands, as well as the 1989
murder of the Sakamoto family, is being tried separately.
	   In Friday's ruling, Judge Megumi Yamamuro acknowledged Asahara's
role in ordering the murders of the Sakamotos, Kyodo News agency
reported.
	   Tomoyuki Oyama, the father of slain wife Satoko Tsutsumi, told
reporters, ``It was very painful to be in court today. Though we
always thought (Okazaki) deserved death, it was still painful to
listen to the ruling.''
	   Okazaki, who left the cult in 1990, first denied his involvement
in the murders of the lawyer and his family, then confessed details
of his role in the killings.
	   Before the Okazaki verdict, the severest penalty a convicted Aum
cult member had received was life in prison. That was Ikuo Hayashi,
51, a former heart surgeon, who was convicted in May of murder in
the subway gassing three years ago.

Croatia likely won't accept extradition of former Nazi guard

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ The Zagreb government is unlikely to
accept Ferdinand Hammer, a former Nazi concentration camp guard the
United States is planning to deport to Croatia, the Croatian
ambassador to the United States said Friday.
	   The ambassador, Miomir Zuzul, said Croatian law forbids
extradition of non-Croatian citizens to the former Yugoslav
republic.
	   Zuzul, talking in Washington D.C. to Mark Richards, an assistant
to a U.S. state prosecutor, also said that it was ``questionable''
whether Hammer, who has a German-sounding name, was indeed of
Croatian origin.
	   On Wednesday, the U.S. Board of Immigration Appeals upheld an
order to deport 77-year-old Hammer, a retired foundry supervisor,
for covering up his past as a guard at Nazi concentration camps
during World War II.

Strike putting at risk inaugural day of new Milan airport
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP Photos &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Not only are some foreign airlines angry
about the opening of Milan's revamped Malpensa airport, airport
workers are also upset and they are threatening to strike on
Sunday, the facility's inaugural day.
	   A spokesman for SULTA, a union representing many of 2,400
Malpensa workers, said Friday the one-day walkout by counter
agents, cleaners and luggage handlers, was called to protest bad
working conditions in the new airport.
	   One of their beefs is shared by the disgruntled airlines --
increased travel time.
	   About 1,400 workers are going to be transferred to Malpensa,
about 50 kilometers (35 miles) northwest of Milan, from the
easy-to-reach Linate airport, at the city outskirts.
	   It is roughly an hour's drive to Malpensa from downtown Milan,
and a special train route won't running till next year at the
earliest.
	   Malpensa, whose opening this month was initially opposed by the
European Union on grounds adequate road and rail links have yet to
be completed, was scheduled to handle 634 flights on Sunday.
	   The Italian transportation ministry envisions Malpensa handling
18 million passngers a year, compared to 10 million a year at
Linate.
	   The switch of most international flights from Linate to Malpensa
prompted complaints by most foreign carriers that they had too
little time for the complex organization to transfer flights.
	   The Italian carrier Alitalia and some small companies, including
an Italian competitor on the lucrative Milan-Rome shuttle, will
keep using Linate for most national flights.
	   Malpensa 2000 was inaugurated by Italian authorities Friday
after the government and the European Commission agreed on the
terms of transfering flights following a five-month row.

Korea talks make slow progress on procedural issues
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ North and South Korea, the United States and China
crawled ahead Friday in talks on a permanent peace treaty for the
divided and tense Korean peninsula.
	   Disagreement over procedures has held up progress in two earlier
rounds of talks between the Korean rivals and highlighted how long
and tricky the negotiations are likely to be.
	   Negotiators made progress Friday in setting up two subcommittees
to replace the current armistice and build confidence between the
longtime foes, officials said.
	   North Korea previously demanded that the four countries agree on
an agenda _ including its demands for withdrawal of the 37,000 U.S.
troops from South Korea _ before setting up working groups.
	   Park Kun-woo, leader of the South Korean delegation and chairman
of the current meeting, said a morning session on the procedural
issues was ``constructive.''
	   Asked whether agreement was near on the two subcommittees, he
replied:
	   ``We are going in this direction,'' Park said.
	   Agreement on procedures is vital because only after that can the
Geneva talks address the substance of a full peace treaty to
replace the armistice that ended the 1950-53 Korean war.
	   The border between the Koreas is the world's most heavily armed,
with nearly 2 million troops deployed on both sides.
	   Annual military maneuvers held jointly by South Korean forces
and their U.S. allies are scheduled to begin Monday.
	   Tensions flared this year after Pyongyang's Aug. 31 launch of a
small satellite, which was originally thought to be a ballistic
missile.
	   The launch showed the North's reclusive communist government had
developed a more advanced missile technology system than the United
States and its allies had previously believed.
	   At New York talks this month, North Korea rebuffed a U.S. demand
that it stop testing and exporting long-range missiles.
	   However, North Korea is under pressure to make some compromises
to gain foreign food aid to feed its 23 million people.
	   Decades of economic mismanagement have led to chronic shortages,
aggravated by three years of flooding and drought. Some U.S.
experts have estimated that 2 million North Koreans may have died
in the famine.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ NATO decided Friday to send another
high-level delegation to warn Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
time is running out to comply with the Kosovo peace deal.
	   The Serb-led Yugoslav government, however, repeated claims that
it has fulfilled its terms of the Oct. 12 agreement with U.S. envoy
Richard Holbrooke and that ethnic Albanian rebels are responsible
for continuing violence.
	   Serbian Premier Mirko Marjanovic said it was time the West
realized that the crisis in Kosovo was caused by ``terrorism of
Albanian separatists.'' The government's Tanjug news agency said
one soldier was killed and another wounded Thursday when Kosovo
Liberation Army rebels attacked a convoy Thursday west of here.
	   In Brussels, Belgium, NATO said it was sending its supreme
commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, and German Gen. Klaus Naumann to
Belgrade on Saturday to press Milosevic to withdraw more police
units and equipment from Kosovo.
	   NATO has extended the deadline for Milosevic to comply with the
agreement until Tuesday. A NATO official, briefing reporters on
condition of anonymity, said ``we have seen great progress but we
are far from adequate compliance.''
	   Under the agreement, Milosevic pledged to withdraw special
police and army units sent to the province after he launched his
crackdown on the KLA Feb. 28. Hundreds of people were killed and an
estimated 300,000 driven from their homes.
	   Milosevic also agreed to allow refugees to return home safely
and enable international relief agencies to bring them aid. He also
pledged to negotiate with ethnic Albanian leaders on the future of
Kosovo, a province of the main Yugoslav republic Serbia.
	   Ethnic Albanians make up about 90 percent of the province's 2
million inhabitants, and most favor independence or self-rule.
	   In Geneva, Switzerland, the spokesman of the U.N. refugee
agency, Kris Janowski, said that 11 days after the agreement only a
``trickle'' of refugees had returned, out of fear and intimidation
by Serb police.
	   ``The impression our staff got on the ground is while some
people trickle back to their ruined homes, widespread destruction
of housing and fear of the continued Serb military and police
presence prevent significant return,'' Janowski said.
	   Kosovo's main ethnic Albanian leader, Ibrahim Rugova, was even
more critical. Rugova told reporters ``the Serbian forces have not
yet withdrawn from Kosovo,'' despite Yugoslav claims to the
contrary.
	   ``We cannot say any progress was made and NATO should maintain
its `activation order' and keep pressing the Belgrade government,''
Rugova said.
	   Complicating diplomatic efforts, however, is the role of the
KLA, whose radical members have not abandoned the goal of
independence. The United States and the Europeans reject
independence but support some form of autonomy for Kosovo.
	   Kosovo's Serbian governor, Veljko Odalovic, said ethnic Albanian
militants had killed five policemen, wounded 12 others and
kidnapped two Serbian journalists since the Holbrooke agreement.
	   On Friday, U.S. envoy Christopher Hill traveled to neighboring
Albania to brief government officials and urge them to support the
U.S.-led peace effort. Albania had permitted rebels to set up
sanctuaries in the north.
	   ``We are looking for full compliance,'' Hill told reporters.
``We'd like to see full compliance. I don't want to predict when
exactly we'll see it but we are working very hard to ensure it.''
	   Albania's new prime minister, Pandeli Majko, said his government
also wants a ``peaceful solution.''

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Top-seeded Venus Williams made short work of
Katarina Studenikova in the quarterfinals of the Kremlin Cup
Friday, dropping only one game on the way to a 6-1, 6-0 victory.
	   But the most impressive showing at the dlrs 1 million tournament
was by second-seed Monica Seles, who wrapped up her match in less
than 50 minutes against Sylvia Farina, winning 6-0, 6-0.
	   The Slovakian Studenikova put up a fight against the American
Williams, and a number of games in the second set went to deuce.
But Williams kept her focus and never gave her opponent a game in
the second set.
	   ``In the past I had some problems focusing, but now that's not
so bad,'' Williams said after the match. ``My mind is good.''
	   Williams, who lost to Studenikova on a hot summer day two years
ago, said she had prepared hard for the match and expected a
tougher fight.
	   ``I thought I would have to hit more balls today,'' Williams
said. ``I played Studenikova two years ago and it was a tough
match. When I went out today I was ready.''
	   Seles, playing the Italian Farina in the first match of the day,
didn't allow her opponent a single point in the first three games.
She beamed sharp groundstrokes down the line, and by the end Farina
seemed to be just returning balls, and never threatened her
American opponent.
	   ``I just think I came out playing so well today,'' Seles said.
``It was one of those days when everything you touch goes in and it
was hard for (Farina) to find her rhythm.''
	   In other games, seventh-seed Sandrine Testud upset third seed
Conchita Martinez 7-6 (7-4), 7-5 in a match that ran almost two
hours. In the second set Martinez's right ankle was bothering her
and she had to get it wrapped by a doctor.
	   But she double faulted to lose the 10th game and could not keep
up after that.
	   Mary Pierce of France had a tough time settling down against
Spaniard Magui Serna, but managed to get out of the first set 7-5,
after falling 2-5. She looked more confident in the second set,
breaking Magui's serve in the third and seventh set, eventually
winning 6-3.
	   In quarterfinal doubles action, Anna Kournikova and Monica Seles
advanced after Serena Williams dropped out before the match started
because she was feeling sick. Her partner was her sister, Venus.

Clubs like UEFA cup changes; Super League ``lying dormant''
</HEADLINE>

	   GENEVA (AP) _ Plans for a breakaway European Super League looked
dead Friday after the continent's top clubs indicated they would
stick with reforms proposed by UEFA.
	   Representatives from AC Milan, Real Madrid and 10 other major
teams appeared to rule out the independent Super League _ proposed
by Italy-based Media Partners _ after a meeting with officials of
Europe's governing body of soccer.
	   Adriano Galliani, the vice president of AC Milan, said the Super
League proposal was ``lying dormant.'' UEFA's proposals for
changing its European Champions League are acceptable in principle,
other club officials added.
	   Media Partners, however, declined to admit defeat and said it
would be meeting in the several weeks with the clubs involved.
	   ``UEFA has come up with practical proposals and I think we can
say the meeting has historical importance,'' Galliani told a news
conference after the meeting.
	   At a meeting in Lisbon, Portugal, earlier this month, UEFA
revealed plans to extend next season's European Champions' League
to include 32 clubs playing in eight groups of four teams in the
first stage. The competition currently comprises 24 teams.
	   The new format will include more teams from Europe's top
soccer-playing nations while also incorporating more teams from
smaller nations, broadening the potential television audience for
games.
	   The UEFA Cup and Cup Winners Cup will be merged into one
competition, called the UEFA Cup. Details still have to be worked
out.
	   Media Partners, by proposing the Super League, has tried to
entice the continent's top clubs with offers of some dlrs 1.2
billion _ far more than the dlrs 322 million generated by the
Champions League in 1997-98, of which only dlrs 157 million went to
the clubs.
	   Some clubs feared Media Partners' plan would make the rich clubs
richer and the poor clubs poorer.
	   UEFA, which has run European soccer since 1954, is keen to
ensure the loyalty of European clubs and had threatened to suspend
clubs and players who opt into the proposed Super League.
	   President of Real Madrid, Lorenzo Sanz, told reporters it was
ready to cooperate with UEFA not just in its own interests but for
the whole of European soccer. Sanz has initially been one of the
major supporters of the Super League.
	   He said the clubs had been surprised by UEFA's ``good footwork''
and congratulated the body for the ``excellent headway'' it had
made in drawing up the reforms.
	   ``The situation is quite good and I am sure there will be good
cooperation in the future,'' he said.
	   ``The tone of the meeting was extremely positive,'' Peter
Kenyon, deputy chief executive of England's Manchester United,
said.
	   Media Partners, in a statement from Milan, said nothing had been
ruled in or out by Friday's meeting.
	   ``We are happy if UEFA has finally recognized the legitimacy of
the clubs' position,'' the statement said. ``We will continue to
work closely with the clubs in the coming weeks and months to
ensure UEFA's words are turned into deeds and the proper reforms of
European competitions takes place.''
	   In order to finance the revamped league, UEFA has said it would
investigate the possibility of pay-per-view and pay TV, but said
broadcasting contracts and marketing would remain under its
control. UEFA remains unwilling to allow national leagues to take
control of domestic television rights.
	   At Friday's meeting, Galliani said UEFA had discussed details of
TV ownership rights and how much money would be at stake, but
declined to give details.
	   Sanz said clubs would have a go-between role in facilitating
cooperation between TV companies and UEFA, but also refused to be
specific.
	   UEFA representatives at the meeting included Senior Vice
President Antonio Matarrese and General Secretary Gerhard Aigner,
general secretary.
	   ``It seems to me we have been able to build up a mutual trust
today,'' Aigner said.
	   Clubs represented at the meeting also included Bayern Munich of
Germany, FC Barcelona of Spain, AFC Ajax of Holland, Borussia
Dortmund of Germany, Internazionale and Juventus of Italy,
Liverpool from England, FC Porto of Portugal and Olympique
Marseille of France.

Niners dominate decade vs. Rams
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BARRY WILNER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The simple fact of life in the American National
Football League in the 1990s is this: When San Francisco plays the
Rams, the 49ers win.
	   They've met 15 times since the Rams, then residing in Anaheim,
last beat the 'Niners. It was in 1990 when the Rams last beat their
rivals in a series dating back to 1950.
	   That the Rams lead the overall series 48-46-2 is totally
misleading. The way things are going, St. Louis might need to go
well into the next century to get another victory over San
Francisco.
	   ``I'm tired of losing to them,'' safety Keith Lyle said. ``I'm
tired of hearing about it.''
	   But he's hearing about again this week, as the 49ers come to St.
Louis with a 5-1 record, tied with Atlanta atop the NFC West
Division. The Rams (2-4) come off a shutout loss at Miami and saw
their quarterback, Tony Banks, go absent for a day.
	   Banks, distraught over his poor performance in the 14-0 loss to
the Dolphins, skipped the team flight home and film study on
Monday, staying with his girlfriend and her family.
	   Then when he returned on Wednesday, he wondered what all the
fuss was about. So he met with coach Dick Vermeil and Rams owner
Georgia Frontiere.
	   ``I tried to show I was moving on,'' Banks said. ``By no means
was I trying to say I don't care. I think my biggest thing is I
care too much. I carry a lot of weight on my shoulders.''
	   The weight of the losing streak apparently doesn't weigh too
heavily for Vermeil, who took over the Rams last year.
	   ``I'm only responsible for the two last years,'' Vermeil said.
``There aren't many guys on the roster who are responsible for many
more than that.
	   ``I'm responsible for ending the streak, and eventually we will.
Maybe Sunday.''
	   Maybe not. The Niners have lots of incentive, thanks to
Atlanta's fast start and their own sloppy effort in edging the
lowly Colts last Sunday.
	   Also going for the 49ers is the impressive recovery by Jerry
Rice from two knee injuries last year. Rice, the league's career
leader in touchdowns (169), touchdown receptions (158), total
receptions (1,088), and yards receiving (16,954), has made at least
one catch in his last 183 games, a streak dating back to his rookie
season in 1985. When he catches a pass against the Rams, he will
surpass Art Monk's mark.
	   ``It's right up there with breaking Jim Brown's record,'' said
Rice, who moved ahead of the Cleveland Browns great when he scored
his 127th touchdown in 1994 against the Los Angeles Raiders. ``When
I broke that record, that was probably No. 1. This is No. 2.
``That's a lot of ballgames, when you think about it. You know
teams are determined to shut you out, and still you make your
catches.''
	   Also Sunday, it will be Atlanta at the New York Jets; Baltimore
at Green Bay; Minnesota at Detroit,; New England at Miami; Tampa
Bay at New Orleans; Chicago at Tennessee; Cincinnati at Oakland;
Jacksonville at Denver; Seattle at San Diego; and Buffalo at
Carolina.
	   On Monday night, Pittsburgh is at Kansas City.
	   Off this week are Arizona, Dallas, Indianapolis, the New York
Giants, Philadelphia and Washington.
	   For Atlanta to stay with the 49ers, it probably will need to win
Sunday without its starting quarterback, Chris Chandler, who has a
left shoulder injury. Steve DeBerg, 44, would be the oldest
starting quarterback in NFL history if he gets the call.
	   ``He's a real emotional guy out there _ jumping around,
screaming and hollering,'' center Robbie Tobeck said. ``If he can't
do it, nobody can. We've got a lot of confidence in Steve. He'll do
fine.''

Russia to increase vodka production
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia will increase vodka production by 60
percent next year, Deputy Prime Minister Gennady Kulik said Friday.
	   Russia produced 82 million decaliters (217 million gallons) of
vodka and other strong drinks in 1998, the Interfax news agency
said.
	   ``We will do our best to squeeze what we can out of this
industry,'' Kulik told lawmakers from the Agrarian Party.
	   The Russian government recently announced it would be taking a
controlling stake in all 184 Russian distilleries that make pure
alcohol _ a key ingredient in vodka _ in an effort to get more tax
revenues.
	   In Soviet times, alcohol taxes amounted to about 25 percent of
the federal budget. Today, the figure is around 2 percent to 4
percent, officials say. About half the alcohol consumed in Russia _
mostly vodka _ goes untaxed, according to government estimates.

Leader of Kosovo Albanians awarded human rights Sakharov Prize
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Parliament has decided to
award this year's Sakharov Prize to Ibrahim Rugova, leader of the
ethnic Albanians in the Serbian separatist province of Kosovo.
	   Parliament President Jose Maria Gil-Robles and leaders of the
political groups in the 626-member assembly voted Thursday in favor
of Rugova, who advocates a peaceful struggle for the independence
of Kosovo.
	   Rugova will be invited to come and receive the award during a
ceremony at the Parliament in Strasbourg, France in mid-December.
	   Rugova preceded two other top contenders for the prize, the
Turkish human rights campaigner Akin Birdal and Ukshin Hoti, an
ethnic Albanian from Kosovo currently detained by Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic's regime.
	   Earlier this month Birdal, the head of Turkey's Human Rights
Foundation, was seen as the most likely contender for the prize
after the Parliament's foreign affairs committee gave him 22 votes,
against 16 to Rugova and six to Hoti.
	   ``All of the candidates were capable of bringing honor to the
prize, but we did think Birdal was the better candidate,'' said
Tony Robinson, a spokesman for the Socialist Party, the largest
faction in the EU Parliament.
	   ``Our party voted for Rugova, because we felt this was the right
thing to do in view of the current political situation in Kosovo,''
Helmut Weixler, a spokesman for the Parliament's Greens said.
	   Rugova, 53, is the elected leader of the Kosovo Albanians, who
make up 90 percent of the population in the province. Serbia, which
revoked Kosovo's autonomy in 1989, never recognized Rugova as the
province's leader.
	   Previous winners of the Sakharov prize include the South African
leader Nelson Mandela, the Burmese opposition leader Aung San Suu
Kyi, and Chinese dissident Wei Jingsheng.
	   The prize comes with 15,000 European currency unit (dlrs
16,500).

Ukraine's parliament fails to ban NATO-led peacekeeping maneuvers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Communists and their allies in Ukraine's
leftist-dominated parliament lashed out Friday against an upcoming
NATO-led peacekeeping exercise in Ukraine, but failed to ban the
maneuvers.
	   At the center of the stormy discussion was Sea Breeze '98, a
two-week naval exercise under NATO's Partnership for Peace program
that is scheduled to begin at Ukraine's Crimean peninsula this
weekend.
	   After a prolonged and heated debate, leftist lawmakers fell two
dozen votes short of approving a bill that would have banned this
year's Sea Breeze and any other military maneuvers with foreign
participation in Ukraine.
	   Communists, who failed to pass a similar bill before last year's
Sea Breeze, said the exercise would be used by NATO ``to work out
possible ways of action in case of a military conflict in Crimea''
and to increase its dominance over Ukraine.
	   Ukrainian leftists, who control about 40 percent of seats in the
legislature, are sharply opposed to NATO and Ukraine's ties with
the West in general. They call for closer relations with Russia,
which opposes any former Soviet republics joining the alliance.
	   Despite frequent attempts by the legislators to suspend
Ukraine's relations with NATO, the government has exercised a
nearly opposite approach in recent years, calling for closer ties
with the alliance and eagerly hosting joint maneuvers with NATO
countries
	   Defense Minister Oleksandr Kuzmuk said earlier in the day that
Sea Breeze '98 would be conducted regardless of what the lawmakers
decided.
	   This year's Sea Breeze, which starts in Crimea on Sunday, will
bring together warships, planes and marines from Ukraine, the
United States, Russia, Bulgaria, France, Germany, Great Britain,
Greece, Georgia, Italy, Romania and Turkey.

Stalled Congo peace talks scheduled to reopen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) _ African defense and foreign ministers will
meet in the Zambian capital Monday to try to restart negotiations
for peace in Congo, the Zambian foreign ministry said.
	   Ministers from the 14-nation Southern African Development
Community and officials from the continent-wide Organization of
African Unity will be joined by participants from Gabon,
representing French-speaking West Africa.
	   The foreign ministry said it was not clear if the full
compliment of SADC ministers will attend. Several had yet to send
confirmation.
	   South Africa was expected, as were officials representing
Congolese President Laurent Kabila and his southern African allies
_ Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe _ who have sent troops to support
him against rebels fighting to topple him.
	   A similar ministerial meeting held Sept. 10 at the OAU
headquarters in Addis Ababa failed to make progress toward
implementing a cease-fire in Congo.
	   It was not clear Friday whether Rwanda and Uganda, accused by
Kabila of backing the rebels, will send representatives to Lusaka.
	   Those countries have urged Kabila to meet with the rebels, but
he has repeatedly refused, insisting the conflict is not a rebel
uprising but an invasion started by Rwanda and Uganda using ethnic
Tutsi fighters.
	   Kabila's southern African allies decided Wednesday to mount an
offensive against rebels stronghold in the jungles of eastern
Congo.
	   Zimbabwe has dispatched at least 2,000 additional troops to join
3,000 already deployed in Congo, diplomats say.

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ The Faeroe Islands' fisheries
minister on Friday took temporary leave pending investigation of
charges that he raped a teen-age girl.
	   John Petersen, 50, has denied the charges that he raped a
17-year-old girl three years ago when she was living at his house.
No date for a trial has been set.
	   A member of the conservative Folkaflokkurin party, Petersen
began his second term as fisheries minister this year. His post is
one of the most important in the Faeroese government because fish
make up 97 percent of the islands' exports.
	   The Faeroes, an 18-island archipelago midway between Iceland and
Scotland, are Danish territory but have substantial home rule.

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Some 1,000 miners from southern Poland
marched through the capital Friday demanding pay increases, job
guarantees and preservation of retirement bonuses under the
government plan to restructure the inefficient coal mining
industry.
	   Chanting ``Solidarity, Solidarity'' and throwing concussion
grenades and eggs, members of the union left petitions with the
Labor Minister Longin Komolowski and parliament speaker Maciej
Plazynski to push their demands.
	   During the decades of communist rule in Poland, mining was the
most heavily subsidized industry and miners the most privileged
professional group. But the state-owned coal mines, which employ
245,000 people, lost 3.4 billion zlotys (just under dlrs 1 billion)
last year, according to government calculations.
	   A preliminary restructuring plan calls for reducing production
to 112 million tons in 2002 from 137 million tons last year, with
employment cut by 104,000 workers to 138,000 total in 2002.
	   The government estimates the program would cost 15 billion
zlotys (about dlrs 4.3 billion).

France pulls out of Confederations Cup

 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with FIFA reaction in grafs 5-7 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ World Cup champion France withdrew Friday from
January's Confederations Cup, snubbing the FIFA tournament which
many European leagues consider irrelevant and untimely.
	   The decision is ``irrevocable,'' said Claude Simonet, president
of the French soccer federation.
	   French league president Noel Le Graet has said the
Confederations Cup was ``just for fun,'' noting that Brazil was
only sending its ``B'' team and some club owners _ notably of
Italian teams _ had said they weren't going to release their
players.
	   That leaves the Jan. 8-20 event in Mexico, billed as FIFA's
tournament of continental champions, with Brazil, Mexico, Bolivia,
the United States, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and New Zealand.
	   Some federations and particularly European leagues regard the
event as an unneeded, one that exhausts already burned out players,
and comes in the middle of the European season.
	   France's ``Les Bleus'' were scheduled to represent Europe in the
competition.
	   FIFA president Joseph ``Sepp'' Blater expressed disappointment
at the decision but indicated no sanctions would be taken against
France.
	   ``It is regrettable that the French FA has made a decision like
this with only 100 days to go before the kickoff of this event,''
he said in a statement. ``For the world champions to withdraw from
an official FIFA competition in which the French team had
undertaken to take part as the representative of the European
confederation, UEFA, is hard for me to understand.''
	   Noting that the French decision appeared ``irrevocable,''
Blatter said UEFA would be responsible for selecting a European
team to replace France in the tournament. Blatter said he would
discuss the issue with UEFA president Lennart Johansson on Saturday
in Glasgow, Scotland.
	   Roger Lemerre, the new coach of the French team, had been in
favor of the French team's participation, which would have allowed
him to test new players.
	   January's tournament will be the fourth edition of the
championship, first contested in 1992 and always previously held in
Saudi Arabia.
	   French internationals playing in European leagues would have
missed domestic matches if they played in Mexico.

U.S. league gaining ground by not losing any
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BRIAN TRUSDELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Three years into his stewardship of Major League
Soccer, Doug Logan doesn't need to go far to find out what he has
done right or wrong, and what he should be doing.
	   From sports writers in the morning papers to cab drivers outside
his home, the MLS commissioner gets critiques: ban the shootout;
keep the shootout; change the schedule; get out of Tampa and Kansas
City.
	   He has been hearing less of one thing, though: Will the league
survive?
	   Not that the turnstiles are spinning like ceiling fans, or that
TV viewership is up for MLS games. Attendance and ratings are both
down slightly.
	   But in three years, no MLS team has moved or folded; it has more
than dlrs 100 million contractually committed sponsorship dollars;
it has major cable and commercial television exposure; it survived
the debacle of the U.S. national team's performance at the World
Cup without hitting so much as a bump in the road; and its top team
_ D.C. United _ has beaten the continent's best.
	   Additionally, average attendance dropped only 304 fans, or 2
percent, to 14,312, and MLS' television outlets, despite paltry
ratings, are happy about the demographics they're getting.
	   That doesn't mean everybody thinks everything is perfect.
	   While getting into a cab two weeks ago in New York City, Logan's
driver immediately recognized the stately gray-haired commissioner.
	   ``Meester Douglas!'' the Ecuadorian immigrant exclaimed.
	   ``Then he proceeded to tell me everything I've done wrong _ and
right _ by the time he dropped me off,'' Logan said.
	   Regardless of the Ecuadorian cabbie vote, Logan has his own list
of what's going well and not-so-well _ as does nearly everybody.
	   D.C. United president-general manager Kevin Payne thinks the
league may be overexposed on television. Los Angeles Galaxy
president Danny Villanueva worries about player development. Some
players are still grumbling about the ``single entity'' structure _
the lawsuit challenging it won't go before a court until next year.
	   Logan sees such problems as the attendance situations in Tampa,
Kansas City and Miami; television ratings; expansion _ and where to
play in Philadelphia, Houston or Portland, Oregon.
	   But this year, Logan also saw:
	   _an average crowd of 17,886 for the expansion Chicago Fire
(third best in the league);
	   _D.C. United beating Toluca of Mexico for the CONCACAF Champions
Cup;
	   _the emergence of young Americans such as Ben Olsen, Clint
Mathis, Josh Wolff and Mark Petke that gives hope the United States
can produce a harvestable crop of new talent.
	   On top of it all, when asked how the league is doing, Logan
points to the greeting displayed on his cellular phone: ``We're
still playing!''
	   ``This season reinforces my belief that we continue to have a
long way to go,'' Logan said. ``But it's certainly a validation of
our approach: a patient, slow approach.''
	   Besides the empirical data, such as an increase from 2.2 million
fans last season to 2.7 million this year, Logan measures small
indicators like the amount of newspaper space dedicated to MLS and
how far forward in the sports section MLS is placed.
	   He realizes many sports editors, broadcasters and other media
types still aren't convinced, and never will be.
	   ``They are going to have to retire, or die,'' he said.
	   Others use their own perception ruler.
	   ``There has been a tremendous improvement on the field as far as
Americans are concerned,'' MetroStars and U.S. national team
midfielder Tab Ramos said. And he isn't referring just to the
rookies like Olsen and Mathis.
	   ``The guys that were there the first year, guys like Jason Kreis
and Chris Armas, guys that were playing here in the United States
but in minor leagues, with a couple of years in the league have
gotten so much better.''
	   With the World Cup being played in the middle of the MLS season,
teams lost several of their top players for more than a month,
forcing coaches to use untested rookies such as Petke at the
MetroStars to replace veterans such as Alexi Lalas.
	   Olsen, who left the University of Virginia after his junior year
for the MLS and U.S. Soccer Federation's Project-40 program, ended
up playing in 31 of 32 games, starting 24, scoring four goals and
earning Rookie of the Year honors.
	   ``For us, MLS, some of the strides have been enormous,'' said
Dallas Burn coach Dave Dir, a veteran of the old NASL as a player,
and the minor leagues as a coach. ``The strides are much bigger
than many people know.''
	   MLS reportedly lost dlrs 20 million in each of the last two
seasons. But that compares with the reported dlrs 200 million lost
by clubs in the North American National Hockey League last season.
	   And despite the losses, word is that the league's
operator-investors have pledged another dlrs 100 million to get the
league at least through the next five years.
	   Money hasn't been flowing in a one-way direction for MLS.
Earlier this year, former U.S. Soccer Federation president and
league founder Alan Rothenberg exercised an option and bought the
San Jose Clash team for dlrs 25 million. And this week, billionaire
Philip Anschutz, who already owns the Colorado Rapids and Chicago
Fire, also bought the Los Angeles Galaxy for dlrs 26 million.
	   Those prices are a 500 percent increase from what it cost to buy
a charter franchise three years ago at a bargain dlrs 5 million.
	   The league expects to add two more expansion teams in the year
2000 and another two 2-3 years after that.
	   Logan says the league can have 16 teams drawing an average crowd
of 20,000 and turning a profit within five years.
	   To accomplish that, he's going to have to continue his ``Great
Wallenda'' act.
	   ``The purists say `Put the game out there and it will sell
itself,' '' Logan said. ``That has been the recipe for disaster for
the last several leagues. Trying to attract new fans and satisfy
the base is the biggest juggling act I perform.''

Cyclist Zuelle changes teams after Tour de France scandal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Swiss rider Alex Zuelle, one of the members of the
Festina cycling team expelled from this year's Tour de France for
taking an illegal performance-enhancing drug, is leaving the French
group, it was disclosed Friday.
	   Zuelle, 30, who was banned from taking part in competitions
until May 1 next year after he and two other Swiss cyclists
admitted taking the hormone EPO, has signed a two-year contract
with the Spanish cycling team Banesto.
	   Zuelle had a contract with Festina which guaranteed him 10
million Swiss francs (dlrs 7.4 million) over a two year period from
1998 to 2000 and made him the highest-earning sportsman in
Switzerland.
	   However, this week the Festina team cut its budget for next
season by half and said its contracts with all its riders were
being renegotiated.
	   The new offer made to Zuelle was unacceptable, said Zuelle's
manager Marc Biver.
	   Biver is also the manager of Laurent Dufaux, one of the other
two Swiss riders who admitted taking EPO. Dufaux, who is currently
on holiday, will almost certainly look for another team if the
offer Festina has made is not improved upon, Biver said.
	   Zuelle rode for the Spanish ONCE team from 1991 to 1997 before
transferring to Festina.
	   ``It's marvellous to be going back to ride for a Spanish team,''
Zuelle said in Spain, where he concluded on Friday the final
details of his new contract with Banesto.

Vail fires won't affect ski world championships, officials say
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOELDEN, Austria (AP) _ Recent fires atop Vail Mountain will not
affect this season's alpine ski world championships, officials said
Friday at the International Ski Federation pre-season conference.
	   After seven separate fires ravaged the top of the mountain
Monday, destroying three buildings and damaging four chairlifts at
the chic Colorado Mountains resort, speculation arose that the
world championships were in jeopardy.
	   ``The fires did not affect the race facilities for the
championships,'' said John Dakin, vice president of the Vail Valley
Foundation. ``It's a great loss for the Vail Associates and
somewhat of an inconvenience for the guests for the moment, but it
won't affect opening day.''
	   The series of fires caused some dlrs 12 million in damage just
days after work began on a major resort expansion opposed by
environmentalists.
	   The Earth Liberation Front environmental group, linked to arson
incidents across the Northwest, took responsibility for the fires
to protest an expansion plan by the nation's busiest ski resort
``on behalf of the lynx.''
	   An investigation is still underway.
	   ``We are no longer worried about the effect it might have on the
worlds,'' Dakin said.

China's president says summits helped improve ties with Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese President Jiang Zemin told the visiting
Russian defense minister Friday that frequent summits have helped
build warmer ties between their countries, state media reported.
	   Jiang is expected to travel to Russia before year's end for
talks with President Boris Yeltsin, the latest of annual summits
started in 1994.
	   Improving ties now extend beyond diplomatic and trade relations,
to military and other exchanges, Jiang was quoted as telling
Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev. The Chinese leader added
that the progress was due partly to the frequent high-level visits.
	   ``It is our sincere hope that China and Russia can maintain
good-neighborly relations generation after generation,'' the Xinhua
News Agency quoted Jiang as saying.
	   Once fierce rivals for allegiances of communist nations, China
and Russia have signed agreements to reduce troops along their
4,330-kilometer (2,600-mile) border.
	   Russia has become the chief supplier of high-tech hardware to
China's military, the world's largest, which has bought equipment
including jet-fighter production lines and destroyers.
	   Russian media reports say Sergeyev is negotiating a contract to
supply China advanced Su-30 fighters, although members of the
military-industrial establishment have complained that too much
know-how is being sold to Beijing.
	   Sergeyev held talks Thursday with Chinese Defense Minister Chi
Haotian and met Friday with Gen. Zhang Wannian. Zhang and Chi are
vice chairmen of the Communist Party commission that oversees the
military. Jiang heads the commission.

 &UR; Corretja squeezes past Delaitre to qualify for Lyon semifinals

<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) _ Alex Corretja reached the last four of an
indoor tournament for the first time in his career Friday,
overcoming determined resistance from surprise quarterfinalist
Olivier Delaitre to win 7-6, 7-5 at the Lyon Grand Prix.
	   No. 4 seed Corretja, the world's number seven, has never before
progressed beyond the second round of an indoor event.
	   But the Spaniard said he is playing the best indoor tennis of
his career at Lyon.
	   ``This is a really important victory for me. I need to do well
indoors to qualify for the Masters,'' Corretja said after the
match.
	   France's Delaitre was in determined mood against his
highly-ranked opponent.
	   Though Corretja had six break points in the sixth game and a set
point while leading 6-5, there were no breaks of service in the
first set.
	   The Spaniard was in classy form in the tiebreak, which he won
7-2.
	   On Delaitre's first service point, Corretja sprinted several
yards wide of the court to chase a Delaitre smash and make a fine
backhand winner.
	   Doubles specialist Delaitre, currently ranked a lowly 224 on the
ATP tour, broke serve go 3-1 ahead in the second set, but the
Spaniard stepped up a gear to take the match in one hour 57
minutes.
	   Pete Sampras' withdrawal through injury Friday meant a walkover
for his quarterfinal opponent Tommy Haas.
	   In other quarterfinal matches due to be played Friday, No. 2
seed Patrick Rafter comes up against Wayne Ferreira of South
Africa, while No. 2 Marcelo Rios faces Frenchman Arnaud di
Pasquale.

Three ethnic Albanians sentenced in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Three ethnic Albanians in Kosovo
have been sentenced to up to five years in prison for ``terrorist
activities,'' the state-run Tanjug news agency reported.
	   Two ethnic Albanians received two and a half years in prison
each. One was sentenced to five years because he had taken away
weapons from Serbs to give to Albanian rebel fighters. He was
captured last May while trying to transfer the weapons.
	   Tanjug noted that the villagers from whom the weapons were taken
had permits for them. The three were tried by a Serb court in Pec
in western Kosovo.
	   Hundreds of ethnic Albanians are awaiting trial in Kosovo on
similar charges, mostly because they had joined the rebels fighting
the Serbian government forces for secession of the province.

Di Canio banned for 11 games, fined 10,000 pounds
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS quotes from Alcock, coach Danny Wilson &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SHEFFIELD, England (AP) _ Sheffield Wednesday striker Paolo Di
Canio was banned for 11 games and fined 10,000 pounds (dlrs 16,900)
Friday for pushing referee Paul Alcock to the ground in a Sept. 26
match.
	   The 30-year-old Italian learned of his punishment after
appearing before a three-man Football Association disciplinary
panel.
	   Di Canio, who was suspended immediately after the home match by
his Sheffield club, had reportedly faced a possible ban of up to
six months from the English game.
	   ``I'm very, very sorry for what happened,'' he said at a news
conference after the verdict was announced. ``I had a fair hearing
and I accept that. I'll see the Sheffield Wednesday fans on Boxing
Day (Dec. 26), the first game after my suspension.''
	   The club said there would be no appeal.
	   ``During the hearing Paolo apologized,'' said a club spokesman
said. ``He apologizes to the commission, he apologizes to the
referee, he apologizes to the club and its fans.
	   ``The club is now looking forward to having him back playing
with us before the end of 1998.''
	   The 11-match ban includes an automatic three-game suspension for
receiving a red card. Di Canio has already served one game of the
suspension and will now miss another 10 before returning to action.
	   However, Alcock was unhappy, and so was Philip Don, who serves
as a spokesman for Premier League referees.
	   ``I'm concerned that the message being sent out by the FA will
be interpreted as being lenient by every referee in this country,''
Alcock said.
	   Don added, ``There were 340 assaults on park referees last
season. What message does this punishment send out to them and what
confidence will they have in the FA?
	   ``It is fair to say I am disappointed with the verdict because I
thought it would be longer. ``Paolo Di Canio has been found guilty
of a major disciplinary issue and I don't think the punishment is
correct.''
	   Sheffield Wednesday coach Danny Wilson reserved comment.
	   ``I need to get my head around this before deciding what I will
say,'' he said. ``We've a very important game tomorrow (at home to
Everton) and I may make some comment then.''
	   Alcock was pushed to the ground after he gave Di Canio a red
card for his part in a brawl in the final minutes of the first half
of the game against Arsenal.
	   Arsenal's Martin Keown was also sent off as a melee among a
dozen players broke out following a tussle between Arsenal's
Patrick Vieira and Wim Jonk.
	   Di Canio later suggested Alcock play-acted and compared him to a
player diving to draw a penalty.
	   ``I pushed (the ref) in the stomach,'' Di Canio said last month.
``He took 3-4 steps sideways and fell like a player'' who dives for
a penalty.
	   Alcock, who denied Di Canio's allegation, said he considered
quitting the sport after the incident but had since changed his
mind.
	   ``I am certainly not going to let something like this beat me,''
Alcock said Thursday. ``I was caught totally by surprise and the
shock caused me to lose my balance.''
	   ``I thought on the way home whether I really need the pressure
of this particular incident and I have thought over the past two or
three weeks whether I need to carry on.
	   ``But at the end of the day I am certainly not going to let an
incident like that stop me refereeing.''

Prime minister says Serbian government in full compliance with
</HEADLINE>
Kosovo agreement

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian government has fully
complied with commitments undertaken in the U.S.-brockered
agreement to defuse the crisis in Kosovo, Serbia's prime minister
claimed Friday.
	   The state-run Tanjug news agency quoted Prime Minister Mirko
Marjanovic as saying Serbia has followed through on all commitments
undertaken in the agreement reached between U.S. envoy Richard
Holbrooke and Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   Milosevic agreed to pull back troops from the strife-torn,
Albanian-majority province in order to defuse the crisis without
NATO airstrikes.
	   He also agreed to a 2,000-strong, unarmed ``verifiers'' who will
scout the province to observe whether the deal was honored. They
will be provided by the Organizations for Security and Cooperation
in Europe.
	   But fighting between the ethnic Albanian guerrilla and Serb
police and army units in Kosovo has been reported even after the
agreement was reached.
	   Speaking at the opening of a new, government-owned petrol
research center in the north of Serbia, Marjanovic said that
``efforts of terrorist gangs (in Kosovo) to undermine'' the
Holbrooke-Milosevic agreement would not succeed.
	   ``We expect and demand that the international community,
primarily the OSCE verifiers mission will, through insight into the
situation in Kosovo, be able to clearly show that the major cause
of the problems in the province is terrorism of (ethnic) Albanian
separatists,'' Marjanovic said.
	   He added he expected the international community to sanction the
acts of the separatists.

Toddler escapes death after being tossed into ceiling fan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ A Bahraini baby narrowly escaped death
when his sister inadvertently tossed him into a whirling ceiling
fan, a newspaper reported Friday.
	   Doctors operated on 12-month-old Jamil Ali Abdullah for five
hours after he was admitted to the Salmaniyah Medical Complex in
Manama with a profusely bleeding forehead, the Bahrain Tribune
reported.
	   But the hospital said Abdullah sustained no permanent injury and
he was discharged Thursday, the paper reported.
	   The accident happened when Abdullah's sister Ghada, 15, lovingly
tossed him into the air while playing with him, the paper said. The
fan blades hit the toddler and threw him into the corner of the
living room.
	   The newspaper, which ran a front-page picture of Abdullah's
bandaged head, did not say when the incident occurred.

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Command of the NATO-led
peace force in Bosnia changed hands Friday, with U.S. Gen.
Montgomery Meigs taking over from U.S. Gen. Eric Shinseki.
	   For three years, the force has been ensuring that Bosnia's
Serbs, Muslims and Croats maintain the peace they agreed to in the
1995 Dayton accords. Some 36,000 troops from 40 countries and
stationed across the country make up the NATO-led force.
	   In the 15 months under Shinseki, the troops successfully oversaw
three elections and arrested several war-criminals.
	   Deputy NATO Secretary General Sergio Balanzino flew in from NATO
headquarters in Brussels to attend handover ceremonies in Sarajevo
and present Shinseki with a medal for his services.
	   Balanzino was standing in for NATO Secretary General Javier
Solana, who was called away to an important meeting in Brussels.
	   A meeting with the newly elected tripartite Bosnian presidency
was canceled due to bad weather, which delayed Balanzino's arrival,
but the secretary general told journlaists after the ceremony he
had a message for leaders: ``Comply with Dayton. Don't allow
disruption and disorder in your country which is now rebuilding
itself.''
	   Shinseki knows his successor since they fought together in
Vietnam. It was Meigs who found himself at outgoing general's
bedside after his second injury back then to donate blood, Shinseki
said.
	   ``Monty, God bless and best wishes for a great ride,'' he told
his successor, as he handed over the flag.
	   Before departing Shinseki thanked everyone _ foreigners and
Bosnians alike _ who helped make his mission a success.
	   ``Forty nations, indeed, the entire World has come to
Bosnia-Herzegovina at your invitation to give you the opportunity
to put the war behind you,'' he told local politicians.
	   Those who oppose Dayton will not last long and continuing the
war by other means will not work, Shinseki said.
	   ``Mark my words, ... the rule of law is coming,'' he said.
``Each successful election will change the face of government here
forever.''

Pope to hand out awards at World Cup ski finals in 2000
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SOELDEN, Austria (AP) _ Skiers at the 2000 World Cup ski finals
in Bormio, Italy, will have to share the spotlight with former ski
racer Pope John Paul II.
	   Gian Franco Kasper, president of the International Ski
Federation (FIS), said Friday that the pope has agreed to include
the two-week event as part of the Holy Year celebrations.
	   Kasper said the pontiff, who used to race as a youngster in
Poland, will hand out awards at a prize-giving ceremony in St.
Peter's Square in Vatican City.
	   ``It's part of the Holy Year program that the Pope is involved
with this,'' Kasper said. ``Of course, it will depend on his
health. He has also decided to be present at the races if his
health will allow it.''
	   As a young man, the pope was a licensed racer in Poland.
	   ``He used to be an excellent skier and we still have the
original of the pope's racing license from when he was competing in
Poland,'' Kasper said. ``He was still skiing 10 years ago. I
remember we gave him a pair of skis which were very specially made
with a cross for the pope because he went skiing once or twice a
year as far as I know.''
	   The 2000 World Cup finals will include competition in all five
World Cup ski circuits _ alpine, cross-country, freestyle skiing,
nordic-combined and snowboarding. The tentative date for the event
is March 15-19.
	   It will be the first time all five disciplines contest their
finals at one event.
	   Until now, the different World Cup circuits all organized their
own finals.
	   The ``mini-Olympics'' will be held every four years when neither
the Olympic Games nor World Championships are scheduled.
	   The 2000 event will be staged in Bormio, Santa Caterina, Livigno
and St. Moritz. St. Moritz, which will host the Nordic combined, is
in Swiss territory but less than 50 kilometers (30 miles) from
Bormio.

Central Banker predicts collapse of hundreds of banks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs; UPDATES with debt restructuring talks to resume next
week. &QL; 
 &UR; By LESLIE SHEPHERD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's chief banker predicted Friday that only a
fraction of the country's commercial banks would survive the
current economic crisis, even with help from the Central Bank.
	   ``We reckon that only a small number of banks will be able to
stay afloat in the current situation,'' said Central Bank chairman
Viktor Gerashchenko.
	   ``I expect that 200-300 banks will be able to cope with the
financial problems,'' he said, according to the Interfax news
agency.
	   The Central Bank recently estimated there were 1,700 commercial
banks in Russia, although the Profil business weekly said only 905
remained profitable after the crisis erupted in mid-August.
	   Russian entrepreneurs rushed to open banks in the post-Soviet
era, but few of the enterprises ever established a solid financial
footing or offered western-style retail services.
	   Many collapsed in the wake of the crisis or froze accounts.
Dealing among other banks all but stopped, due to the plummeting
ruble, a lack of capital and potential losses resulting from huge
investments in the treasury bills the government defaulted on.
	   Talks between Russian officials and foreign banks that hold many
of the treasury bills broke down in London on Thursday, but
Germany's Deutsche Bank AG said they will resume next week.
	   Foreign banks fear they will be offered less favorable repayment
rates than Russians.
	   The Central Bank said Thursday that 61 billion rubles (dlrs
3.58) would be needed to bail out the country's banking system. It
said it would help the most viable and important banks, as well as
key banks in the regions.
	   Meanwhile, the government lowered import duties Friday on meat,
milk and other staples in an effort to prevent any shortages this
winter.
	   Russia relies heavily on imports, which have fallen since the
crisis as become more expensive as the ruble loses value.
	   The country has not experienced any food shortages, and is not
expected to. But the government wants to make sure there is plenty
of food on hand for the winter.
	   The Interfax news agency said the import duties on meat have
been trimmed from 15 percent to 10 percent, on milk from 10 percent
to 5 percent and on butter, from 20 percent to 15 percent. Duties
on other foods, such as soybeans, also were lowered.
	   The government continued talks Friday with officials from the
International Monetary Fund. Few details have been released, but
the IMF top representative in Russia, Martin Gilman, has said that
the question of further IMF loan installments has not come up.
	   A dlrs 22.6 billion loan package, put together by the IMF before
the crisis, was frozen in September after the first dlrs 4.8
billion installment was provided.
	   The IMF has said it will not release more money until it sees
Russia's plan for coping with the economic crisis and signs that it
is being implemented. Russia has already indicated it is putting
together only short-term measures, rather than a comprehensive,
long-term plan.

NATO headquarters for Kosovo mission to be near Macedonian capital
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ A NATO headquarters for the air
surveillance mission over Kosovo is likely to be set up near the
Macedonian capital, the country's defense minister said Friday.
	   Macedonia's defense minister, Lazar Kitanoski, told reporters
that an Alliance headquarters will probably be established at the
military airfield and barracks in Kumanovo, about 20 kilometers (12
miles) northeast of capital Skopje.
	   Between 100 and 150 NATO personnel are expected to be based
there, Kitanoski added.
	   ``A NATO experts team has been in Macedonia for the past two
days to review the conditions at the Kumanovo facility and will
report back to Brussels,'' Kitanoski said.
	   The final decision to begin setting up the base is expected to
be taken by NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, oon, he also
said.
	   On Thursday, NATO's Secretary-General Javier Solana said the
Alliance wanted to station a unit in Macedonia and would finalize
plans for a ``coordination cell'' there.
	   The purpose of the cell would be to support NATO's mission to
verify Serbian government compliance with the deal to end the
crisis in neighboring Kosovo.
	   It would also serve to provide back-up for the 2,000 unarmed
``verifiers'' who will make sure Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic and the ethnic Albanians honor the Oct. 12 agreement to
defuse the crisis without NATO airstrikes.
	   But an opposition coalition opposed to a NATO role in Macedonia
finished ahead of the government in the first round of national
elections last weekend. The final balloting is set for Nov. 1.
	   Kitanoski said the deployment of a NATO headquarters on
Macedonian territory was not a threat to neighboring Serbia, which
includes Kosovo, but would represent an act of good will on
Macedonia's part.
	   ``We are safer with NATO than without it,'' Kitanoski replied
when asked about the possibility of hostile acts from its Balkan
neighbor.
	   Macedonia became a member of NATO's Partnership for Peace
Program in 1995 and wants to join the Alliance.

	   The U.S. embassy in Brasilia said Washington had not decided
whom to send.
	   The dispute centered on a remote jungle area called Tiwintza,
located on a 48-mile (78 kilometer) stretch of border not included
in the 1942 Rio de Janeiro Protocol that set territorial
boundaries. Soldiers from Peru and Ecuador fought there in 1941,
1981 and 1995.
	   Peace talks begin in 1995. After years of slow progress, the
presidents of the two nations met in August to work out the
details.
	   As a condition for brokering the peace talks, the four guarantor
nations required prior approval of the accord by the Peruvian and
Ecuadoran congresses and a promise that neither side would later
try to modify it.

Walker arrives in Pristina to set up OSCE mission
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The American head of the Kosovo
ground verification mission, William Walker, arrived in the
province Friday, vowing to improve conditions for refugees and help
guarantee success of the Oct. 12 peace agreement.
	   Up to 2,000 personnel are expected to join the mission, run by
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, to provide
the ``eyes and ears'' of the international community and make sure
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic honors the accord.
	   ``I wanted to come in here as early as possible to demonstrate
the seriousness with which OSCE takes this mission,'' Walker said.
``I cannot tell you how impressed I am by the reaction of the
international community to put together this mission very quickly
and very robustly.''
	   Walker said OSCE officials ``think we can make conditions get
better and we are going to do everything we possibly can to help
Kosovo return to being a stable, peaceful community living under a
process of true democracy.''
	   He said the verifiers would help establish what is actually
happening on the ground in the province. He also safety was a major
concern.
	   ``It would be foolish of us ... to ask unarmed international
verifiers to walk into combat,'' he said. ``When two sides are
firing at each other, I'm not going to send my people into the
middle of it, because those are usually the people who get hurt.
But I don't think this is going to undermine our ability to know
what's going on.''
	   He also said he had received assurances of support from the
ethnic Albanian community.
	   ``I have been very encouraged by the talks I have had here in
Kosovo ... with representatives of the Albanian community,'' he
said. ``The last thing on their minds is bringing into harms' way
the international verifiers. I think everyone understands we are
coming in her unarmed with no preconceived opinions as to what's
been going on here. We are here to look and see what the reality of
the situation is.''

Suspected Turkish underworld boss sentenced to prison
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ A suspected Turkish underworld boss who
had escaped from prison was convicted Friday on charges of entering
the country illegally and possessing an unlicensed gun, the state
news agency BTA reported.
	   Yacup ``Kursat'' Yilmaz and Ali Oymak got a one-year term each
for illegal entry into Bulgaria and another 10 months for
possession of false documents, the report said.
	   Oymak will serve an extra year and three months for illegal
possession of a pistol.
	   The two other defendants, Suleyman Kavrak and Behcet Hasanov, a
Bulgarian ethnic Turk, were sentenced to three months on probation.
	   The court confiscated 50,000 US dollars, 50,000 Deutsche marks,
a Makarov pistol with a cartridge and 20 bullets. The convicts will
cover the expenses for the trial.
	   The sentence was passed by a panel of the district court in the
Black Sea town of Varna, where police arrested the gang last July.
	   Yilmaz and Oymac escaped from a Turkish prison last February.
Yilmaz has been serving a sentence for ordering his men to kill a
mayor and a businessman in southwestern Turkey. He had previously
also been convicted of extortion.
	   A separate trial on extraditing Yilmaz and Oymac to Turkey is
scheduled next month.

Parliament speaker berates organization on its anniversary
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Parliament speaker Apostolos Kaklamanis
Friday berated the United Nations and its secretary general for
discriminating against some countries.
	   Greece has in the past criticized the Security Council for
failing to implement more than one dozen U.N. resolutions calling
for a solution to the Cyprus problem.
	   In a letter sent to Secretary General Kofi Annan for Saturday's
commemoration of the organization's 53rd anniversary, Kaklamanis
called on the U.N. to respect its charter.
	   ``In the cases where the strategic interests of some powerful
members _ mainly the United States _ demand it, we have noted an
inordinate amount of zeal in the implementation of U.N.
decisions,'' Kaklamanis said.
	   The eastern Mediterranean island of Cyprus has been divided
since 1974, when Turkey invaded and occupied its northern third.
U.N.-sponsored talks to reunify the island have been deadlocked
since 1997.
	   Kaklamanis added that ``decisions should be implemented without
discrimination among member states, large or small.''
	   Athens is still stinging over its failure to win a non-permanent
seat on the Security Council earlier this month.
	   Kaklamanis, a member of the governing socialist party, has
criticized both the U.N. and U.S. in the past.
	   Earlier this year he accused U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Burns of
acting like an ``anthippatos,'' which in ancient Greek was used to
describe a deputy governor of Imperial Rome.

	   GRCINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ They were so close, just one more hill
to climb on the rugged mountain path from Albania to home. Five
adults carried some of the 11 children, with older kids helping the
younger ones in the pre-dawn darkness.
	   After a month in exile, they could return to their Kosovo
village because last week's political agreement would halt Serb
attacks, they thought.
	   Then came the gunfire, killing one man, his two young sons and
his niece. On Friday came the grief, with sobbing villagers burying
the four in a hillside cemetery.
	   ``Why didn't you take your uncle with you?'' Xhafer Sylmetaj
moaned into the ear of his 2-year-old nephew Mazlummi, lying in a
tiny wood coffin with a gaping bullet wound in his left cheek.
	   Caressing the stiffened hands and arms, he softly said, ``We
loved you. You loved us.''
	   The deaths Thursday in the mountainous border region between
Kosovo and Albania showed the enormous gulf between last week's
agreement by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic that averted
NATO airstrikes on his forces and the reality of daily life in the
war-torn Serbian province.
	   Despite the agreement's provisions for refugees from a more than
seven-month Serb and Yugoslav offensive to return home safely,
continuing violence _ including attacks by ethnic Albanian
guerrillas on Serb and Yugoslaw forces _ and intimidation by Serb
police hinders progress.
	   ``We thought it would be better now with Holbrooke,'' said Hamez
Sylmetaj, 73, the father and grandfather of three of the dead,
referring to U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke's agreement with
Milosevic. ``If we are not helped by America and Europe, then the
Serbs will continue to do this.''
	   A Yugoslav army statement issued in Pristina described the
killings as a shootout between border guards and Albanian
guerrillas who used women and children as shields when smuggling
weapons.
	   The army said the smugglers fired first after being warned to
stop, and that four people were killed and two wounded, all of them
Albanians.
	   Survivors related a far different story.
	   Fadil Sylmetaj, his eyes puffy from weeping, said no warning was
issued as he and his brother led their wives and six children,
along with their sister-in-law and her five kids on the final steps
of an eight-hour journey from Albania.
	   ``They didn't even say stop, or do this or that. They just
started shooting,'' he said. ``I couldn't protect the children. It
was so awful.''
	   In a room of moaning, wailing women wearing the white scarves of
grief, Lindita Sylmetaj, 15, also described the shooting as sudden.
She had a small cut under her left eye and stitches in her left ear
from a bullet graze, and her hands nervously tied and untied her
scarf as she spoke.
	   ``We didn't see anybody, they just started shooting at us'' she
said above the grieving din. ``The children were screaming and my
uncle yelled, `Stop firing, stop shooting us.' While I was getting
up to help my cousin, another shot hit me. They were shooting
again.''
	   When it stopped, Ramiz Sylmetaj, 27, and his sons Muharremi, 6,
and Mazlummi were dead. His wife Ashja, 23, was seriously injured.
Lindita's sister Leonora, 12, also was badly hurt.
	   ``We carried her, but after we left the soldiers, she died,''
Lindita said.
	   Mourners packed another room where the bodies lay, Leonora's
pale face cradled by her mother and grandmother. When the coffin of
Mazlummi was opened, several women screamed and some were carried
out, convulsed in grief.
	   ``I'm 75 years old,'' muttered Fetah Thaci, wearing the
traditional white dome cap of Albanian elders. ``I remember World
War II. Milosevic is worse than Stalin or Hitler, to massacre women
and children.''
	   The Sylmetaj brothers took their families to Albania on Sept.
20, fearing attack in a Serb police and Yugoslav army offensive in
the area south of Jakovica in southwestern Kosovo, relatives said.
	   After the Oct. 12 agreement between Holbrooke and Milosevic,
they decided to return, even though more police and soldiers were
seen in the region.
	   ``After we crossed the border, I felt like I was home,'' Lindita
said. ``I wasn't afraid of anything.''

Parliament approves new defense minister, wage hike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Parliament approved a newly appointed
defense minister Friday and pushed through a controversial wage
hike for the president.
	   Pavao Miljavac, a former army general, was voted in, 69 to 18 by
the chamber, which is overwhelmingly dominated by President Franjo
Tudjman's ruling Croatian Democratic Union.
	   Opposition deputies objected acrimoniously to Miljavac, arguing
that appointment of a military official would hinder Croatia's
entry into Western defense structures _ primarily NATO's auxiliary
program, Partnership for Peace.
	   ``We can only accept a civilian defense minister as it
corresponds with international conventions to which Croatia
aspires,'' said Zlatko Tomicic, leader of the opposition Peasants
Party.
	   Military and diplomatic officials believe that a civilian is
needed in the position, in order to carry out stringent reforms and
implement drastic budget cuts needed to align the army with Western
standards.
	   Also Friday, deputies of the ruling party handily pushed through
a controversial wage hike for Croatian President Franjo Tudjman and
members of parliament.
	   Under the new legislation, effective Nov. 1, Tudjman will earn
420,000 kuna (dlrs 70,000), while deputies of the bicameral
parliament will pocket 198,000 kuna (dlrs 33,000) per annum.
	   The 200-plus percent increase _ 14 times the average monthly
wage _ was initially proposed in July to be 30 percent higher, but
was slashed following widespread public outcry.
	   The average Croat struggles to make ends meet on less than dlrs
500 per month. Pensioners receive half that figure.

New harsh media law is implemented: two editors, one publisher
</HEADLINE>
summoned to court &QL; 
 &UR; By JOVANA GEC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Two prominent independent editors
and a publisher were summoned to a Serbian court Friday for
criticizing President Slobodan Milosevic, becoming the first to be
tried under a harsh media law.
	   According to the new media law passed last Tuesday, each of the
three faces fines of dinars 400,000 to 800,000 (dlrs 41,000 to dlrs
82,000) for allegedly ``trying to undermine the constitutional
order'' of Yugoslavia by criticizing Milosevic and his rule.
	   Editors Slavko Curuvija and Dragan Bujosevic were ordered to
appear in court Friday to answer charges based on several articles
in the current edition of the Evropljanin (European) weekly, which
criticize Milosevic and his ``repressive'' policies.
	   The publisher of Evropljanin, Ivan Tadic, was also to be tried
at the same Belgrade district court on charges filed by a
progovernment group called the Patriotic Union of Belgrade. The
group is believed to be run by supporters of Milosevic's wife
Mirjana Markovic.
	   Proceedings started with about 100 independent journalists
following the three to the downtown court building in a show of
support.
	   Milosevic exploited anti-Western sentiments about possible NATO
intervention in Serbia's Kosovo province, where ethnic Albanian
rebels are fighting for independence, to pass a law banning
broadcasts of Serbo-Croatian language programs by foreign media.
	   The law also empowers authorities to determine which reports
break the law and are against the constitution and further
restricts working permits for news organizations.
	   Independent legal experts and journalists say the law reimposes
censorship, which Serbia formally abandoned in the late 1980s, and
drags the country back toward single-party dictatorship.
	   ``They want to strangle the independent media, the last
remaining point of resistance, with draconian punishments,
spreading fear among the Serbs,'' said Aleksandar Tijanic, a former
Serbian information minister and a Evropljanin commentator.
	   The Evropljanin article, entitled ``What Next, Milosevic?'' and
written as a letter to the Yugoslav president, criticizes him for
introducing ``dictatorship'' and leading the country into
political, economic and social chaos.
	   The charges filed by the Patriotic Union against the editors and
the publisher include two pictures published in Evropljanin, one of
a rebel of the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army and a soldier
from Romania's anti-Communist revolution, with the caption saying
``That's the way it ended in Romania.''

Greek Culture Ministry: Clerics demand return of Archimedes Text
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with reaction from Christie's. No pickup &QL; 
 &UR; By ELENA BECATOROS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greek Orthodox clerics are demanding the
return of the only known copy of a text by the ancient Greek
scientist Archimedes due to be auctioned next week, Greece's
culture ministry said Friday.
	   But if the manuscript's current holders _ a French family _ do
not return the 1,000-year-old copy, the Orthodox Patriarchate of
Jerusalem would consider taking legal measures, Culture Minister
Evangelos Venizelos said.
	   ``According to the Jerusalem Patriarchate, the manuscript has
been stolen,'' Venizelos said.
	   An auction for the 174-leaf text has been set for Oct. 29 at
Christie's in New York. It includes transcriptions of writings on
geometry and physics by the 3rd century BC theoretician and
inventor. Christie's anticipated it could fetch between dlrs
800,000 to dlrs 1.2 million.
	   A Christie's spokeswoman said the auction date has not been
affected by the Patriarchate's claim.
	   ``As far as I know, the sale will take place as scheduled
because Christie's continues to be satisfied that the consignor has
a legitimate title and right to sell,'' Vredy Lytsman told The
Associated Press.
	   But the auction house has said it would call off the sale if
there was proof that the manuscript was not legitimately owned by
the French holders.
	   Venizelos originally appealed to several Greek groups and
businesses to pool funds to bid on the text.
	   But then questions were raised the ownership of the manuscript,
which was lost when the Patriarchate's library was transferred to
Athens from Constantinople _ now Istanbul _ after World War I. It
had been housed earlier in Orthodox monasteries in Palestine.
	   If the Jerusalem Patriarchate can prove its ownership, the
manuscript _ known as the Archimedes Palimpsest _ will be housed in
Athens' National Library, Venizelos said.
	   A palimpsest is a manuscript whose pages have been written on
twice. When writing materials were in short supply, the original
text would be washed away when no longer deemed useful.
	   A U.S. lawyer for the Jerusalem Patriarchate, Simos Dimas,
drafted a letter to Christie's to demand the manuscript's return,
Venizelos said. Christie's has not released the name of the family
that placed the text up for auction.
	   According to a statement by Felix de Marez Oyens, the head of
the auction house's Books and Manuscripts Department, Christie's is
satisfied it ``has been legitimately owned by a French family for
the last three-quarters of a century.''
	   If the auction goes ahead, the Greek government will bid for it,
Venizelos stresses.
	   ``If the outcome is negative for legal issues _ because
historically and morally, there is no doubt that the Patriarchate
is right _ of course we will return to our efforts of purchasing
this manuscript,'' he said.

Parliament allows NATO aircraft to use its airspace
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ The Bulgarian parliament agreed Friday to
allow NATO planes to use Bulgarian airspace if the alliance
launches airstrikes against neighboring Yugoslavia.
	   The decision passed parliament by a vote of 150 for and 47 _
mostly from the opposition Socialist party _ against. Nine
lawmakers abstained.
	   Earlier this month, NATO's North Atlantic Council had asked
Bulgaria to allow unlimited access to its airspace for possible
military operations over Yugoslavia.
	   The declaration passed Friday stresses Bulgaria's will for a
peaceful solution to the conflict and states that the country won't
participate directly or indirectly in military actions in
Yugoslavia.

	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ Peru and Ecuador have agreed on terms to
end a border dispute that has lasted nearly 60 years and caused
three wars over one of South America's last border flashpoints,
diplomatic sources said Friday.
	   Presidents Alberto Fujimori of Peru and Jamil Mahuad of Ecuador
will sign a peace accord on Monday here in Brazil's capital, where
the negotiations took place, the sources said.
	   The two neighbors fought wars in 1941, 1981 and 1995 over the
unmarked border in the jungle-covered Cordillera del Condor region.
The full border stretches 1,050 miles (1,690 kilometers) through
mainly jungle terrain.
	   The dispute centered on a remote jungle area called Tiwintza,
located on a 48-mile (77-kilometer) stretch of border that was not
defined in the 1942 Rio de Janeiro Protocol that set territorial
boundaries.
	   Peace talks begin in 1995. After years of slow progress, the
presidents of the two nations met in August to work out the final
details.
	   The agreement was confirmed by sources of both countries, who
asked not to be identified pending an official announcement.
	   Although details were not released, the accord is based on a
proposal elaborated by the four peace brokers: Brazil, the United
States, Argentina and Chile.
	   Beyond setting the boundary between the two nations, it includes
an agreement security measures and on trade and navigation.
	   The presidents of Brazil, Argentina and Chile will attend the
signing as will King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia of Spain.
	   The U.S. Embassy in Brasilia said Washington had not decided
whom to send.
	   As a condition for brokering the peace talks, the four nations
involved in the talks secured approval in advance from the Peruvian
and Ecuadoran congresses for any deal negotiated.

Council discusses Iraqi questions about sanctions review
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. Security Council on Friday
discussed nine questions about a proposed review of Iraqi sanctions
that Baghdad wants answered before it will consider ending a 2
1/2-month boycott of U.N. arms inspections.
	   While the council met behind closed doors, chemical weapons
experts were wrapping up a two day assessment of tests by U.S.,
French and Swiss laboratories to determine whether Iraq loaded the
deadly nerve agent VX into missile warheads.
	   The Security Council imposed economic sanctions after Iraq
invaded Kuwait in 1990, and U.N. weapons experts must certify that
Iraq has destroyed its chemical, biological and nuclear weapons _
and the missiles to deliver them _ before the council can lift
them.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has proposed a ``comprehensive
review'' of Iraq's progress over the past seven years in
eliminating its weapons of mass destruction. The council has agreed
to conduct a review, but members say it won't begin until Iraq
rescinds its Aug. 5 decision to stop cooperation with the
inspections.
	   Annan's proposal would require inspectors to prove that Iraq is
still hiding banned weapons and set a timetable to clear up
outstanding disarmament issues so that sanctions could be eased.
	   Iraq has accused the U.N. Special Commission, known as UNSCOM,
which is charged with the disarmament task, of taking orders from
the United States, which opposes any lifting of sanctions until
Baghdad fully complies with the Security Council.
	   In its request for ``clarifications,'' Baghdad told the council
it wants inspectors to be forced to disclose the source of evidence
to back their claims that Iraq isn't fully disarmed.
	   That could be a problem considering some council members have
already expressed discomfort with Annan's proposal to shift the
onus of disclosing information about the hidden weapons from Iraq
to the inspectors.
	   Iraq also wants to know exactly how long after inspectors are
allowed to return to work the council will begin the review, and
whether Iraq would be allowed to participate.
	   According to Iraq, the review should also recognize that 100
percent verification of all banned weapons is impossible and should
quantify what margin of uncertainty the council would accept before
lifting sanctions.
	   The Iraqis also said the council should not enter a review
assuming that it will find gaps and holes in the country's past
declarations of its banned weapons.
	   The results of the scientific assessment on the VX tests could
be a key factor in the sanctions review.
	   Iraqi claims it was never able to produce enough VX nerve agent,
or stabilize it sufficiently, to load into missiles. But U.S. tests
showed traces of VX on fragments of warheads that Iraq filled
before the 1991 Gulf war.
	   The Iraqis challenged the validity of the U.S. test results,
prompting the United Nations to authorize a second series of tests
by French and Swiss scientists, which were being assessed by 17
experts from seven countries.
	   Chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler said he expected to
receive a report from the experts Friday evening and would forward
it to the Security Council and the Iraqis early next week.
	   Butler has said that even if the French and Swiss labs don't
turn up traces of VX, Baghdad still has to account for the findings
by the U.S. Army's Aberdeen Proving Ground laboratory.

Poles turn to local parties to run regional government, official
</HEADLINE>
results show &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Poles overwhelmingly voted for
representatives of local parties in regional elections two weeks
ago that showed serious losses for a center-right party led by the
nation's finance minister, according to official results released
Friday.
	   The ballot was ordered under the Western-style administrative
reform that reduces the number of provinces from 49 to 16 and
transfers some decision-making powers to the lowest levels of local
administration, dismantling the last remnants of communist-era
central government.
	   Local parties won 60 percent of the of the 63,765 seats on
provincial, district and various city and neighborhood councils,
the State Electoral Commission said.
	   The Solidarity bloc, which heads the national governing
coalition, had the best showing of national parties, winning 17
percent of seats on the local councils. The ex-communist opposition
won 14 percent.
	   The Solidarity-based Freedom Union, junior partner in the
national government, sustained substantial losses compared to the
last local elections, in 1994, winning just 2 percent of the vote _
behind the leftist Social Alliance of farmers and pensioners who
won percent.
	   The result was widely seen as a slap at the party leader, Leszek
Balcerowicz, who as finance minister is pushing through difficult
reforms. He is also the architect of Poland's economic ``shock
therapy'' that closed many inefficient plants, sent their employees
on a dole and introduced free market competition in the early
1990s.
	   Parties appealing to religious Catholics in this predominantly
Catholic nation also had bad showings. The extreme nationalist
alliance, Patriotic Movement ``Fatherland,'' won just .4 percent.
And a party supported by the conservative Catholic Radio Maryja,
the
	   Polish Family, won just .2 percent of the vote in its first
election.
	   Turnout was an average 48 percent _ the highest ever in local
elections and significantly higher than the 30 percent initially
projected. The head of the State Electoral Commission said the
turnout showed that the Poles ``eagerly approve participation in
local government bodies.''

Argentine President: No apology to Britain over 1982 South Atlantic
</HEADLINE>
war &QL; 
 &UR; By BILL CORMIER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ President Carlos Menem said
Friday he offered no Britain apologies for the Falklands war, but
looked forward to a historic trip to heal wounds over their 1982
conflict.
	   Ahead of the first visit by an Argentine president to Britain
since the war, Menem called his trip ``a re-encounter and an
exploration'' during which he would express a ``will to normalize
relations definitively.''
	   But he insisted he never told Britain he was sorry for the
conflict in the South Atlantic, even though he lamented the
hundreds of deaths in the war for the Falklands, which Argentina
calls the Malvinas.
	   ``At no moment did I offer apologies,'' Menem told reporters
Friday, hours after Britain's largest-selling tabloid, The Sun, ran
a front-page headline stating, ``Argentine: We are Sorry for the
Falklands.''
	   The Sun quoted a letter from Menem as saying ``Some brave young
Argentine and British soldiers lost their lives in a conflict that
should never have happened and that we deeply regret.''
	   Asked about his choice of words, Menem told reporters: ``We are
simply making a reference to a lamentable situation ... many deaths
and blood that was shed.''
	   The war for the islands _ which are populated by some 2,200
people of mostly British ancestry _ claimed at least 970 lives,
including 255 British forces.
	   But Menem wrote in the Argentine newspaper Clarin on Friday that
his country has not renounced claim to the islands. Argentine
argues it inherited the islands from the Spanish crown before their
1833 occupation by the British.
	   Under the headline, ``Why we are going to London,'' Menem
declared in Clarin: ``The Malvinas are Argentine without a doubt''
and he would continue to press for ``our unalienable rights'' to
the islands.
	   Nonetheless, Argentine officials have acknowledged that the
dispute was not likely to be central to the five-day trip.
	   ``Unfortunately the British have shown themselves to be
intransigent when it comes to discussions with Argentine on the
issue of sovereignty,'' Argentine Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella
said.
	   Menem's state visit will be rich in symbolism, highlighted by a
wreath-laying at Britain's Falkland war memorial and a
reconciliation service at Saint Paul's Cathedral.
	   But beyond the symbols, Menem has said he wants both countries
to profit from ``strong and vigorous'' relations in trade, which
reached a record dlrs 1.2 billion in 1997.
	   Despite moves by both sides to focus on other issues, the
mission has revived Argentines' memories of the war. Newspapers
here have heavily covered preparations.
	   Opposition lawmakers have criticized the trip for apparently
leaving little room for real talk on the islands' sovereignty.
Hundreds of Argentine war veterans used the upcoming visit to
demand greater recognition and compensation, noisily protesting
outside congress.
	   In London, Prime Minister Tony Blair's spokesman said Thursday
that Menem's visit will not be overshadowed by either the Falklands
or the arrest of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the former Chilean dictator
who is under armed guard at a London clinic.
	   British police arrested the 82-year-old general on Oct. 16 on a
warrant from Spanish magistrate seeking to extradite him on charges
relating to the murder, genocide and torture of victims killed
during his 17-year rule.

German carmaker to invest 500 million pounds in Crewe plant
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Volkswagen said Friday that it will
invest 500 million pounds (dlrs 847.6 million) at the Rolls-Royce
and Bentley plant in Crewe, England over the next five years.
	   VW paid 479 million pounds (dlrs 790 million) for Rolls-Royce
and Bentley in early July, then sold the rights for the name
Rolls-Royce to BMW after agreeing that VW could use the name for
free until Dec. 31, 2002.
	   After that BMW will take the name and create a new Rolls-Royce
Motor Cars Ltd., and VW will continue producing the Bentley line of
luxury cars at Crewe.
	   While VW plans to increase output of Bentley cars to 9,000 units
in the medium term, it will leave the production of Rolls-Royce
cars at current levels, board member Robert Buechelhofer said at a
meeting of worldwide dealers in Crewe Friday.

Yankees pitching ace reunites with family after defection
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with airport confirming arrival. &QL; 
 &UR; By JUDIE GLAVE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ New York Yankees pitcher Orlando ``El Duque''
Hernandez on Friday was reunited with the family he hasn't seen
since defecting from Cuba on a raft 10 months ago.
	   Hernandez's mother, two daughters and ex-wife arrived at
Teterboro Airport in New Jersey at 2:45 a.m. on the private jet of
team owner George Steinbrenner. Hernandez and his mother wept and
hugged each other as friends stood by with bottles of champagne.
	   The family arrived just in time for Friday's parade in New York
City to commemorate the Yankees' World Series victory over the San
Diego Padres.
	   U.S. State Department officials and others said the family left
the island with the Cuban government's blessing for what is
expected to be a brief stay. They changed planes at Miami
International Airport late Thursday.
	   ``I am very happy that I will be able to see my dad. I have
missed him,'' said Yahumara, 8, during the stop. She and 2-year-old
Steffi both wore Yankees T-shirts.
	   ``I'm very happy. I'm very proud of my son,'' said Maria Julia
Pedroso Cruz, 52. ``He hasn't changed, in spite of the fact that he
has all that money.''
	   Since her son left, she said, ``it has been very difficult for
us, but we have survived the situation.''
	   Hernandez, who signed a four-year dlrs 6.6 million contract with
the Yankees in March, was banned from playing in Cuba for dealing
with American Major League Baseball scouts.
	   He fled by climbing onto a rickety raft with his wife, Noris
Bosch, and six others last December. They landed on a remote
Bahamian island and were rescued by the U.S. Coast Guard.
	   He became a key member of the Yankees pitching staff, helping
them to a 9-3 victory Sunday in the World Series, which New York
won in a sweep of San Diego on Wednesday night.
	   Hernandez asked Cardinal John O'Connor for help in bringing his
family in from Cuba, said Joe Zwilling, a spokesman for the Roman
Catholic Archdiocese of New York.
	   The cardinal sent a message to Cuban President Fidel Castro on
behalf of the player. The Cuban ambassador to the United Nations
called O'Connor late Wednesday and said the visit was approved,
Zwilling said.
	   The cardinal called Steinbrenner during the first inning of
Wednesday's game to give him the news, and the owner arranged the
plane ride.
	   Hernandez's half-brother, Livan, also played baseball in Cuba
and defected during a team trip to Mexico in 1995. He was the 1997
World Series most valuable player for the Florida Marlins and his
mother was allowed to fly from Cuba to Miami to visit him just
before Game 7.
	   Juan Iglesias, Livan Hernandez's agent, said he didn't know
anything about the latest Hernandez family visit, only that ``El
Duque'' was planning to fly to Miami after Friday's parade to visit
his brother.

Thriller writer Eric Ambler dies aged 89
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Eric Ambler, one of the founding authors of modern
thrillers and an Oscar-nominated screenwriter, has died, his agent
said Friday. He was 89.
	   Ambler had been ill for some time and died at his apartment in
central London on Thursday, agent John McLaughlin said. McLaughlin
did not give a cause of death.
	   Ambler had 21 books published, including his autobiography
``Here Lies'' in 1985. Among his best-known works are ``Epitaph for
a Spy,'' in 1938, ``The Mask of Dimitrios,'' in 1939, ``Journey
into Fear,'' 1940, ``Judgment at Deltchev'' in 1951 and ``The
Schirmer Inheritance'' in 1953.
	   ``He was one of the masters of the thriller and he really was
one of the great signposts, because he took the spy thriller out of
the gentility of the drawing room and into the back streets of
Istanbul and where it all really happened,'' said Frederick
Forsyth, author of ``The Day of the Jackal.''
	   ``He was the first of the realists, apart from being a very
charming man and he was what you'd call a good egg.'' Forsyth said.
	   In ``Whodunit,'' H.R.F. Keating's handbook of crime and suspense
fiction, Ambler is singled out as creator of ``a new phase in the
history of the spy story ... choosing as hero not an operative with
right and the Establishment on his side, but a person caught up in
the machinations of the Great Powers who was himself of the Left, a
doubter and an innocent.''
	   In Ambler's fifth book, ``The Mask of Dimitrios,'' he wrote of
an unassuming academic caught up in the murderous espionage battles
of the Balkans in the 1930s.
	   The novel, the first to bring him international recognition, was
made into a film by Warner Brothers, starring Sydney Greenstreet,
Zachary Scott, and Peter Lorre.
	   Ambler, born in London in 1909, had studied engineering at the
University of London and later worked in advertising. He served in
the Royal Artillery during World War II, rising to the rank of
lieutenant-colonel.
	   The early novels, beginning in 1936 with ``The Dark Frontier,''
were generally set in Eastern Europe and the Levant, and written
from a left-wing point of view, which was seen as a conscious
reaction to the tradition of John Buchan and others who had written
of the glory of the empire from within the Establishment.
	   Ambler also wrote 16 screenplays, the most noted being the
adaptation of Nicholas Monsarrat's novel ``The Cruel Sea,'' for
which he received a 1953 Oscar nomination. Others were , ``The
Purple Plain,'' in 1954, ``A Night to Remember,'' in 1958, and
``Wreck of the Mary Deare'' in 1959.
	   Ambler lived in Hollywood for some years with his second wife,
Joan, who worked as a film producer for Alfred Hitchcock. He and
the late Mrs. Ambler had no children. No funeral plans were
announced.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Echoing Western claims, Kosovo's
main ethnic Albanian leader said Friday that Yugoslavia has not
removed its troops from the embattled province and that little
progress has been made to defuse the crisis.
	   More than 10 days after a U.S.-brokered peace agreement, Ibrahim
Rugova told reporters that ``the Serbian forces have not yet
withdrawn from Kosovo,'' despite Yugoslav statements to the
contrary.
	   With NATO's latest deadline for Yugoslav compliance only four
days away, the alliance decided Friday to send its supreme
commander Gen. Wesley Clark and German Gen. Klaus Naumann to
Belgrade this weekend to insist that Yugoslavia speed its troop
withdrawal from Kosovo.
	   ``We have seen great progress, but we are still far from
adequate compliance,'' a NATO official told reporters in Brussels,
Belgium, on condition of anonymity.
	   Fighting has all but ceased in the southern Serbian province,
but tension remains high here despite the agreement averting NATO
airstrikes that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and U.S.
envoy Richard Holbrooke reached on Oct. 12.
	   State-run Tanjug news agency reported Friday that one Yugoslav
army soldier was killed Thursday and another seriously wounded when
ethnic Albanians attacked an army supply convoy traveling from the
provincial capital, Pristina, to the southwestern town of Pec.
	   The report said the army unit responded to the attack but gave
no further details. The statement corresponds with a report from
diplomatic observers that they heard heavy tank fire in the
surrounding Drenica region on Thursday.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and hundreds of thousands
driven from their homes by violence since Milosevic began cracking
down on ethnic Albanian separatists in February. The majority of
Kosovo's 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Albanians, and most favor
independence.
	   To reinforce the U.S.-brokered accord, American diplomat William
Walker arrived in the Yugoslav capital, Belgrade, Thursday to
oversee the establishment of a 2,000-member mission to make sure
Milosevic honors the agreement.
	   Walker will head the mission under the direction of the
Vienna-based Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
Walker met Milosevic early Friday and was later meeting Rugova in
Pristina.
	   After his talks with Walker, the Yugoslav president said in a
statement that he ``expects successful cooperation'' between the
OSCE mission and the Yugoslav coordinating commission, to be headed
by one of his top aides, Nikola Sainovic.
	   Milosevic also expressed hopes the OSCE mission would help
``secure peaceful solution of the existing problems,'' said the
statement, carried by Tanjug.
	   The rebel Kosovo Liberation Army has insisted it will not
abandon its goal of independence. The United States and the
Europeans reject independence but support some form of autonomy for
Kosovo.
	   The U.N. refugee agency said Friday that few refugees are
returning to their homes, due to fear and intimidation by Serb
police.
	   ``The impression our staff got on the ground is while some
people trickle back to their ruined homes, widespread destruction
of housing and fear of the continued Serb military and police
presence prevent significant return,'' U.N. spokesman Kris Janowski
said in Geneva, Switzerland.
	   But the Serb regional governor, Veljko Odalovic, accused ethnic
Albanian rebels of provoking government troops by attacking police,
killing five officers since Oct. 12.
	   Yugoslavia insists it has met NATO demands to withdraw troops to
the levels they were at before Milosevic began his crackdown.
	   U.S. and other Western diplomats dispute this, warning that
continuing violence threatens the Serbian province's peace process
and raises the threat of NATO airstrikes. NATO has extended its
deadline to give Milosevic until Tuesday to comply.
	   Rugova said he has seen no signs of progress. ``NATO should
maintain its 'activation order' and keep pressing the Belgrade
government,'' he said.

	   SOELDEN, Austria (AP) _ Skiers at the 2000 World Cup ski finals
in Bormio, Italy, will have to share the spotlight with former ski
racer Pope John Paul II.
	   Gian Franco Kasper, president of the International Ski
Federation (FIS), said Friday that the pope has agreed to include
the two-week event as part of the Holy Year celebrations.
	   Kasper said the pontiff, who used to race as a youngster in
Poland, will hand out awards at a prize-giving ceremony in St.
Peter's Square in Vatican City.
	   ``It's part of the Holy Year program that the Pope is involved
with this,'' Kasper said. ``Of course, it will depend on his
health. He has also decided to be present at the races if his
health will allow it.''
	   As a young man, the pope was a licensed racer in Poland.
	   ``He used to be an excellent skier and we still have the
original of the pope's racing license from when he was competing in
Poland,'' Kasper said. ``He was still skiing 10 years ago. I
remember we gave him a pair of skis which were very specially made
with a cross for the pope because he went skiing once or twice a
year as far as I know.''
	   The 2000 World Cup finals will include competition in all five
World Cup ski circuits _ alpine, cross-country, freestyle skiing,
nordic-combined and snowboarding. The tentative date for the event
is March 15-19.
	   It will be the first time all five disciplines contest their
finals at one event.
	   Until now, the different World Cup circuits all organized their
own finals.
	   The ``mini-Olympics'' will be held every four years when neither
the Olympic Games nor World Championships are scheduled.
	   The 2000 event will be staged in Bormio, Santa Caterina, Livigno
and St. Moritz. St. Moritz, which will host the Nordic combined, is
in Swiss territory but less than 50 kilometers (30 miles) from
Bormio.

Austrian chief denies doping accusations
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS with Maier denying accusations
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SOELDEN, Austria (AP) _ Olympic and World Cup ski champion
Hermann Maier on Friday rejected accusations that his stunning
success last season was due to use of banned performance-enhancing
drugs.
	   Appearing at a news conference on the eve of the new alpine
season, the Austrian star was bombarded with questions concerning
an article in the Swiss daily paper ``Sport,'' which quoted Swiss
ski boss Theo Nadig questioning Maier's rapid physical development.
	   ``Whenever you start from zero and rise to 100 you get people
who start asking questions,'' said Maier, who emerged from
obscurity last season to win two Olympic gold medals, the giant
slalom and super-g World Cup titles as well as the overall World
Cup crown.
	   ``The staff and coaches around me are more doped than I am. When
they have a cold they take medication, but when I have a cold I
can't take half of the products available.''
	   ``Sport'' quoted Nadig as saying that a diet of pasta and
granola could not explain Maier's rapid gain of muscle mass.
	   ``... Even if you train a lot, an athlete can only gain about 3
1/2 to 4 1/4 kilos (7-8.5 pounds) of muscle mass, and even that's a
lot,'' Nadig said in the article. ``But when you hear what's said
about Hermann Maier's development, you get suspicious. Alone, pasta
and Muesli won't achieve that.''
	   Maier attributed his powerful physique to his former profession
as bricklayer when he used to ``carry bricks and cement on my
back.''
	   ``I don't need to build muscle anymore,'' he said. ``I don't do
any weight lifting. I just train on my stationary bike about 2-to-3
hours a day depending on how I feel.''
	   Maier said he had been tested four times by the international
federation (FIS) since the start of the year. In addition, he said
he'd been tested ``about 20 to 30 times in Austria'' during his
career by the national federation.
	   FIS said Friday it would investigate the matter, and that Nadig
could face sanctions for making accusations without supporting
evidence.
	   ``We must see and study the article,'' said newly appointed FIS
president Gian Franco Kasper, who is Swiss.
	   ``If he's really accusing the Austrians without proof we might
have to take severe sanctions against him. If he has proof, he
should have gone through the proper channels and come to us.''
	   On Friday, Nadig told The Associated Press he felt such measures
would be unfair.
	   ``If I'm sanctioned for saying I want tougher drug control,
well, that doesn't sound right to me,'' he said. ``Three Swiss
cyclists were involved and admitted to taking banned substances
(during the Tour de France), so in Switzerland we're now very
sceptical.
	   ``I think doping exists in skiing and if we want to prevent what
happened in cycling we must take the proper measures now,'' Nadig
said. ``The reasons are there for skiers to turn to such methods.''
	   Over the summer, some 450-500 out-of-competition drug tests were
carried out, FIS said, and none were positive.
	   In a heated confrontation between Nadig and Austrian alpine
director Hans Pum during the pre-season FIS press conference, Nadig
eventually softened his statements.
	   ``I'm not accusing anybody,'' he said. ``I was just curious.
Hermann Maier is the reference point and as the head of the Swiss
team it's my job to find the best ways to train my skiers and
provide them with the best training possible.
	   ``I don't think that kind of muscle mass can be developed just
from pasta and Muesli (granola) and I was curious to know what they
were doing.''
	   In addition, Maier's name has been linked with doctor Bernd
Pansold, the last coach of the Eastern German women's swimming
team. Pansold works at the Obertauern independent Olympic training
center in Austria.
	   ``I train at the (Obertauern) sports center but my trainer is
Berg Mueller,'' Maier said. ``That other doctor (Pansold) is a
doctor who analyses physical performance data. I have no particular
contact with him.''

Three ethnic Albanians sentenced in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with another ethnic Albanian sentenced &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Four ethnic Albanians in Kosovo were
sentenced Friday to up to five years in prison for ``terrorist
activities,'' the state-run Tanjug news agency reported.
	   Three of these were tried in a Serb district court in Pec, 75
kilometers (47 miles) west of the provincial capital Pristina. Two
ethnic Albanians received 2 1-2 years in prison each while the
third was sentenced to five years.
	   Gasper Seljamanaj, 42, was sentenced to five years imprisonment
because he had taken away weapons from Serbs to give to Albanian
rebel fighters. He was captured last May while trying to transfer
the weapons.
	   Tanjug noted that the villagers from whom the weapons were taken
had permits for them.
	   At another court, in Kosovo's southeastern town of Gnjilane,
Ejup Salihi, 24, also received a five-year prison sentence.
	   According to the court, Salihi, had joined the guerrilla Kosovo
Liberation Army while in Albania and was captured smuggling arms
into Kosovo in July this year.
	   Also Friday, the Gnjilane court brought charges against 26
ethnic Albanians, 20 of whom are on the run while six have been
apprehended.
	   All were charged with conspiracy against the state and the
forming of a terrorist group with the aim to conduct armed assault
and kidnapping.

Zuelle changes teams after Tour de France scandal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Swiss rider Alex Zuelle, one of the members of the
Festina cycling team expelled from this year's Tour de France for
taking an illegal performance-enhancing drug, is leaving the French
squad, it was disclosed Friday.
	   Zuelle, 30, who was banned from taking part in competitions
until May next year after he and two other Swiss cyclists admitted
taking the hormone EPO, has signed a two-year contract with the
Spanish team Banesto.
	   Zuelle had a contract with Festina which guaranteed him 10
million Swiss francs (dlrs 7.4 million) over a two year period from
1998 to 2000 and made him the highest-earning sportsman in
Switzerland.
	   However, this week the Festina team cut its budget for next
season by half and said its contracts with all its riders were
being renegotiated.
	   The new offer made to Zuelle was unacceptable, Zuelle's manager
Marc Biver said.
	   Biver is also the manager of Laurent Dufaux, one of the other
two Swiss riders who admitted taking EPO. Dufaux, who is currently
on holiday, will almost certainly look for another team if the
offer Festina has made is not improved upon, Biver said.
	   Zuelle rode for the Spanish ONCE team from 1991 to 1997 before
transferring to Festina.
	   ``It's marvellous to be going back to ride for a Spanish team,''
Zuelle said in Spain, where he concluded on Friday the final
details of his new contract with Banesto.

British woman searches for husband's killers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANGELA DOLAND &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A year after her husband was stomped to death on
the Champs-Elyees by a gang of youths wearing Rollerblades, a
British woman has come back to Paris to find witnesses and,
ultimately, the attackers.
	   Eve Henderson, 52, has printed 300 color flyers that she will
pass out Saturday on the famous Paris boulevard.
	   She is especially searching for an American couple who helped
her husband, Roderick, as he lay unconscious on the sidewalk. She
hopes the couple will remember the faces of his attackers.
	   ``It hurts to come back here,'' Henderson said, sitting at a
Paris restaurant near the site of the killing. ``I know I only have
a needle-in-a-haystack chance of finding anything.''
	   The couple, from Swanley in Kent, England, had come came to
Paris Oct. 26, 1997 to celebrate Mr. Henderson's 54th birthday.
They spent the evening cruising on the Seine with their son and
nephew and having drinks in a cafe near the Arc de Triomphe.
	   Mrs. Henderson took a taxi home early, but the others stayed.
When the three men left the cafe in the early morning, about 10
young people surrounded them and began beating them, for no
apparent reason.
	   Scott Henderson and Andrew Knapp, the son and nephew, had no
serious injuries. Disoriented after the attack, they could remember
only that a middle-aged American couple stopped to help them while
they waited for an ambulance.
	   Mrs. Henderson brought her husband's clothes to the hospital, so
confident was she that he would survive. But he died several days
after the beating from multiple fractures of the skull.
	   While he was still on life support, Mrs. Henderson went to
several police stations, trying to find someone who could give her
information on the crime.
	   When she finally found some police who would talk to her, she
realized police at the scene had taken no witness reports.
	   ``It took me four months to discover that nothing much had been
done,'' said Mrs. Henderson, a secretary. In August, nine months
after the attack, a special police force took on the case.
	   Mrs. Henderson is in France with her representative from the
European Parliament, Peter Skinner. She hopes his political clout
will help cut through the red tape she says keeps tourists from
getting answers after a crime.
	   ``It doens't do me any good to criticize the process now,'' Mrs.
Henderson said. ``I'm more concerned with finding the attackers.''
	   ``It's a year later and I'm still looking,'' she said.

Leader of Kosovo Albanians awarded Sakharov human rights prize
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Parliament has decided to
award this year's Sakharov Prize to Ibrahim Rugova, leader of the
ethnic Albanians in the Serbian separatist province of Kosovo.
	   Parliament President Jose Maria Gil-Robles and leaders of the
political groups in the 626-member assembly voted Thursday in favor
of Rugova, who advocates a peaceful struggle for the independence
of Kosovo.
	   Rugova will be invited to receive the award at a December
ceremony in parliament headquarters in Strasbourg, France.
	   Other nominees were the Turkish human rights campaigner Akin
Birdal and Ukshin Hoti, an ethnic Albanian from Kosovo who is
currently under arrest.
	   Earlier this month Birdal, the head of Turkey's Human Rights
Foundation, was seen as the most likely contender for the prize
after the Parliament's foreign affairs committee gave him 22 votes,
against 16 to Rugova and six to Hoti.
	   ``Our party voted for Rugova, because we felt this was the right
thing to do in view of the current political situation in Kosovo,''
Helmut Weixler, a spokesman for the Parliament's Greens said.
	   Rugova, 53, is the elected leader of the Kosovo Albanians, who
make up 90 percent of the population in the province. Serbia, which
revoked Kosovo's autonomy in 1989, never recognized Rugova as the
province's leader.
	   Previous winners of the Sakharov prize include the South African
leader Nelson Mandela, the Burmese opposition leader Aung San Suu
Kyi, and Chinese dissident Wei Jingsheng.
	   The prize comes with 15,000 European currency unit (dlrs
16,500).

U.N. withdraws another official from Iraq for taking photos
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The United Nations has withdrawn a Chilean
pilot from Iraq for taking photographs in the second such move in
two weeks, the chief U.N. weapons inspector in Iraq said Friday.
	   Nils Carlstrom said the Chilean authorities wanted to withdraw
the pilot after Iraq accused him of spying and Richard Butler, the
head of the U.N. Special Commission on Iraqi disarmament, had
accepted the request.
	   The pilot had used his own camera to photograph sensitive
material in breach of the commission's rules, Carlstrom told The
Associated Press.
	   The Chilean will leave Iraq on the next available U.N. flight,
Carlstrom said, declining to identify him.
	   U.N. weapons inspectors rely on five Chilean helicopters and
their 40-member crew for their travel in Iraq and aerial
surveillance of weapons sites.
	   Last week Butler ordered Carl Pfluger, an American inspector, to
leave the country for taking pictures with his own camera of a
missile site close to Baghdad.
	   Iraqi newspapers reported the withdrawal of Pfluger with glee
Friday.
	   ``UNSCOM withdraws one of its spies (Pfluger) from Iraq,''
trumpeted the official newspaper Al-Iraq.
	   Iraq has repeatedly accused the U.N. weapons inspectors of
espionage and since Aug. 5 has blocked surprise inspections by the
experts, who are charged with supervising the elimination of its
weapons of mass destruction.
	   But Carlstrom said the withdrawal of the Chilean and the
American should not be interpreted as admission that the commission
was involved in espionage.
	   ``(The pilot's) withdrawal is not due to the wrongful
allegations of espionage, but to the fact that he violated UNSCOM's
own rules regarding the non-use of personal cameras on
inspections.''
	   Both the pilot and Pfluger would be dismissed from the
commission, Carlstrom added.
	   Under U.N. Security Council resolutions passed after the 1991
Gulf War, Iraq must show it has eliminated its weapons of mass
destruction before the world body will lift the trade sanctions
imposed after the invasion of Kuwait.

Imates hold guards hostage in Turkish prisons
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ A group of political prisoners, apparently
seeking better jail conditions, took guards hostage Friday at a
prison in western Turkey, news reports said.
	   It was not immediately clear how many guards were being held at
Bergama prison, some 570 kilometers (342 miles) west of Ankara.
	   Although paramilitary police had been stationed in front of the
ward, prison officials were ruling out a possible raid to release
the guards, the semi-official news agency said.
	   In a separate incident Friday, two inmates in the southeast,
died of severe burns after setting themselves afire, raising to
four the number of prisoners to die in a protest against the
government's crackdown on Kurdish rebels.
	   A third prisoner, at Diyarbakir jail, was rushed to hospital
early Friday and was in intensive care, the report said.
	   The prisoners, either awaiting trial or convicted on charges of
Kurdish separatism, were protesting government attempts to clamp
down on Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan and his group, which
is fighting for autonomy in southeastern Turkey.
	   Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz announced this week that Ocalan had
moved to Russia from Syria where he was believed to be in hiding.
Turkish and Syrian officials struck an agreement Tuesday under
which according to Turkish officials Damascus pledged to brand the
group illegal and stop its activities on Syrian territory.
	   Turkey's prisons, which house some 9,000 prisoners linked to
leftist or Kurdish groups, are frequently rocked by riots and
hunger strikes.

Police continue hunt for HIV sex-crime man
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ At least 120 women have reported having
sex with an HIV-positive man whom police are hunting on assault
charges for having unprotected intercourse despite knowing that he
carried the virus that causes AIDS.
	   The manhunt has been front-page news in Sweden for most of the
week and on Tuesday authorities took the unusual-for-Sweden step of
releasing his name and photograph, identifying him as James Patric
Kimball of the United States.
	   However, the name quickly proved to be false. Interpol reported
to Swedish police that the man, who had been living in Sweden since
1992 under that identity, was actually an Iranian named Mehdi
Tayeb.
	   The man is charged with rape and grave assault. The latter is
the charge used in Sweden to prosecute people accused of having
unprotected sex while knowing they are HIV-positive.
	   Police phones and an AIDS crisis line have been inundated with
calls this week, from frightened women and people providing tips on
Tayeb's possible whereabouts.
	   ''We have tips that he has been seen in the Stockholm area but
also in a far-away country,'' police inspector Lone Callias was
quoted as saying Friday by the Swedish news agency TT.
	   Tayeb, a taxi driver, was a well-known figure in Stockholm
nightspots, reportedly bragging that he had wide celebrity
contacts.
	   Although 120 women have reported having had sex with the man,
only one is so far known to have tested positive for HIV _ a
Swedish woman with whom he moved to the country from France in
1992, TT said.
	   The newspaper Expressen reported Friday that Tayeb had in the
1980s run a model agency in Deerfield Beach, Florida, using the
name Fabian Foxx. The agency was suspected of being a front for
prostitution, the newspaper said.
	   The Deerfield Beach detective whom the newspaper cited was off
on Friday and a duty officer told The Associated Press he had no
knowledge of the case.

Bulgaria clears minefields at Greek border
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Bulgaria began clearing several
minefields along its border with neighboring Greece Friday,
removing the last remains of a Cold War-era military confrontation.
	   A group of 14 sappers will remove some 1,640 anti-personnel
jumping mines from seven fields near the village of Egrek, about
350 kilometer (220 miles) southeast of Sofia within the next three
weeks, state-run BTA news agency reported.
	   Demining of the southern border started last May. Once cleared,
70-kilometers (44-mile) stretch of land along the border will be
given to local people for farming, planting tobacco and potatoes.
	   Bulgaria, a former Warsaw Pact member, had officially installed
the mines ``to protect the country from an aggression from
neighboring NATO countries Greece and Turkey,'' according to the
then-ruling Communist party. But it was widely believed that the
reason was to prevent people from fleeing the country.
	   Anti-mine action was launched following the Geneva convention on
anti-personnel mines, which Bulgaria signed last year.

Chechen officials concede that kidnapping ultimatum failed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Authorities in the breakaway republic of Chechnya
conceded Friday that an ultimatum demanding that criminal groups
release their hostages had failed, a news agency said.
	   Shadid Bargishev, head of the government agency in charge of
fighting the kidnapping gangs, said the government would begin to
use force against them, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Bargishev said the campaign to force the release of hostages
would begin Sunday.
	   Since the end of its 1994-94 war of secession against Russia,
Chechnya has been plagued by lawlessness, including dozens of
hostage-takings for ransom. The government has continually pledged
to root out the hostage-takers but has had little success in doing
so.
	   The government had recently demanded the immediate release of
all hostages, an ultimatum that was roundly ignored by those
holding them.

Report: Passenger bus hits land mine killing 26 people
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ A passenger bus hit a land mine in a
southern Afghan city, killing 26 people and wounding 30 others,
Radio Shariat reported Friday.
	   The bus packed with people attending a wedding hit the land mine
Thursday in the old quarter of Kandahar, said the radio broadcast
monitored in the Pakistani capital.
	   According to the broadcast the mine was a remnant of
Afghanistan's 10-year war against invading Soviet soldiers during
the 1980s.
	   Afghanistan is one of the most heavily mined countries in the
world. Many of the mines were laid during the Soviet occupation,
and others were buried during the bitter factional fighting between
rival Islamic groups who gained control of the country in 1992.
	   Kandahar is the headquarters of Afghanistan's hard-line Taliban
militia who rule roughly 90 percent of the country. Its opponents
control the remaining 10 percent.

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Graca Machel of Mozambique and Canadian
Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy were awarded Friday the Council of
Europe's annual North-South Prize for human rights and cultural
achievements.
	   The prize, a sculpture in marble and wood, was presented at the
National Assembly, Portugal's parliament.
	   Axworthy was given the award for his leading role in recruiting
support for the international treaty banning land mines that was
signed in Ottawa last year.
	   ``This is really a prize for the broad issue of the land mines
campaign,'' Axworthy said.
	   ``The importance of the prize is that it reinforces the need to
have the treaty brought into effect and actually get down to the
work of demining,'' he added.
	   Machel, who married South African President Nelson Mandela in
July, was not present for the ceremony. She was represented by the
Mozambican ambassador to Lisbon.
	   Machel, whose country endured a 15-year civil war that ended in
1992, has campaigned extensively for children living in war
situations. She heads the southwest African country's National
Organization for Children.
	   She also campaigned for the land mine ban.

France's star risks losing nation's top honors for bad behavior
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in 5th graf with quote from Depardieu saying he would
be happy to turn in the award. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ One of France's best-known faces, actor Gerard
Depardieu, risks losing his coveted Legion of Honor award because
of drunken driving, the newspaper France-Soir reported Friday.
	   The daily quoted two top officials at the ``Grande
Chancellerie'' which oversees distribution of awards like the
Legion of Honor and the National Order of Merit honoring French
citizens, as saying the procedure punishing Depardieu is underway.
	   ``We have just sent a letter informing Mr. Depardieu of the
procedure that has just been opened against him ....,'' the paper
quoted a top aide at the Grande Chancellerie, Francois Sourd, as
saying.
	   ``It is obvious he can present his explanations (for his
behavior) ...,'' Sourd said, meaning Depardieu can defend himself.
	   Referring to the award, France's LCI television quoted Depardieu
as saying, ``I would be happy to turn it in,'' and that he had not
received the letter.
	   Depardieu was convicted July 23 of driving drunk on his
motorcycle last May. A court gave him a three-month suspended
sentence and a 10,000-franc (dlrs 1,600) fine, and suspended his
driver's license for 15 months.
	   He was more than five times over the legal limit at the time of
the crash.
	   According to the code of the Grande Chancellerie, members of the
Legion of Honor convicted by a court of committing a dishonorable
act can be disciplined -- either censured or suspended or excluded
from the elite group.
	   The star of ``Cyrano de Bergerac,'' ``Green Card,'' and ``The
Return of Martin Guerre,'' suffered leg and facial injuries in the
accident. Depardieu has recently been hailed for his latest
performance in the made-for-television movie ``The Count of Monte
Cristo.''
	   Depardieu was among a parade of celebrities that included model
Claudia Schiffer and actress Claudia Cardinale who went to Slovakia
to stump for the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia, the governing
party, headed by Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar, in September.
	   Sourd said that was not a consideration in moving to discipline
Depardieu.
	   ``He didn't go saying ... `Look I have the Legion of Honor.' It
was a private, perhaps questionable choice,'' Sourd said, ``but not
contrary to the notion of honor.''

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ North and South Korea, the United States and China
inched forward Friday with talks on a permanent peace treaty for
the divided and tense Korean peninsula.
	   Negotiators gave mixed signals about progress in thrashing out
procedural details that had blocked earlier sessions last December
and March and highlighted the long path ahead.
	   ``We are not there yet. We have more work to do,'' said U.S.
delegation leader Charles Kartman.
	   ```We haven't been that successful today,'' said North Korean
Deputy Foreign Minister Kim Gye Gwan.
	   However, Chinese ambassador Quian Yong-nian said he expected
``some results'' by Saturday, the fourth and probably final day of
this round of talks. China is the main ally of Communist North
Korea.
	   The anticipated outcome is agreement to set up two
sub-committees to discuss how to replace the current armistice and
how to build confidence between the longtime foes.
	   North Korea previously demanded that the conference agree on an
agenda _ including its demands for withdrawal of the 37,000 U.S.
troops from South Korea _ before setting up working groups.
	   South Korea and its U.S. ally insist that while troop
withdrawals can be discussed, they should not be a formal agenda
item.
	   Agreement on procedures is vital because only after that can the
Geneva talks address the substance of a full peace treaty to
replace the armistice that ended the 1950-53 Korean war.
	   The border between the Koreas is the world's most heavily armed,
with nearly 2 million troops deployed on both sides.
	   Annual military maneuvers held jointly by South Korean forces
and their U.S. allies are scheduled to begin Monday.
	   Tensions flared this year after Pyongyang's Aug. 31 launch of a
small satellite, which was originally thought to be a ballistic
missile.
	   The launch showed the North's reclusive communist government had
developed a more advanced missile technology system than the United
States and its allies had previously believed.
	   In New York earlier this month, North Korea rebuffed a U.S.
demand that it stop testing and exporting long-range missiles.
	   However, Pyongyang is under pressure to make some compromises as
it desperately needs foreign food aid to feed its 23 million
people.
	   Decades of economic mismanagement have led to chronic shortages,
aggravated by three years of flooding and drought. Some U.S.
experts have estimated that 2 million North Koreans may have died
in the famine.
	   Park Kun-woo, leader of the South Korean delegation and chairman
of the current meeting, said heads of the four delegations would
meet Saturday morning to continue their work.

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Police on Friday confirmed that
there was no connection between the bombing of the Planet Hollywood
restaurant and two U.S. embassy explosions.
	   The three blasts happened within weeks of each other in August.
	   Police ruled out a tie within a few days of the Aug. 26
restaurant blast after the FBI visited Cape Town, police Supt. John
Sterrenberg told the Associated Press on Friday.
	   Shortly after the Planet Hollywood explosion that killed two
people, South African officials speculated there was a connection
to the Aug. 7 embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania.
	   In September, National Police Commissioner George Fivaz ruled
out international involvement in the bombing, but did not
specifically rule out a connection to the embassy blasts.
	   Sterrenberg said the question came up at a press conference on
Friday about crime statistics.
	   No arrests have been made in the restaurant blast.

Dressed in white shrouds, militants denounced Wye agreement

<TEXT>
	   RAFAH, Gaza Strip (AP) _ In a rally of the Islamic Jihad group,
Palestinians swathed in the white shrouds of suicide bombers burned
U.S. flags Friday and speakers denounced the Mideast peace
agreement reached at the end of a nine-day summit in Maryland.
	   Islamic Jihad leader Nafez Azzam said the land-for-security
agreement ``will encourage the Israeli enemy to continue its
crimes.''
	   The crowd chanted: ``We will never accept the Washington
solutions.''
	   Islamic Jihad, the smaller of two Islamic militant factions
staunchly opposed to peace with Israel, organized the rally to mark
the third anniversary of the assassination of its leader, Fathi
Shekaki. Shekaki was gunned down outside a Malta hotel in an
operation widely attributed to Israel.
	   The rally drew some 2,000 people who gathered in a square in
this squalid town. Youths set fire to several Israeli and American
flags and burnt an empty, black coffin with ``Oslo'' scrawled in
white on it, a reference to the Norwegian capital that hosted the
first secret contacts between Israel and the PLO.
	   Azzam did not mention carrying out new attacks against Israel,
but a man wearing a mask spoke through a bullhorn and said that
``Jihad members are ready to make our bodies a bridge to heaven.''
	   Islamic militants believe that suicide bombers go straight to
paradise.

Thriller writer Eric Ambler dies aged 89
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: Adds Ambler's awards, grafs 12, 13 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Eric Ambler, one of the founding authors of modern
thrillers and an Oscar-nominated screenwriter, has died, his agent
said Friday. He was 89.
	   Ambler had been ill for some time and died at his apartment in
central London on Thursday, agent John McLaughlin said. McLaughlin
did not give a cause of death.
	   Ambler had 21 books published, including his autobiography
``Here Lies'' in 1985. Among his best-known works are ``Epitaph for
a Spy,'' in 1938, ``The Mask of Dimitrios,'' in 1939, ``Journey
into Fear,'' 1940, ``Judgment at Deltchev'' in 1951 and ``The
Schirmer Inheritance'' in 1953.
	   ``He was one of the masters of the thriller and he really was
one of the great signposts, because he took the spy thriller out of
the gentility of the drawing room and into the back streets of
Istanbul and where it all really happened,'' said Frederick
Forsyth, author of ``The Day of the Jackal.''
	   ``He was the first of the realists, apart from being a very
charming man and he was what you'd call a good egg.'' Forsyth said.
	   In ``Whodunit,'' H.R.F. Keating's handbook of crime and suspense
fiction, Ambler is singled out as creator of ``a new phase in the
history of the spy story ... choosing as hero not an operative with
right and the Establishment on his side, but a person caught up in
the machinations of the Great Powers who was himself of the Left, a
doubter and an innocent.''
	   In Ambler's fifth book, ``The Mask of Dimitrios,'' he wrote of
an unassuming academic caught up in the murderous espionage battles
of the Balkans in the 1930s.
	   The novel, the first to bring him international recognition, was
made into a film by Warner Brothers, starring Sydney Greenstreet,
Zachary Scott, and Peter Lorre.
	   Ambler, born in London in 1909, had studied engineering at the
University of London and later worked in advertising. He served in
the Royal Artillery during World War II, rising to the rank of
lieutenant-colonel.
	   The early novels, beginning in 1936 with ``The Dark Frontier,''
were generally set in Eastern Europe and the Levant, and written
from a left-wing point of view, which was seen as a conscious
reaction to the tradition of John Buchan and others who had written
of the glory of the empire from within the Establishment.
	   Ambler also wrote 16 screenplays, the most noted being the
adaptation of Nicholas Monsarrat's novel ``The Cruel Sea,'' for
which he received a 1953 Oscar nomination. Others were , ``The
Purple Plain,'' in 1954, ``A Night to Remember,'' in 1958, and
``Wreck of the Mary Deare'' in 1959.
	   The Crime Writers Association awarded its Golden Dagger Award to
``The Levanter,'' in 1972, and in 1986 honored Ambler with a
Diamond Dagger Award. The novel ``A Kind of Anger,'' in 1964 won
the Mystery Writers of America's Edgar Allen Poe Award. The
American association made Ambler a Grand Master in 1975.
	   Queen Elizabeth II honored him in 1981 with an OBE award as
officer of the Order of the British Empire.
	   Ambler lived in Hollywood for some years with his second wife,
Joan, who worked as a film producer for Alfred Hitchcock. He and
the late Mrs. Ambler had no children. No funeral plans were
announced.

Inmates hold guards hostage in Turkish prisons
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to remove writethru designation &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ A group of political prisoners, apparently
seeking better jail conditions, took guards hostage Friday at a
prison in western Turkey, news reports said.
	   It was not immediately clear how many guards were being held at
Bergama prison, some 570 kilometers (342 miles) west of Ankara.
	   Although paramilitary police had been stationed in front of the
ward, prison officials were ruling out a possible raid to release
the guards, the semi-official news agency said.
	   In a separate incident Friday, two inmates in the southeast,
died of severe burns after setting themselves afire, raising to
four the number of prisoners to die in a protest against the
government's crackdown on Kurdish rebels.
	   A third prisoner, at Diyarbakir jail, was rushed to hospital
early Friday and was in intensive care, the report said.
	   The prisoners, either awaiting trial or convicted on charges of
Kurdish separatism, were protesting government attempts to clamp
down on Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan and his group, which
is fighting for autonomy in southeastern Turkey.
	   Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz announced this week that Ocalan had
moved to Russia from Syria where he was believed to be in hiding.
Turkish and Syrian officials struck an agreement Tuesday under
which according to Turkish officials Damascus pledged to brand the
group illegal and stop its activities on Syrian territory.
	   Turkey's prisons, which house some 9,000 prisoners linked to
leftist or Kurdish groups, are frequently rocked by riots and
hunger strikes.

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Chemical weapons experts were wrapping up
a two day assessment of tests by U.S., French and Swiss
laboratories Friday to determine whether Iraq loaded the deadly
nerve agent VX into missile warheads.
	   The U.N. Security Council had been scheduled to discuss nine
questions about a proposed review of Iraqi sanctions that Baghdad
wants answered before it will consider ending a 2 1/2-month boycott
of U.N. arms inspections.
	   But the council's president, British Ambassador Jeremy
Greenstock, said the main discussion on Iraq had been delayed so
council members could work on a resolution to enshrine the Kosovo
peace deal.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) -- Four people trying to cross into Albania
from Kosovo were killed early Friday when they stepped on landmines
on the Yugoslav side of the border, the Albanian interior ministry
said.
	   The ministry said the incident occurred about 1 a.m. Friday
(2300 gmt Thursday) near the Albanian village of Bastrik. One
survivor managed to cross the border and notify Albanian
authorities, a ministry official said.
	   He said the mines were about 500 meters (yards) inside Yugoslav
territory.
	   The ministry did not have identifications of the victims but the
official said they were believed to have included women and
children.

Interior minister, coma and heart attack victim, leaves hospital

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with French prime minister visiting Chevenment.
Trims. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement,
who fell into a coma after his heart stopped due to an allergic
reaction to anesthesia, left the Val de Grace military hospital on
Friday, more than seven weeks after entering.
	   Chevenement's heart stopped for nearly an hour after he was
administered curare, a muscle relaxant known to cause allergic
reactions in some patients, just ahead of planned gall bladder
surgery on Sept. 2. He spent eight days in a coma.
	   The French press had painted a grim picture of the chances of
full recovery for the 59-year-old Chevenement. On Friday, the
left-leaning newspaper Liberation called his recovery ``a
miracle.''
	   It had been reported Chevenement would leave the hospital this
week. Before his discharge, Chevenement received a visit from Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin.
	   A one-line statement from the hospital confirmed Chevenement
left Friday to begin a two-month period of convalescence.
	   Doctors had said the minister would suffer ``neither physical
nor neurological aftereffects.''
	   Chevenement, a key figure in Socialist Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin's Cabinet, is expected to return to his post by the start of
next year.
	   In his first interview since the accident, published earlier
this week in Paris Match, Chevenement said he had ``reached the
other bank,'' a reference to his flirt with death.
	   Chevenement also quashed questions about how the prestigious
team of military doctors at Val de Grace could have administered
curare without knowing in advance that he would prove allergic.
	   ``What happened to me ... was as unpredictable as an auto
accident,'' Chevenement told Paris Match.
	   Chevenement spent weeks on a respirator and dialysis. Terse
medical statements gave the impression his recovery was in doubt.
	   Instead, the minister entered a period of steady recovery. He
told Paris match that he had re-read ``War and Peace'' and ``Don
Quixote.''
	   Chevenement has held several ministry portfolios, including
industry, education and defense. He resigned as defense minister in
1991 to protest France's involvement in the Gulf War.
	   As interior minister, he is responsible for the nation's police
and security forces.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ NATO decided Friday to send another
high-level delegation to warn Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
time is running out to comply with the Kosovo peace deal.
	   The Serb-led Yugoslav government, however, repeated claims that
it has fulfilled its terms of the Oct. 12 agreement with U.S. envoy
Richard Holbrooke and that ethnic Albanian rebels are responsible
for continuing violence.
	   Serbian Premier Mirko Marjanovic said it was time the West
realized that the crisis in Kosovo was caused by ``terrorism of
Albanian separatists.'' The government's Tanjug news agency said
one soldier was killed and another wounded when Kosovo Liberation
Army rebels attacked a convoy Thursday west of here.
	   In Brussels, Belgium, NATO said it was sending its supreme
commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, and German Gen. Klaus Naumann to
Belgrade on Saturday to press Milosevic to withdraw more police
units and equipment from Kosovo.
	   NATO's latest deadline for Milosevic to comply with the
agreement is Tuesday. A NATO official, briefing reporters on
condition of anonymity, said ``we have seen great progress but we
are far from adequate compliance.''
	   Sporadic gunfire was heard in the hills of central Kosovo on
Friday, more evidence that the conflict has not ended.
	   Near the Albanian border, sobbing villagers in Grcina buried a
man, his two young sons and his niece the day after they were
killed by Yugoslav border forces trying to cross back into Kosovo
to return to their homes.
	   The Yugoslav army described the killings as the result of a
shootout with armed guerrillas. But survivors gave a much different
account.
	   ``They didn't even say stop, or do this or that,'' said Fadil
Sylmetaj, whose brother was killed. ``They just started shooting.
It was so awful.''
	   Also Friday, four people trying to cross into Albania from
Kosovo were killed when they stepped on landmines on the Yugoslav
side of the border, the Albanian interior ministry said.
	   Under the agreement, Milosevic pledged to withdraw special
police and army units sent to the province after he launched his
crackdown on the KLA Feb. 28. Hundreds of people were killed and an
estimated 300,000 driven from their homes.
	   Milosevic also agreed to allow refugees to return home safely
and enable international relief agencies to bring them aid. He also
pledged to negotiate with ethnic Albanian leaders on the future of
Kosovo, a province of the main Yugoslav republic Serbia.
	   Ethnic Albanians make up about 90 percent of the province's 2
million inhabitants, and most favor independence or self-rule.
	   In Geneva, Switzerland, the spokesman of the U.N. refugee
agency, Kris Janowski, said that 11 days after the agreement only a
``trickle'' of refugees had returned, out of fear and intimidation
by Serb police.
	   ``The impression our staff got on the ground is while some
people trickle back to their ruined homes, widespread destruction
of housing and fear of the continued Serb military and police
presence prevent significant return,'' Janowski said.
	   Kosovo's main ethnic Albanian leader, Ibrahim Rugova, was even
more critical. Rugova told reporters ``the Serbian forces have not
yet withdrawn from Kosovo,'' despite Yugoslav claims to the
contrary.
	   ``We cannot say any progress was made and NATO should maintain
its `activation order' and keep pressing the Belgrade government,''
Rugova said.
	   Complicating diplomatic efforts, however, is the role of the
KLA, whose radical members have not abandoned the goal of
independence. The United States and the Europeans reject
independence but support some form of autonomy for Kosovo.
	   Kosovo's Serbian governor, Veljko Odalovic, said ethnic Albanian
militants had killed five policemen, wounded 12 others and
kidnapped two Serbian journalists since the Holbrooke agreement.
	   The KLA issued a statement Friday reiterating that it is keeping
to a cease-fire but saying it would respond and defend villages if
Serb and Yugoslav forces move on them.
	   U.S. envoy Christopher Hill traveled to neighboring Albania on
Friday to brief government officials and urge them to support the
U.S.-led peace effort. Albania had permitted rebels to set up
sanctuaries in the north.
	   ``We are looking for full compliance,'' Hill told reporters.
``We'd like to see full compliance. I don't want to predict when
exactly we'll see it but we are working very hard to ensure it.''
	   Albania's new prime minister, Pandeli Majko, said his government
also wants a ``peaceful solution.''

	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ Chile's government stepped up efforts
Friday to secure through diplomatic, legal, or humanitarian
channels the release of former dictator Augusto Pinochet, who was
arrested last week in a London clinic on charges of ordering human
rights abuses against Europeans and Chileans.
	   Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza said that the government
expects that once the 82-year-old Pinochet is back home, the ailing
former dictator will ``disappear from our political life.''
	   ``When Gen. Pinochet comes back to Chile, he should go his
house. That is the government's position,'' he said. ``This country
can no longer be subject to the tensions and divisions that his
figure causes.''
	   Insulza, among those dissidents exiled during Pinochet 17-year
rule, said it was not inconsistent to using humanitarian
considerations to rescue a man with such a poor human rights
record.
	   ``You just have to look at him to understand his reality,'' he
said about Pinochet's condition. ``Is there any point in promoting
a trial that may last for years to a man that age?''
	   President Eduardo Frei indicated the humanitarian angle is now
high in the government*s strategy, as Pinochet, is reported to be
in serious condition at the London clinic were he underwent back
surgery earlier this month.
	   Pinochet ruled from 1973 until 1990 but remained army commander
until last March. Then, he moved to congress as a senator for
liufe, as permitted by the constitution his regime drafted.
	   Insulza said his deputy, Mariano Fernandez, flew to London last
night to attempt new efforts that he did not detail.
	   ``I would rather not talk about his mission, but we are
attempting all possibilities, not dismissing any one,'' Insulza
said Friday.
	   From London, Fernandez was to fly to Madrid and Washington.
Insulza refused to comment on reports that Chile was asking the
U.S. government to influence Britain.
	   The government here appeared increasingly encouraged by
indications that humanitarian arguments may prevail where
political, diplomatic and legal efforts have failed.
	   ``We can understand the situation faced by Mr. Pinochet and his
family, and therefore we will request the necessary considerations,
given his serious health condition,'' Frei said in a nationally
televised speech.
	   Government officials here believe the British home secretary is
legally empowered to turn down the extradition request by Spanish
magistrate Baltasar Garzon.
	   London newspapers reported that the British government could let
Pinochet free ``on compassionate grounds.''
	   Frei said the Chilean government, which maintains that Britain
should recognize Pinochet's diplomatic immunity as a
senator-for-life, is defending Pinochet ``in spite of deep
differences.''
	   Frei noted that concern over Pinochet's health was voiced at a
cabinet session Thursday, including by ministers ``who suffered
torture and exile'' during Pinochet's 1973-90 dictatorship.
	   ``We are not defending a person, we are defending principles,''
he said.

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ North and South Korea, the United States and China
creeped forward Friday with talks on a permanent peace treaty for
the divided and tense Korean peninsula.
	   Negotiators gave mixed signals about progress in thrashing out
procedural details that blocked earlier sessions and highlighted
the long path ahead.
	   ``We are not there yet. We have more work to do,'' said U.S.
delegation leader Charles Kartman.
	   ```We haven't been that successful today,'' said North Korean
Deputy Foreign Minister Kim Gye Gwan.
	   However, Chinese ambassador Quian Yong-nian said he expected
``some results'' by Saturday, the fourth and probably final day of
this round of talks. China is the main ally of Communist North
Korea.
	   The anticipated outcome is agreement to set up subcommittees to
discuss how to replace the current armistice and build confidence
between the longtime foes.
	   North Korea previously demanded that the conference agree on an
agenda _ including its demands for withdrawal of the 37,000 U.S.
troops from South Korea _ before setting up working groups.
	   South Korea and its U.S. ally insist that while troop
withdrawals can be discussed, they should not be a formal agenda
item.
	   Agreement on procedures is vital because only after that can the
Geneva talks address the substance of a full peace treaty to
replace the armistice that ended the 1950-53 Korean war.
	   The border between the Koreas is the world's most heavily armed,
with nearly 2 million troops deployed on both sides.
	   Annual military maneuvers held jointly by South Korean forces
and their U.S. allies are scheduled to begin Monday.
	   Tensions flared this year after Pyongyang's Aug. 31 launch of a
small satellite, which was originally thought to be a ballistic
missile.
	   The launch showed the North's reclusive communist government had
developed a more advanced missile technology system than the United
States and its allies had previously believed.
	   In New York earlier this month, North Korea rebuffed a U.S.
demand that it stop testing and exporting long-range missiles.
	   However, Pyongyang is under pressure to make some compromises as
it desperately needs foreign food aid to feed its 23 million
people.
	   Decades of economic mismanagement have led to chronic shortages,
aggravated by three years of flooding and drought. Some U.S.
experts have estimated that 2 million North Koreans may have died
in the famine.
	   Park Kun-woo, leader of the South Korean delegation and chairman
of the current meeting, said heads of the four delegations would
meet Saturday morning to continue their work.

	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Graca Machel of Mozambique and Canadian
Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy were awarded Friday the Council of
Europe's annual North-South Prize for human rights and cultural
achievements.
	   The prize, a sculpture in marble and wood, was presented at the
National Assembly, Portugal's parliament.
	   Axworthy was given the award for his leading role in recruiting
support for the international treaty banning land mines that was
signed in Ottawa last year.
	   ``This is really a prize for the broad issue of the land mines
campaign,'' Axworthy said.
	   ``The importance of the prize is that it reinforces the need to
have the treaty brought into effect and actually get down to the
work of demining,'' he added.
	   Machel, who married South African President Nelson Mandela in
July, was not present for the ceremony. She was represented by the
Mozambican ambassador to Lisbon.
	   Machel, whose country endured a 15-year civil war that ended in
1992, has campaigned extensively for children living in war
situations. She heads the southeast African country's National
Organization for Children.
	   She also campaigned for the land mine ban.

Premier: Belarusian production up, but so is inflation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ The Belarusian prime minister boasted
Friday of an increase in economic production so far this year, but
conceded that it came along with runaway inflation and a steady
decline in the value of the national currency.
	   ``Almost all year we have been living in conditions of sharp
aggravation in the markets, in conditions of a grave financial
crisis in Russia,'' Sergei Ling said in a speech to the National
Assembly.
	   Russia is Belarus' neighbor and chief trading partner, and the
two countries have formalized especially close relations in a union
treaty that calls for free trade between them.
	   Like other former Soviet republics ringing Russia, Belarus has
been hard hit by the Russian economic crisis. To a far greater
extent than Russia, Belarus has retained most tenets of the Soviet
economy.
	   Ling tried to put the best face on the situation, saying
Belarus' gross domestic product was up 10 percent so far this year,
and industrial production was sharply up as well.
	   He conceded that agriculture showed a slight decline of 0.1
percent, and sharply criticized agricultural bosses for poor work
and outdated methods.
	   Ling also conceded that the Belarusian ruble was steadily
falling, that consumer prices had soared 53 percent so far this
year, and that industrial production had dropped in September.

Greek Culture Ministry: Clerics demand return of Archimedes Text
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ELENA BECATOROS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greek Orthodox clerics are demanding the
return of the only known copy of a text by the ancient Greek
scientist Archimedes due to be auctioned next week, Greece's
culture ministry said Friday.
	   But if the manuscript's current holders _ a French family _ do
not return the 1,000-year-old copy, the Orthodox Patriarchate of
Jerusalem would consider taking legal measures, Culture Minister
Evangelos Venizelos said.
	   ``According to the Jerusalem Patriarchate, the manuscript has
been stolen,'' Venizelos said.
	   An auction for the 174-page text has been set for Oct. 29 at
Christie's in New York. It includes transcriptions of writings on
geometry and physics by the 3rd century BC theoretician and
inventor. Christie's anticipated it could fetch between dlrs
800,000 to dlrs 1.2 million.
	   A Christie's spokeswoman said the auction date has not been
affected by the Patriarchate's claim.
	   ``As far as I know, the sale will take place as scheduled
because Christie's continues to be satisfied that the consignor has
a legitimate title and right to sell,'' Vredy Lytsman told The
Associated Press.
	   But the auction house has said it would call off the sale if
there was proof that the manuscript was not legitimately owned by
the French holders.
	   Venizelos originally appealed to several Greek groups and
businesses to pool funds to bid on the text.
	   But then questions were raised the ownership of the manuscript,
which was lost when the Patriarchate's library was transferred to
Athens from Constantinople _ now Istanbul _ after World War I. It
had been housed earlier in Orthodox monasteries in Palestine.
	   If the Jerusalem Patriarchate can prove its ownership, the
manuscript _ known as the Archimedes Palimpsest _ will be housed in
Athens' National Library, Venizelos said.
	   A palimpsest is a manuscript whose pages have been written on
twice. When writing materials were in short supply, the original
text would be washed away when no longer deemed useful.
	   A U.S. lawyer for the Jerusalem Patriarchate, Simos Dimas,
drafted a letter to Christie's to demand the manuscript's return,
Venizelos said. Christie's has not released the name of the family
that placed the text up for auction.
	   According to a statement by Felix de Marez Oyens, the head of
the auction house's Books and Manuscripts Department, Christie's is
satisfied it ``has been legitimately owned by a French family for
the last three-quarters of a century.''
	   If the auction goes ahead, the Greek government will bid for it,
Venizelos stresses.
	   ``If the outcome is negative for legal issues _ because
historically and morally, there is no doubt that the Patriarchate
is right _ of course we will return to our efforts of purchasing
this manuscript,'' he said.

Rebel leader sentenced to death for crimes against humanity

	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ Seven years after triggering
Sierra Leone's civil war, the feared rebel leader Foday Sankoh
smiled and sang Friday while he was condemned to death by hanging
for treason and other crimes.
	   Sankoh, leader of the mysterious rebel Revolutionary United
Front which has launched a retribution campaign of civilian
massacres during the two-month trial, was convicted by a 12-member
jury.
	   They deliberated less than two hours before announcing the
verdict.
	   ``I thank my brothers, members of the jury for taking such a
decision,'' Sankoh replied.
	   Justice Samuel Adejobi Ademosu passed the death sentence on
Sankoh for supporting Sierra Leone's ousted military junta, which
held power for 10 months following a bloody army coup in May last
year.
	   ``Had it not been for you, the atrocities committed and trauma
experienced by the people of this country would not have happened.
For that you deserve nothing less than death,'' the judge told
Sankoh.
	   The rebel leader, who earlier in the morning appeared visibly
worried, grinned wryly and replied simply: ``Thank you Lord.'' He
sang as he was led out of the courtroom in handcuffs.
	   As a civilian, Sankoh has the right to appeal under Sierra
Leonean law. He did not have a lawyer during the trial because none
had been willing to represent him, despite urgings from human
rights groups and the U.N.
	   ``The law is a schoolmaster for a layman like myself, and I have
learned a lot from the trial with the absence of legal
representatives,'' the rebel leader said.
	   Although Sankoh was imprisoned in Nigeria at the time of the May
25, 1997 coup, his rebel soldiers joined the junta troops in the
capital while continuing to proclaim Sankoh as their inspirational
leader.
	   Remnants of the rebel-junta alliance, which was toppled by a
Nigerian-led West African intervention force earlier this year,
have chopped off arms and legs, raped and killed thousands of
unarmed villagers in a campaign of vengeance since their ouster.
	   Witnesses, U.N. observers and aid workers say the bloodletting
has escalated since Sankoh's trial began in August. The rebels, who
themselves in radio interviews have proclaimed an ``Operation Spare
No Living Soul'' have refused offers of amnesty and remain holed up
in remote outposts in the forested interior, from where they launch
lightning raids on villages.
	   The rebels' motives are murky, but their methods clear. Large
numbers of amputees who have had arms and legs hacked off by the
attackers bear witness to the renegades' apparent goal: spreading
influence by fear.
	   Some of those mutilated in recent weeks say their attackers told
them they were seeking retribution for Sankoh's trial.

Euro: introduced not with a bang, but with two months changeover
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ For the first two months in 2002,
Germany's mark and the euro, Europe's future currency, will be
circulated side by side.
	   After that it's euro only, a broad group of 15 bank, business
and vending machine industry representatives agreed Friday,
undermining the retail trade's desire for an overnight ``big bang''
introduction while setting a much tighter deadline than the six
months allowed.
	   The compromise was in part to appease the vending machine
industry _ which has 2 million machines to recalibrate. The retail
trade, though it favored a quick switch, said it was happy with
relative speed of the transition.
	   The agreement also includes language encouraging stores and
banks to adopt a flexible attitude when customers show up with
marks after the two-month transition has expired.
	   Euro bills and coins don't hit the streets until Jan. 1, 2002,
three years after it becomes the official currency in the 11
European nations merging monetery policy. Countries are given the
leeway to set their own timetable for the physical switch, provided
it's done by the end of June 2002, in keeping with the European
Central Bank's philosophy that each member must be allowed to serve
its own interests.
	   Still, the European Commission, the executive arm of the
European Union, wants the changeover to be as short as possible,
and welcome Germany's decision. ``A period shorter than six months
should be perfect,'' spokesman Patrick Child said.
	   Other countries joining currency union, such as Austria, said
the decision may increase pressure on them to follow suit and phase
out the national currencies more quickly than currently planned.
	   For vending machine companies, two months is still too little.
Refitting the machines will be complex and expensive, costing about
one billion marks (dlrs 625 million,) they say.
	   ``This is going to cost a lot of money and we're not going to
get any of it back. I'm not sure I'm that happy,'' said Gerhard
Trost-Heutmerkers, managing director of the Federal Association of
Vending Machine Companies, whose group was present at negotiations.
	   In some ways, the agreement is typical for a country where
industry leaders and government traditionally operate on broad
consensus.
	   Germany's Finance Ministry and the Bundesbank were believed to
favor a rapid introduction, possible over one weekend.
	   The Bundesbank also was confident it could have handled such a
``big bang''-style switch.
	   It has done something similar before, when the former communist
East Germany adopted the West's mark three months before the formal
political unification.
	   But a European monetary analyst at Dresdner Bank, Jens Ulbrich,
questioned whether that would have been possible in a nation of 80
million people.
	   ``They would have had to close off the entire circulation of the
mark in one go. And then in one go, create a new circulation for
the euro,'' he said. ``I doubt if they even have enough money
transport vans to do it. What would they do, ask the army to
help?''

Slovakia's national team coach dismissed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ The coach of Slovakia's national
soccer team, Jozef Jankech, was fired Friday following a 3-0 home
defeat to Portugal earlier this month.
	   Jankech already was under fire for the team's failure to get
through any of the qualification rounds for the European
Championship or World Cup.
	   Jankech's predecessor, Jozef Venglos, was dismissed after
Slovakia was beaten 4-0 by France and 5-0 by Poland.
	   ``We have to think about the standard of the Slovak first
league, which provides players for the national team. The level of
the matches in the league is very weak,'' said Milan Sluzanic,
president of the Slovak Soccer Association.
	   The Slovak league was expanded to 16 teams three years ago, a
move that diluted the quality at the top level.

Toddler escapes death after being tossed into ceiling fan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ A Bahraini baby narrowly escaped death
when his sister inadvertently tossed him into a whirling ceiling
fan, a newspaper reported Friday.
	   Doctors operated on 12-month-old Jamil Ali Abdullah for five
hours after he was admitted to the Salmaniyah Medical Complex in
Manama with a profusely bleeding forehead, the Bahrain Tribune
reported.
	   But the hospital said Abdullah sustained no permanent injury and
he was discharged Thursday, the paper reported.
	   The accident happened when Abdullah's sister Ghada, 15, lovingly
tossed him into the air while playing with him, the paper said. The
fan blades hit the toddler and threw him into the corner of the
living room.
	   The newspaper, which ran a front-page picture of Abdullah's
bandaged head, did not say when the incident occurred.

Seven killed in fighting between militants and security forces
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SRINAGAR, India (AP) _ Separatist militants opened fire in a
heavily guarded area in Kashmir's summer capital Friday, killing
one policeman and seriously injuring two others, police said.
	   Minutes later, militants lobbed a grenade at an army bunker, but
missed. No one was injured. Shops in the neighborhood shut down
immediately and police beefed up security in the area.
	   The attacks came just a day after India's interior minister said
security forces had gained the upper hand in the fight against
militancy in the intractable Kashmir province.
	   Just outside Srinagar, a group of soldiers on patrol drove into
a landmine and one soldier was killed in the explosion, police
said. Three others were seriously injured. The explosion destroyed
the vehicle the men were traveling in and damaged two houses
nearby.
	   In other parts of the state, unidentified gunmen killed two
people.
	   In Kupwara, 90 kilometers (55 miles) north of Srinagar,
militants and security forces fought a fierce gunbattle in which
three militants were killed. Two of them were from neighboring
Pakistan, police said.
	   India accuses Pakistan of backing a nine-year old Islamic led
insurgency in Kashmir, a charge Pakistan denies. Kashmir is divided
between the two countries but both claim a unified Kashmir.

Bulgaria clears minefields at Greek border
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Bulgaria began clearing several
minefields along its border with neighboring Greece Friday,
removing the last remains of a Cold War-era military confrontation.
	   A group of 14 sappers will remove some 1,640 anti-personnel
jumping mines from seven fields near the village of Egrek, about
350 kilometer (220 miles) southeast of Sofia within the next three
weeks, state-run BTA news agency reported.
	   Demining of the southern border started last May. Once cleared,
70-kilometers (44-mile) stretch of land along the border will be
given to local people for farming, planting tobacco and potatoes.
	   Bulgaria, a former Warsaw Pact member, had officially installed
the mines ``to protect the country from an aggression from
neighboring NATO countries Greece and Turkey,'' according to the
then-ruling Communist party. But it was widely believed that the
reason was to prevent people from fleeing the country.
	   Anti-mine action was launched following the Geneva convention on
anti-personnel mines, which Bulgaria signed last year.

Inmates hold guards hostage in Turkish prisons

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with hostage-taking in second prison; INCREASES number
of prisoners killed by setting themselves on fire, ADDS details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Political prisoners, apparently seeking
better jail conditions, took guards hostage Friday at two prisons
in Turkey, news reports said.
	   As many as 30 prison officials were being held captive in a
political prisoners' ward at Umraniye prison, in Istanbul, the
Anatolia news agency reported.
	   An unknown number of guards were being held at Bergama prison,
some 570 kilometers (342 miles) west of Ankara.
	   Although paramilitary police had been stationed in front of the
ward, prison officials were ruling out a possible raid to release
the guards, the semi-official news agency said.
	   Exact demands by the prisoners were not immediately clear.
	   In a separate incident Friday, three inmates in the southeast
died of severe burns after setting themselves afire, raising to
five the number of prisoners to die in a protest against the
government's crackdown on Kurdish rebels this week.
	   A fourth prisoner, at Diyarbakir jail, was rushed to hospital
early Friday in critical condition, the report said.
	   The prisoners, either awaiting trial or convicted on charges of
Kurdish separatism, set themselves afire to protest government
attempts to clamp down on Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan and
his group, which is fighting for autonomy in southeastern Turkey.
	   Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz announced this week that Ocalan had
moved to Russia from Syria where he was believed to be in hiding.
Turkish and Syrian officials struck an agreement Tuesday under
which according to Turkish officials Damascus pledged to brand the
group illegal and stop its activities on Syrian territory.
	   Turkey's prisons, which house some 9,000 prisoners linked to
leftist or Kurdish groups, are frequently rocked by riots and
hunger strikes.
	   In April, leftist prisoners in seven jails around the country
took more than 50 guards hostage for two days to push for the
reversal of a policy to transfer of comrades to separate prisons.

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Parliament has decided to
award this year's Sakharov Prize to Ibrahim Rugova, leader of the
ethnic Albanians in the Serbian separatist province of Kosovo.
	   Parliament President Jose Maria Gil-Robles and leaders of the
political groups in the 626-member assembly voted Thursday in favor
of Rugova, who advocates a peaceful struggle for the independence
of Kosovo.
	   Rugova will be invited to come and receive the award during a
ceremony at the Parliament in Strasbourg, France in mid-December.
	   ``This reward comes in times of hardship for Kosovo and is an
acknowledgement to the people of Kosovo for their sacrifice and
peaceful resistance,'' Rugova said Friday in Kosovo.
	   ``I am happy to be in the circle of such esteemed recipients of
the prize as Nelson Mendela,'' he added.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Echoing Western claims, Kosovo's
main ethnic Albanian leader said Friday that Yugoslavia has not
removed its troops from the embattled province and that little
progress has been made to defuse the crisis.
	   More than 10 days after a U.S.-brokered peace agreement, Ibrahim
Rugova told reporters that ``the Serbian forces have not yet
withdrawn from Kosovo,'' despite Yugoslav statements to the
contrary.
	   With NATO's latest deadline for Yugoslav compliance only four
days away, the alliance decided Friday to send its supreme
commander Gen. Wesley Clark and German Gen. Klaus Naumann to
Belgrade this weekend to insist that Yugoslavia speed its troop
withdrawal from Kosovo.
	   ``We have seen great progress, but we are still far from
adequate compliance,'' a NATO official told reporters in Brussels,
Belgium, on condition of anonymity.
	   Tension remains high here despite the agreement averting NATO
airstrikes that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and U.S.
envoy Richard Holbrooke reached on Oct. 12.
	   Sporadic gunfire was heard in the hills of central Kosovo on
Friday, more evidence that the conflict has not ended.
	   Near the Albanian border, sobbing villagers in Grcina buried a
man, his two young sons and his niece the day after they were
killed by Yugoslav border forces trying to cross back into Kosovo
to return to their homes.
	   The Yugoslav army described the killings as the result of a
shootout with armed guerrillas. But survivors gave a much different
account.
	   ``They didn't even say stop, or do this or that,'' said Fadil
Sylmetaj, whose brother was killed. ``They just started shooting.
It was so awful.''
	   Also Friday, four people trying to cross into Albania from
Kosovo were killed when they stepped on land-mines on the Yugoslav
side of the border, the Albanian interior ministry said.
	   State-run Tanjug news agency reported Friday that one Yugoslav
army soldier was killed Thursday and another seriously wounded when
ethnic Albanians attacked an army supply convoy traveling from the
provincial capital, Pristina, to the southwestern town of Pec.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and hundreds of thousands
driven from their homes by violence since Milosevic began cracking
down on ethnic Albanian separatists in February. The majority of
Kosovo's 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Albanians, and most favor
independence.
	   To reinforce the U.S.-brokered accord, American diplomat William
Walker arrived in the Yugoslav capital, Belgrade, Thursday to
oversee the establishment of a 2,000-member mission to make sure
Milosevic honors the agreement.
	   Walker will head the mission under the direction of the
Vienna-based Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
Walker met Milosevic early Friday and was later meeting Rugova in
Pristina.
	   After his talks with Walker, the Yugoslav president said in a
statement that he ``expects successful cooperation'' between the
OSCE mission and the Yugoslav coordinating commission, to be headed
by one of his top aides, Nikola Sainovic.
	   Milosevic also expressed hopes the OSCE mission would help
``secure peaceful solution of the existing problems,'' said the
statement, carried by Tanjug.
	   The rebel Kosovo Liberation Army has insisted it will not
abandon its goal of independence. The United States and the
Europeans reject independence but support some form of autonomy for
Kosovo.
	   The KLA issued a statement Friday reiterating that it is keeping
to a cease-fire but saying it would respond and defend villages if
Serb and Yugoslav forces move on them.

Friday smashed windows at the mayor's office and burnt the national
flag to protest delays in receiving their wages.
	   About 2,000 workers surrounded the headquarters of Mayor Solomon
Tawengwa in downtown Harare, where they broke glass and deflated
tires on city-owned vehicles. They also set fire to garbage they
dumped on city grounds.
	   Scores of riot police appeared but did not intervene.
	   The riot emphasized increasing deterioration of services over
past months in the capital of Harare. Since independence of the
former Rhodesia in 1980, the city had run relatively efficiently.
	   Critics in recent weeks have targeted the mayor and his staff
for shutting down water supplies to Harare suburbs after failing to
pay for pump maintenance services.
	   The national government was forced to intervene Thursday to pay
maintenance contractors who stopped work on the pumping system in
the city of 2 million people.
	   Tawengwa, accused of ignoring basic utilities while building
himself a 30 million Zimbabwe dollars (dlrs 850,000) mayoral
mansion, has ignored calls for his resignation.
	   The riots came two days after the national government committed
an estimated 2,000 additional troops to back the Congolese
government in a civil war. They will join another 3,000 Zimbabwean
troops already there.
	   The move is expected to further strain national coffers and
social services.
	   The demonstrators gathered during the day demanding to see
Tawengwa. The violence level increased in late afternoon, when they
were told he was not in his offices.
	   Tawengwa told councilmen at a meeting Thursday the municipal
authorities had run out of money to pay the city's full wage bill.
	   The crowd dispersed at nightfall.

Woman wounded, more death reports in troubled Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian sources Friday said
a woman was wounded in the latest shelling and told of more deaths
in Serbia's strife-torn Kosovo province.
	   According to the Kosovo Information Center, the mouthpiece of
the province's ethnic Albanian leadership, Serb forces shelled
Friday a village near Malisevo, 40 kilometers (25 miles) southwest
of Pristina.
	   One ethnic Albanian woman, 32-year-old Faze Krasniqi, was
wounded in the shelling of Ladrovac village, the center reported
but gave no details of her condition.
	   The center also said four civilians _ three children and a woman
in her 60s _ had died of exhaustion in the previous few days in a
village near the border town Djakovica.
	   The reports could not be independently confirmed.

Argentine President: No apology to Britain over 1982 South Atlantic
</HEADLINE>
war &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: ADDS two last grafs of British government comment on the
apology flap, CORRECTS headline to read: `ARGENTINA SAYS: WE'RE
SORRY FOR THE FALKLANDS.' &QL; 
 &UR; By BILL CORMIER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ President Carlos Menem said
Friday he offered Britain no apologies for the Falklands war, but
looked forward to a historic trip to heal wounds over their 1982
conflict.
	   Ahead of the first visit by an Argentine president to Britain
since the war, Menem called his trip ``a re-encounter and an
exploration'' during which he would express a ``will to normalize
relations definitively.''
	   But he insisted he never told Britain he was sorry for the
conflict in the South Atlantic, even though he lamented the
hundreds of deaths in the war for the Falklands, which Argentina
calls the Malvinas.
	   ``At no moment did I offer apologies,'' Menem told reporters
Friday, hours after Britain's largest-selling tabloid, The Sun, ran
a front-page headline stating, ``Argentine: We are Sorry for the
Falklands.''
	   The Sun quoted a letter from Menem as saying ``Some brave young
Argentine and British soldiers lost their lives in a conflict that
should never have happened and that we deeply regret.''
	   Asked about his choice of words, Menem told reporters: ``We are
simply making a reference to a lamentable situation ... many deaths
and blood that was shed.''
	   The war for the islands _ which are populated by some 2,200
people of mostly British ancestry _ claimed at least 970 lives,
including 255 British forces.
	   But Menem wrote in the Argentine newspaper Clarin on Friday that
his country has not renounced claim to the islands. Argentine
argues it inherited the islands from the Spanish crown before their
1833 occupation by the British.
	   Under the headline, ``Why we are going to London,'' Menem
declared in Clarin: ``The Malvinas are Argentine without a doubt''
and he would continue to press for ``our unalienable rights'' to
the islands.
	   Nonetheless, Argentine officials have acknowledged that the
dispute was not likely to be central to the five-day trip.
	   ``Unfortunately the British have shown themselves to be
intransigent when it comes to discussions with Argentine on the
issue of sovereignty,'' Argentine Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella
said.
	   Menem's state visit will be rich in symbolism, highlighted by a
wreath-laying at Britain's Falkland war memorial and a
reconciliation service at Saint Paul's Cathedral.
	   But beyond the symbols, Menem has said he wants both countries
to profit from ``strong and vigorous'' relations in trade, which
reached a record dlrs 1.2 billion in 1997.
	   Despite moves by both sides to focus on other issues, the
mission has revived Argentines' memories of the war. Newspapers
here have heavily covered preparations.
	   Opposition lawmakers have criticized the trip for apparently
leaving little room for real talk on the islands' sovereignty.
Hundreds of Argentine war veterans used the upcoming visit to
demand greater recognition and compensation, noisily protesting
outside congress.
	   In London, Prime Minister Tony Blair's spokesman said Thursday
that Menem's visit will not be overshadowed by either the Falklands
or the arrest of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the former Chilean dictator
who is under armed guard at a London clinic.
	   British police arrested the 82-year-old general on Oct. 16 on a
warrant from Spanish magistrate seeking to extradite him on charges
relating to the murder, genocide and torture of victims killed
during his 17-year rule.
	   Asked whether Britain regarded the Sun article as an apology
from Menem, a spokesman for Blair said: ``The words speak for
themselves. I'm not going to interpret them.
	   ``We welcome the sentiments expressed,'' the spokesman told
Britain's Press Association, speaking on customary anonymity.

Williams, Seles advance in quick matches
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with additional details, final doubles results.
 &UR; By NICK WADHAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The top two seeds at the Kremlin Cup overwhelmed
their opponents in quarterfinal action Friday, taking less than two
hours between them to advance.
	   Top-seeded Venus Williams dispatched Katarina Studenikova from
Slovakia, dropping only one game on the way to a 6-1, 6-0 victory.
	   But the most impressive showing at the dlrs 1 million tournament
was second-seed Monica Seles, who wrapped up her match in less than
50 minutes against Sylvia Farina, winning 6-0, 6-1.
	   Studenikova put up a fight against the American Williams, going
to deuce three times in the second set. But Williams kept her focus
and won each time.
	   ``In the past I had some problems focusing but now that's not so
bad,'' Williams said after the match. ``My mind is good.''
	   Williams, who lost to Studenikova on a hot day two years ago,
said she had prepared hard for the match and expected a tougher
fight.
	   ``I thought I would have to hit more balls today,'' Williams
said. ``When I went out today I was ready.''
	   She wasn't the only one. Seles didn't even allow the Italian
Farina a single point in the first three games. She beamed sharp
groundstrokes down the line that Farina could only gape at.
	   ``I just think I came out playing so well today,'' Seles said.
``It was one of those days when everything you touch goes in and it
was hard for her (Farina) to find her rhythm.''
	   Seles will face seventh-seed Sandrine Testud in the semifinal
Saturday. Testud upset Conchita Martinez, seeded third, 7-6 (7-4),
7-5 in a match that ran almost two hours.
	   Martinez, suffering from a hurt ankle in the second set, missed
a number of chances to finish off Testud, and dropped the last game
after going up 40-love.
	   Mary Pierce, holding the fifth seed, looked tired at the start
against Spaniard Magui Serna, but overcame a 2-5 defecit in the
first set to win 7-5. She looked more confident in the second,
breaking Magui's serve in the third and seventh set to win 6-3.
	   Pierce will go on to face Williams, who beat her last week at
the quarterfinals of the European Championships, with a record
breaking 205 kmph (127.4 mph) serve to end the match.
	   In quarterfinal doubles action, doubles-specialist Natasha
Zvereva and Mary Pierce upset second-seeded pair Conchita Martinez
and Patricia Tarabini in straight sets, 6-2, 6-2.
	   They will face Anna Kournikova and Monica Seles, who advanced
Thursday after Serena and Venus Williams withdrew because Serena
was sick.
	   Lisa Raymond and Rennae Stubbs, doubles seeds No. 1, defeated
Manon Bollegraf and Elena Tatarkova, 6-3, 6-2. They will meet Cara
Black and Irina Selyutina, who beat Julie Halard-Decugis and Chanda
Rubin in straight sets 6-4, 6-0.

Indian space organization gears up for meteoroids
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ The Indian Space Research Organization
is gearing up to minimize damage to its satellites that may be
caused by debris from Leonid meteoroids that are likely to enter
the earth's atmosphere between November 14 and 20, a statement from
the organization said Friday.
	   It is predicted the meteoroid storm will peak at 8:40 gmt on
November 18 and will last for a couple of hours on either side of
its peak. During the peak of the storm, the debris from the
meteoroids may fall at the rate of 150,000 particles per hour, the
statement said.
	   The chances that Indian satellites would be hit by the debris
were minuscule, ISRO said. But it would take all precautions to
prevent it.
	   India's Insat satellites are placed about 36,000 kilometers
(21,600 miles) over the equator while the Indian Remote Sensing
satellites are placed in polar orbits of 820 kilometers (490 miles)
to 900 kilometers (540 miles).
	   The main risk to the satellites were mechanical and electrical
damage because of the debris.
	   ISRO said it would position the satellites in such a way that
they presented the minimum surface area to the approaching debris.
Some functions of the satellites would be shut off and only
essential equipment would be used, the statement said.

	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ The TV set in the garden cafe was
turned on to the nightly news Friday, but most customers were more
interested in their gin rummy hand than in learning about the new
Mideast peace agreement.
	   The few who did watch the news said they doubted Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu would actually carry out his promise and
withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   ``The news reports are so contradictory it makes us even more
skeptical the agreement will be implemented,'' said Salem Abed
Rabbo, a 36-year-old importer, as he puffed on a waterpipe.
	   Just a half hour's drive away from Gaza City, in the squalid
town of Rafah, some 2,000 supporters of the Islamic Jihad group
chanted: ``We will never accept the Washington solutions.''
	   Some 20 Islamic Jihad supporters, swathed in the white shrouds
of suicide bombers, burned Israeli and American flags.
	   As part of the agreement, the CIA will play a stronger role in
the Palestinian Authority's campaign against Islamic militants.
	   Sheik Ahmed Yassin, founder of the Islamic militant group Hamas,
said a new crackdown could perhaps restrict the activities of the
Hamas military wing temporarily, but would not prevent attacks
against Israelis. ``It cannot erase Hamas,'' said Yassin.
	   Jewish settlers leaders warned that they will shut down the West
Bank on Sunday with street protests and will move their campaign to
topple Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu into high gear.
	   The spokesman of the settlement movement, Aharon Domb, said
Netanyahu had surrendered to the Palestinians and the United
States. ``The reality is that the principle, that for land they are
giving us peace and security .... is not happening,'' he said.
	   However, the news of the peace agreement came just a few hours
before the start of the Jewish Sabbath and settler leaders did not
have much time to organize their protest campaign.
	   Israel's dovish opposition pledged to back Netanyahu on the
peace accord and make sure he is not brought down by parliament
during the 12 weeks Israel has been allotted to withdraw troops
from 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   At least a dozen hardline coalition members have said they would
vote against a peace agreement in parliament, enough to rob the
prime minister of his parliamentary majority.
	   ``We will give him a safety net for the coming weeks,'' said
Yossi Beilin of the opposition Labor Party, one of the architects
of the 1993 breakthrough agreement between Israel and the
Palestinians.
	   Former Prime Minister Shimon Peres praised the agreement and
said it was proof that the path charted by him and his Labor
colleagues was the right one.

<TEXT>
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Sammy Sosa was to
receive his nation's highest honor Friday before tossing out the
first pitch to open the Dominican Winter League as a
still-suffering country set aside its cares for a moment by turning
to its favorite sport.
	   Sosa, who hit 66 home runs this year to break the long-standing
single-season home run record in U.S. Major League Baseball set by
Roger Maris, still finished behind Mark McGwire of the St. Louis
Cardinals, who hit 70 for the 1998 title.
	   Yet the Chicago Cubs outfielder remains an idol in the Dominican
Republic, a county where thousands still struggle without homes,
electricity and water. Hurricane Georges devastated the country on
Sept. 22, killing some 300 people by the official count.
	   In its wake, Sosa's success has provided a diversion and a
source of pride for Dominicans. His name, likeness and the number
66 _ appear on T-shirts, car windows, caps, buttons, medals and
other items.
	   Sosa was to receive a medal of his own Friday from President
Leonel Fernandez, the Grand Cross of the Order of Dart, Sanchez and
Mella, at the National Palace.
	   Fernandez also was to bestow on Sosa the title ``Roving
Ambassador to the Glory of Sport'' for his Caribbean country.
	   Besides Sosa, other Dominican players and one manager from the
American major leagues were to be honored at the National Palace
including Moises Alou of the Houston Astros, Raul Mondesi of the
Los Angeles Dodgers, Alex Rodriguez of the Seattle Mariners, Pedro
Martinez of the Boston Red Sox, Vladimir Guerrero of the Montreal
Expos and Expos manager Felipe Alou.
	   Some vendors have taken to calling Sosa ``Sammy Claus,'' because
his popularity has produced a sales boom.
	   ``It's incredible,'' said Miguel Ogando, a street-corner T-shirt
salesman. ``Yesterday I sold more than 100 Sammy T-shirts and today
I've sold 40 and it isn't noon yet.''
	   Ogando said Sosa-related sales were outstripping souvenirs of
the pope's 1992 visit to this predominately Catholic country.
	   ``My home was badly damaged in the hurricane, but without him
knowing it, Sammy has allowed me to earn enough money to fix it,''
said Edgar de la Cruz, 34. He said he sold more than 200 medals
featuring Sosa.
	   This year's Winter League season is dedicated to Sosa, but his
hometown of San Pedro de Macoris will not benefit from baseball's
return.
	   The town's stadium was destroyed by the hurricane, so the local
team _ los Estrellas Orientales or the Eastern Stars _ will not
play this year. The same goes for another of the country's six
teams, La Romana's Sugar Growers.
	   Residents say about 50 people would normally work at the San
Pedro stadium and others make a living by selling goods outside
during the season. The town also relies on sugar cane, but nearly
90 percent of that crop was wiped out by Georges.
	   ``We survive on hope,'' 16-year-old Isaias Ozoria Torres said.
``The only person who can help us now is God above.''
	   Sosa sent three planeloads of food and medical supplies to his
hometown, San Pedro provincial Mayor Sergio Cedeno said, pointing
out that he had received no government aid.
	   ``For being a humble person who has reached the hearts of many
people ... he's the best ambassador we could have,'' Cedeno said.

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ After a week of talks, the United
Nations signed an agreement Friday with Afghanistan's hard-line
Taliban religious militia to return to the war-ravaged country.
	   The agreement covered U.N. security concerns that prompted the
withdrawal of all 50 staff from Afghanistan in August after three
of its employees were killed.
	   Before the international staff returns to Afghanistan, the
Taliban must meet several conditions, including producing a report
on the killings, said Ahmad Farah, acting U.N. coordinator in
neighboring Pakistan, where the talks took place.
	   After the 11-point agreement was signed, Farah told reporters
that he could not specify exactly what the Taliban's report would
contain, but said it should show signs of a ``goodwill effort to
reach a satisfactory conclusion.''
	   The Taliban are anxious for the return of the United Nations to
restart its programs including mine clearing, and repairing canals
and irrigation systems.
	   Taliban negotiator Qari Din Mohammed, who is the minister of
planning, said security would be a priority, but cautioned that
Afghanistan is in the midst of war and is still suffering the
affects of two decades of fighting.
	   ``Our police are inexperienced and have no training,'' he said.
	   Ian Bullpitt, the United Nations acting security coordinator
said the agreement ``does not constitute an immediate return to
Afghanistan . . . there are a number of things that need to happen
first and that will take some time.''
	   The United Nations did not release the text of the agreement,
but Bullpitt and Farah said the Taliban agreed to appoint regional
security liaison officers who would meet regularly with the U.N.
staff. Also, the Taliban have agreed not to detain U.N. staff for
more than 72 hours without charging them, and must allow the United
Nations to provide detained staff with legal aid and medical
assistance.
	   Bullpitt said the talks bode well for future negotiations.
	   ``There was a spirit of good will and cooperation not previously
seen before,'' Bullpitt said.
	   Relations between the United Nations and the Taliban army, which
controls roughly 90 percent of Afghanistan, have been strained for
months. The world body has been at loggerheads with the Taliban
over aid distribution and the treatment of women.
	   The international community has isolated the Taliban since they
made women leave their jobs, forced them to wear the all-enveloping
burqa, and closed girls schools. Women often are publicly beaten
for traveling outside their homes unaccompanied by a male relative.
	   U.N. programs in areas controlled by the Taliban's opposition
have been suspended for nearly a year because of lawlessness and
fighting. U.N. warehouses in opposition-run areas have been
ransacked, vehicles stolen and premises invaded. The opposition
leaders say they cannot guarantee the U.N. staff's security.

Greens torn by strife on eve of joining German government

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Greens leader urges support for government role.

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany's Greens are about to join the
government, but not without the kind of squabbling dear to the
former protest party since its founding 18 years ago.
	   After last month's election victory by the Social Democrats,
Greens leaders swiftly grasped power at the national level for the
first time, sealing a coalition pact after surprisingly smooth
negotiations.
	   Both parties are expected to ratify the deal this weekend at
special conventions in Bonn, clearing final hurdles for Germany's
first left-leaning government in 16 years.
	   While the Social Democrats' vote is likely to go smoothly,
Greens leaders may face resistance from members who resent the fact
that Schroeder nixed radical goals such as a sharp hike in gasoline
taxes and a timetable for scrapping nuclear power.
	   Still, the Greens were expected to back the coalition Saturday
as the best deal they could get as junior partner.
	   Party co-chair Gunda Roestel opened their meeting Friday with a
plea to some 750 delegates to reconcile their anti-establishment
roots with the chance to govern Europe's biggest nation.
	   ``Assuming you approve, a new chapter in postwar German history
will start on Monday,'' she said. ``This new chapter will bear
Green handwriting.''
	   ``Of course we had to swallow things we didn't like,'' she said.
But, she added, ``this is a chance for our party to grow into a new
role.''
	   Reflecting the queasiness among many party members, the three
Greens tapped for Cabinet posts faced accusations Friday that they
are amassing power.

	   OVIEDO, Spain (AP) _ Seven women honored on Friday with one of
the eight prestigious Asturias Prizes dedicated their award to
Myanmar's opposition leader and 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung
San Suu kyi.
	   The seven women who shared the Asturias award for International
Cooperation were among a total 19 winners of this year's prizes
that are considered the Spanish-speaking world's closest equivalent
to Nobels.
	   One by one the winners were presented their awards by Crown
Prince Felipe of Asturias in this northern city.
	   The Social Science prize went to European Commission President
Jacques Santer and former Luxembourg premier Pierre Werner for
their contribution to setting in motion the European single
currency.
	   Santer, the younger of the so-called ``parents of the euro''
called on Europe to show the world that it should ``overcome the
(divisive) power of individual states through the higher ideal of
the power of trust.''
	   Europe's top official identified unemployment and internal
security as the most pressing issues facing the region.
	   This year's Arts award went to Brazilian photographer Sebastiao
Salgado, well known for his haunting depiction's of landless
peasants and exploited miners.
	   Spanish writer Francisco Ayala picked up the Literature prize,
while Spanish physicists Pedro Miguel Etxenike and Emilio Mendez
collected the Science prize.
	   German publisher Reinhard Mohn received this year's
Communication and Humanities prize that in 1997 went to CNN and
Czech Republic President Vaclav Havel.
	   Spain's young tennis star Aranxta Sanchez Vicario was awarded
the prize for achievement in sports.
	   Five men shared the Concord award - Bangladeshi philanthropist
Mohammad Yunus, Spanish missionaries Vincente Ferrer and Nocolas
Castellanos and fellow countryman and doctor Joaquin Sanz Gadea.
	   European Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid Emma Bonino of Italy
spoke on behalf of the seven women honored for their contribution
to International Cooperation. The group also included the 1992
Nobel Peace Prize laureate Rigoberta Menchu of Guatemala, Fatiha
Boudiaf of Algeria, Olayinka Koso-Thomas of Nigeria, Graca Machel
of Mozambique, Fatana Ishaq of Afghanistan and Somaly Mam of
Cambodia.
	   Bonino called for ``less realism and cynicism'' in international
relations and ``more ethics, values, ideals and commitment''
	   The prizes include a check for 5 million pesetas (dlrs 35,000)
and an original sculpture by Spanish artist Joan Miro.
	   ``If there is one thing that unites all the winners it is the
ambition to do something lasting that helps others,'' Prince Felipe
said at the end of the ceremony.

	   During the debate before the vote, Italy's center-right
opposition forces, led by former Premier Silvio Berlusconi,
promised a fierce battle against the new, center-left government
led by D'Alema, a former Communist.
	   The government is Italy's 56th since the end of World War II.
	   Berlusconi's Freedom Alliance called supporters to march in
protest in Rome on Saturday.
	   D'Alema would like to have as broad as support as possible to
pass the 1999 budget as well as to revive efforts to reform Italy's
bureaucratic institutions and an electoral system that rewards
small parties and feeds the country's chronic government
instability.
	   The opposition contends that D'Alema's coalition, which ranges
from a small centrist party of former Christian Democrats now loyal
to ex-president Francesco Cossiga to Communists holding ministry
posts for the first time in five decades, fails to respect the
choices made by voters in the 1996 elections.
	   Many of the centrist deputies were elected to Parliament in 1996
on the center-right Freedom Alliance ticket, not on the center-left
Olive Tree group which proposed Romano Prodi as premier.
	   Prodi's 2 1-2 year-old coalition, Italy's second longest-lasting
since the end of the war, collapsed after some Communists, then
outside the government but usually supportive of Prodi, refused to
back the government in a confidence vote Oct. 9.
	   D'Alema won the vote on the eve of his first international
appearance as premier. He was expected in Austria for a European
Union summit Saturday.
	   D'Alema has promised to pursue the strict economic policies
imposed by Prodi, which allowed Italy to qualify for Europe's
single currency.

Thriller writer Eric Ambler dies aged 89
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: graf 12 CORRECTS title of book that won American award &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Eric Ambler, one of the founding authors of modern
thrillers and an Oscar-nominated screenwriter, has died, his agent
said Friday. He was 89.
	   Ambler had been ill for some time and died at his apartment in
central London on Thursday, agent John McLaughlin said. McLaughlin
did not give a cause of death.
	   Ambler had 21 books published, including his autobiography
``Here Lies'' in 1985. Among his best-known works are ``Epitaph for
a Spy,'' in 1938, ``The Mask of Dimitrios,'' in 1939, ``Journey
into Fear,'' 1940, ``Judgment at Deltchev'' in 1951 and ``The
Schirmer Inheritance'' in 1953.
	   ``He was one of the masters of the thriller and he really was
one of the great signposts, because he took the spy thriller out of
the gentility of the drawing room and into the back streets of
Istanbul and where it all really happened,'' said Frederick
Forsyth, author of ``The Day of the Jackal.''
	   ``He was the first of the realists, apart from being a very
charming man and he was what you'd call a good egg.'' Forsyth said.
	   In ``Whodunit,'' H.R.F. Keating's handbook of crime and suspense
fiction, Ambler is singled out as creator of ``a new phase in the
history of the spy story ... choosing as hero not an operative with
right and the Establishment on his side, but a person caught up in
the machinations of the Great Powers who was himself of the Left, a
doubter and an innocent.''
	   In Ambler's fifth book, ``The Mask of Dimitrios,'' he wrote of
an unassuming academic caught up in the murderous espionage battles
of the Balkans in the 1930s.
	   The novel, the first to bring him international recognition, was
made into a film by Warner Brothers, starring Sydney Greenstreet,
Zachary Scott, and Peter Lorre.
	   Ambler, born in London in 1909, had studied engineering at the
University of London and later worked in advertising. He served in
the Royal Artillery during World War II, rising to the rank of
lieutenant-colonel.
	   The early novels, beginning in 1936 with ``The Dark Frontier,''
were generally set in Eastern Europe and the Levant, and written
from a left-wing point of view, which was seen as a conscious
reaction to the tradition of John Buchan and others who had written
of the glory of the empire from within the Establishment.
	   Ambler also wrote 16 screenplays, the most noted being the
adaptation of Nicholas Monsarrat's novel ``The Cruel Sea,'' for
which he received a 1953 Oscar nomination. Others were , ``The
Purple Plain,'' in 1954, ``A Night to Remember,'' in 1958, and
``Wreck of the Mary Deare'' in 1959.
	   Britain's Crime Writers Association awarded its Golden Dagger
Award to ``The Levanter,'' in 1972, and in 1986 honored Ambler with
a Diamond Dagger Award. The novel ``The Light of Day,'' in 1961 won
the Mystery Writers of America's Edgar Allen Poe Award. The
American association made Ambler a Grand Master in 1975.
	   Queen Elizabeth II honored him in 1981 with an OBE award as
officer of the Order of the British Empire.
	   Ambler lived in Hollywood for some years with his second wife,
Joan, who worked as a film producer for Alfred Hitchcock. He and
the late Mrs. Ambler had no children. No funeral plans were
announced.

	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ Peru and Ecuador settled on a border
slicing through a jungle in the Andean foothills, eliminating a
flashpoint between the South American neighbors, diplomats said
Friday.
	   Presidents Alberto Fujimori of Peru and Jamil Mahuad of Ecuador
will sign a peace accord on Monday here in Brazil's capital, where
the negotiations took place, the sources said.
	   The two neighbors fought wars in 1941, 1981 and 1995 over the
unmarked border in the jungle-covered Cordillera del Condor region.
The full border stretches 1,050 miles (1,690 kilometers) through
mainly jungle terrain.
	   The dispute centered on a remote jungle area called Tiwintza,
located on a 48-mile (77- kilometer) stretch of border that was not
defined in the 1942 Rio de Janeiro Protocol that set territorial
boundaries.
	   Under the terms of the pact, the portion of border unmarked
until now will follow the heights of the Cordillera del Condor
mountain range, said Peruvian Foreign Minister Fernando de
Trazegnies as he announced the details of the agreement in a
televised address in Lima.
	   But a jungle-cloaked hill within Peru's territory called
Tiwintza will be granted to Ecuador's government as private
property _ even though it will remain under Peruvian sovereignty.
That would make ownership of the 250 acres (100 hectares) somewhat
comparable to an individual Ecuadoran owning property in Peru.
	   Tiwintza is a highly emotional symbol to Ecuador because its
troops managed to defend it successfully against repeated assaults
by Peruvian troops during the 1995 border war.
	   The agreement also calls for two national parks to be created
contiguously to one another in the disputed area.
	   Peace talks begin in 1995. After years of slow progress, the
presidents of the two nations met in August to work out the final
details. The accord is based on a proposal elaborated by the four
peace brokers: Brazil, the United States, Argentina and Chile.
	   Beyond setting the boundary between the two nations, it includes
an agreement security measures and on trade and navigation.
	   The presidents of Brazil, Argentina and Chile will attend the
signing as will King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia of Spain.
	   The U.S. Embassy in Brasilia said Luigi Einaudi, the special
U.S. envoy for the peace talks, would represent Washington at the
ceremony.
	   As a condition for brokering the peace talks, the four nations
involved in the talks secured approval in advance from the
congresses of Peru and Ecuador for any deal negotiated.

	   ROME (AP) _ Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema on Friday won the

electoral,'' D''Alema said, pitching for the confidence vote.
	   Prodi's 2 1-2 year-old coalition, Italy's second longest-lasting
since the end of the war, collapsed after some Communists, then
outside the government but usually supportive of Prodi, refused to
back the government in a confidence vote Oct. 9.
	   D'Alema won the vote on the eve of his first international
appearance as premier. He was expected in Austria for a European
Union summit Saturday.

	   OVIEDO, Spain (AP) _ Seven women honored on Friday with one of
the eight prestigious Asturias Prizes dedicated their award to
Myanmar's opposition leader and 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung
San Suu kyi.
	   The seven women who shared the Asturias award for International
Cooperation were among a total 19 winners of this year's prizes
that are considered the Spanish-speaking world's closest equivalent
to Nobels.
	   One by one the winners were presented their awards by Crown
Prince Felipe of Asturias in this northern city.
	   The Social Science prize went to European Commission President
Jacques Santer and former Luxembourg premier Pierre Werner for
their contribution to setting in motion the European single
currency.
	   Santer, the younger of the so-called ``parents of the euro''
called on Europe to show the world that it should ``overcome the
(divisive) power of individual states through the higher ideal of
the power of trust.''
	   Europe's top official identified unemployment and internal
security as the most pressing issues facing the region.
	   This year's Arts award went to Brazilian photographer Sebastiao
Salgado, well known for his haunting depiction's of landless
peasants and exploited miners.
	   Spanish writer Francisco Ayala picked up the Literature prize,
while Spanish physicists Pedro Miguel Etxenike and Emilio Mendez
collected the Science prize.
	   German publisher Reinhard Mohn received this year's
Communication and Humanities prize that in 1997 went to CNN and
Czech Republic President Vaclav Havel.
	   Spain's young tennis star Aranxta Sanchez Vicario was awarded
the prize for achievement in sports.
	   Four men shared the Concord award - Bangladeshi philanthropist
Mohammad Yunus, Spanish missionaries Vincente Ferrer and Nocolas
Castellanos and fellow countryman and doctor Joaquin Sanz Gadea.
	   European Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid Emma Bonino of Italy
spoke on behalf of the seven women honored for their contribution
to International Cooperation. The group also included the 1992
Nobel Peace Prize laureate Rigoberta Menchu of Guatemala, Fatiha
Boudiaf of Algeria, Olayinka Koso-Thomas of Nigeria, Graca Machel
of Mozambique, Fatana Ishaq of Afghanistan and Somaly Mam of
Cambodia.
	   Bonino called for ``less realism and cynicism'' in international
relations and ``more ethics, values, ideals and commitment''
	   The prizes include a check for 5 million pesetas (dlrs 35,000)
and an original sculpture by Spanish artist Joan Miro.
	   ``If there is one thing that unites all the winners it is the
ambition to do something lasting that helps others,'' Prince Felipe
said at the end of the ceremony.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ World Cup champion France withdrew Friday from
January's Confederations Cup, snubbing the FIFA tournament which
many European leagues consider irrelevant and untimely.
	   The decision is ``irrevocable,'' said Claude Simonet, president
of the French soccer federation.
	   French league president Noel Le Graet has said the
Confederations Cup was ``just for fun,'' noting that Brazil was
only sending its ``B'' team and some club owners _ notably of
Italian teams _ had said they weren't going to release their
players.
	   That leaves the Jan. 8-20 event in Mexico, billed as FIFA's
tournament of continental champions, with Brazil, Mexico, Bolivia,
the United States, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and New Zealand.
	   There are no plans to cancel the tournament, Mexican officials
said.
	   ``It affects us. Hopefully, it will be worked out,'' Mexican
federation president Enrique Borja said. ``It would be a pity not
to have the world champion.''
	   Some federations and particularly European leagues regard the
event as an unneeded, one that exhausts already burned out players,
and comes in the middle of the European season.
	   France's ``Les Bleus'' were scheduled to represent Europe in the
competition.
	   FIFA president Joseph ``Sepp'' Blatter expressed disappointment
at the decision but indicated no sanctions would be taken against
France.
	   ``It is regrettable that the French FA has made a decision like
this with only 100 days to go before the kickoff of this event,''
he said in a statement. ``For the world champions to withdraw from
an official FIFA competition in which the French team had
undertaken to take part as the representative of the European
confederation, UEFA, is hard for me to understand.''
	   Noting that the French decision appeared ``irrevocable,''
Blatter said UEFA would be responsible for selecting a European
team to replace France in the tournament. Blatter said he would
discuss the issue with UEFA president Lennart Johansson on Saturday
in Glasgow, Scotland.
	   Borja said he hoped France would be replaced by a ``top-flight''
team, but would have nothing more to say until speaking with
Blatter on Saturday in Scotland.
	   ``Who better to work negotiate this than Joseph Blatter,'' he
said.
	   Roger Lemerre, the new coach of the French team, had been in
favor of the French team's participation, which would have allowed
him to test new players.
	   January's tournament will be the fourth edition of the
championship, first contested in 1992 and always previously held in
Saudi Arabia.
	   French internationals playing in European leagues would have
missed domestic matches if they played in Mexico.

U.N. withdraws another official from Iraq for taking photos
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC;

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The United Nations has withdrawn a Chilean
pilot from Iraq for taking photographs _ the second such move in
two weeks, the top U.N. inspector in Iraq said Friday.
	   Chilean authorities wanted to withdraw the pilot after Iraq
accused him of spying, said Nils Carlstrom. Richard Butler, the
head of the U.N. Special Commission, which carries out inspections,
accepted the request.
	   The pilot had used his own camera to photograph sensitive
material in breach of the commission's rules, Carlstrom told The
Associated Press.
	   The Chilean will leave Iraq on the next available U.N. flight,
Carlstrom said, declining to identify him.
	   U.N. weapons inspectors rely on five Chilean helicopters and
their 40-member crews for their travel in Iraq and aerial
surveillance of weapons sites.
	   Last week Butler ordered Carl Pfluger, an American inspector, to
leave the country for taking pictures with his own camera of a
missile site close to Baghdad.
	   Iraqi newspapers reported the withdrawal of Pfluger with glee
Friday.
	   ``UNSCOM withdraws one of its spies from Iraq,'' trumpeted the
official newspaper Al-Iraq.
	   Iraq has repeatedly accused the U.N. weapons inspectors of
espionage and since Aug. 5 has blocked surprise inspections by the
experts, who are charged with supervising the elimination of its
weapons of mass destruction.
	   But Carlstrom said the withdrawal of the Chilean and the
American should not be interpreted as admission that the commission
was involved in espionage.
	   ``(The pilot's) withdrawal is not due to the wrongful
allegations of espionage, but to the fact that he violated UNSCOM's
own rules regarding the non-use of personal cameras on
inspections.''
	   Both the pilot and Pfluger would be dismissed from the
commission, Carlstrom added.
	   Under U.N. Security Council resolutions passed after the 1991
Gulf War, Iraq must show it has eliminated its weapons of mass
destruction before the Security Council will lift the trade
sanctions imposed after the invasion of Kuwait.

At-Talabah of Iraq reaches Asian Cup Winners' semis over Iranian
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ To the beat of drums, brass bands and songs
equating the match to war, Iraq's At-Talabah held Iran's Paas to a
1-1 draw Friday and advanced to the semifinals of the Asian Cup
Winners' Cup.
	   ``This is the way the beseiged people play. If it was just a
game for them, for us it was a battle,'' the lyrics to one
patriotic song blared from loudspeakers as players left the field.
	   Members of Paas wept as they exit the pitch. A crowd of more
than 50,000 in al-Shaab stadium danced, cheered and waved the
club's blue flags as the match wore on, culminating with the
players being carried off the field by jubilant supporters.
	   At-Talabah needed only a draw Friday to advance, having won the
first leg in Tehran earlier this month 1-0.
	   For almost a week, state-run media has been urging Iraqis not to
miss the match and organizers said al-Shaab was full hours before
kickoff.
	   Iraq and Iran fought a ruinous war between 1980 and 1988, but
the crowd was well behaved and both sides shook hands warmly.
	   Baghdad streets were almost deserted before the match started.
	   Despite vanquishing a rival from one bitter neighbor,
At-Talabah's victory only earns it a meeting with another.
	   At-Talabah will face next either Kuwait's Al-Kadhimiya or Saudi
Arabia's Al-Nasir.
	   Iraqi football officials have said both Saudi Arabia and Kuwait,
which Iraq invaded in 1990, has refused to play Iraqi teams in the
past.

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Slovakian national team coach Jozef
Jankech was fired Friday following a 3-0 home defeat to Portugal
earlier this month.
	   Jankech already was under fire for the team's failure to qualify
for the 1996 European Championship or 1998 World Cup.
	   Jankech's predecessor, Jozef Venglos, was dismissed after
Slovakia was beaten 4-0 by France and 5-0 by Poland.
	   ``We have to think about the standard of the Slovakian first
division, which provides players for the national team. The level
of the matches in the league is very weak,'' said Milan Sluzanic,
president of the Slovak Football Association.
	   The Slovak league was expanded to 16 teams three years ago, a
move that diluted the quality at the top level.

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Political prisoners, apparently seeking
better jail conditions, took guards hostage Friday at three prisons
in Turkey, Justice Minister Hasan Denizkurdu said.
	   As many as 30 prison officials were being held captive in a
political prisoners' ward at Umraniye prison, in Istanbul.
	   An unknown number of guards were being held at Bergama prison,

China and Russia balk at U.N. resolution on Kosovo peace deal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ China and Russia balked Friday at a
proposed U.N. Security Council resolution endorsing the Kosovo
peace deal, claiming it would give a green light for military
action.
	   Russia submitted an alternate draft resolution which council
members were discussing informally, said British Ambassador Jeremy
Greenstock, the council's president.
	   ``We have broken up to have further group discussions and
exchanges between delegations, but the process is going forward,''
he said. The council was scheduled to meet again late Friday to
continue the Kosovo debate.
	   Russia and China have opposed any language threatening Serbs and
ethnic Albanians with force if they don't comply with the Oct. 12
agreement, which averted NATO strikes on Serb targets.
	   The Security Council is under pressure to adopt a resolution
enshrining the accord so a team to verify compliance can start
roaming Kosovo to ensure that fighting between Serbs and ethnic
Albanians has ceased.
	   Under the deal brokered by U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke,
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic agreed to a ceasefire, to
withdraw his special police forces, and to allow a 2,000-strong
team to verify the agreement.
	   The United States and Britain have been pushing for a tough
resolution to put pressure on Milosevic to comply with the
agreement and intimate the consequences if he doesn't.
	   As permanent council members, Russia and China could veto any
new resolution.
	   Russia has religious and cultural ties to the Serbs, and Russian
lawmakers warned NATO Friday that airstrikes on Yugoslavia would
prompt Moscow to offer weapons to Serbs. China is traditionally
opposed to any military intervention into what it considers an
internal matter, fearing a precedent could be set for its own
disputes with Taiwan and Tibet.
	   After a council meeting which was supposed to be devoted to Iraq
but dealt exclusively with Kosovo, China's Ambassador Qin Huasun
told reporters that Beijing had ``difficulties in principle'' with
the initial draft resolution.
	   Diplomats said China and Russia objected to three paragraphs in
the proposed resolution which would give NATO the right ``to take
steps'' to ensure full implementation of the deal and to ensure the
safety of the team from the Vienna-based Organization for Security
and Cooperation which will verify it.
	   Praising Milosevic's ``great efforts and concessions'' to
resolve the Kosovo question peacefully, Qin accused NATO _ without
naming it _ of unilaterally deciding without Security Council
authorization to take military action against Yugoslavia ``and
brutally interfere in the internal affairs of a sovereign state.''
	   China was prepared to accept ``a technical resolution'' to
endorse the Kosovo agreement, but not a resolution that might
authorize military action, he said.
	   Fighting between Serb forces and ethnic Albanians _ who make up
90 percent of Kosovo's population _ has killed hundreds of people
and forced around 300,000 from their homes since a Serb crackdown
began in February. Serbia is the largest of the two republics that
make up Yugoslavia.

Elections to key Iranian assembly apparently marred by low turnout
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. CHANGES overline. Voting extended three hours to 1730
GMT; no pickup
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's official media boasted a huge turnout
Friday for the elections to a key assembly, but many polling
stations were nearly empty in Tehran where some voters complained
that hard-line clerics had already decided the outcome.
	   State-controlled Tehran radio reported ``unprecedented and
unique'' voting levels in the polls for the 86-member Assembly of
Experts, which oversees Iran's supreme leader.
	   The radio said long lines of voters had queued at polling
stations across the country and electoral officers expected to run
out of ballot papers.
	   But correspondents who visited a dozen polling stations around
the capital found turnout to be minimal. Only two polling stations
had voters waiting in line.
	   The electoral authorities twice extended the polls' closure _
for a total of three hours. Interior Minister Abdolvahed Lari
announced that stations had closed at 1730 GMT, but said late
voters would not be turned away.
	   One candidate, Majid Ansari, a moderate cleric, blamed the low
turnout in Tehran on the lack of choice as most of the 167
candidates _ all clergymen _ were hard-liners. The candidates were
selected by a Council of Guardians that is controlled by
conservatives.
	   ``Unfortunately, the procedures were such that competition was
limited and a group of revolutionaries were prevented from taking
part in the elections,'' Ansari told The Associated Press.
	   Ordinary people were blunt about their reason for boycotting the
polls.
	   ``It makes no difference. They have already selected the people
they want to put in the assembly,'' said Siavash Mohseni, 24, a
university student who said he didn't vote.
	   A young woman who gave only her first name, Arezou, said she was
similarly alienated from the polls. ``The behavior of the Council
of Guardians was very insulting because they did not give us a
chance to choose the candidates of our choice.''
	   Although voting was supposed to be secret, there were no private
booths for voters and it was easy to see whom a person voted for.
	   An election observer in western Tehran said many voters had cast
empty ballot papers and many more had voted for supporters of the
moderate President Mohammad Khatami.
	   However, one voter in Tehran's Enqelab Square, Saeid Kazami, 41,
said he had cast his ballot mainly for hard-line candidates.
	   The hard-liners ``are protectors of the (Islamic) revolution. We
know that the revolution will have no problem if they are in
charge,'' he said.
	   Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, a hard-liner, has
the final say in government and conservative clerics want to keep
it that way. But moderate clerics, led by Khatami, are calling for
a more accountable leader.
	   Khatami's efforts to ease the revolution's social, political and
media restrictions are popular. But they are opposed bitterly by
hard-liners who are loathe to give up control of key institutions
such as the judiciary and the security agencies.
	   Khatami urged people to vote after casting his ballot at the
Husseinieh Jamaran mosque in northern Tehran.
	   ``Definitely, there could have been more qualified people than
were allowed, but nonetheless we still have a chance to choose our
favored candidates,'' Khatami told reporters.
	   Official results are not expected until Saturday, and Tehran's
results could be announced as late as Sunday, the electoral
authorities said.

Police continue hunt for HIV sex-crime man
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ At least 120 women have reported having
sex with an HIV-positive man police accuse of having unprotected
intercourse despite knowing that he carried the virus that causes
AIDS.
	   The manhunt has been front-page news in Sweden for most of the
week and on Tuesday authorities took the unusual-for-Sweden step of
releasing his name and photograph, identifying him as James Patric
Kimball of the United States.
	   The name quickly proved to be false. Interpol reported to
Swedish police that the man, who had been living in Sweden since
1992 under that identity, was actually an Iranian named Mehdi
Tayeb.
	   The man is charged with rape and grave assault. The latter is
the charge used in Sweden to prosecute people accused of having
unprotected sex while knowing they are HIV-positive.
	   Police phones and an AIDS crisis line have been inundated with
calls this week, from frightened women and people providing tips on
Tayeb's possible whereabouts.
	   ''We have tips that he has been seen in the Stockholm area but
also in a far-away country,'' police inspector Lone Callias was
quoted as saying Friday by the Swedish news agency TT.
	   Tayeb, a taxi driver, was a well-known figure in Stockholm
nightspots, reportedly bragging that he had wide celebrity
contacts.
	   Although 120 women have reported having had sex with the man,
only one is so far known to have tested positive for HIV _ a
Swedish woman with whom he moved to the country from France in
1992, TT said.
	   The newspaper Expressen reported Friday that Tayeb had in the
1980s run a model agency in Deerfield Beach, Florida, using the
name Fabian Foxx. The agency was suspected of being a front for
prostitution, the newspaper said.
	   The Deerfield Beach detective whom the newspaper cited was off
on Friday and a duty officer told The Associated Press he had no
knowledge of the case.

France pulls out of Confederations Cup
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: RESTORES original edit; CORRECTS writethru sequence. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ World Cup champion France withdrew Friday from
January's Confederations Cup, snubbing the FIFA tournament which
many European leagues consider irrelevant and untimely.
	   The decision is ``irrevocable,'' said Claude Simonet, president
of the French soccer federation.
	   French league president Noel Le Graet has said the
Confederations Cup was ``just for fun,'' noting that Brazil was
only sending its ``B'' team and some club owners _ notably of
Italian teams _ had said they weren't going to release their
players.
	   That leaves the Jan. 8-20 event in Mexico, billed as FIFA's
tournament of continental champions, with Brazil, Mexico, Bolivia,
the United States, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and New Zealand.
	   There are no plans to cancel the tournament, Mexican officials
said.
	   ``It affects us. Hopefully, it will be worked out,'' Mexican
federation president Enrique Borja said. ``It would be a pity not
to have the world champion.''
	   Some federations and particularly European leagues regard the
event as an unneeded, one that exhausts already burned out players,
and comes in the middle of the European season.
	   France's ``Les Bleus'' were scheduled to represent Europe in the
competition.
	   FIFA president Joseph ``Sepp'' Blatter expressed disappointment
at the decision but indicated no sanctions would be taken against
France.
	   ``It is regrettable that the French FA has made a decision like
this with only 100 days to go before the kickoff of this event,''
he said in a statement. ``For the world champions to withdraw from
an official FIFA competition in which the French team had
undertaken to take part as the representative of the European
confederation, UEFA, is hard for me to understand.''
	   Noting that the French decision appeared ``irrevocable,''
Blatter said UEFA would be responsible for selecting a European
team to replace France in the tournament. Blatter said he would
discuss the issue with UEFA president Lennart Johansson on Saturday
in Glasgow, Scotland.
	   Borja said he hoped France would be replaced by a ``top-flight''
team, but would have nothing more to say until speaking with
Blatter on Saturday in Scotland.
	   ``Who better to work negotiate this than Joseph Blatter,'' he
said.
	   Roger Lemerre, the new coach of the French team, had been in
favor of the French team's participation, which would have allowed
him to test new players.
	   January's tournament will be the fourth edition of the
championship, first contested in 1992 and always previously held in
Saudi Arabia.
	   French internationals playing in European leagues would have
missed domestic matches if they played in Mexico.

Russia says substantial progress made toward peace treaty with
</HEADLINE>
Japan &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia and Japan have made substantial progress
toward a peace treaty that would resolve differences dating to
World War II, Russian officials said Friday.
	   However, Russia remains adamant that it will not give up any of
the territory it claimed from Japan after the war, the chairman of
the State Duma's Foreign Affairs Committee told the ITAR-Tass news
agency.
	   ``Of course, Russia will not cede the southern Kuriles,''
Vladimir Lukin said.
	   Russia's claim to the Kurile islands, which lie off the
southeastern Russian coast, just north of the northernmost Japanese
island of Hokkaido, has been a major sticking point in
negotiations. Japan has insisted for years that Russia return the
islands.
	   A spokesman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, Grigory Karasin,
said deputy ministers from the two countries would meet in Tokyo
next week to discuss a draft peace agreement.
	   A Russian-Japanese summit is scheduled next month, and leaders
of the two countries will continue to work out details of the
treaty, Karasin said, according to ITAR-Tass.

Ukraine's government approves 1999 budget draft
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ The Ukrainian government on Friday approved
a revised 1999 budget draft, which forecasts a deficit of 0.6
percent of gross domestic product, a news report said.
	   The document provides for revenues of 22.5 billion hryvna (dlrs
6.58 billion) and expenditures of 23.18 billion hryvna (dlrs 6.77
billion), the Interfax news agency reported.
	   The draft also projected a 1 percent growth of Ukraine's GDP,
which was estimated to reach 117.5 billion hryvna (dlrs 34.36
billion) next year.
	   The latest 1999 budget draft was approved after parliament
rejected the Cabinet's previous draft last month.
	   Lawmakers argued at the time that the devaluation of the
national hryvna currency in September in the wake of the turmoil in
neighboring Russia made many of the document's figures unrealistic.
	   Prime Minister Valery Pustovoitenko said the new budget would be
submitted to parliament along with the Cabinet's plan of action for
the next six months by the end of Friday.

Central Banker predicts collapse of hundreds of banks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS 9th graf, `The Central ...,' to restore dropped word
`billion.' &QL; 
 &UR; By LESLIE SHEPHERD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's chief banker predicted Friday that only a
fraction of the country's commercial banks would survive the
current economic crisis, even with help from the Central Bank.
	   ``We reckon that only a small number of banks will be able to
stay afloat in the current situation,'' said Central Bank chairman
Viktor Gerashchenko.
	   ``I expect that 200-300 banks will be able to cope with the
financial problems,'' he said, according to the Interfax news
agency.
	   The Central Bank recently estimated there were 1,700 commercial
banks in Russia, although the Profil business weekly said only 905
remained profitable after the crisis erupted in mid-August.
	   Russian entrepreneurs rushed to open banks in the post-Soviet
era, but few of the enterprises ever established a solid financial
footing or offered western-style retail services.
	   Many collapsed in the wake of the crisis or froze accounts.
Dealing among other banks all but stopped, due to the plummeting
ruble, a lack of capital and potential losses resulting from huge
investments in the treasury bills the government defaulted on.
	   Talks between Russian officials and foreign banks that hold many
of the treasury bills broke down in London on Thursday, but
Germany's Deutsche Bank AG said they will resume next week.
	   Foreign banks fear they will be offered less favorable repayment
rates than Russians.
	   The Central Bank said Thursday that 61 billion rubles (dlrs 3.58
billion) would be needed to bail out the country's banking system.
It said it would help the most viable and important banks, as well
as key banks in the regions.
	   Meanwhile, the government lowered import duties Friday on meat,
milk and other staples in an effort to prevent any shortages this
winter.
	   Russia relies heavily on imports, which have fallen since the
crisis as become more expensive as the ruble loses value.
	   The country has not experienced any food shortages, and is not
expected to. But the government wants to make sure there is plenty
of food on hand for the winter.
	   The Interfax news agency said the import duties on meat have
been trimmed from 15 percent to 10 percent, on milk from 10 percent
to 5 percent and on butter, from 20 percent to 15 percent. Duties
on other foods, such as soybeans, also were lowered.
	   The government continued talks Friday with officials from the
International Monetary Fund. Few details have been released, but
the IMF top representative in Russia, Martin Gilman, has said that
the question of further IMF loan installments has not come up.
	   A dlrs 22.6 billion loan package, put together by the IMF before
the crisis, was frozen in September after the first dlrs 4.8
billion installment was provided.
	   The IMF has said it will not release more money until it sees
Russia's plan for coping with the economic crisis and signs that it
is being implemented. Russia has already indicated it is putting
together only short-term measures, rather than a comprehensive,
long-term plan.

Vail fires won't affect World Championships, officials say
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOELDEN, Austria (AP) _ Recent fires atop Vail Mountain will not
affect this season's World Alpine Championships, International Ski
Federation officials said Friday at the FIS' pre-season conference.
	   After seven separate fires ravaged the top of the mountain
Monday, destroying three buildings and damaging four chairlifts at
the chic Colorado Mountains resort, speculation arose that the
World Championships, scheduled for Jan. 30-Feb. 14, were in
jeopardy.
	   ``The fires did not affect the race facilities for the
championships,'' said John Dakin, vice president of the Vail Valley
Foundation. ``It's a great loss for the Vail Associates and
somewhat of an inconvenience for the guests for the moment, but it
won't affect opening day.''
	   The series of fires caused about dlrs 12 million in damage just
days after work began on a major resort expansion opposed by
environmentalists.
	   The Earth Liberation Front environmental group, linked to arson
incidents across the Northwest, took responsibility for the fires
to protest an expansion plan by the nation's busiest ski resort
``on behalf of the lynx.''
	   An investigation is still underway.
	   ``We are no longer worried about the effect it might have on the
worlds,'' Dakin said.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ The board of Telecom Italia SpA, the world's
fifth largest phone company, on Friday named board member Berardino
Libonati as new chairman, replacing Gian Mario Rossignolo.
	   It was the third power shuffled at the top of the
telecommunications company in 22 months.
	   Rossignolo was named chairman on Jan. 12 and one month later
forced out chief executive and longtime Telecom executive Tomaso

Acting Virgin Islands police chief indicted

<TEXT>
	   CHARLOTTE AMALIE, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) _ The acting police
chief for this U.S. territory has been indicted on two counts of
grand larceny and federal program fraud, U.S. Attorney James Hurd
announced Friday.
	   Acting Police Chief Americus Jackson was placed on
administrative leave with pay following the indictment.
	   Jackson allegedly took a used 1990 Dodge truck that was meant to
be sold at a police auction and used it himself, without going
through the proper administrative procedures. An investigation of
Jackson's use of the vehicle began in July.
	   Police Commissioner Ramon S. Davila said Jackson will remain on
leave pending the outcome of the court case and Deputy Police Chief
Jose Garcia will fill in for Jackson.

Commuters tune in on Berlin subway
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Commuters who zone out by staring out the window
on one stretch of Berlin subway actually will be tuning in _ to
movies flashing on the tunnel walls.
	   The subway cinema premiered Friday with cartoon characters, but
creators expect to change the film periodically. Most _ about 70
percent _ will be advertisements.
	   The effect is created by about 900 projectors mounted in the
tunnel casting pictures on a special white background. Here's the
trick: the pictures don't move _ but the speeding train makes them
look like they do.
	   Commuters will have to pay attention: the show lasts about 30
seconds from the central Zoo station to Hansaplatz, north of the
city's Tiergarten park. That's 30 pictures per second at speeds of
65 kilometers (40 miles) an hour, calculates creator Joerg
Moser-Metius.
	   MetroCinevision, which is developing the project, plans to
install the system in subway tunnels in Paris and London.

Egypts says it will not be freeing early an Israeli-Arab spy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt affirmed Friday it did not intend to
pardon an Israeli-Arab serving a 15-year sentence for espionage.
	   ``The position of President Hosni Mubarak is steadfast and clear
concerning the request to free the Israeli spy Azzam Azzam,''
Egypt's official Middle East News Agency reported.
	   ``This position has not changed and no new (orders) have been
issued concerning it,'' said MENA, quoting a senior government
source.
	   Israeli television and radio had reported earlier that Azzam's
release was to be part of the peace agreement that Palestinians and
Israelis were finalizing outside Washington on Friday. The reports
were later denied by a spokesman for the Israeli prime minister.
	   Azzam was jailed last year after a bizarre trial in which
prosecutors said he supplied women's underwear soaked in invisible
ink to an Egyptian accomplice. The accomplice used the ink to write
secret messages to Israeli intelligence about Egyptian factories
and Egypt's treatment of its citizens who had dealings with the
Israeli embassy in Cairo.
	   Israel denied that Azzam was an agent and has pleaded for his
release.

	   PARIS (AP) _ French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine welcomed the

</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with Telecom saying negotiations for digital platform
going ahead; NOTE ``and'' replaces ampersand in 3rd graf, And soon &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ In the third power shuffle in 22 months at
the top of the world's fifth largest phone company, Telecom Italia
SpA's board on Friday named board member Berardino Libonati as new
chairman, replacing Gian Mario Rossignolo.
	   In a statement Telecom specified that Libonati's position as
chairman will not include the broad executive powers given to
Rossignolo. Instead, those powers have been temporarily assigned to
Telecom's executive committee.
	   Rossignolo was named chairman on Jan. 12 and one month later
forced out chief executive and longtime Telecom executive Tomaso
Tommasi di Vignano.
	   And soon after he was named chairman, Rossignolo broke off a
strategic alliance with the U.S. company AT and T.
	   The executive committee told the adminstrative board that it is
looking to find a chief executive officer shortly.
	   Telecom added that negotiations for a digital platform will go
forward with all interested parties.
	   Earlier this month, the Italian financial daily Il Sole 24 Ore
reported that Telecom was close to concluding an accord with RAI,
Italy's state TV network, and Rupert Murdoch's British Sky
Broadcasting Group PLC (BSy) over its 100 percent-controlled
digital pay-TV unit stream.

Russia to increase vodka production
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INSERTS 1 graf after 4th graf to UPDATE with estimate of
revenues. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia will increase vodka production by 60
percent next year, Deputy Prime Minister Gennady Kulik said Friday.
	   Russia produced 82 million decaliters (217 million gallons) of
vodka and other strong drinks in 1998, the Interfax news agency
said.
	   ``We will do our best to squeeze what we can out of this
industry,'' Kulik told lawmakers from the Agrarian Party.
	   The Russian government recently announced it would be taking a
controlling stake in all 184 Russian distilleries that make pure
alcohol _ a key ingredient in vodka _ in an effort to get more tax
revenues.
	   Interior Minister Sergei Stapashin said Friday that the
government could earn up to 40 billion rubles (dlrs 2.5 billion)
next year if the plan succeeds, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   In Soviet times, alcohol taxes amounted to about 25 percent of
the federal budget. Today, the figure is around 2 percent to 4
percent, officials say. About half the alcohol consumed in Russia _
mostly vodka _ goes untaxed, according to government estimates.

Officials' cool to swimmers charges of widespread doping in sport
</HEADLINE>
after hearing &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KASSEL, Germany (AP) _ The two world-class swimmers who charged
performance-enhancing drugs were rife throughout the sport
expressed dismay Friday at German officials' lack of action after a
special hearing.
	   German swim and sports officials questioned Chris-Carol Bremer
and Mark Warnecke for three hours about their claims last week that
EPO and testosterone were in widespread use in the sport.
	   But following the hastily called meeting, the officials declined
to commit themselves to specific action, expressed doubts about the
swimmers' claims or said they should have named names.
	   ``I'm disappointed. I wish there had been some concrete
statements offered,'' said Bremer, bronze medalist at the 1994
World Championships.
	   ``Nothing will change in my active career. This (problem) will
go on forever,'' the visibly disappointed swimmer added.
	   Bremer and Warnecke caused a stir with their statements on
Germany's ARD Television last Sunday that the banned sustances were
systematically used in measured doses to be nearly undetectable.
	   ``You'll find testosterone and EPO in the pockets of swimmers
everywhere in the world,'' Warnecke, an Olympic bronze medalist,
said in the interview.
	   ``With the help of a good sports doctor, you can regulate it so
that someone is doped the entire year. When it's done right, it
can't be detected at any testing,'' Warnecke added.
	   Bremer, who echoed those statements of TV, said he hoped at the
meeting that the German Swim Federation and German Sports
Federation would take a lead role in cleaning up the sport.
	   But Ruediger Tretow, president of the German Swim Federation,
said the two athletes should have named names.
	   He also believes few swimmers are being administered banned
substances in measured amounts that allow them to slip just under
testing limits.
	   ``I don't believe that doping takes place in that way. In a gray
zone that's certainly possible, but even then in a relatively small
amount (of cases),'' said Tretow.
	   After they made their charges last week, Bremer and Warnecke
drew the cautious support of Harm Beyer, chairman of the
anti-doping commission of FINA, swimming's world governing body.
	   Beyer said there were ``too many hints'' to dismiss the claims,
saying he heard deep voices, saw acne and noticed dramatic
improvements in times in swimming pools at competitions.
	   All are indications banned substances are being used to boost
performances.
	   The sport has been rocked by numerous doping scandals recently.
Four Chinese swimmers were banned at January's World Championships
in Perth, Australia. Three-time Olympic gold medalist Michelle
Smith of Ireland was also suspended in August after tampering with
a urine sample.
	   Another top German swimming official said he couldn't understand
the two swimmers' disappointment after the hearing, saying their
charges were too vague.
	   ``One can only be really active when things are concrete,'' said
Sven Baumgarten, vice-president of the swim federation.

Greek warplanes, vessels in Cyprus war games

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Greek warplanes and navy vessels Friday
joined the Cypriot military on the fourth day of joint military
exercises that have underlined the potential for conflict on this
war-divided Mediterranean island.
	   A total of 10,000 Greek Cypriot troops, including 8,000
reservists, tanks and helicopters are taking part in the six-day
war games, which will end Sunday.
	   ``Its an exercise that makes us all proud,'' said President
Glafcos Clerides whose government in the only internationally
recognized administration on the island.
	   The war games are held regularly with Greek forces under the
provisions of a 1993 defense pact between Cyprus and Greece. Four
Greek air force jets and five navy ships are taking part this time.
	   The exercises are aimed at sending a message to Turkey, which
invaded Cyprus in 1974 and occupied the northern third portion. A
breakaway Turkish Cypriot republic in the occupied area _
recognized only by Ankara _ was declared in 1983.
	   Cyprus' Greek and Turkish communities have been living apart
since the 1974 Turkish invasion and repeated efforts by the United
Nations and others to reunite the island have so far failed.
	   In the midst of the war games, Greece and Cyprus accused Turkish
warplanes of violating the Cypriot air space Tuesday and Thursday.
Turkey denied the charges.
	   Last March, tension rose on the island when Ankara dispatched
warplanes and navy vessels to northern Cyprus in response to the
use by Greek jets for the first time of a controversial air base
near the resort town of Paphos in western Cyprus.
	   In Friday's exercises, Greek navy vessels blasted mock targets
off the waters of the Mediterranean south of the island, while
Greek Cypriot troops used live ammunition and fired
ground-to-ground missiles.
	   Four Greek jets _ two F-16 fighter-jets and two A-7 Corsair
bombers _ later joined the fray, firing at mock ground targets.
	   It was the Greek air force's second day of involvement in the
exercises. The Cypriot authorities are not saying whether the Greek
jets are using the Paphos air base or not.
	   The Paphos facility, which was completed in February, was built
for the use of Greek warplanes since the Greek Cypriots don't have
an air force of their own.

Lab tests: Mercedes had no problems; collision with Uno confirmed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLAS MARMIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Long-awaited results of tests on Princess Diana's
Mercedes show the car had no technical problems, was going slower
than originally believed, and definitely brushed against a Fiat
Uno, sources close to the investigation said Friday.
	   The tests on the Mercedes, which have been conducted for the
past 13 months at a police lab outside Paris, have been seen as the
biggest piece of the puzzle still missing in the investigation into
Diana's death in a Paris traffic tunnel on Aug. 31, 1997.
	   Two sources, both of whom spoke to The Associated Press on
condition of anonymity, said the tests had been completed and will
be transmitted to Judge Herve Stephan on Nov. 2. They included both
crash tests and tests using a computer.
	   According to the sources, they showed that:
	   _ The Mercedes had no problems with its brakes, contrary to
reported testimony in the police record that car was precarious
when braking suddenly.
	   It also had no problems with its airbags, the sources said.
Investigators were believed to have been looking at whether the
front air bags may have inflated before the car struck the tunnel's
pillar _ perhaps as a result of the brush with the Uno.
	   _ That driver Henri Paul was only going at 100 kilometers per
hour (62 mph). That is much slower than initial reports speculated.
Still, it is twice the speed limit.
	   Paul, who was drunk at the time of the crash, was killed, as was
Diana's boyfriend, Dodi Fayed. The only survivor was bodyguard
Trevor Rees-Jones.
	   _ That the Mercedes, as has long been believed, did indeed have
a brush with a Fiat Uno before crashing. However, it is not known
to what extent the incident caused the crash.
	   Police have questioned almost 3,000 owners of Fiat Unos, but are
thought to have long ago given up hope of finding either the car or
the owner.
	   Judge Stephan will have to decide whether he now has enough
information to complete his investigation.
	   Still in limbo are the 10 paparazzi, under formal investigation
in the crash. It is believed that they will be cleared on the
manslaughter charge, but a few may be tried on the charge of
failing to aid people in danger.
	   The Mercedes was rented by the Ritz Hotel from the Etoile
Limousine company. The Ritz, where Diana and Dodi Fayed dined that
night, is owned by Mohamed Al Fayed _ Dodi's father.
	   Before concluding the investigation, Stephan has several other
elements to consider, including a report on the level of carbon in
the driver's blood, a report on the exact causes of death of the
victims, as well as a suit by Rees-Jones against the Ritz and
Etoile Limousine, claiming they endangered the lives of others by
failing to provide a licensed chauffeur.
	   The main causes of the crash are still believed to be
drunkenness and speed.
	   Repeated blood tests found Paul was heavily drunk at the time of
the crash. That, and even a speed of 100 kph (62 mph) into curving
tunnel, created a highly dangerous mix.

	    &UR; Vlasic to introduce 'world's largest pickle'
	   CHERRY HILL, New Jersey (AP) _ Vlasic Foods International plans
to introduce a giant pickle that it claims is the world's largest:
10 times larger than an ordinary pickle.
	   The chip-shaped pickle measures 16 inches (41 centimeters) long
and 3 inches (8 centimeters) in diameter and will cover an entire
hamburger, guaranteeing a pickle piece in every bite, Vlasic said
Monday.
	   The company spent the past four years developing the new pickle,
``Hamburger Stackers.'' The pickle is made from specially
cultivated cucumbers grown by the Cherry-Hill based food giant.
	   Vlasic spokesman Kevin Lowery said cucumbers used for the
pickles were specially grown for size, taste and crispness.
Cucumbers that size grown with traditional methods would have the
texture of a watermelon and would not be ideal for making pickles,
he said.
	   The pickle was secretly developed under the code name, ``Project
Frisbee.'' It was the brainchild of Frank Meczkowski, who created
Vlasic's ``Sandwich Stackers,'' a broad flat pickle, in 1995.
	   Only 3 percent of the 35 billion sandwiches consumed at home
each year have a pickle, Vlasic estimates. However, two-thirds of
all pickles are consumed with a sandwich.
	   This time Vlasic is targeting hamburger consumers. The company
estimates Americans eat 3.5 billion hamburgers annually.
	   The product has a ``peck of pickle profit potential,'' Lowery
said. The company estimates it could generate at least dlrs 20
million in sales annually.
	   Hamburger Stackers will sell for dlrs 2.99 and will be available
in two varieties: dill and bread and butter. The new pickles will
hit retail shelves next week.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   Use facts from the story to complete the following statements:
	   1. Vlasic Foods International -
	   a) created a giant pickle.
	   b) recently moved to Cherry-Hill, N.J.
	   c) is the world's largest company.
	   2. Most of the sandwiches eaten at home each year -
	   a) cost about $2.99 to prepare.

	   c) do not include a pickle.
	   3. ``Hamburger Stackers'' are supposed to be -

	   4. The huge pickles -
	   a) were invented in 1995.
	   b) taste like watermelon.
	   c) are made from cucumbers.
	   5. Vlasic probably kept its new product a secret because the
company -
	   a) wanted to be the first to sell giant pickles.
	   b) was afraid that no one would buy the food.
	   c) didn't want the crispy chips to be tossed around.
	   6. ``Project Frisbee'' -
	   a) took four years to complete.
	   b) resulted in the loss of billions of dollars.
	   c) was carried out by very smart children.
	   7. One jar of the new creation probably contains -
	   a) both varieties (kinds) of the product.
	   b) many slices of over-sized pickles.
	   c) 10 whole cucumbers.
	   8. According to the story, each pickle slice -
	   a) measures 3 inches (8 centimeters) in diameter.
	   b) taste best when eaten in a single bite.
	   c) both a and b are correct.
	   9. Another company specialty, ``Sandwich Stackers,'' -
	   a) was invented by Frank Meczkowski.
	   b) will be replaced by ``Hamburger Stackers.''
	   c) is made from a fat pickle.
	   10. Company spokesman Kevin Lowery believes that -
	   a) Vlasic needs to change the name of the food.
	   b) consumers usually eat pickles by the peck.
	   c) the new product will be a best seller.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   SANDWICH CHEF:
	   Imagine that Vlasic held a sandwich-making contest. Enter the
contest by inventing a crazy sandwich that would go well with a big
pickle. Write a description of your concoction. Include a list of
ingredients. Have you created a sandwich sensation?

<TEXT>
	   JACKSON, Mississippi (AP) _ Heavyweight champion Evander
Holyfield said Friday that Mike Tyson is not in his boxing future
right now. However, Holyfield acknowledged that could change if
fans want a rematch.
	   Tyson got back the license taken from him for biting Holyfield's
ears in a championship fight 15 months ago.
	   Holyfield again said the Nevada Athletic Commission decision
this week was the right one, but added, ``I can't say he learned
his lesson; time tells that.''
	   Holyfield, the WBA and IBF champion, said he expected to unify
the title when he fights WBC titleholder Lennox Lewis in late
February or early March.
	   ``Then, I would be the undisputed champ of the world. I guess
after that I would see how bad the people want me to fight Mike
Tyson,'' Holyfield said.
	   Holyfield said having another Tyson fight would not be decided
by how much he might want a rematch.
	   ``I've already beat him twice. So, it's not how bad I want to
beat him, but how bad the people want me to fight him,'' he said.
	   Holyfield said Lewis is ``the wanted man now.''
	   ``We're both on contract to fight. The people will get an
opportunity to see who is really the best,'' Holyfield said.
	   Holyfield said he will continue to fight as long as he does
well.
	   The 35-year-old champion was in Jackson with Florida attorney
Willie Gary to present computers and a dlrs 100,000 check to the
Mississippi Schools for the Deaf and Blind.
	   Kenneth Carpenter, a 16-year-old wrestler on the School for the
Deaf team, told Holyfield he was ready to fight him.
	   ``I'll be free in December,'' the youth told the incredulous
Holyfield while getting an autograph.
	   He looked over the teen-ager, who stood about chest high to
Holyfield, and said, ``You really want to fight me? I'll think
about it.''

Two prominent Nevada boxing commissioners reappointed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ Two long-serving Nevada boxing commissioners,
who both voted earlier this week to allow Mike Tyson to return to
the ring, have been reappointed to new three-year terms.
	   The reappointments of Nevada Athletic Commission chairman Dr.
Elias Ghanem and commissioner Luther Mack were announced Friday by
Gov. Bob Miller.
	   Miller spokesman Gordon Absher said the timing of the
reappointments was coincidental and occurred only because the terms
of the two men expire on Oct. 31.
	   ``The governor feels very strongly they have represented the
state through some tough and interesting times,'' Absher said.
	   Both Ghanem and Mack have played influential roles on the
commission, voting last year to revoke Tyson's boxing license and
fine him dlrs 3 million for biting Evander Holyfield's ears.
	   On Monday, they both voted to return Tyson's license, while
warning him that another violation would result in the former
heavyweight champion never fighting in Nevada again.
	   ``The last year and a half particularly, the eyes of the global
public at large, and not just the sports world, have been focused
on Nevada's Athletic Commission,'' Miller said. ``Throughout this
trying time, Elias Ghanem and Luther Mack have been credible,
professional assets to this commission. Through their long-term
service, they have helped it emerge as the best in the boxing
world.''
	   Ghanem, a Las Vegas doctor, was originally appointed to the
commission in 1987. Mack, operator of a string of McDonald's
restaurants in Reno, was appointed in 1989.

Elections to key Iranian assembly apparently marred by low turnout

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's official media boasted about a huge
turnout in elections Friday for the council that oversees the
country's supreme leader. But many polling stations were nearly
empty in Tehran, the capital and largest city and where some voters
complained that hard-line clerics had already decided the outcome.
	   State-controlled Tehran radio reported ``unprecedented and
unique'' voting levels for the 86-member Assembly of Experts.
	   The radio said long lines of voters queued at polling stations
across the country, and electoral officers expected to run out of
ballot papers.
	   But correspondents who visited a dozen polling stations around
the capital found turnout to be minimal. Only two polling stations
had voters waiting in line.
	   The electoral authorities twice extended closing the polls for a
total of three hours. Interior Minister Abdolvahed Lari also said
late voters would not be turned away.
	   Candidate Majid Ansari, a moderate cleric, blamed the low
turnout in Tehran on the lack of choice as most of the 167
candidates _ all clergymen _ were hard-liners. The candidates were
selected by a Council of Guardians that is controlled by
conservatives.
	   ``Unfortunately, the procedures were such that competition was
limited and a group of revolutionaries were prevented from taking
part in the elections,'' Ansari told The Associated Press.
	   Ordinary people were blunt about their reason for boycotting the
polls.
	   ``It makes no difference. They have already selected the people
they want to put in the assembly,'' said Siavash Mohseni, 24, a
university student who didn't vote.
	   A young woman who gave only her first name, Arezou, said she was
also alienated from the polls.
	   ``The behavior of the Council of Guardians was very insulting
because they did not give us a chance to choose the candidates of
our choice,'' she said.
	   Although voting was supposed to be secret, there were no private
booths for voters and it was easy to see whom a person voted for.
	   An election observer in western Tehran said many voters had cast
empty ballot papers and many more had voted for supporters of the
moderate President Mohammad Khatami.
	   However, a voter in Tehran's Enqelab Square, Saeid Kazami, 41,
said he had cast his ballot mainly for hard-line candidates because
they ``are protectors of the (Islamic) revolution.''
	   ``We know that the revolution will have no problem if they are
in charge,'' he said.
	   Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, a hard-liner, has
the final say in government, and conservative clerics want to keep
it that way. But moderate clerics, led by Khatami, are calling for
a more accountable leader.
	   Khatami's efforts to ease the revolution's social, political and
media restrictions are popular. But they are opposed bitterly by
hard-liners who are loathe to give up control of key institutions
such as the judiciary and the security agencies.
	   Khatami urged people to vote after casting his ballot at the
Husseinieh Jamaran mosque in northern Tehran.
	   ``Definitely, there could have been more qualified people than
were allowed, but nonetheless we still have a chance to choose our
favored candidates,'' Khatami told reporters.
	   Official results are not expected until Saturday, and Tehran's
results could be announced as late as Sunday, electoral authorities
said.

D'Alema wins confidence vote in Italian Chamber of Deputies

 &UR; EDS: LEADS to add Ciampi quotes on job creation &QL; 
 &UR; With AP Photos &QL;

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema on Friday won the
required vote of confidence in the Chamber of Deputies for his new
government, the first to include Communists in a half-century.
	   The vote on the center-left coalition, Italy's 56th government
since World War II, was 333 in favor and 281 against, with three
abstaining.
	   The premier was expected to easily win next week's confidence
vote in the upper chamber, the Senate.
	   D'Alema has promised to pursue the strict economic policies
imposed by his predecessor Romano Prodi, which allowed Italy to
qualify for Europe's single currency.
	   Treasury and Budget Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, who stayed
over from the previous government led by Romano Prodi, indicated
D'Alema continued to keep on healing Italy's economy.
	   Ciampi said in an interview for RAI state TV that the government
over the next years -- its full term runs out in 2001 -- could
create 650,000 new jobs.
	   Italy's unemployment runs 12.5 percent nationally and nearly
double that in the south.
	   During debate before the vote, Italy's center-right opposition
forces, led by former Premier Silvio Berlusconi, promised a fierce
battle against D'Alema, a former Communist.
	   Berlusconi's Freedom Alliance called supporters to march in
protest in Rome on Saturday.
	   The opposition contends that D'Alema's coalition, which ranges
from a small centrist party of former Christian Democrats now loyal
to ex-president Francesco Cossiga to Communists holding ministry
posts for the first time in five decades, fails to respect the
choices made by voters in the 1996 elections.
	   Many of the centrist deputies were elected to Parliament in 1996
on the center-right Freedom Alliance ticket, not on the center-left
Olive Tree group which proposed economist Prodi as premier.
	   D'Alema would like to have as broad as support as possible to
pass the 1999 budget as well as to revive efforts to
constitutionally reform Italy's bureaucratic institutions and an
electoral system that rewards small parties and feeds the country's
chronic government instability.
	   ``This government was born for reforms, constitutional and
electoral,'' D''Alema said, pitching for the confidence vote.
	   Prodi's 2 1-2 year-old coalition, Italy's second longest-lasting
since the end of the war, collapsed after some Communists, then
outside the government but usually supportive of Prodi, refused to
back the government in a confidence vote Oct. 9 over what they said
was not enough action to create jobs.
	   D'Alema won the vote on the eve of his first international
appearance as premier. He was expected in Austria for a European
Union summit Saturday.

U.N. chief hopes Mideast accord will lead to comprehensive peace
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan welcomed
the Middle East peace agreement Friday and expressed hope that it
will lead to a comprehensive peace agreement for the region.
	   ``I am delighted at the news that the impasse in the Middle East
peace process has finally been broken,'' he said in a statement.
	   Annan, who is visiting South Korea, congratulated Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
``for having had the courage to make the compromises necessary for
peace.''
	   And he paid tribute to U.S. President Bill Clinton, King Hussein
of Jordan ``and all those who put in so much effort to make this
achievement possible.''
	   ``I hope that this will lead to renewed efforts to conclude a
comprehensive peace for the region as a whole,'' Annan said.
	   Under the deal announced Friday afternoon, the Palestinians
would eliminate anti-Israel provisions in their founding charter
and the Israelis would cede 13 percent more of the territory on the
West Bank of the Jordan River and free 750 alleged political
prisoners, U.S. and Palestinian officials said.

Yankees treated to parade following World Series triumph

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The crowd roared, confetti poured and the World
Series Champion New York Yankees _ including ailing teammate Darryl
Strawberry _ made their way up Manhattan's Canyon of Heroes.
	   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Yankees manager Joe Torre were on the
lead float, but the crowd reserved its biggest cheers Friday for
Strawberry, who is recovering from colon cancer surgery and missed
the Series' four-game sweep of the San Diego Padres.
	   Chants of ``Darryl! Darryl!'' echoed in the skyscraper-lined
canyon, as fans with blue and white painted faces, waving signs
reveled in a blizzard of shredded paper as Strawberry rode past
them in a red classic Cadillac.
	   The entire day was emotional for pitcher Orlando ``El Duque''
Hernandez, who smiled and waved from the Yankees pitchers' float.
Hours earlier, Hernandez was reunited with his mother, two
daughters and ex-wife when they arrived from Cuba at about 3 a.m.
	   It was the first time he had seen them since he defected from
Cuba in December on a raft. The Cuban government granted the family
a temporary visa so they could attend the parade.
	   No crowd estimate was immediately available but hundreds of
thousands stood 10 to 40 deep along the mile-long (1.6-kilometer)
parade route from Battery City Park to City Hall.
	   ``Jeter! Jeter!'' teen-aged girls squealed, waving signs
proposing marriage as Yankee heartthrob Derek Jeter passed by.
Pitcher David Wells and catcher Jorge Posada obviously wanted to
preserve the memory by videotaping the crowd as the crowd filmed
them.
	   Brooms of all sizes and shapes _ kitchen brooms, garage brooms,
whisk brooms _ were in evidence, signifying the Yankees four-game
sweep of the San Diego Padres in the World Series.
	   At City Hall, where the mayor presented the players the keys to
the city, trees were draped in paper streamers and confetti and the
stage adorned in a rainbow of red, white and blue balloons.
	   The record-breaking 1998 Yankees won 125 games this season,
including the playoffs and World Series, more than any other team
in U.S. Major League Baseball history. It was the team's 24th World
Series win _ also a record.
	   The celebration _ the second parade for the Yankees in three
years _ began at Battery Park shortly before noon.
	   The march included 13 marching bands; 10 classic cars; eight
Yankee floats; seven double-decker buses, six press trucks _ and
the Radio City Rockettes on a flatbed truck.
	   The floats carried the team, coaches and support crews while the
Yankee wives, children and politicians rode in double-decker buses.
World Series Most Valuable Player Scott Brosius had his own float.

Greens torn by strife on eve of joining German government
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. UPDATES and RECASTS with Greens leader calls for reform
of party. &QL; 
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany's Greens are about to join the
government, but not without the kind of squabbling dear to the
former protest party since its founding 18 years ago.
	   After last month's election victory by the Social Democrats,
Greens leaders swiftly grasped power at the national level for the
first time, sealing a coalition pact after surprisingly smooth
negotiations.
	   Both parties are expected to ratify the deal this weekend at
special conventions in Bonn, clearing final hurdles for Germany's
first left-leaning government in 16 years.
	   While the Social Democrats' vote is likely to go smoothly, many
Greens members are upset that Schroeder nixed radical goals such as
a sharp hike in gasoline taxes and a timetable for scrapping
nuclear power.
	   Reflecting queasiness among party activists, the three Greens
tapped for Cabinet posts faced accusations Friday that they are
amassing power.
	   Still, Greens leaders expected delegates to back the coalition
Saturday as the best deal they could get as junior partner.
	   Party co-chair Gunda Roestel opened their meeting Friday with a
plea to some 750 delegates to reconcile their anti-establishment
roots with the chance to govern Europe's biggest nation.
	   ``Assuming you approve, a new chapter in postwar German history
will start Monday,'' she said. ``This new chapter will bear Green
handwriting.''
	   ``Of course we had to swallow things we didn't like,'' she said.
But, she added, ``this is a chance for our party to grow into a new
role.''
	   The biggest controversy could be set off by delegates who argue
that Trittin and the two other future Greens ministers are acting
too much like mainstream politicians in insisting that they also
hold on to their seats in parliament.
	   Designated foreign minister Joschka Fischer, the most prominent
Greens leader, has already hinted he'll turn down the Cabinet post
if delegates vote Saturday to bar the dual role.
	   Touching indirectly on the topic, Trittin told delegates Friday
that the Greens must modernize their approach to power now that
they will no longer be an opposition party.
	   He said the Greens, founded in 1980 by pacifists, anti-nuclear
activists and feminists, need to make ``a new political start.''
	   Denying Green ministers a foot in parliament would weaken the
party compared to the Social Democrats, Trittin said earlier.
	   But Peter Swane, the party's leader in Schleswig-Holstein state,
kept up pressure on the future Cabinet members.
	   ``I know from talking with many colleagues in the national party
that this issue is a very sensitive point,'' he said on German
radio. ``This topic is almost more important than some points that
may be controversial in the coalition agreement.''
	   Schroeder is to be sworn in Tuesday, a day after the new
parliament convenes.
	   Social Democrats and Greens have promised shifts on several
fronts. Chief projects are to work toward shutting down nuclear
plants, cut taxes for people with low and medium incomes, and allow
more foreigners to become citizens.

	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Command of the NATO-led
force charged with maintaining the peace among Bosnia's Serbs,
Muslims and Croats changed hands Friday.
	   U.S. Gen. Montgomery Meigs took over from U.S. Gen. Eric
Shinseki as head of the force guarding the peace laid out in the
1995 Dayton accords. In the 15 months under Shinseki, the troops
successfully oversaw three elections and arrested several
war-criminals.
	   Some 36,000 troops from 40 countries and stationed across the
country make up the NATO-led force.
	   Deputy NATO Secretary General Sergio Balanzino flew in from NATO
headquarters in Brussels to attend Friday's handover ceremonies in
Sarajevo and present Shinseki with a medal for his services.
	   Balanzino was standing in for NATO Secretary-General Javier
Solana, who was called away to a meeting in Brussels.
	   Shinseki knows his successor since they fought together in
Vietnam. It was Meigs who found himself at outgoing general's
bedside after his second injury back then to donate blood, Shinseki
said.
	   ``Monty, God bless and best wishes for a great ride,'' he told
his successor, as he handed over the flag.
	   Before departing Shinseki thanked everyone _ foreigners and
Bosnians alike _ who helped make his mission a success.
	   Those who oppose Dayton will not last long and continuing the
war by other means will not work, Shinseki said.
	   ``Mark my words ... the rule of law is coming,'' he said. ``Each
successful election will change the face of government here
forever.''

Germany's railway chairman faces strong criticism
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Criticism of the head of the German
railway grew Friday as the incoming railway union chief blamed
chairman Johannes Ludewig's management style for poor morale, and a
Greens lawmaker called for a new rail chief.
	   ``The business won't become a success with his style of
leadership,'' said Norbert Hansen, designated chairman of the
railway workers union. Greens lawmaker Albert Schmidt said it was
time for a change in top management at the national railway.
	   The criticism adds to pressure on Ludewig. Several members of
Deutsche Bahn AG's managing board recently have threatened to quit
unless he goes.
	   Ludewig hit back at the criticisms in Friday's edition of
Munich-based Sueddeutsche Zeitung, saying the June crash of an
express train in Eschede, in which 101 people died, was the reason
for the massive drop in income this year.
	   The crash caused a profits drop of between 100 million and 150
million marks (dlrs 61 million and dlrs 92 million), the newspaper
quoted Ludewig as saying.
	   Deutsche Bahn didn't immediately confirm the contents of the
report, but a spokesman defended Ludewig, citing constructive talks
with union leaders that led to an extension last week of job
guarantees for workers.
	   The union says morale is low among the railway's 30,000 train
drivers, who are clocking up record overtime and can't keep to
timetables. In addition, customers are getting badly looked after,
they say.
	   They blame Ludewig for creating expectations among travelers
that trains would resume normal schedules faster than was possible
following the crash, and for not making clear that the cause of the
crash was the failure of a wheel produced by private company _ not
the railway itself.

European Commission president favors extradition of Pinochet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHANNA TUCKMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with report on Chilean TV that Pinochet reacted calmly
to news of his situation &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Europe's top official said Friday that he
hoped former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet would be extradited
to Spain to be tried for crimes committed during his 17-year rule.
	   ``Sometimes it should be made clear that crimes, wherever they
take place, cannot be left unpunished,'' European Commission
President Jacques Santer said.
	   Pinochet was detained by British police in London on Oct. 16 by
request of a Spanish magistrate as a first step toward his
extradition to stand trial for genocide and terrorism.
	   ``The dictatorship caused great suffering and sent many citizens
into exile,'' Santer said, referring to the 1973-90 Pinochet
regime.
	   Santer was speaking to reporters in the northern Spanish city of
Oviedo where he was due to receive the Prince of Asturias Prize for
social science _ one of the eight annual prizes named after the
heir to the Spanish throne.
	   Meanwhile, a Spanish newspaper reported Friday that Pinochet is
not fully aware of his predicament.
	   Daily El Mundo said the ailing retired general's family and
aides have been shielding him from the details for fear he would
fly into a rage that would kill him.
	   Pinochet was detained in the London clinic while recovering from
back surgery. El Mundo said its reporter accompanied Chilean
politicians seeking his release during a visit to the clinic
Thursday.
	   The reporter said he talked briefly to Pinochet's wife, Lucia
Hiriart, and daughter Veronica.
	   ``If Augusto knew the truth, he would have an attack of rage and
die,'' El Mundo quoted Hiriart as saying to others while waiting
for permission from Scotland Yard to visit her husband on the
eighth floor of the clinic.
	   She said she was particularly concerned because he is also
suffering from a urinary infection, heart problems and diabetes,
the newspaper reported.
	   El Mundo reported that the family had asked police guards to
stand outside the former dictator's room and keep out of sight. The
paper said the room lacked television, radio or telephone.
	   According to the report Pinochet was informed of the arrest
order from two policemen, but is convinced it was a mistake and
that he is protected by diplomatic immunity.
	   Meanwhile, a Chilean television station reported Friday that a
Chilean army officer close to Pinochet told the former military
chief about his situation after flying to London Thursday.
	   TV13 reported that the unidentified officer said Pinochet
reacted calmly to the news imparted ``as one soldier to another.''

Mexican soccer officials say tournament will go on without France
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ The Mexico 1999 Confederations Cup will go on
as planned despite the decision by world champion France to
withdraw from the tournament, Mexican soccer officials said Friday.
	   Enrique Borja, president of the Mexican soccer federation, said
at a news conference he expected the Jan. 8-20 FIFA tournament
would be held as scheduled with a top-flight European team
replacing the French.
	   ``We can't think about giving up,'' he said.
	   Borja said the Mexican soccer federation would wait until FIFA
president Joseph Blatter and UEFA president Lennart Johansson meet
this weekend in Glasgow, Scotland, before making any further
announcements.
	   Justino Compean, president of the local organizing committee,
said negotiations had begun with domestic sponsors so that they
would not pull out of the event.
	   ``Of course, we are very disappointed that France will not
come,'' he said. ``It was extremely important.''
	   The tournament was to have opened with a repeat of this year's
World Cup final, with France squaring off against the soccer-loving
Brazilians in the western city of Guadalajara.
	   But French internationals playing in European leagues would have
missed domestic matches if they played in Mexico.
	   FIFA's tournament of continental champions is considered
irrelevant and untimely by many European leagues.
	   Other teams participating in the tournament are Brazil, Mexico,
Bolivia, the United States, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and New Zealand.

	   LYON, France (AP) _ South African Wayne Ferreira pulled off the
biggest shock so far in the dlrs 750,000 Lyon Grand Prix on Friday
when he beat No. 2 seed Patrick Rafter, 6-4, 6-1.
	   Unseeded Ferreira, who beat Pete Sampras two weeks ago in Basel,
never looked back after breaking Rafter's serve in the first game
of the match.
	   In the second set, he raced to a 4-0 lead and continued to hit
winner after winner to gain a victory in one hour and ten minutes.
	   Rafter hit too many unforced errors and displayed unusually
patchy serving against Ferreira, the 1995 Lyon champion.
	   Ferreira, 27, had won four of the players' previous seven
meetings, including all three that were played on carpet.
	   ''When you play Patrick you know that he is going to come to the
net,'' the South African said. ''But I hit some great passing shots
and was very happy with my form.''
	   Ferreira, currently ranked 29, said he is getting back to his
best form after a serious ankle injury sustained last year.
	   Following Rafter's elimination and Sampras' withdrawal because
of a back injury, Marcelo Rios is favorite to take the Lyon title.
	   No. 3 seed Rios proved much too strong for 19-year-old French
wildcard Arnaud Di Pasquale, winning 6-4, 6-0.
	   Roared on by a partisan crowd, world junior champion Di Pasquale
competed well in the first set, but the Chilean's dogged baseline
game soon proved too much for the Frenchman, who lost in 59
minutes.
	   ''I started a bit sloppily and wasn't serving too well but I
played better in the second set,'' Rios said after the match.
	   Rios, who has only played Sampras once, said that he hadn't
thought about facing the world No. 1. ''Injury is part of the game
and I just think one match at a time,'' he said.
	   In the semifinal, Rios will instead take on Germany's Tommy
Haas, who won a walkover after Sampras' withdrawal.
	   In a match of contrasting styles, Ferreira will take on Alex
Corretja in Saturday's second semifinal.

	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ In an apparent move to stifle Hamas
comment on the White House signing of the peace agreement,
Palestinian police on Friday detained journalists outside the home
of the group's leader, Sheik Ahmed Yassin.
	   The journalists had come to Yassin's home to seek reaction to
the signing ceremony. At first, the journalists were asked to leave
the area. They were then given police escorts and told to drive to

Prices fall in September, historic deflation in Brazil
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Consumer prices fell in September
for the third straight month, dropping 0.3 percent from August, the
government said Friday.
	   Prices dropped 1.1 percent in the third quarter, the Brazilian
Institute of Geography and Statistics said. It was the first
three-month period of deflation since the institute began measuring
consumer prices in 1979.
	   In the past 12 months inflation was 3.2 percent, the institute
said.
	   While deflation is a welcome change from the four-digit
inflation that wracked Brazil until 1994, some economists say
declining prices are a sign of coming recession.
	   Last month, Brazil's Central Bank raised interest rates to
nearly 50 percent in an attempt to slow the exodus of panicky
investors, convinced that Brazil would be the next victim of the
global financial meltdown.
	   The increase made credit inaccessible and slowed the economy to
a crawl. The government predicts growth in 1999 will be close to
zero.

Dominicans give honest honors to Sammy Sosa

Sports-Baseball-Honoring Sosa &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Sammy Sosa received his
nation's highest honor Friday and had the winter baseball season
dedicated to him as Dominicans set aside their cares for the
national pastime of baseball.
	   Sosa mania still rules here in the aftermath of Hurricane
Georges, which killed about 300 people and left thousands homeless
on Sept. 22. His name, likeness and ``66'' _ the number of home
runs the Chicago Cubs outfielder launched this year _ appear on
T-shirts, car windows, caps, buttons, medals and other items.
	   President Leonel Fernandez awarded Sosa the Grand Cross of the
Order of Duarte, Sanchez and Mella at a National Palace ceremony.
He also named Sosa a ``Roving Ambassador to the Glory of Sport''
for his Caribbean country.
	   ``Sammy's exploits last season in the Major Leagues merit this
and much more,'' Fernandez said.
	   ``I am so proud of the way my people have treated me,'' Sosa
said. ``I never thought that I could be the recipient of everything
you have done for me in the past few days.''
	   Sosa received a hero's welcome on Tuesday by thousands of
Dominicans on his return from the United States, where he had
raised funds for hurricane relief after the season. The winter
league season was dedicated to Sosa, who was to toss the first
pitch Friday night.
	   Although Sosa was the star, other Dominican big leaguers were
honored by Fernandez, including Moises Alou of the Houston Astros,
Raul Mondesi of the Los Angeles Dodgers, Alex Rodriguez of the
Seattle Mariners, Pedro Martinez of the Boston Red Sox, Vladimir
Guerrero of the Montreal Expos and Expos manager Felipe Rojas Alou.
	   Some vendors are calling Sosa ``Sammy Claus'' because his
popularity has produced a sales boom.
	   ``It's incredible,'' said Miguel Ogando, a street-corner T-shirt
salesman. ``Yesterday I sold more than 100 Sammy T-shirts and today
I've sold 40 and it isn't noon yet.''
	   Ogando said Sosa-related sales were outstripping souvenirs of
Pope John Paul II's 1992 visit to this predominately Catholic
country.
	   ``My home was badly damaged in the hurricane, but without him
knowing it, Sammy has allowed me to earn enough money to fix it,''
said Edgar de la Cruz, 34. He said he sold more than 200 medals
featuring Sosa.
	   In Sosa's hometown of San Pedro de Macoris, the baseball stadium
was destroyed by the hurricane, so the local Estrellas Orientales,
the Eastern Stars, will not play this year. The same goes for
another of the country's six teams, La Romana's Sugar Growers.
	   Residents say about 50 people would normally work at the San
Pedro stadium and others make a living by selling goods outside
during the season. The town also relies on sugar cane, but nearly
90 percent of that crop was wiped out by Georges.
	   ``We survive on hope,'' said 16-year-old Isaias Ozoria Torres.
``The only person who can help us now is God above.''
	   Sosa sent three planeloads of food and medical supplies to his
hometown, San Pedro provincial Mayor Sergio Cedeno said, pointing
out that he had received no government aid.
	   ``For being a humble person who has reached the hearts of many
people ... he's the best ambassador we could have,'' Cedeno said of
Sosa.

Turkish consul refuses to issue passport to Bavarian officials
</HEADLINE>
trying to deport youth &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ The Turkish consul general in Munich
refused Friday to issue a second passport for a 14-year-old Turkish
boy requested by Bavarian officials who want to deport the youth
because of his record as a juvenile delinquent.
	   Turkish Consul General Ali Yakital said he declined to issue the
passport at the request of the boy's parents. Yakital also said he
stamped the boy's original passport ``invalid,'' also at the
parents' request.
	   Bavarian officials' efforts to deport the boy, known only as
``Mehmet,'' became an election-year symbol for conservatives
demanding a crackdown on foreigners who commit crimes.
	   The Turkish consul's refusal to issue a new passport angered
Bavarian Minister Guenther Beckstein, who said the state's efforts
to deport the boy would not end there.
	   ``It can't be that applying German law on foreigners is
dependent on the desires of Turkish parents,'' Beckstein said. He
said that he would take the issue up with incoming Foreign Minister
Joschka Fischer.
	   Fischer is a leader of the Greens party, which has criticized
the deportation and pushed for an agreement with the Social
Democrats that will liberalize citizenship laws for German-born
foreigners under the new center-left government, which takes office
next week.
	   However, Beckstein insisted that when Fischer's oath of office
will require him to act in the interest of the Germans.
	   Mehmet is accused of committing more than 60 offenses, but has
been convicted of only one, beating up and robbing a 19-year-old
student in July with three German youths. The conviction carries a
one-year sentence, which legally allows deportation under German
law.
	   Bavarian officials also want to expel the parents, who have
lived in Munich for 30 years, arguing they have endangered society
by failing to properly raise their son.
	   Courts in Bavaria have blocked efforts so far to deport the
parents, but on Tuesday upheld the state's refusal to renew the
boy's residency permit.
	   The Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe said Thursday it was
reviewing the boy's case and would rule in the next few days.

Zimbabwe demonstrators burn flag, blockade mayor's office

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ City workers smashed windows at the
mayor's office and burned Zimbabwe's flag Friday to protest delays
in receiving their wages.
	   About 2,000 workers surrounded the headquarters of Mayor Solomon
Tawengwa in the capital, Harare, and threw rocks, deflated the
tires of city-owned vehicles, and set fire to garbage.
	   Scores of riot police arrived at the site but did not intervene,
and by nightfall, the crowd had dispersed. No injuries were
reported.
	   The riot, which came a day after the mayor announced that the
city had run out of money to pay the full wage bill, emphasized the
deterioration of services over past months in the capital of this
southern African nation.
	   The city had run relatively efficiently after the transition
from the white minority-dominated state of Rhodesia to Zimbabwe in
1980. But in recent weeks, the city government has been forced to
shut down water supplies to the suburbs after failing to pay for
pump maintenance services.
	   The national government was forced to intervene Thursday to pay
maintenance contractors who stopped work on the pumping system.
	   Tawengwa has drawn particular criticism because while basic
services ground to a halt he was building himself a mayoral mansion
for 30 million Zimbabwe dollars (dlrs 850,000). The mayor has
ignored calls for his resignation.
	   Earlier this year, strikes and riots were widespread in Zimbabwe
where financial instability has sent the currency plummeting.
Critics link worsening local services to corruption in the national
government, which appoints all local officials.

	   OSTRAVA, Czech Republic (AP) _ Andre Agassi rallied from a 0-4
deficit in the final set to beat Sweden's Thomas Johansson 6-7
(6-8), 6-4, 6-4 Friday and advance to the semifinals of the Czech
Indoor ATP tournament.
	   Seventh seed Thomas Enqvist beat fellow Swede Nicklas Kulti 6-3,
6-4, qualifier Wayne Black of Zimbabwe overpowered Martin Damm of
the Czech Republic 7-6 (7-3), 6-7 (8-10), 6-3, and Slovakia's Jan
Kroslak crushed Andrei Medvedev of the Ukraine 6-3, 6-0.
	   ``In the last six games of the final set I played some of my
best tennis this year,'' Agassi said after. ``I think I was pretty
lucky, too''.
	   If Agassi wins his match against Black on Saturday, he will be
assured a berth in the eight-member ATP Tour World Chanpionship to
be played in Hanover, Germany in November.

European Commission president favors extradition of Pinochet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES at end with report on Chilean TV that military officer
told Pinochet of his arrest. No pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHANNA TUCKMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Europe's top official said Friday that he
hoped former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet would be extradited
to Spain to be tried for crimes committed during his 17-year rule.
	   ``Sometimes it should be made clear that crimes, wherever they
take place, cannot be left unpunished,'' European Commission
President Jacques Santer said.
	   Pinochet was detained by British police in London on Oct. 16 by
request of a Spanish magistrate as a first step toward his
extradition to stand trial for genocide and terrorism.
	   ``The dictatorship caused great suffering and sent many citizens
into exile,'' Santer said, referring to the 1973-90 Pinochet
regime.
	   Santer was speaking to reporters in the northern Spanish city of
Oviedo where he was due to receive the Prince of Asturias Prize for
social science _ one of the eight annual prizes named after the
heir to the Spanish throne.
	   Meanwhile, a Spanish newspaper reported Friday that Pinochet is
not fully aware of his predicament.
	   Daily El Mundo said the ailing retired general's family and
aides have been shielding him from the details for fear he would
fly into a rage that would kill him.
	   Pinochet was detained in the London clinic while recovering from
back surgery. El Mundo said its reporter accompanied Chilean
politicians seeking his release during a visit to the clinic
Thursday.
	   The reporter said he talked briefly to Pinochet's wife, Lucia
Hiriart, and daughter Veronica.
	   ``If Augusto knew the truth, he would have an attack of rage and
die,'' El Mundo quoted Hiriart as saying to others while waiting
for permission from Scotland Yard to visit her husband at the
clinic.
	   She said she was particularly concerned because he is also
suffering from a urinary infection, heart problems and diabetes,
the newspaper reported.
	   El Mundo reported that the family had asked police guards to
stand outside the former dictator's room and keep out of sight. The
paper said the room lacked television, radio or telephone.
	   According to the report Pinochet was informed of the arrest
order from two policemen, but is convinced it was a mistake and
that he is protected by diplomatic immunity.
	   Meanwhile, a Chilean television station reported Friday that a
Chilean army officer close to Pinochet told the former military
chief about his situation Thursday after flying to London Thursday.
	   TV13 reported that the unidentified officer said Pinochet
reacted calmly to the news imparted ``as one soldier to another.''

Union leaves galvanized, next stop New York
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW with Friday's developments &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ There were 240 National Basketball Association
players at the largest gathering in their union's history. Next
week, the players promise an even larger showing in New York, where
collective bargaining talks will resume.
	   After a militant meeting at which conciliatory players like John
Stockton were shouted down, many players left town Friday with the
realization that their careers and paychecks probably won't be
resuming soon.
	   NBA deputy commissioner Russ Granik and union director Billy
Hunter spoke on the telephone and agreed to meet Wednesday when the
league's Board of Governors will be in New York for a two-day
meeting that begins Tuesday.
	   Hunter said the union would try to get all its members _ about
400 players _ to show up. The 240 who came to Las Vegas voted
unanimously to never accept a hard salary cap, Hunter said.
	   ``Every member of the union has a right to be present,'' Hunter
said. ``It doesn't mean they'll be involved in negotiations. But
it's important for them to be there and hear David Stern say he
wants a hard (salary) cap.''
	   There have been no negotiations since Oct. 13.
	   When the sides meet Wednesday _ a faceoff that could include
more than 500 people _ the lockout will be in its 120th day.
	   The owners, demanding cost certainty, want an absolute ceiling
on player salaries in the next collective bargaining agreement.
They had the right to seek a new labor agreement if the percentage
of revenues devoted to salaries exceeded 51.8 percent, and it
reached 57 percent in the 1997-98 season.
	   In their most recent proposal, owners asked that the percentage
be reduced to 52 percent in the 2000-01 season, 50 percent in
2001-02 and 48 percent in 2002-03.
	   The union has offered two methods to tighten the salary cap if
the percentage rises to 63 percent, as well as a ``tax'' on the
salaries of the highest-paid players.
	   According to several sources who attended Thursday's player
meeting, Stockton and teammate Jeff Hornacek were shouted down when
they tried to move the discussion from militant speeches to a
dialogue on what percentage of revenues the players could live
with.
	   ``Everybody could speak, the mike was open,'' Charles Barkley
said.
	   Among the most vocal players were Karl Malone and David
Robinson. Everyone paid the most attention when Michael Jordan
spoke, sources said.
	   ``I was not surprised to see Michael here,'' Barkley said.
``He's the most dominant guy in the league, and that shows how
unified we are.''
	   Shaquille O'Neal, Scottie Pippen and Kevin Garnett were among
the other high-profile players. Grant Hill, Allen Iverson and Penny
Hardaway were among the notable absentees.

<TEXT>
	   JACKSON, Mississippi (AP) _ Heavyweight champion Evander
Holyfield said Friday that Mike Tyson is not in his boxing future
right now. However, Holyfield acknowledged that could change if
fans want a rematch.
	   Tyson got back the license taken from him for biting Holyfield's
ears in a championship fight 15 months ago.
	   Holyfield again said the Nevada Athletic Commission decision
this week was the right one, but added, ``I can't say he learned
his lesson; time tells that.''
	   Holyfield, the WBA and IBF champion, said he expected to unify
the title when he fights WBC titleholder Lennox Lewis in late
February or early March.
	   ``Then, I would be the undisputed champ of the world. I guess
after that I would see how bad the people want me to fight Mike
Tyson,'' Holyfield said.
	   Holyfield said having another Tyson fight would not be decided
by how much he might want a rematch.
	   ``I've already beat him twice. So, it's not how bad I want to
beat him, but how bad the people want me to fight him,'' he said.
	   Holyfield said Lewis is ``the wanted man now.''
	   ``We're both on contract to fight. The people will get an
opportunity to see who is really the best,'' Holyfield said.
	   Holyfield said he will continue to fight as long as he does
well.
	   The 36-year-old champion was in Jackson with Florida attorney
Willie Gary to present computers and a dlrs 100,000 check to the
Mississippi Schools for the Deaf and Blind.
	   Kenneth Carpenter, a 16-year-old wrestler on the School for the
Deaf team, told Holyfield he was ready to fight him.
	   ``I'll be free in December,'' the youth told the incredulous
Holyfield while getting an autograph.
	   He looked over the teen-ager, who stood about chest high to
Holyfield, and said, ``You really want to fight me? I'll think
about it.''

Bremen earns late draw in Felix Magath's debut
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Felix Magath, hired to restore Werder Bremen's
former glory, had a successful debut Friday as his new club drew
against Hamburger SV.
	   Yuri Maximov scored with four minutes to play as visiting Bremen
pulled out the 1-1 tie against the Bundesliga's third-place club,
which hasn't been defeated in 12 home matches.
	   Borussia Dortmund, another German club trying to regain its
former prominence, earned a 2-2 away draw against SC Freiburg to
run its unbeaten streak to four matches.
	   Magath, who played in two World Cups for Germany, been signed by
last-place Bremen just 32 hours before kickoff for the match
against a club he coached from 1995 to 1997.
	   Magath benched several players for the draw, which moved the
team up a notch to 17th place, in his first match for Bremen. The
North German side won Bundesliga titles and the 1992 Cup Winners
Cup this decade.
	   The gamble didn't pay off until Maximov's late surprise goal as
Hamburg stung the club with Ghana's Anthony Yeboah's third season
score in the 58th minute.
	   Dortmund, the 1997 Champions Cup winner, failed to pick up the
triumph when Tunisia's Zoubaier Baya fooled several defenders in
the 65th minute and shot the short-range equalizer.
	   He also put Freiburg up 1-0 in the 19th minute before Stephane
Chapuisat provided the evener with his 100th Bundesliga goal.
Alfred Nijhuis scored the second for Dortmund on a header.

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Authorities in Puerto Rico on
Friday found the body of a girl swept away a day earlier by
floodwaters, bringing the death toll to three caused by a tropical
wave across the Caribbean.
	   A month after Hurricane Georges stormed through the region,
killing hundreds and leaving thousands homeless, heavy rains
brought a reminder of September's suffering.
	   In Puerto Rico, flooding in the eastern part of the island
killed 66-year-old David Esquilin Hernandez when his car was washed
off a bridge. His wife, who was with him, survived.
	   In the east coast town of Yabucoa, authorities continued
searching for 4-year-old Mariana Medina Fernandez, who was swept
away by a flooded creek, along with two other girls who were
rescued.
	   A 5-year-old girl was killed on the eastern Caribbean island of
St. Lucia when a landslide buried three homes in the western
community of Vannard. More than 10 inches (25 centimeters) of rain
was reported on the island.
	   St. Lucia's crucial banana industry also suffered losses from
several days of rain and wind. Some farmers said Friday that as
much as 60 percent of their crops could be lost. St. Lucia was not
affected by Hurricane Georges.
	   On the island of St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands,
widespread flooding forced nine families to be evacuated from their
homes and all schools were closed Friday. The other Virgin Islands
were not as affected.

	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ The TV set in the Gaza City cafe
was turned on Friday to the nightly news, but most customers were
more interested in their gin rummy hands than in learning about the
new Mideast peace agreement.
	   The few who did watch the news said they doubted Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would actually carry out his promise
and withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   ``The news reports are so contradictory it makes us even more
skeptical the agreement will be implemented,'' said Salem Abed
Rabbo, a 36-year-old importer, as he puffed on a water pipe.
	   Just a half-hour's drive from Gaza City, in the squalid town of
Rafah, about 2,000 supporters of the Islamic Jihad group chanted:
``We will never accept the Washington solutions.''
	   About 20 Islamic Jihad supporters, swathed in the white shrouds
of suicide-bombers, burned Israeli and American flags.
	   As part of the agreement, the CIA will play a stronger role in
the Palestinian Authority's campaign against Islamic militants.
	   Sheik Ahmed Yassin, founder of the Islamic militant group Hamas,
said a new crackdown could perhaps restrict the activities of the
Hamas military wing temporarily but would not prevent attacks
against Israelis. ``It cannot erase Hamas,'' said Yassin.
	   Jewish settler leaders warned they would shut down the West Bank
on Sunday with street protests and would move their campaign to
topple Netanyahu into high gear.
	   The spokesman of the settlement movement, Aharon Domb, said
Netanyahu had surrendered to the Palestinians and the United
States. ``The reality is that the principle that for land they are
giving us peace and security ... is not happening,'' he said.
	   However, the news of the peace agreement came just a few hours
before the start of the Jewish Sabbath and settler leaders did not
have much time to organize their protest campaign.
	   Israel's dovish opposition pledged to back Netanyahu on the
peace accord and make sure he is not brought down by parliament
during the 12 weeks Israeli government spokesmen said Israel has
been allotted to withdraw troops from 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   The withdrawal means the Palestinians will have either sole or
shared control over about 40 percent of the West Bank.
	   At least a dozen hard-line coalition members have said they
would vote against a peace agreement in parliament, enough to rob
the prime minister of his parliamentary majority.
	   ``We will give him a safety net for the coming weeks,'' said
Yossi Beilin of the opposition Labor Party, one of the architects
of the 1993 breakthrough agreement between Israel and the
Palestinians.
	   Former Prime Minister Shimon Peres praised the agreement and
said it was proof that the path charted by him and his Labor
colleagues was the right one.

Arafat due in Austria to brief European leaders
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat will
brief European leaders on the West Bank land-for-peace accord
during a stopover Saturday in Austria on his way back from talks in
Maryland, the Austria Press Agency said.
	   Quoting the chancellor's office, APA said Friday that Arafat
would arrive around 1230 gmt Saturday in Klagenfurt and proceed to
the nearby mountain resort of Poertschach, where European leaders
are gathering for an informal European Union summit.
	   The agency said Austrian Chancellor Viktor Klima had won
agreement from the other EU leaders to invite Arafat to brief them
on the outcome of the talks at Wye Plantation in Maryland.
	   Arafat is expected to travel on to Cairo afterward to brief
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.

Officials' cool to swimmers charges of widespread doping in sport
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to fix style of slug &QL; 
after hearing &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KASSEL, Germany (AP) _ The two world-class swimmers who charged
performance-enhancing drugs were rife throughout the sport
expressed dismay Friday at German officials' lack of action after a
special hearing.
	   German swim and sports officials questioned Chris-Carol Bremer
and Mark Warnecke for three hours about their claims last week that
EPO and testosterone were in widespread use in the sport.
	   But following the hastily called meeting, the officials declined
to commit themselves to specific action, expressed doubts about the
swimmers' claims or said they should have named names.
	   ``I'm disappointed. I wish there had been some concrete
statements offered,'' said Bremer, bronze medalist at the 1994
World Championships.
	   ``Nothing will change in my active career. This (problem) will
go on forever,'' the visibly disappointed swimmer added.
	   Bremer and Warnecke caused a stir with their statements on
Germany's ARD Television last Sunday that the banned sustances were
systematically used in measured doses to be nearly undetectable.
	   ``You'll find testosterone and EPO in the pockets of swimmers
everywhere in the world,'' Warnecke, an Olympic bronze medalist,
said in the interview.
	   ``With the help of a good sports doctor, you can regulate it so
that someone is doped the entire year. When it's done right, it
can't be detected at any testing,'' Warnecke added.
	   Bremer, who echoed those statements of TV, said he hoped at the
meeting that the German Swim Federation and German Sports
Federation would take a lead role in cleaning up the sport.
	   But Ruediger Tretow, president of the German Swim Federation,
said the two athletes should have named names.
	   He also believes few swimmers are being administered banned
substances in measured amounts that allow them to slip just under
testing limits.
	   ``I don't believe that doping takes place in that way. In a gray
zone that's certainly possible, but even then in a relatively small
amount (of cases),'' said Tretow.
	   After they made their charges last week, Bremer and Warnecke
drew the cautious support of Harm Beyer, chairman of the
anti-doping commission of FINA, swimming's world governing body.
	   Beyer said there were ``too many hints'' to dismiss the claims,
saying he heard deep voices, saw acne and noticed dramatic
improvements in times in swimming pools at competitions.
	   All are indications banned substances are being used to boost
performances.
	   The sport has been rocked by numerous doping scandals recently.
Four Chinese swimmers were banned at January's World Championships
in Perth, Australia. Three-time Olympic gold medalist Michelle
Smith of Ireland was also suspended in August after tampering with
a urine sample.
	   Another top German swimming official said he couldn't understand
the two swimmers' disappointment after the hearing, saying their
charges were too vague.
	   ``One can only be really active when things are concrete,'' said
Sven Baumgarten, vice-president of the swim federation.

Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands from
the National Weather Service.
	   Scattered showers and isolated thunderstorms began to develop
once again over Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands this
afternoon. At the beginning most of the activity was concentrated
mainly over western Puerto Rico but by 4 p.m. the showers and
thunderstorms started to develop over the saturated areas of
eastern Puerto Rico and over the U.S. Virgin Islands. The winds
continued to be from the south to southeast at 10 to 15 mph.
	   Abundant moisture continued to flow northward across our area.
This moisture combined with local factors and an upper-level low
pressure center over the Hispaniola to produce the showers and
thunderstorms mentioned before. Since the grounds over our area are
already saturated, any additional rainfall will likely produce
widespread flooding. For this reason a flash flood watch continues
in effect for the U.S. Virgin Islands and for the east half of
Puerto Rico through this evening.

Schott tells baseball she will sell her Reds controlling shares
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CINCINNATI (AP) _ Marge Schott, majority owner of the Cincinnati
Reds since 1984, has told major league baseball that she will sell
her controlling share of the team to end her tenure as general
partner, it was announced Friday.
	   The June 12, 1996 agreement by which John Allen was appointed
the Reds' managing executive will be extended from Oct. 31 of this
year through Dec. 31 or until Schott sells her partnership shares,
whichever occurs first, baseball commissioner Bud Selig said.
	   Baseball officials had been considering extending Schott's 2
1/2-year suspension _ for making inflammatory remarks about
minorities _ from day-to-day operation of the Reds. Allen had been
running the team during Schott's suspension.
	   Schott has been general partner of the Reds under an ownership
agreement that continues through the end of 2000. Limited partners
of the Reds will now have an opportunity to buy her shares and take
control of the ballclub, which is hoping to move into a new,
taxpayer-financed stadium in Cincinnati by 2003.
	   ``I respect Mrs. Schott's decision and will do everything I can
to ensure a dignified and orderly transition,'' Selig said.
	   Schott did not return a telephone call to her office Friday
afternoon. There was no answer at her home telephone.
	   The Reds had nothing to add to Selig's statement, team spokesman
Rob Butcher said. Allen declined comment, through Butcher.
	   ``It's between major league baseball and Mrs. Schott,'' Butcher
said.

Faeroe Islands minister takes leave pending rape charge

investigation &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ A government minister on Denmark's
Faeroe Islands took temporary leave Friday pending investigation of
charges that he raped a teen-age girl.
	   Fisheries Minister John Petersen, 50, denies he raped a
17-year-old girl three years ago when she was living at his house.
No trial date has been set.
	   A member of the conservative Folkaflokkurin party, Petersen
began his second term as fisheries minister this year. His post is

New left-wing line-up seeks to tackle EU's problems

way back from Washington. No pickup. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   POERTSCHACH, Austria (AP) _ The new left-wing lineup of European
Union leaders gathers Saturday in an Austrian lakeside resort for a
weekend of brainstorming to map out the EU's future, but
here-and-now crises in Kosovo and the gl obal economy are sure to
intrude.
	   In addition, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat will brief
European leaders on West Bank land-for-peace accord during a
stopover Saturday in Austria on his way back from talks in the
United States, the Austria Press Agency said.
	   The opening day of the two-day summit marks the EU debut of
Germany's Social Democratic Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder, and
Italy's new Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema, a former Communist who
now heads the Democratic Left party.
	   Their arrival means all but four of the 15 EU governments are
headed by left-leaning prime ministers. Two others are coalitions
with socialists in top positions, and only in Ireland and Spain are
socialists in opposition.
	   Although some of the faces have changed, the problems facing the
EU leaders have a nagging familiarity:
	   _ How to maintain Europe's economic recovery and tackle
unemployment in the face of spreading international turmoil.
	   _ How to reduce Europe's dependence on the United States when
bloody conflicts flares up on the EU's doorstep.
	   _ How to streamline the EU's ponderous decision-making process
and make the EU more efficient ahead of next decade's planned
expand of the membership from 15 to 21.
	   Forecasts released by the EU this week show the crisis sweeping
though Asia, Russia and Latin America dragging growth in the
15-nation bloc down to 2.4 percent next year, from the previously
predicted 3 percent.
	   Although EU officials insist the slowdown will be temporary,
pressure is growing for government action to encourage growth by
increasing public investment or cutting interest rates to boost
business.
	   ``The competitiveness of our companies ... must be further
bolstered. The government intends to see to that,'' French Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin said this week in Paris. ``A decline in
interest rates is essential to that end.''
	   Schroeder and other Socialist leaders have also indicated rates
should be lower, but central bank governors have resisted calls to
cut, arguing rates in the EU's core economies, such as France and
Germany, are already among the world's lowest.
	   Jospin may have more success seeking support for a plan to raise
state funding for job-creating public-works projects. The outgoing
German administration of Chancellor Helmut Kohl quashed that idea
last time it came up, Schroeder may be more sympathetic.
	   Britain's Labor Prime Minister Tony Blair this week indicated he
may be prepared to drop the long-standing opposition of his
Conservative predecessors to giving the EU a military capability.
	   ``We need to allow fresh thinking in this, and it is important
for Britain to be part of this thinking,'' Blair was quoted telling
The Times of London.
	   His spokesman Alistair Campbell explained Blair wanted European
countries to be able to mount peacekeeping or combat operations to
deal with crises like Bosnia or Kosovo.
	   ``We could put together an operation with, say, France, Belgium,
Italy and Spain, in a way that meant we did not have to rely the
whole time on the Americans,'' Campbell said.
	   The leaders will also debate plans to raise the Union's
international profile by naming a permanent envoy to coordinate EU
foreign affairs, although nobody is likely to be appointed until a
December summit in the Austrian capital, Vienna.
	   As part of this role, APA said Friday that Arafat would arrive
Saturday in Klagenfurt and proceed to Poertschach to address the
gathering.
	   This weekend's summit was originally called to let leaders hold
an informal chat in a relaxed Alpine atmosphere on ways to overhaul
the EU, making it more efficient and more relevant to its 370
million citizens as it prepares to take on Poland, Hungary, the
Czech Republic, Cyprus, Estonia and Slovenia as new members over
the next few years.
	   ``Poertschach provides an excellent opportunity to relaunch the
debate on the future of the Union,'' said EU Commission President
Jacques Santer, in a letter to the leaders. ``Europe must rid
itself of its cliched image of an economic giant but political
dwarf.''

	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Greek warplanes and navy vessels Friday
joined the Cypriot military on the fourth day of joint military
exercises that have underlined the potential for conflict on this
war-divided Mediterranean island.
	   A total of 10,000 Greek Cypriot troops, including 8,000
reservists, tanks and helicopters are taking part in the six-day
war games, which will end Sunday.
	   ``Its an exercise that makes us all proud,'' said President
Glafcos Clerides whose government in the only internationally
recognized administration on the island.
	   The war games are held regularly with Greek forces under the
provisions of a 1993 defense pact between Cyprus and Greece. Four
Greek air force jets and five navy ships are taking part this time.
	   The exercises are aimed at sending a message to Turkey, which
invaded Cyprus in 1974 and occupied the northern third portion. A
breakaway Turkish Cypriot republic in the occupied area _
recognized only by Ankara _ was declared in 1983.
	   Cyprus' Greek and Turkish communities have been living apart
since the 1974 Turkish invasion and repeated efforts by the United
Nations and others to reunite the island have so far failed.
	   In the midst of the war games, Greece and Cyprus accused Turkish
warplanes of violating the Cypriot air space Tuesday and Thursday.
Turkey denied the charges.

	   OVIEDO, Spain (AP) _ A group of women honored Friday with one of
Spain's prestigious Asturias Prizes dedicated their award to Aung
San Suu Kyi, winner of a Nobel peace prize for her efforts to bring
democracy to Myanmar.
	   The seven women who shared the Asturias award for International
Cooperation were among a total 19 winners of this year's prizes
that are considered the Spanish-speaking world's closest equivalent
to Nobels.
	   One by one the winners were presented their awards by Crown
Prince Felipe of Asturias in this northern city.
	   The Social Science prize went to European Commission President
Jacques Santer and former Luxembourg premier Pierre Werner for
their contribution to setting in motion the European single
currency.
	   Santer, the younger of the so-called ``parents of the euro''
called on Europe to show the world that it should ``overcome the
(divisive) power of individual states through the higher ideal of
the power of trust.''
	   Europe's top official identified unemployment and internal
security as the most pressing issues facing the region.
	   This year's Arts award went to Brazilian photographer Sebastiao
Salgado, well known for his haunting depiction's of landless
peasants and exploited miners.
	   Spanish writer Francisco Ayala picked up the Literature prize,
while Spanish physicists Pedro Miguel Etxenike and Emilio Mendez
collected the Science prize.
	   German publisher Reinhard Mohn received this year's
Communication and Humanities prize that in 1997 went to CNN and
Czech Republic President Vaclav Havel.
	   Spain's young tennis star Aranxta Sanchez Vicario was awarded
the prize for achievement in sports.
	   Four men shared the Concord award _ Bangladeshi philanthropist
Mohammad Yunus, Spanish missionaries Vincente Ferrer and Nocolas
Castellanos and fellow countryman Dr. Joaquin Sanz Gadea.
	   European Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid Emma Bonino of Italy
spoke on behalf of the seven women honored for their contribution
to International Cooperation. The group also included the 1992
Nobel Peace Prize laureate Rigoberta Menchu of Guatemala, Fatiha
Boudiaf of Algeria, Olayinka Koso-Thomas of Nigeria, Graca Machel
of Mozambique, Fatana Ishaq of Afghanistan and Somaly Mam of
Cambodia.
	   Bonino called for ``less realism and cynicism'' in international
relations and ``more ethics, values, ideals and commitment''
	   The prizes include a check for 5 million pesetas (dlrs 35,000)
and an original sculpture by Spanish artist Joan Miro.
	   ``If there is one thing that unites all the winners it is the
ambition to do something lasting that helps others,'' Prince Felipe
said at the end of the ceremony.

	   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) _ Salvadoran police used tear gas
to break up a protest Friday by bus drivers angered by a police
crackdown. Five people were injured and dozens overcome by tear
gas.
	   About 50 buses blocked several streets in San Salvador, the
capital, to protest fines given to drivers for failing to stick to
routes approved by the Transportation Ministry. The buses were
towed away.
	   Drivers claimed officials hadn't informed them about route
changes before ticketing them.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Flooding on the Papaloapan river in the
eastern Mexican state of Veracruz has affected 800 families, but
most have refused to leave their homes, a government official said
Friday.
	   Pedro Jose Yepes, civil defense director in the municipality of
Alvarado, said only 500 people are staying in temporary shelters,
the government news agency Notimex reported. No injuries have been
reported.
	   Bad weather also has forced five ports to close in Veracruz
state, Notimex reported.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Brazilian airlines will ban smoking on
all national and international flights effective Friday, the
Department of Civil Aviation announced.
	   The ban was the result of a federal court order issued Thursday
in the southern city of Porto Alegre by judge Guilherme Pinho
Machado. The judge said the aim was ``to safeguard the health of
non-smokers.''
	   Until Friday, smokers were allowed to light up one hour after
takeoff in areas that were ``isolated and properly ventilated.''
But the department reversed itself, saying most airplanes do not
have such conditions.
	   ``Planes are not equipped with any physical barriers, separating
smokers from non-smokers,'' Machado said. ``Cigarette smoke spreads
out through the entire plane affecting the health of non-smokers.''
	   Airlines that disobey the order will be subject to a daily fine
of 50,000 real (dlrs 42,372).
	   ___ &QC; 
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Colombian police arrested a man police
described as a major figure in the reborn Cali cocaine cartel on
Friday.
	   Edgar de Jesus Fernandez was seized in an apartment in Medellin,
once the rival city of the Cali drug cartel, police said.
	   They said Fernandez is among a group of lower-profile drug
lords, many of them former mid-level traffickers, who assumed the
business after top Cali bosses Gilberto and Miguel Rodriguez
Orejuela were jailed in 1995.
	   Police also said Fernandez was wanted for extradition by the
United States. U.S. embassy and Colombian Foreign Ministry
officials contacted by The Associated Press said they were unaware
of any such request.
	   The newer generation of Cali drug traffickers are less notorious
and violent than the drug cartels that once terrorized Colombia.
But the flow of drugs to the United States has remained steady at
about 700 tons of cocaine a year, authorities say.
	   Colombia currently produces more than 80 percent of the cocaine
and much of the heroin sold on U.S. streets.

	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ The TV set in the Gaza City cafe
was turned on Friday to the nightly news, but most customers were
more interested in their gin rummy hands than in learning about the
new Mideast peace agreement.
	   The few who did watch the news said they doubted Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would actually carry out his promise
and withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   ``The news reports are so contradictory it makes us even more
skeptical the agreement will be implemented,'' said Salem Abed
Rabbo, a 36-year-old importer, as he puffed on a water pipe.
	   Just a half-hour's drive from Gaza City, in the squalid town of
Rafah, about 2,000 supporters of the Islamic Jihad group chanted:
``We will never accept the Washington solutions.''
	   About 20 Islamic Jihad supporters, swathed in the white shrouds
of suicide-bombers, burned Israeli and American flags.
	   Islamic Jihad organized the rally to mark the third anniversary
of the assassination of its leader, Fathi Shekaki. Shekaki was
gunned down outside a Malta hotel in an operation widely attributed
to Israel.
	   As part of the agreement, the CIA will play a stronger role in
the Palestinian Authority's campaign against Islamic militants.
	   Sheik Ahmed Yassin, founder of the Islamic militant group Hamas,
said a new crackdown could perhaps restrict the activities of the
Hamas military wing temporarily but would not prevent attacks
against Israelis. ``It cannot erase Hamas,'' said Yassin.
	   Jewish settler leaders warned they would shut down the West Bank
on Sunday with street protests and would move their campaign to
topple Netanyahu into high gear.
	   The spokesman of the settlement movement, Aharon Domb, said
Netanyahu had surrendered to the Palestinians and the United
States. ``The reality is that the principle that for land they are
giving us peace and security ... is not happening,'' he said.
	   However, the news of the peace agreement came just a few hours
before the start of the Jewish Sabbath and settler leaders did not
have much time to organize their protest campaign. Still, dozens of
Israeli settlers in the West Bank demonstrated Friday for the third
straight day.

China and Russia balk at U.N. resolution on Kosovo peace deal

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ China and Russia balked Friday at a
proposed Security Council resolution endorsing the Kosovo peace
deal, claiming it would give a green light for military action.
	   Russia submitted an alternate draft resolution which council
members were discussing informally, said British Ambassador Jeremy
Greenstock, the council's president.
	   ``We have broken up to have further group discussions and
exchanges between delegations, but the process is going forward,''
he said. The council was meeting again late Friday to continue the
Kosovo debate.
	   Russia and China have opposed any language threatening Serbs and
ethnic Albanians with force if they don't comply with the Oct. 12
agreement, which averted NATO strikes on Serb targets.
	   The Security Council is under pressure to adopt a resolution
enshrining the accord so a team to verify compliance can start
roaming Kosovo to ensure that fighting between Serbs and ethnic
Albanians has ceased.
	   Potential troop-contributing nations are concerned about safety
and want the council to endorse the plan first.
	   Under the deal brokered by U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke,
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic agreed to a cease-fire, to
withdraw his special police forces, and to allow a 2,000-strong
team to verify the agreement.
	   The United States and Britain have been pushing for a tough
resolution to put pressure on Milosevic to comply with the
agreement and intimate the consequences if he doesn't.
	   As permanent council members, Russia and China could veto any
new resolution.
	   Russia has religious and cultural ties to the Serbs, and Russian
lawmakers warned NATO Friday that airstrikes on Yugoslavia would
prompt Moscow to offer weapons to Serbs. China is traditionally
opposed to any military intervention into what it considers an
internal matter, fearing a precedent could be set for its own
disputes with Taiwan and Tibet.
	   After a council meeting which was supposed to be devoted to Iraq
but dealt exclusively with Kosovo, China's Ambassador Qin Huasun
told reporters that Beijing had ``difficulties in principle'' with
the initial draft resolution.
	   Diplomats said China and Russia objected to three paragraphs in
the proposed resolution which would give NATO the right ``to take
steps'' to ensure full implementation of the deal and to ensure the
safety of the verification team from the Vienna-based Organization
for Security and Cooperation.
	   The Russian draft calls instead on Yugoslavia and ethnic
Albanians ``to take appropriate steps'' to ensure that the
agreement is enforced and that the verification personnel are
protected.
	   The draft notes that the OSCE is considering arrangements for
evacuating personnel in the event of an emergency and says the
council ``stands ready to consider the endorsement of such
arrangements.''
	   Praising Milosevic's ``great efforts and concessions'' to
resolve the Kosovo question peacefully, Qin accused NATO _ without
naming it _ of unilaterally deciding without Security Council
authorization to take military action against Yugoslavia ``and
brutally interfere in the internal affairs of a sovereign state.''
	   China was prepared to accept ``a technical resolution'' to
endorse the Kosovo agreement, but not a resolution that might
authorize military action, he said.
	   Fighting between Serb forces and ethnic Albanians _ who make up
90 percent of Kosovo's population _ has killed hundreds of people
and forced around 300,000 from their homes since a Serb crackdown
began in February. Serbia is the largest of the two republics that
make up Yugoslavia.

No deal yet between IMF and Brazil
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MICHAEL ASTOR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ A bailout package between Brazil
and the International Monetary Fund has not yet been worked out, a
spokesman for IMF said Friday.
	   Francisco Baker said that the IMF and Brazil are still working
out the details of a budget cutting measures to qualify the country
for a rescue package reportedly worth about dlrs 30 billion.
	   The Fund's vice deputy managing director, Stanley Fischer,
arrived in Rio early Friday and met with Brazilian Fiance Minister
Pedro Malan, who left after a few hours without comment.
	   The talks about an aid package aimed at shoring up investor
confidence in Brazil continued between Fischer and lower-echelon
officials of the Brazilian Finance Ministry.
	   ``They didn't talk about numbers or money. It was a continuation
of the dialogue that began at the World Bank at the beginning of
October,'' Baker was quoted by the Estado news agency.
	   The talks were believed to hinge on what measures the Brazilian
government will take to reduce its ballooning budget deficit of
about dlrs 65 billion _ or some 7 percent of the country's gross
domestic product.
	   President Fernando Henrique Cardoso is expected to announce the
measures next week.
	   In Buenos Aires Thursday, Fischer spoke for the first time of
concrete figures saying he believed Brazil would need about dlrs 30
billion in emergency aid.
	   He also said the IMF would supply about half of that and the
money could be ready in about two weeks.
	   Fischer said that although there had been ``important advances''
the fund wanted to know exactly what the Brazilian government
intended to do with the money.
	   Brazilian papers reported Friday that the aid package would
consist of dlrs 15 billion from the IMF, dlrs 6 billion from the
U.S. Treasury and dlrs 4.5 billion each from the World Bank and the
InterAmerican Development Bank.
	   Private banks reportedly would not take part in the package.
	   Brazil has been especially hard hit by the economic turmoil
affecting emerging markets.
	   At the height of the crisis Brazilian stock exchanges lost
nearly three quarters of their value and the country has lost more
than dlrs 20 billion in foreign reserves.
	   Brazil's largest stock exchange, Sao Paulo's Bovespa, lost 4.4
percent Friday.
	   A crowd of reporters hung around outside the Finance Ministry in
Rio de Janeiro waiting for news throughout the day, but a spokesman
said that neither Malan nor Fischer would make any statements.
	   Fischer was to return to Washington Friday night.

	   THE VILLAGES, Florida (AP) _ It could be time to get the Dottie
Pepper punching bags out again.
	   Pepper, who angered the Europeans with her flamboyant displays
during the Solheim Cup last month, shot a 3-under-par 69 Friday to
take a three-stroke lead after two rounds of the Samsung World
Championship of Women's Golf.
	   Pepper's two-day score of 5-under 139 put her ahead of the
second-place group of Annika Sorenstam, Brandie Burton and
Liselotte Neumann.
	   Sorenstam shot 1-over 73 and Burton had an even-par 72. Neumann
carded the best round of the day, shooting 5-under 67 on a blustery
afternoon at the 6,326-yard (5,757-meter) Tierra Del Sol course.
	   Pepper is seeking her first tour victory in more than two years
in the dlrs 550,000 tournament.
	   But she has been a target since last month, when Europeans wrote
``Dottie Pepper'' on a punching bag _ then took their aggression
out on the bag _ after Pepper played to the home crowd in the
United States' victory over Europe in the Solheim Cup.
	   ``It's different emotions,'' Pepper said of playing for herself
and her country. ``But if I'm correct, we're not playing any
different game than we were a month ago. You still have a ball, tee
and club and you've got to go out there and play.''
	   Pepper opened the day tied with Sorenstam at 3-under. Pepper
bogeyed two of the first four holes, then gained one back by
hitting a 3-iron to two feet (0.6 meters) on the par-3 fifth hole
for a birdie.
	   She made three straight birdies on Nos. 14-16 to open a
four-stroke lead, then gave one stroke back with a bogey on 17.
	   Still, she headed into the weekend in position for her first
victory since the Safeway LPGA Golf Championship in September 1996.
	   ``It may not be right here, right now, this week, but I know my
time is coming,'' Pepper said. ``I'm hitting better golf shots than
I really ever have. On one side of the coin, it makes you patient.
On the other side, it makes you anxious because you're playing so
well.''
	   She's one of the few who can make that claim this week.
	   At 1-under, Juli Inskter was the only other player in the
16-woman field to finish below par after two rounds.
	   Karrie Webb and Helen Alfredsson each finished at even par. Se
Ri Pak shot 75 to finish at 3-over.
	   Sorenstam, the tour's money leader, said she let the steady 25
mph wind bother her as the round progressed.
	   ``You've got to be patient when it's windy like that,'' she
said. ``I had a good first 12 holes, but after that I didn't feel
like the momentum was there and I wasn't making the great putts
that I needed. I got anxious and pressed a little more than I
usually do.''
	   Most other players also struggled with the wind, with Neumann
standing out as one of the few exceptions.
	   After worrying too much over the conditions during an
opening-round 75, she forced herself to not let them bother her.
	   ``I think yesterday I was a little too careful,'' she said. ``It
was like I was trying to just hold onto what I was doing instead of
staying aggressive and focusing on the flag and going right at
it.''
	   Some good putting helped, too.
	   Seeking her first title since April, Neumann sank a birdie putt
on No. 5, a 25-footer (8 meters) on No. 10 and 15-footers (4.5
meters) on Nos. 6 and 8 to get back in contention.

Precede GAZA CITY

 &UR; Palestinians indifferent or skeptical about Mideast deal
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with reaction to White House signing
ceremony; changes byline &QL; 
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ For Osama Ghol, the Mideast peace
agreement signed Friday at the White House means he can see his
fiancee more often and get fresh fish for his restaurant.
	   The accord provides for a land route for the Palestinians
between the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Ghol's restaurant is in
the West Bank. His fiancee and the fish supplies are in Gaza.
	   For Shai Shabat, a Jewish settler, the news that Israel agreed
to hand over another 13 percent of the West Bank brought anxiety
and he did not turn on his TV set to watch the ceremony.
	   With more land under Palestinian control, Shabat, a computer
engineer from the Maaleh Adumim settlement, said his fear of being
ambushed on a West Bank road by Palestinian militants while driving
home from his job in Jerusalem has only grown.
	   While many Israelis and Palestinians tried to come to terms with
a new reality, hardliners on both sides announced even before the
signing that they would try their utmost to torpedo the agreement.
	   Jewish settlers leaders warned that they will shut down the West
Bank with street protests Sunday and will move their campaign to
topple Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu into high gear.
	   However, the news of the peace agreement came just a few hours
before the start of the Jewish Sabbath and settler leaders did not
have much time to organize their protest campaign.
	   In the Gaza Strip, the leader of the Islamic militant Hamas,
Sheik Ahmed Yassin, said a more determined effort by the
Palestinian Authority to prevent attacks against Israelis _ an
element of the new deal _ might work for a while, but not in the
long term. ``It cannot erase Hamas,'' he said.
	   In an attempt to gag Yassin, Palestinian police detained dozens
of journalists who had assembled near his Gaza City home Friday
night to get his reaction to the White House signing.
	   Just a half hour's drive away from Gaza City, in the squalid
town of Rafah, some 2,000 supporters of the Islamic Jihad group
chanted: ``We will never accept the Washington solutions.''
	   Some 20 Islamic Jihad supporters, swathed in the white shrouds
of suicide bombers, burned Israeli and American flags
	   Even among Israelis and Palestinians supporting the new
agreement, skepticism and indifference was more prevalent than joy
or optimism. Scarred by setbacks and broken promises in the past,
many said they feared a suicide bombing or the instability of
Netanyahu's coalition could stop a troop pullback in its tracks.
	   Some questioned the sincerity of Netanyahu, once a staunch
opponent of the land-for-peace process begun by his dovish
predecessors.
	   In the ``Mr. Baker'' fast food restaurant in the West Bank town
of Nablus, the TV set wasn't even turned on.
	   Hava Levinson, a graying 70-year-old woman, sat in an armchair
in her Tel Aviv apartment, listening to the jokes and warm speeches
delivered by Netanyahu, U.S. President Clinton and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat during the ceremony.
	   ``This is theater,'' said Mrs. Levinson angrily. ``It seems
strange that they are taking this seriously. Netanyahu does not
want to give anything.
	   In a garden cafe in Gaza City, customers were more interested in
their gin rummy hand than in learning about the new agreement.
	   The few who did watch the news said they doubted Netanyahu would
actually carry out his promises.
	   ``The news reports are so contradictory it makes us even more
skeptical the agreement will be implemented,'' said Salem Abed
Rabbo, a 36-year-old importer, as he puffed on a waterpipe.
	   But Uri Savir, a key player in the negotiations that led to the
breakthrough peace agreements of 1993 and 1995, said a pullback was
inevitable. ``This time, the credbility of the president of the
United Staes is involved to make that happen,'' he said.
	   Ghol, the Ramallah restaurant owner, said he hoped the agreement
would not only improve his fish supply, but also his relationship
with his fiancee, a Gaza resident.
	   Until now, he has only been able to make rare trips to Gaza,
whenever the Israelis granted him a travel permit. ``I only saw her
(the fiancee) when I picked up the fish,'' said Ghol, a tall man
wearing a blue silk shirt.
	   Now he'll be able to go almost every day.

Man convicted of hammer slaying of mother and daughter
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MAIDSTONE, England (AP) _ A man who had a history of violence
was convicted Friday of bludgeoning a woman and her 6-year-old
daughter to death and leaving a second daughter critically injured
on a country lane in southern England.
	   After Michael Stone, 38, heard the verdict he said, ``I didn't
do it Your Honor! It wasn't me.'' Judge Ian Kennedy imposed three
life sentences and said Stone should not be considered for parole
for at least 14 years.
	   After a 13-day day trial, a jury of eight women and four men at
Maidstone Crown Court convicted Stone of murdering Lin Russell, 45,
and Megan Russell, and of attempting to murder Josie Russell, then
9.
	   The July 1996 hammer attack in a village 10 miles (16 km) east
of Canterbury, Kent, attracted widespread publicity because of the
surviving child and her struggle to regain her speech.
	   The three, along with the family dog, had been walking home from
a swimming program at school in Chillenden when the killer attacked
them with a hammer after demanding money from Mrs. Russell.
	   Josie, lashed to a tree, had been blindfolded. A police surgeon
called to the scene initially thought she was dead, but a slight
movement alerted police and she was rushed to a hospital. She
eventually was able to give details about the attack, but did not
identify Stone.
	   Testimony during the trial said Stone had confessed the murders
to fellow prisoner Damien Daley when the two were in the same jail
last year, and that he told friend Mark Jennings that he would be
prepared to kill women and children to eliminate witnesses.
	   Stone's lawyer said his client denied confessing.
	   After the sentencing, local health and social services
departments discussed elements of Stone's history that had not been
permitted before the jury.
	   Stone has spent many years in prison since the age of 14 for a
variety of offenses, including violence, said Ruth Carnall, chief
executive of the West Kent Health Authority.
	   He had a personality disorder and was a chronic drug abuser, but
tests had determined he was not mentally ill and he could not be
held against his will, she said.
	   The government said there would be an independent inquiry into
the handling of Stone's treatment.
	   After the convictions, Shaun Russell spoke of the loss of his
wife and daughter, and of Josie's request for a new dog, to replace
the pet that was killed in the hammer attack.
	   ``She knows she will never get her mother or her sister back,''
he said, breaking down in front of reporters, ``but she might get a
dog back.''

In first sign of crackdown, Palestinians gag Hamas leader
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INCORPORATES BC-Mideast-Yassin &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ In a first sign of a crackdown on
Islamic militants, Palestinian police on Friday surrounded the home
of the Hamas leader and detained a dozen journalists trying to get
his reaction to the signing of a new Mideast peace deal.
	   Among those held for more than an hour was Heidi Levine, an
American photographer on assignment for Newsweek.
	   The attempt by police to gag the Hamas leader, Sheik Ahmed
Yassin, coincided with promises by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
to U.S. President Bill Clinton and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu that he will do more to prevent terror attacks against
Israel.
	   Hamas has carried out more than a dozen suicide attacks in
Israel since 1994, and Yassin said earlier Friday that the group
would not change its tactics.
	   The confrontation between the police and the journalists began
at about 10 p.m. (2000 gmt) Friday. A dozen journalists, including
reporter Ibrahim Barzak and photographer Adel Hanna _ both on
assignment for The Associated Press _ gathered outside Yassin's
Gaza City home to get his reaction to the Washington signing.
	   Suddenly, Palestinian policemen drove up and told journalists
they had to leave and drive to police headquarters under police
escort.
	   At the police station, an officer who identified himself as
Mohammed Hindi told Levine that from now on, journalists would have
to get official permission before they could interview or
photograph political leaders.
	   All journalists were forced to hand over their equipment,
including mobile phones, tape recorders and cameras.
	   Levine told Hindi she wanted to contact the U.S. Embassy.
	   Hindi told her that ``first we are going to drink coffee and
watch Clinton on TV,'' a reference to the White House signing
ceremony.
	   Levine said she was allowed to go after more than an hour after
she agreed to hand over several rolls of film she had shot in Gaza
that day.
	   Barzak, Hanna and the other Palestinian journalists were freed
after about two hours. They were told to report to police
headquarters again on Saturday morning.

Moceanu calls suing parents ``the hardest thing I've done in my
</HEADLINE>
life'' &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: NEW with Friday's developments &QL; 
 &UR; By TERRI LANGFORD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HOUSTON (AP) _ Gymnast Dominique Moceanu says her decision to
sue her parents was ``the hardest thing I've done in my life'' and
insisted no one influenced her decision.
	   ``Let me make it perfectly clear, no one is pushing or
pressuring me into this decision,'' the 17-year-old said in a
prepared statement read aloud by her attorney, Roy W. Moore. ``It
is something I have thought about for a long time and recent
decisions by my father made it clear to me that it had to be done
immediately.''
	   The 1996 Olympic gold medalist fled her parents' Houston-area
home late Sunday and on Monday filed a lawsuit demanding to be
declared a legal adult so she could get answers about how her
earnings are being spent, primarily by her father, Dumitru Moceanu.
	   ``I want whatever I have earned to be under my control so I know
how my earnings are being used and I want to be able to train and
compete in the sport I love for the right reason, because I love
it, not because my father tells me I have to make more money,''
Moceanu said in her statement.
	   On Friday, her parents _ Dimitru and Camelia Moceanu _ fought
back, asking a judge Friday to dismiss their daughter's lawsuit,
and the temporary restraining order against them.
	   In four petitions filed with the 309th state District Court in
Houston, they asked a judge to dissolve the temporary restraining
order and return their child to them, that Miss Moceanu's request
for adult status be dismissed and that a new hearing be held on the
matter. A judge will consider the motions on Nov. 4 and on Nov. 11,
a judge will consider whether to grant Miss Moceanu adult status.
	   ``It is really emotional for them,'' said Jimmy Phillips Jr. an
attorney for the Moceanus. ``They have worked with their child,
they have been a family unit.''
	   The gymnast claimed her trust fund was being squandered by her
father, that her earnings, socked away in a trust fund, have
bankrolled a $4 million gym bearing her name and other, more risky
investments without her approval.
	   Phillips claims Texas family law requires that at least one
parent or a legal guardian must support a minor's request to be
legally declared an adult before a judge can approve it. He claims
it's doubtful whether Moceanu is ``sufficiently sophisticated'' to
take care of herself.
	   ``In her instance, it means more than having enough money for
food and lodging,'' the Moceanus' attorney said. ``She has a
terrific ability and I'm not so sure she has the sufficient
sophistication to handle the legal contracts, the money she does
receive.''
	   But the gymnast's attorney Roy W. Moore, disagreed.
	   ``He's stretching,'' said Moore.''It's our belief that the
parents in this action _ because of their diametrically opposed
position of the petition _ that they are, of course, unavailable to
sign the petition.''
	   Except for an interview with the Houston Chronicle, Moceanu, a
senior at the private Northland Christian School, has remained in
seclusion all week.
	   In her statement, she said the decision to sue for adult status,
is not one she recommends.
	   ``I'm not saying this is right for all minors ... but under this
circumstance, it is,'' she said.

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council planned to vote
Saturday on a resolution endorsing the Kosovo peace accord, despite
potentially deal-braking opposition from China and Russia that it
would give a green light for military action.
	   It wasn't clear if the two permanent council members would veto
the resolution or simply abstain from it. Both were awaiting word
from their governments ahead of further consultations Saturday
morning and a scheduled vote later in the day.
	   ``We are not in favor of the current draft,'' Chinese Ambassador
Qin Huasun said after consultations Friday evening.
	   Russia and China have opposed any language threatening Serbs and
ethnic Albanians with force if they don't comply with the Oct. 12
agreement, which averted NATO strikes on Serb targets.
	   The Security Council is under pressure to adopt a resolution
enshrining the accord so a team to verify compliance can start
roaming Kosovo to ensure that fighting between Serbs and ethnic
Albanians has ceased.
	   Potential troop-contributing nations are concerned about safety
of their forces and want the council to endorse the plan first,
with provisions for enforcement.
	   Fighting between Serb forces and ethnic Albanians _ who make up
90 percent of Kosovo's population _ has killed hundreds of people
and forced around 300,000 from their homes since a Serb crackdown
began in February.
	   Under the deal brokered by U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke,
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic agreed to a cease-fire, to
withdraw his special police forces from the province, and to allow
a 2,000-strong team to verify the agreement.
	   The United States and Britain have been pushing for a tough
resolution to put pressure on Milosevic to comply with the
agreement and intimate the consequences if he doesn't.
	   Russia has religious and cultural ties to the Serbs, and Russian
lawmakers warned NATO Friday that airstrikes on Yugoslavia would
prompt Moscow to offer weapons to Serbs. China is traditionally
opposed to any military intervention into what it considers an
internal matter, fearing a precedent could be set for its own
disputes with Taiwan and Tibet.
	   Diplomats said China and Russia objected to three paragraphs in
the proposed resolution which would give NATO the right ``to take
steps'' to ensure full implementation of the deal and to ensure the
safety of the verification team from the Vienna-based Organization
for Security and Cooperation.
	   A Russian draft circulated Friday calls instead on Yugoslavia
and ethnic Albanians ``to take appropriate steps'' to ensure that
the agreement is enforced and that the verification personnel are
protected.
	   The draft notes that the OSCE is considering arrangements for
evacuating personnel in the event of an emergency and says the
council ``stands ready to consider the endorsement of such
arrangements.''
	   Russian Ambassador Sergey Lavrov declined to say how he would
vote, saying only ``There are no changes in the Russian position.''
	   Russia has said that it would not go along with any resolution
that was tougher than a Sept. 23 resolution which helped form the
basis of the Holbrooke deal. That resolution said the council would
consider unspecified measures if both sides didn't comply but
didn't give any explicit threats of force.
	   Praising Milosevic's ``great efforts and concessions'' to
resolve the Kosovo question peacefully, Qin accused NATO _ without
naming it _ of unilaterally deciding without Security Council
authorization to take military action against Yugoslavia ``and
brutally interfere in the internal affairs of a sovereign state.''
	   China was prepared to accept ``a technical resolution'' to
endorse the Kosovo agreement, but not a resolution that might
authorize military action, he said.

Ecuador and Peru to sign peace accord, end border feud
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS number of wars fought specifically over strip of
jungle. The first war was over the larger border issue, largely

 &UR; By ANY CABRERA &QC;

<TEXT>
	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ Ecuador and Peru have resolved a dispute
over a 48-mile (77- kilometer) strip of jungle they have fought two
wars to control, Brazil's foreign minister said Friday.
	   Brazil, together with the United States, Argentina and Chile,
brokered the agreement, which offers something to both feuding
neighbors.
	   The four mediating nations stepped in after Peru and Ecuador
deadlocked over three years of negotiations. The mediators required
that Peru and Ecuador accept whatever solution they presented as a
final decision.
	   Ecuadoran President Jamil Mahuad and Peruvian President Alberto
Fujimori will sign the territorial agreement Monday at a ceremony
in Brazil's capital, Brasilia.
	   The border dispute dates to 1941 when Peru and Ecuador fought a
war along the Pacific coast at a time when their frontier wasn't
fully defined.
	   Under the agreement, announced by Brazil's Foreign Minister Luis
Felipe Lampreia, the disputed area will be demarcated along the
Cordillera de Condor mountain range, as Peru argued it should.
	   But a jungle-cloaked hill lying within the territory allocated
to Peru will be granted to Ecuador as private property, while still
remaining part of Peru. The 250-acre (100-hectare) hill area,
called Tiwintza, is a highly emotional symbol to Ecuador because
its troops defended it successfully against assaults by Peruvian
troops during their last border war in 1995.
	   The agreement also calls for contiguous national parks to be
created in the disputed area.
	   ``Like all Ecuadorans, this decision leaves us with a
bittersweet taste because we would have liked it to be more
equitable,'' said Ecuador's armed forces chief Gen. Patricio Nunez,
speaking in Quito, the capital.
	   Ecuador's president, seeking to stress the positive, said
Tiwintza ``becomes Ecuadoran property forever.''
	   In Lima, the Peruvian capital, Fujimori countered criticism that
he had given up too much by noting that the border will be drawn
largely from what Peru wanted.
	   In the jungle city of Iquitos, Peru, angry residents protested
the decision on Tiwintza.
	   ``This represents a kind of surrender with another name,'' said
Raul Morey, president of the Loreto Patriotic Front in Iquitos.
	   Peru won the first territorial war, and the two sides defined
1,088 miles of border in 1942. But with 48 miles (77 kilometers)
left undefined, Ecuador declared the demarcation partially void.
Since then, Peru and Ecuador fought twice more over the region, in
1981 and 1995.
	   Tensions flared most recently in August when Peru accused 300
Ecuadoran troops of violating its territory. When Ecuador insisted
its troops were not inside Peru, Lima refused to continue
internationally sponsored peace talks aimed at resolving the
dispute.
	   Fujimori agreed later to let peacekeepers from neutral countries
serve as a buffer on the troubled border.
	   Among those attending Monday's signing ceremony will be U.S.
special envoy Luigi Einaudi and Thomas ``Mack'' McLarty, a former
aide to President Clinton, a U.S. Embassy spokesman said in
Brasilia.

agency &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ The Chicago White Sox on Friday rejected Albert
Belle's request to be one of the three highest-paid players in U.S.
Major League Baseball, making him eligible for free agency.
	   Earlier this week, Belle said he wanted to remain with the White
Sox because he respects manager Jerry Manuel and thinks the team
can be a division winner next season.
	   However, the team said he invoked a special clause in his
contract that allows him to become a free agent if the team decides
not to raise his salary to among the three highest in the game. It
would have required the White Sox to pay him an additional dlrs
4.26 million over the next three years.
	   If he chooses to file for free agency, Belle's contract allows a
30-day period to test the market. He may sign with another team
during the period or may return to the White Sox.
	   Belle's deal, which he signed following the 1996 season,
guarantees him dlrs 55 million over five years _ dlrs 10 million a
year plus a dlrs 10 million club option for 2002 with a dlrs 5
million buyout.
	   He hit .328 this season with 49 home runs and 152 RBIs.

Davey Johnson introduced as new Dodgers manager
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN NADEL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ While Davey Johnson wasn't the first choice
to manage the Los Angeles Dodgers, club officials were unanimous
Friday in saying he is the best man for the job.
	   As for Johnson, he was just happy to accept the position and
said he believes the Dodgers can rebound from their mediocre 1998
season to contend for the next year's World Series title.
	   ``This is undoubtedly the greatest moment in my life in
baseball. I've had a lot of great moments,'' Johnson said at a
Dodger Stadium news conference.
	   One of those great moments was in 1986, when he managed the New
York Mets to a World Series victory over the Boston Red Sox.
	   ``It's a great challenge for me,'' Johnson said. ``I've always
looked at the Dodgers as the epitome of a great organization. To
me, this is a dream job. I don't see anything but good things in
the future.''
	   Johnson, whose .575 winning percentage in 10 full seasons and
parts of two others ranks 11th among managers with 1,000 or more
games and is higher than any other active manager, succeeds Glenn
Hoffman.
	   Johnson, 55, signed a three-year contract believed to be worth
around dlrs 1 million per year, making him one of the higher-paid
managers in the game.
	   ``This is going to be the most important person in my life other
than my wife and kids, hopefully for a long time,'' said Dodgers
general manager Kevin Malone, who announced Sept. 30 that Hoffman
would return next year as a member of the coaching staff, not as
manager.
	   ``I believe the right choice, the best choice, the No. 1 choice
(for the job) was Davey Johnson. He's a winner.''
	   Malone offered the job to Felipe Alou on Oct. 11, but Alou opted
to remain as manager of the Montreal Expos.
	   Johnson managed the Mets from 1984 until he was fired early in
the 1990 season, leading them to two division titles. He managed
the the Cincinnati Reds from 1993-95, leading the Reds to the
playoffs in his final year, and took the Baltimore Orioles to the
postseason in 1996-97.
	   The Orioles were 88-74 and 98-64 in Johnson's two years there
after going 71-73 in 1995. They won the AL East championship in
1997, but Johnson left after the season following disagreements
with team owner Peter Angelos.
	   Malone was Baltimore's assistant general manager during the
years Johnson managed the Orioles. Johnson, whose career record is
985-727, was out of baseball this year.

No deal yet between IMF and Brazil

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ The International Monetary Fund
and Brazil ended eight hours of talks Friday without reaching an
agreement on a bailout package intended to help Brazil's slumping
economy.
	   IMF spokesman Francisco Baker said they were still working out
ways to slash Brazil's budget deficit so the country can qualify
for a rescue package reportedly worth dlrs 30 billion.
	   Stanley Fischer, IMF vice deputy managing director, arrived in
Rio early Friday and met with Brazilian Finance Minister Pedro
Malan and Central Bank President Gustavo Franco. They both left
after a few hours without comment.
	   The talks about an aid package aimed at shoring up investor
confidence in Brazil continued between Fischer and lower-level
officials of the Brazilian Finance Ministry.
	   ``Discussions centered on reaching an accord between Brazil and
the IMF. The Brazilian government presented the IMF details of an
economic plan,'' said Finance Ministry spokesman Joao Batista
Magalhaes in a brief statement following the meeting.
	   The talks were believed to hinge on what measures the Brazilian
government will take to reduce its ballooning budget deficit of
about dlrs 65 billion, or some 7 percent of the Brazil's gross
domestic product.
	   President Fernando Henrique Cardoso is expected to announce the
measures next week.
	   In Buenos Aires on Thursday, Fischer spoke for the first time of
concrete figures, saying he believed Brazil would need about dlrs
30 billion in emergency aid.
	   He also said the IMF would supply about half of that and the
money could be ready in about two weeks.
	   Fischer said that although there had been ``important
advances,'' the IMF wanted to know exactly what the Brazilian
government intended to do with the money.
	   Brazil has been especially hard hit by the economic turmoil
affecting emerging markets.
	   At the height of the crisis, Brazilian stock exchanges lost
nearly three quarters of their value and the country has lost more
than dlrs 20 billion in foreign reserves.
	   Brazil's largest stock exchange, Sao Paulo's Bovespa, lost 4.4
percent Friday after rising for four consecutive days on hope that
the announcement of the bailout package was imminent.

Slick greens and a packed leaderboard at Disney
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAKE BUENA VISTA, Florida (AP) _ If not for the occasional
whistle from the Disney World railroad, Tiger Woods, Mark O'Meara
and the rest of the field might have thought they were at Augusta
National on Friday.
	   What typically is a birdie fest turned into a frustrating day of
survival on slick, sun-baked greens in the National Car Rental
Classic, leaving Davis Love III and five others in the lead after
the second round.
	   Their 7-under 137 tied the record for the highest 36-hole score
in the Disney Classic, set by John Mahaffey in 1973. That didn't
surprise anyone.
	   ``It was like Augusta _ spooky, scary, speedy,'' said Masters
champion O'Meara, who shot his second straight 1-under 71 and was
five off the lead.
	   Love did most of his damage before the wind kicked up, sneaking
in with a 64. He was joined later by John Huston, Rocco Mediate,
Tom Purtzer, Glen Day and Doug Martin. In the previous 19 Disney
events, no more than three players have shared the 36-hole lead.
	   ``It's hard for anyone to separate themselves from the pack,''
said defending champion David Duval, who had a 72 and was at
4-under 140. ``I lost four shots (from Thursday) but gained ground
on the lead.''
	   Forty-nine players were at 2-under or better, setting up what
could be a wild weekend with a lot on the line.
	   The final full-field tournament of the year will determine the
top 125 players on the money list who will keep their exempt status
for next year, and the top 30 for the field in next week's
lucrative Tour Championship.
	   Ten of the 14 players from 120 to 135 on the money list made the
cut; not among were Mike Springer (122), Dave Stockton Jr. (125),
Steve Fleischer (132) and R.W. Eaks (134).
	   Andrew Magee, 30th on the money list, bogeyed the last hole and
missed the cut.
	   Skip Kendall, 32nd on the money list and needing at least a
third-place finish to get into the Tour Championship, was one
stroke back along with Jesper Parnevik and Mark Brooks.
	   Woods was tied for the lead until consecutive bogeys, including
a three-putt from 60 feet in which the first putt hit the middle of
the cup and still rolled 10 feet by. He finished with a 73 and was
at 139.
	   ``I thought these were the fastest bermuda greens I've ever
putted on,'' said Woods, who won the Disney in 1996 with a 21-under
267. ``It was pretty hairy out there.''
	   Huston won the Disney in 1992 with a tournament-record 262 and
was cruising along in gusts of 25 mph (40 kmph) at 9-under until
three bogeys on the front nine of the Magnolia course slowed him.
He bogeyed the last hole to drop back into the logjam at 137.
	   ``You won't see 7-under very often after the first couple of
days,'' Huston said. ``I've never seen the greens as fast here. I
found myself both days putting very defensive most of the time.''
	   Duffy Waldorf, who shot a 63 in windy conditions on Thursday,
was 15 strokes higher Friday and finished three strokes back at
141.
	   The 25 mph (40 kmph) gusts were only part of the problem. As the
sun emerged from an otherwise cloudy day, a yellow sheen covered
the greens and putts that screamed by the hole left players shaking
their heads.
	   ``Downhill, down-grain, downwind, you've got no chance,'' Duval
said.
	   Love missed the cut by one stroke the last time he played Disney
and, after opening with a 73, was determined not to let that happen
again. He had an early tee time Friday under cloudy, soft
conditions with barely a trace of wind.
	   That didn't last long, but Love took advantage. He was 9-under
on his first 15 holes _ 8-under for the tournament _ until giving
back his only stroke with a pin-high chip that rolled 15 feet (4.5
meters) by the hole.
	   Mediate also got to 8-under until a bogey on the last hole, and
Nolan Henke was at 8-under in the afternoon until he made bogey on
three of the last four holes.

over a 48-mile (77- kilometer) strip of jungle they have fought two
wars to control, Brazil's foreign minister said Friday.
	   Brazil, together with the United States, Argentina and Chile,
brokered the agreement, which offers something to both feuding
neighbors.
	   The four mediating nations stepped in after Peru and Ecuador
deadlocked over three years of negotiations. The mediators required
that Peru and Ecuador accept whatever solution they presented as a
final decision.
	   Ecuadoran President Jamil Mahuad and Peruvian President Alberto
Fujimori will sign the territorial agreement Monday at a ceremony
in Brazil's capital, Brasilia.
	   The border dispute dates to 1941 when Peru and Ecuador fought a
war along the Pacific coast at a time when their frontier wasn't
fully defined.
	   Under the agreement, announced by Brazil's Foreign Minister Luis
Felipe Lampreia, the disputed area will be demarcated along the
Cordillera de Condor mountain range, as Peru argued it should.
	   But a jungle-cloaked hill lying within the territory allocated
to Peru will be granted to Ecuador as private property, while still
remaining part of Peru. The 250-acre (100-hectare) hill area,
called Tiwintza, is a highly emotional symbol to Ecuador because
its troops defended it successfully against assaults by Peruvian
troops during their last border war in 1995.
	   The agreement also calls for contiguous national parks to be
created in the disputed area.
	   ``Like all Ecuadorans, this decision leaves us with a
bittersweet taste because we would have liked it to be more
equitable,'' said Ecuador's armed forces chief Gen. Patricio Nunez,
speaking in Quito, the capital.
	   Ecuador's president, seeking to stress the positive, said
Tiwintza ``becomes Ecuadoran property forever.''
	   In Lima, the Peruvian capital, Fujimori countered criticism that
he had given up too much by noting that the border will be drawn
largely from what Peru wanted.
	   In the jungle city of Iquitos, Peru, angry residents protested
the decision on Tiwintza.
	   ``This represents a kind of surrender with another name,'' said
Raul Morey, president of the Loreto Patriotic Front in Iquitos.
	   Peru won the first territorial war, and the two sides defined
1,088 miles of border in 1942. But with 48 miles (77 kilometers)
left undefined, Ecuador declared the demarcation partially void.
Since then, Peru and Ecuador fought twice more over the region, in
1981 and 1995.
	   Tensions flared most recently in August when Peru accused 300
Ecuadoran troops of violating its territory. When Ecuador insisted
its troops were not inside Peru, Lima refused to continue
internationally sponsored peace talks aimed at resolving the
dispute.
	   Fujimori agreed later to let peacekeepers from neutral countries
serve as a buffer on the troubled border.
	   Among those attending Monday's signing ceremony will be U.S.
special envoy Luigi Einaudi and Thomas ``Mack'' McLarty, a former
aide to President Clinton, a U.S. Embassy spokesman said in
Brasilia.

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Brazil's human rights
organizations on Friday joined efforts to press for the trial of
former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet.
	   Many citizens of Latin American countries ruled by dictators in
the 1960s and 1970s have expressed support for Judge Baltazar
Garzon, who wants to try the 82-year-old general in the deaths of
more than 4,000 suspected dissidents who were killed during his
regime.
	   ``Trying Pinochet in a European court has the utmost importance
to cast light over a sad chapter in Latin America's recent
history,'' said Jair Kirschke, of the Justice and Human Rights
Movement, based in Porto Alegre, 2.000 miles (3,200 kilometers)
from Rio de Janeiro. ``We are asking England to give a green light
to the extradition request presented by Spanish judges.''
	   Tortura Nunca Mas, Portuguese for Torture Never Again, a
grassroots group that collects information about repression during
Brazil's 1964-1985 military dictatorship, demanded that Brazil's
government look into the cases of five Brazilians who disappeared
during the early days of Pinochet's regime.
	   The group was joined by the Friends of the Dead and Missing
during the Brazilian dictatorship and five other entities,
including unions and university professors.
	   The group claims the Brazilians were killed by the Chilean
military during or shortly after the September 11, 1973 coup, but
their bodies were never found.
	   While the government has not officially commented the arrest of
Pinochet, Brazilian diplomats said it was considered as an issue
between England and Chile.

Tropical Storm Mitch produces heavy rain in Costa Rica
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) _ Heavy rains linked by Tropical Storm
Mitch caused mudslides and swollen rivers Friday in Central
America, killing at least one person and leaving five missing.
	   A swollen river carried away a house near Ciudad Cortes, some
280 kilometers (175 miles) southeast of Costa Rica's capital, San
Jose, said Sigurd Koberg, head of Costa Rica's emergency
commission.
	   At least one resident of the house was killed and five others
were missing.
	   Floods and mudslides closed roads in parts of southern Costa
Rica and forced evacuation of 6,000 people, including the staff and
patients of a hospital.
	   More rain was expected Saturday in southern and central Costa
Rica, said Irina Katchan of the National Weather Forecast
Institute.
	   In Honduras, where earlier storms had killed 12 people over the
past two weeks, authorities are warning residents to take
precautions against the possible arrival of Mitch.
	   In Nicaragua, storms nearer the Pacific coast knocked down trees
and utility poles, leaving hundreds of people without electricity
or phone service.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with government formally asking immediate
end of Pinochet arrest. No Pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By EDUARDO GALLARDO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ Chile's government stepped up efforts
Friday to secure through diplomatic, legal, or humanitarian
channels the release of former dictator Augusto Pinochet, who was
arrested last week in a London clinic on charges of ordering human
rights abuses against Europeans and Chileans.
	   A new formal request with was made to the British government for
the ``immediate end'' of the arrest of the 82-year-old Pinochet.
	   Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza said that the government
expects that once Pinochet is back home, the ailing former dictator
will ``disappear from our political life.''
	   ``When Gen. Pinochet comes back to Chile, he should go his
house. That is the government's position,'' he said. ``This country
can no longer be subject to the tensions and divisions that his
figure causes.''
	   The foreign ministry said a formal note was handed Friday
afternoon to British ambassador Glynne Evans with new legal
information to support Chile's claim that Pinochet has diplomatic
immunity.
	   The note, the ministry said, repeated that Chile does not
recognize foreign courts' right to interfere in domestic events.
	   Insulza, among the dissidents exiled during Pinochet 17-year
rule, said it was not inconsistent to using humanitarian
considerations to rescue a man with such a poor human rights
record.
	   ``You just have to look at him to understand his reality,'' he
said about Pinochet's condition. ``Is there any point in promoting
a trial that may last for years to a man that age?''
	   Pinochet ruled from 1973 until 1990 but remained army commander
until last March. Then, he moved to congress as a senator for
liufe, as permitted by the constitution his regime drafted.
	   President Eduardo Frei indicated the humanitarian angle a
primary government strategy to secure his release since Pinochet is
reported to be in serious condition at the London clinic were he
underwent back surgery earlier this month.
	   Insulza said his deputy, Mariano Fernandez, flew to London last
night to attempt new efforts. From London, Fernandez was to fly to
Madrid and Washington. Insulza refused to comment on reports that
Chile was asking the U.S. government to influence Britain.
	   The government here appeared encouraged by indications that
humanitarian arguments may prevail where political, diplomatic and
legal efforts have failed.
	   ``We can understand the situation faced by Mr. Pinochet and his
family, and therefore we will request the necessary considerations,
given his serious health condition,'' Frei said in a nationally
televised speech.
	   Government officials here believe the British home secretary is
legally empowered to turn down the extradition request by Spanish
magistrate Baltasar Garzon.
	   London newspapers reported that the British government could let
Pinochet free ``on compassionate grounds.''
	   Frei said the Chilean government, which maintains that Britain
should recognize Pinochet's diplomatic immunity as a
senator-for-life, is defending Pinochet ``in spite of deep
differences.''
	   Frei noted that concern over Pinochet's health was voiced at a
cabinet session Thursday, including by ministers ``who suffered
torture and exile'' during Pinochet's 1973-90 dictatorship.
	   ``We are not defending a person, we are defending principles,''
he said.

Report: U.S. Export-Import Bank to lend Brazil dlrs 2 billion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ The U.S. Export-Import Bank said Friday
it would lend Brazil dlrs 2 billion to finance imports of American
products.
	   The announcement was made by after Eximbank president James
Harmon after a meeting with President Fernando Henrique Cardoso.
	   ``I would bet with anyone today that, in the long term ... we
will all agree that this was a good moment to invest in Brazil,''
Harmon was quote by the Estado news agency.
	   Brazil represents a substantial market for the United States and
many fear that a looming recession in the Latin American country
provoked by a worldwide financial downturn could cut into the
profits of U.S. producers.
	   Harmon said that actual amount loaned could exceed the promised
dlrs 2 billion and that the loans would become available on an as
needed basis, Globo television reported.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat have reached a breakthrough
land-for-peace West Bank accord. President Bill Clinton called the
Friday agreement an opportunity to ``rebuild trust and renew hope''
for peace in the Mideast. Clinton said Netanyahu and Arafat had
agreed to do just that, with final peace talks to commence after
this interim agreement has been ratified by the two sides'
governments. The deal culminated nine days of negotiations at a
secluded Chesapeake Bay conference center and was finalized only
after negotiators overcame a last-minute snag over Israel's demand
for the release of Jonathan Pollard, an American convicted of
spying for Israel. (US-MIDEAST TALKS)
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip _ Palestinians appeared skeptical about
Mideast deal, while Jewish settlers threatened to shut down West
Bank and topple Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Some
Palestinians said they doubted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu would actually carry out his promise and withdraw from 13
percent of the West Bank. Sheik Ahmed Yassin, founder of the
Islamic militant group Hamas, said a new crackdown could
temporarily restrict the activities of the group's military wing
but would not prevent attacks against Israelis. Jewish settler
leaders warned they would shut down the West Bank on Sunday with
street protests and would move their campaign to topple Netanyahu
into high gear. The spokesman of the settlement movement, Aharon
Domb, said Netanyahu had surrendered to the Palestinians and the
United States. (MIDEAST-REACTIONS)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Echoing Western claims, Kosovo's
main ethnic Albanian leader said Friday that Yugoslavia has not
removed its troops from the embattled province and that little
progress has been made to defuse the crisis. More than 10 days
after a U.S.-brokered peace agreement, Ibrahim Rugova told
reporters that ``the Serbian forces have not yet withdrawn from
Kosovo,'' despite Yugoslav statements to the contrary. With NATO's
latest deadline for Yugoslav compliance only four days away, the
alliance decided Friday to send two top generals to Belgrade this
weekend to insist that Yugoslavia speed its troop withdrawal from
Kosovo. Tension remains high here despite the agreement averting
NATO airstrikes that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and U.S.
envoy Richard Holbrooke reached on Oct. 12. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ Ecuador and Peru have resolved a dispute
over a 48-mile (77- kilometer) strip of jungle they have fought two
wars to control, Brazil's foreign minister said Friday. Brazil,
together with the United States, Argentina and Chile, brokered the
agreement, which offers something to the feuding neighbors.
Ecuadoran President Jamil Mahuad and Peruvian President Alberto
Fujimori will sign the territorial agreement Monday at a ceremony
in Brazil's capital, Brasilia. Under the agreement, the disputed
area will be demarcated along the Cordillera de Condor mountain
range, as Peru argued it should. But a jungle-cloaked hill lying
within the territory allocated to Peru will be granted to Ecuador
as private property, while still remaining part of Peru.
(BRAZIL-PERU-ECUADOR PEACE)
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Typhoon Babs headed toward southern
China on Saturday after battering the central and northern
Philippines with heavy winds and rain that killed at least 86
people, flattened crops, and forced more than 320,000 people from
their homes. The toll was expected to rise as contacts are restored
with remote areas where roads were blocked by landslides and
flooding, and telephone service was knocked out by strong winds.
Among the worst-hit areas was the impoverished Bicol region along
the Philippines' eastern coast. At least 53 people were killed in
landslides on Catanduanes island, where Babs first hit land
Thursday, the Office of Civil Defense said. Seventeen others died
in landslides in nearby Camarines Sur province. More than 320,000
people in the area were forced to flee their homes.

Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form.
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Smaller-company stocks rose for an eight
straight session Friday, but the Dow industrials and other popular
measures ended their winning streaks as investors secured some
gains before the weekend. The Dow Jones industrial average fell
80.85 points _ or by 1 percent _ to 8,452.29, giving back most of
its slim 116-point gain from the past four days. (US-CLOSING
STOCKS)
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Germany's Finance Ministry, banks and
businesses agreed Friday that Europe's future single currency, the
euro, will be eased into circulation in this country over two
months in 2002, rather than with a ``big bang'' as earlier
suggested. Fifteen groups representing banks, the retail industry
and vending machine companies agreed with Germany's Finance
Ministry that the German mark will be eased out of circulation
between Jan. 1-Feb. 28, 2002. The decision was largely taken to
ease the burden on vending machine companies. The industry
estimates refitting the country's 2 million vending machines to
accept the euro will cost about one billion marks (dlrs 625

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's chief banker predicted Friday that only a
fraction of the country's commercial banks would survive the
current economic crisis, even with help from the Central Bank. Some
200 to 300 commercial banks will weather the crisis, said Central
Bank chairman Viktor Gerashchenko. The Central Bank recently
estimated there were 1,700 commercial banks in Russia, although the
Profil business weekly said just 905 remained profitable after the
crisis erupted in mid-August. ``Only a small number of banks will
be able to stay afloat in the current situation,'' Gerashchenko
told Interfax news agency. Russian entrepreneurs rushed to open
banks in the post-Soviet era, but few ever established a solid
financial footing or offered Western-style retail services.

	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Nokia's cellular phone sales nearly
doubled in the third quarter, helping to fuel a 75 percent increase
in pretax profit for the first nine months of the year, to 9.6
billion markkaa (dlrs 1.9 billion). Net sales for all Nokia's
divisions jumped to 53.3 billion markkaa (dlrs 10.6 billion)
compared with 36.7 billion markkaa for the January-September period
last year. During the third quarter, sales of mobile phones surged
to 12.9 billion markkaa (dlrs 2.58 billion) from 6.6 billion
markkaa in 1997, and for the nine-month period were up to 31.9
billion markkaa (dlrs 6.38 billion) from 20 billion markkaa last
year. (FINLAND-EARNS-NOKIA)
	   PARIS (AP) _ A global agreement on direct investment can't
logically go ahead without France, the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development said Friday, justifying a waiting
period before further negotiations. ``There is a general
understanding that any (multilateral trade) framework must include
all major OECD countries,'' OECD Deputy Secretary General Victor
Schloegl said after a news conference. French Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin last week pulled his country out of the negotiations for the
OECD-piloted Multilateral Agreement On Investment, known as MAI,
citing concerns about national sovereignty. (OECD-GLOBAL

	   HARRISBURG, Pennsylvania (AP) _ AMP Inc., fighting off a
proposed takeover by AlliedSignal Inc., reported a dlrs 76.3
million loss for the third quarter and boosted its planned job cuts
by about 700 to a total of 4,200 positions. The results reported
Friday amounted to a loss of 35 cents per diluted share in contrast
to a profit of dlrs 121.6 million, or 55 cents per share, in the
July-September period in 1997. Sales fell 6.7 percent to dlrs 1.34
billion from dlrs 1.43 billion a year ago. The world's largest
maker of electrical connectors increased the number of jobs it
plans to eliminate to about 4,200 compared with previous plans for
3,500 cuts. The company said about 2,200 people had been let go as
of Oct. 1. It has about 47,000 employees worldwide.

	   AOKIGAHARA FOREST, Japan (AP) _ When visitors hike through this
ancient forest of majestic 300-year-old trees and cool hollows,
they are advised not to stray from the narrow, black volcanic rock
paths.
	   That's because visibility is poor at the base of Mount Fuji, and
the floor of the dense woods _ known as the ``sea of trees'' _ is
pocked with crater-like holes and patches of slick, moss-covered
stones.
	   But straying hikers are increasingly stumbling across something
more sinister: dead bodies.
	   The sprawling Aokigahara Forest, a favorite among day-trippers
from Tokyo, is also one of the country's most popular destinations
for the suicidal _ and growing more popular.
	   This year a record 58 bodies have already been found and
authorities expect the 1998 total to top 70. Officials attribute
the surge to the economic slump as Japan weathers its worst
recession in decades.
	   ``It's a hard problem to deal with. How do you know if someone's
going into the woods to kill himself or just to pick mushrooms?''
asked Yoshiki Shimura, an official in the town of Kamikuishiki,
which borders the forest.
	   The forest's previous annual suicide record was set in 1994,
when 57 bodies were found _ the most since searches were first
begun in 1971. Last year, 55 were found.
	   The latest search, by more than 300 police and firefighters
earlier this week, recovered three bodies.
	   For many suicide victims, the last public stop is often the Lava
Cave Shopping Center, a roadside refreshment stand near a main
entrance to the forest trail.
	   ``They're easy to spot,'' said cashier Kazuaki Amano. ``They
wander around for a while before starting down the trail and are
careful not to make eye contact with anyone.''
	   Amano said the shop advises police about anyone who looks
suspicious and so far, about 40 deaths have been prevented that way
this year. Besides failed businessmen, those contemplating suicide
included people suffering from mental or physical illnesses and
distraught students.
	   But many others were not stopped. Often they hang themselves
from tree limbs or take poison, nestling in the underbrush until it
takes effect.
	   ``We don't sell them the rope,'' Amano said. ``They come
prepared. They know what they're doing.''
	   The dark side of the national park is so well known that it was
mentioned in a controversial 1993 book, ``The Complete Manual of
Suicide.''
	   But many Japanese say the trend dates to a 1960 novel, ``The
Pagoda of Waves,'' which was later serialized as a television drama
about a woman who kills herself in the forest.
	   While suicide carries a stigma in Japan, it has traditionally
been viewed as an honorable way out of a shameful situation.
	   In the past, samurai warriors disemboweled themselves to atone
for failure. Today, people kill themselves after suffering personal
or professional setbacks.
	   National Police Agency figures show that 24,391 Japanese
committed suicide across the country last year, a 5.6 percent
increase over the previous year.
	   Japan has one of the world's highest suicide rates, with 17.2
per 100,000 people taking their lives each year. That is higher
than the 12 per 100,000 in the United States and the 7.5 in
England, but lower than Finland's 27.3, according to Japan's Health
Ministry.
	   Efforts to prevent deaths at Aokigahara have been hampered by
wariness on the part of local officials to publicize the problem
and risk increasing the area's mystique as a suicide haven.
	   Still, signs meant to discourage any would-be suicide victims
have been posted alongside trail entrances.
	   ``Your life is a precious gift from your parents,'' reads one
sign, located in a dark grove about 300 yards into the woods.
``Think calmly once again about them, your siblings and your
children. Don't keep worries to yourself _ please seek
counseling.''

Italian premier goes to EU appointment with confidence win

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ After winning an important vote of confidence,
Italy's new premier, Massimo D'Alema, was heading to his first
international appearance as premier at Saturday's European Union
summit in Austria.
	   The Friday vote on D'Alema's center-left coalition, Italy's 56th
government since World War II, was 333 in favor and 281 against,
with three deputies abstaining. The premier is expected to easily
win next week's confidence vote in the Senate.
	   D'Alema, a former Communist, has promised to continue the strict
economic policies imposed by his predecessor, Romano Prodi. Prodi's
austere budgets allowed Italy to qualify for Europe's single
currency, the euro, which takes effect next year.
	   During debate before the vote, Italy's center-right opposition,
led by former Premier Silvio Berlusconi, promised a fierce fight
against D'Alema. Berlusconi's Freedom Alliance called supporters to
march Saturday in a Rome protest.
	   The opposition contends that D'Alema's coalition, which ranges
from a small centrist party of former Christian Democrats to
Communists holding Cabinet posts for the first time since 1947,
fails to respect the outcome of an election two years ago.
	   Many of the centrist deputies were elected to Parliament in 1996
on the center-right Freedom Alliance ticket, not on the center-left
Olive Tree group, which proposed Prodi, an economist, as premier.
	   D'Alema is seeking a broad base of support to pass the 1999
budget as well as to revive efforts to change Italy's constitution
to reform an electoral system that rewards small parties and feeds
the country's chronic government instability.
	   ``This government was born for reforms, constitutional and
electoral,'' D''Alema said, pitching for the confidence vote.
	   Prodi's 2 1/2-year coalition was Italy's second longest-lasting
since the war. It collapsed after some Communists, then outside the
government but usually supportive of Prodi, refused to back the
government in a confidence vote on Oct. 9.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Three days ahead of its deadline for
Slobodan Milosevic to comply with Western demands, NATO was sending
two top generals to Belgrade on Saturday to demand more Kosovo
withdrawals by the Yugoslav president.
	   Gen. Wesley Clark, the alliance's supreme military commander,
and German Gen. Klaus Naumann were seeking more pullbacks of police
units and equipment from the separatist province, where scattered
skirmishes continue.
	   NATO says it will reimpose the threat of airstrikes on Serbian
military targets if Milosevic doesn't back up all his pledges from
an Oct. 12 agreement by Tuesday.
	   With Western nations only beginning to organize a 2,000-strong
group of unarmed monitors to verify Yugoslavia's actions in Kosovo,
the deadline is widely expected to be pushed back for a second
time. But no official action by NATO is expected until Monday.
	   A NATO official, briefing reporters in Brussels, Belgium, on
condition of anonymity, said Friday that ``we have seen great
progress but we are far from adequate compliance.''
	   The Serb-led Yugoslav government reiterated claims that it has
fulfilled its terms of the agreement with U.S. envoy Richard
Holbrooke and that ethnic Albanian rebels are responsible for
continuing violence.
	   Serbian Premier Mirko Marjanovic said it was time the West
realized that the crisis in Kosovo was caused by ``terrorism of
Albanian separatists.''
	   While fighting in Kosovo effectively halted in late September,
there is sporadic gunfire and almost nightly shelling in different
locations _ evidence the conflict has not ended.
	   Under the agreement, Milosevic pledged to withdraw special
police and army units sent to the province after he launched his
crackdown on the KLA Feb. 28. Hundreds of people have been killed
and an estimated 300,000 driven from their homes.
	   Milosevic also agreed to let refugees return home safely and
enable international relief agencies to bring them aid. He also
pledged to negotiate with ethnic Albanian leaders on the future of
Kosovo, a province of the main Yugoslav republic Serbia.
	   Ethnic Albanians make up about 90 percent of the province's 2
million inhabitants, and most favor independence or self-rule.
	   The KLA issued a statement Friday reiterating that it is keeping
to a general cease-fire but saying it would respond and defend
villages if Serb and Yugoslav forces move on them.
	   U.S. envoy Christopher Hill was in neighboring Albania to brief
government officials and urge them to support the U.S.-led peace
effort. Albania had permitted rebels to set up sanctuaries in the
north.
	   ``We are looking for full compliance,'' Hill told reporters.
``We'd like to see full compliance. I don't want to predict when
exactly we'll see it but we are working very hard to ensure it.''
	   At the United Nations, China and Russia continued to block a
proposed Security Council resolution endorsing the Kosovo peace
deal because of language threatening the use of force if it falls
apart.
	   The council is under pressure to adopt a resolution enshrining
the accord so the verifiers can begin Kosovo.
	   The American head of the Kosovo ground verification mission,
William Walker, arrived Friday in Kosovo after meeting Milosevic,
vowing to improve conditions for refugees and help guarantee
success of the peace agreement.

Test of new agreement will come in implementing complex accord

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Under the new Israeli-Palestinian agreement,
the Palestinians are promised a sizable piece of real estate,
needed to achieve their goal of statehood.
	   Israel hopes a package of new security measures will put Islamic
militants behind bars for good and prevent terror attacks, which
have frayed the Israeli public's confidence in the peace process.
	   But the key question is whether the complex, multi-stage
agreement can be carried out in the climate of suspicion and
distrust _ which may only have deepened in the acrimony surrounding
the Maryland summit.
	   The first test will come when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu returns home to face the political storm brewing as a
result of the agreement.
	   Jewish settlers, who contend the accord amounts to ``betrayal''
and ``treason,'' are vowing a bitter fight to block its
implementation and bring down Netanyahu's ruling coalition.
	   Former Prime Minister Shimon Peres of the Labor Party says
Netanyahu cannot make any more concessions, and certainly can't
tackle sensitive final-status issues such as Jerusalem, refugees
and borders, unless he forms a new coalition or calls early
elections.
	   Calling for a new nationwide vote would mean an election
campaign in the midst of the complex, phased plan to bring about an
Israeli withdrawal. That will create a highly charged atmosphere in
which the smallest hiccup could become a major crisis.
	   Politics aside, there are built-in problems to the accord.
	   For example, regardless of how the map is drawn, a 13 percent
withdrawal will isolate at least some settlements _ perhaps as many
as 15 _ leaving them as islands in a Palestinian-controlled sea.
	   Settlers are certain to try to reinforce these settlements,
asking the government for money to expand housing and facilities.
The Palestinians can be expected to act to contain such growth,
building on land next to settlements and staging protests that will
lead to clashes.
	   Statements from both sides show clearly that, despite an
important breakthrough in ending an 18-month impasse, the level of
distrust is such that U.S. President Bill Clinton will have to
invest as much effort in overseeing implementation as he gave to
hammering out an agreement.
	   ``The real test is in the implementation. Israel can use any
excuse for non-implementation,'' said Hanan Ashrawi, a former
Palestinian Cabinet minister.
	   Moshe Fogel, the Israeli government spokesman, said much will
depend on whether the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat lives up to
promises to rein in militants while Israel carries out the phased
withdrawal over a three-month period.
	   ``It's a two-way street. These three months can either be
problematic, or they can be a springboard for rebuilding
confidence,'' he said.
	   What has brought the negotiating process to a halt in the past _
and could block or slow implementation of the agreement in the
future _ are terror attacks.
	   Even an all-out effort by Arafat can't guarantee a bomb won't go
off, and if it does, Netanyahu will be hard-pressed by his
right-wing constituency to call a halt in the withdrawal process.
	   Even though Arafat has reportedly pledged not to unilaterally
declare a state on May 4, when the interim agreement on autonomy
expires, he may argue he is entitled to change his mind if Israel
does not live up to the bargain in full.
	   Part of the problem, says political science professor Ali
Jirbawi of Bir Zeit University in the West Bank, is that the
Palestinians do not believe they will get any further land in
final-status negotiations.
	   Hence, they want not only the 13 percent of territory that
Netanyahu has promised to transfer to shared control with the
Palestinians _ giving the Palestinians either sole or shared
control over about 40 percent of the West Bank _ but a further
withdrawal on top of that.
	   The United States, especially the CIA, which is to oversee
security aspects of the agreement, is in a difficult position. For
the first time, Washington will abandon the role of mediator and
become judge and jury for deciding who has complied with the
agreement.
	   Handing out judgments may sour relations with either party and,
in the case of criticism of the Palestinians, might also have
repercussions with other allies in the region, such as Egypt,
Jordan and the Gulf states.

Sigel's course-record 61 good for three-stroke lead

<TEXT>
	   KAANAPALI, Hawaii (AP) _ Jay Sigel posted the second best Senior
PGA Tour score ever, a 10-under-par 61, and held a three-stroke
lead after Friday's first round of the Kaanapali Classic.
	   And had he known, he might have gone for the PGA Tour record of
59 shared by Al Geiberger and Chip Beck.
	   Sigel made the turn at the 6,590-yard Kaanapali North Golf Club
on Maui at 29, putting together six birdies without a bogey. He
picked up three more birdies over the next five holes before
narrowly missing an eagle on the par-5 15th.
	   ``I felt if I could make the putt at 15 (for the eagle), I would
have hit a driver at 16,'' Sigel said of the more agressive play at
the 400-yard par-4.
	   Hugh Baiocchi, his playing partner who had a 65, said it
appeared Sigel wasn't aware of his score, the lowest on the senior
tour this year and one behind the senior record set by Isao Aoki
who had a 10-under 60 in the 1997 Emerald Coast Classic.
	   ``I was aware he could shoot a 59,'' Baiocchi said during a
joint post-round news conference with Sigel. ``I knew you had a 29
(at the turn), but you didn't realize it, did you?''
	   ``I thought I shot 30,'' said Sigel, who is fourth on this
year's money list.
	   ``When he birdied 8 and 9, I though 59 was a definite
possibility,'' Baiocchi said.
	   Sigel, 54, is a five-time winner on the senior tour including
the Bell Atlanta Classic in May.
	   Bob Eastwood had a 64 Friday, one stroke ahead of Baiocchi and
Walter Hall. Larry Laoretti and local pro Dick McClean had 66s.
	   Gibby Gilbert, Jerry McGee, DeWitt Weaver, Bob E. Smith and Tom
Shaw were at 67. Former Kaanapali champion Jim Colbert headed a
group at 68 with three-time winner Bob Charles and 1994 champion
Bob Murphy among those at 69.
	   Aoki was at 70 with defending champion Hale Irwin at 2-over 73.
	   The 54-hole tournament, with a dlrs 1 million purse, is
sponsored by EMC Corp. of Massachusetts, a provider of enterprise
storage and retrieval technology.

World Cup champion Maier denies doping rumors

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SOELDEN, Austria (AP) _ Double Olympic champion Hermann Maier of
Austria, denying rumors his stunning wins last year were
drug-enhanced, said his rivals needed to learn how to lose.
	   Hit with questions Friday about a recent article in the Swiss
daily paper ``Sport,'' which quoted Swiss ski boss Theo Nadig
questioning Maier's rapid physical development, the Austrian skier
said the Swiss coach was simply reacting to his own poor season.
	   ``The Swiss team had a bad season last year so I understand an
attack like that now,'' Maier said. ``It's never easy to lose in
sport. You must learn to lose.''
	   Nadig was quoted in ``Sport'' as saying that a diet of pasta and
granola could not explain Maier's rapid gain of muscle mass.
	   ``... Even if you train a lot, an athlete can only gain about 3
1/2 to 4 1/4 kilos (7-8.5 pounds) of muscle mass, and even that's a
lot,'' Nadig said in the article.
	   ``But when you hear what's said about Hermann Maier's
development, you get suspicious. Alone, pasta and Muesli won't
achieve that.''
	   Newly appointed FIS president Gian Franco Kasper said Nadig
could face stiff sanctions if the International Ski Federation
finds his accusations without foundation.
	   In a fiery showdown between Nadig and Austrian alpine director
Hans Pum on the eve of Saturday's season-opening race, Nadig
eventually bent.
	   ``I'm not accusing anybody,'' he said. ``I was just curious.
Hermann Maier is the reference point and as the head of the Swiss
team it's my job to find the best ways to train my skiers and
provide them with the best training possible.
	   ``I don't think that kind of muscle mass can be developed just
from pasta and Muesli (granola) and I was curious to know what they
were doing it.''
	   Speculation over Maier's powerful physique took root last season
when the 26-year-old came out of nowhere to dominate.
	   As a child, Maier was kicked out of his ski school because of
his weak knees. Later the national junior squads repeatedly refused
to take him on because of weak joints.
	   Sparking further rumors, Maier's name has been tied to doctor
Bernd Pansold, the last coach of the Eastern German women's
swimming team.
	   Questioned about his training at the Obertauern independent
Olympic training center in Austria where Pansold works, Maier
denied any connection to the former East German.
	   ``I train at the (Obertauern) sports center but my trainer is
Berg Mueller,'' said Maier, who emerged from obscurity last season
to win two Olympic gold medals, the giant slalom and super-g World
Cup titles as well as the overall World Cup crown.
	   ``That other doctor (Pansold) is a doctor who analyses physical
performance data. He studies before and after performance results
to be able to adapt your training.
	   ``I have no particular contact with him.''
	   FIS said that over the summer some 450-500 out-of-competition
drug tests were carried out without a positive test.
	   Maier said he had been tested four times since the start of the
year. The skier said he was tested at the winter Olympics in
Nagano, and twice underwent FIS pre-announced urine testing. The
Austrian also said he'd been tested ``about 20 to 30 times in
Austria'' by the national federation.
	   FIS requires blood tests twice a year at a laboratory in
Innsbruck, Austria.
	   The FIS will meet Nov. 28-29 to discuss the issue of drugs in
skiing with other winter sports federations, before attending the
world conference on doping organized by the International Olympic
Committee in February.

Elections to key Iranian assembly apparently marred by low turnout

	   TEHRAN, Iran _ Some Iranian voters complained that hard-line
clerics have already decided the outcome in elections for the
council that oversees Iran's supreme leader, even before Saturday's
expected release of first official results.
	   Iran's official media boasted about a huge turnout in Friday
elections for the 86-member Assembly of Experts, which oversees the
supreme religious leader. But many polling stations were nearly
empty in Tehran, the capital and largest city.
	   Official results are not expected until Saturday, and results in
the capital, Tehran, could be announced as late as Sunday,
electoral authorities said.
	   Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, a hard-liner, has
the final say in government, and conservative clerics want to keep
it that way. But moderate clerics, led by Khatami, are calling for
a more accountable leader.
	   Candidate Majid Ansari, a moderate cleric, blamed the low
turnout in Tehran on the lack of choice as most of the 167
candidates _ all clergymen _ were hard-liners. The candidates were
selected by a Council of Guardians that is controlled by
conservatives.
	   ``Unfortunately, the procedures were such that competition was
limited and a group of revolutionaries were prevented from taking
part in the elections,'' Ansari told The Associated Press on
Friday.
	   Ordinary people were blunt about their reason for boycotting the
polls.
	   ``It makes no difference. They have already selected the people
they want to put in the assembly,'' said Siavash Mohseni, 24, a
university student who didn't vote.
	   Although voting was supposed to be secret, there were no private
booths for voters and it was easy to see for whom a person voted.
	   An election observer in western Tehran said many voters had cast
empty ballot papers and many more had voted for supporters of the
moderate President Mohammad Khatami.
	   However, a voter in Tehran's Enqelab Square, Saeid Kazami, 41,
said he had cast his ballot mainly for hard-line candidates because
they ``are protectors of the (Islamic) revolution.''
	   ``We know that the revolution will have no problem if they are
in charge,'' he said.
	   Khatami's efforts to ease the revolution's social, political and
media restrictions are popular. But they are opposed bitterly by
hard-liners who are loathe to give up control of key institutions
such as the judiciary and the security agencies.
	   Khatami urged people to vote after casting his ballot at the
Husseinieh Jamaran mosque in northern Tehran.
	   ``Definitely, there could have been more qualified people than
were allowed, but nonetheless we still have a chance to choose our
favored candidates,'' Khatami told reporters.

Palestinians indifferent or skeptical about Mideast deal

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ For Osama Ghol, the Mideast peace
agreement signed Friday at the White House means he can see his
fiancee more often and get fresh fish for his restaurant _ but
hard-liners on both sides said they would do their utmost to
torpedo the accord.
	   Ghol's business is in the West Bank. His fiancee and the fish
are in Gaza. A new land route for the Palestinians through Israel _
one of the provisions of the new peace deal _ will soon link the
two areas.
	   But Ghol's hope for a better future seemed to be the exception.
	   Both Israeli and Palestinian hard-liners announced even before
the signing ceremony that they would try their utmost to torpedo
the agreement.
	   And skepticism or indifference prevailed among the many Israelis
and Palestinians who in principle support the land-for-security
agreement.
	   In a garden cafe in Gaza City, customers were more interested in
their gin rummy hand than in learning about the new agreement.
	   The few who did watch the news said they doubted Netanyahu would
actually carry out his promises.
	   ``The news reports are so contradictory it makes us even more
skeptical the agreement will be implemented,'' said Salem Abed
Rabbo, a 36-year-old importer, as he puffed on a waterpipe.
	   For Shai Shabat, a resident of the Jewish West Bank settlement
of Maaleh Adumim, the news that Israel agreed to hand over another
13 percent of the West Bank brought anxiety and he did not turn on
his TV set to watch the ceremony.
	   With more land under Palestinian control, Shabat, a computer
engineer from the Maaleh Adumim settlement, said he was worried
about being ambushed on a West Bank road by Palestinian militants
while driving home from his job in Jerusalem.
	   Jewish settlers leaders warned that they will shut down the West
Bank with street protests Sunday and will move their campaign to
topple Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu into high gear.
	   However, the news of the peace agreement came just a few hours
before the start of the Jewish Sabbath and settler leaders did not
have much time to organize their protest campaign.
	   In the Gaza Strip, the leader of the Islamic militant Hamas,
Sheik Ahmed Yassin, said a more determined effort by the
Palestinian Authority to prevent attacks against Israelis _ an
element of the new deal _ might work for a while, but not in the
long term. ``It cannot erase Hamas,'' he said.
	   In a first sign of a crackdown on Hamas, Palestinian police
detained a dozen journalists, including American free-lance
photographer Heidi Levine, who had assembled outside Yassin's home
Friday night to get his reaction to the White House signing.
	   The journalists were released after more than an hour.
	   Just a half hour's drive away from Gaza City, in the squalid
town of Rafah, some 2,000 supporters of the Islamic Jihad group
chanted: ``We will never accept the Washington solutions.''
	   Some 20 Islamic Jihad supporters, swathed in the white shrouds
of suicide bombers, burned Israeli and American flags
	   In Israel, some questioned the sincerity of Netanyahu, once a
staunch opponent of the land-for-peace process begun by his dovish
predecessors.
	   Hava Levinson, a graying 70-year-old woman, sat in an armchair
in her Tel Aviv apartment, listening to the jokes and warm speeches
delivered by Netanyahu, U.S. President Bill Clinton and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat during the ceremony.
	   ``This is theater,'' said Mrs. Levinson angrily. ``It seems
strange that they are taking this seriously. Netanyahu does not
want to give anything.
	   But Uri Savir, a key player in the negotiations that led to the
breakthrough peace agreements of 1993 and 1995, said a pullback was
inevitable. ``This time, the credbility of the president of the
United States is involved to make that happen,'' he said.
	   Ghol, the Ramallah restaurant owner, said he hoped the agreement
would not only improve his fish supply, but also his relationship
with his fiancee.
	   Until now, he has only been able to make rare trips to Gaza,
whenever the Israelis granted him a travel permit. ``I only saw her
(the fiancee) when I picked up the fish,'' said Ghol, a tall man
wearing a blue silk shirt.
	   Now he'll be able to go almost every day.

	   POERTSCHACH, Austria (AP) _ European Union leaders welcome two
new kids on their block Saturday _ German Chancellor-elect Gerhard
Schroeder and Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema _ at a summit
devoted to brainstorming about where the EU is going.
	   On the summit's eve, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat was
scheduled to brief summit leaders on a West Bank land-for-peace
deal concluded at U.S.-led peace talks in Maryland.
	   The debuts of Schroeder, a social democrat who takes office next
week, and D'Alema, an ex-communist sworn in this week, gives the
line-up of the West European leaders a stronger leftist tint.
	   Eleven of the 15 EU governments are headed by left-wing or
center-left leaders, two others are coalitions with socialists and
only in Ireland and Spain are conservatives in power.
	   The line-up at the top may have changed, but not some vexsome
issues facing West European leaders.
	   They must debate ways of maintaining Europe's economic recovery,
tackle high unemployment and say how they plan to implement painful
agricultural, budget and decision-making reforms needed if the EU
is to take in half-a-dozen newcomers in the years ahead.
	   The EU will launch a single currency in January _ after years of
debate and the leaders will be urged not to let the euro be the end
of the line.
	   ``A signal must be sent from Poertschach that a single market
and a single currency is not the end of the EU journey,'' Austrian
Chancellor and summit chairman Viktor Klima said ahead of the
summit.
	   Forecasts issued this week showed the financial turmoil sweeping
Asia, Russia and Latin America will drag EU growth down to 2.4
percent in 1999, from a previously predicted 3 percent.
	   That outlook and the emergence of more leftist leaders is
creating pressure for a more hands-on approach to boost growth
through more public investment or cutting interest rates.
	   ``The competitiveness of our companies ... must be further
bolstered,'' French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said this week in
Paris. ``A decline in interest rates is essential to that end.''
	   Schroeder and other euro-Socialists have also indicated rates
should be lower, but central bank governors have resisted that.
They argue rates in key EU economies such as France and Germany are
already among the world's lowest.
	   The EU leaders will be keen to hear British Prime Minister Tony
Blair's views on a common European defense policy. Blair said this
week he may be prepared to drop the long-standing opposition of his
Conservative predecessors to giving the EU a military capability
within the NATO alliance.
	   His spokesman Alistair Campbell explained Blair wanted European
countries to be able to mount peacekeeping or combat operations to
deal with crises like Bosnia or Kosovo.
	   ``Poertschach provides an excellent opportunity to relaunch the
debate on the future of the Union,'' said EU Commission President
Jacques Santer, in a letter to the leaders. ``Europe must rid
itself of its cliched image of an economic giant but political
dwarf.''
	   Acknowledging the EU's political importance to the Palestinians,
Arafat was to fly to Austria to brief leaders on the U.S.-brokered
peace deal, the Austria Press Agency reported.
	   Quoting the chancellor's office, APA said Friday that Austrian
Chancellor Viktor Klima had won agreement from the other EU leaders
to invite Arafat to brief them on the outcome of the talks at Wye
Plantation in Maryland.

Typhoon Babs heads for southern China; at least 90 dead in
</HEADLINE>
Philippines &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) - A deadly typhoon dubbed Babs raced
towards southern China on Saturday, leaving behind a trail of
destruction on the Philippines' main island where at least 90
people died and tens of thousands were forced to flee their homes.
	   Philippines President Joseph Estrada declared three provinces
and a city in the worst hit area on the southern tip of Luzon
island under a state of calamity. He was expected to declare add
more provinces to the list once the full extent of the damage can
be determined.
	   Disaster officials said the toll on lives and property would
rise as telephone service is restored and roads blocked by
landslides and flooding are reopened in the worst hit areas.
	   By early Saturday Babs had moved out over the South China Sea,
280 kilometers (175 miles) west-northwest of Dagupan City in
Pangasinan province, weather officials said. It had sustained winds
of 120 kph (75 mph), with gusts up to 150 kph (95 mph), and was
headed toward southern China.
	   Meteorological officials expect the typhoon to reintensify over
water as it neared Hong Kong by early Sunday.
	   Of the 90 deaths reported, so far in the Philippines, 53 were
attributed to landslides on Catanduanes island where Babs first
landed on Thursday, the Office of Civil Defense said.
	   ``Catanduanes received the first punch and it was a hard hit,''
said Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado, who is overseeing the
relief and rescue work.
	   Seventeen others died in landslides in nearby Camarines Sur
province and another 102 people were injured by flying debris in
Sorsogon province, both located in the impoverished Bicol region
along the Philippines' eastern coast. Nine other people were
injured elsewhere in Bicol.
	   More than 320,000 people in the area were forced out of their
homes, disaster relief officials said. Tens of thousands of others
were stranded as ports were shut and ships forbidden to sail.
	   The fatalities included 14 drownings, two people hit by falling
trees, a man who died of shock, two children who were killed by a
landslide in central Iloilo province, and a fireman crushed to
death after his van overturned on a slippery road, officials said.
	   Eight other people were reported missing.
	   In the metropolitan Manila area, Estrada ordered at least 10,000
people living in swollen creeks and rivers out of their homes and
into government shelters.
	   Many areas in Manila and nearby provinces were still under water
early Saturday.
	   Babs also pounded areas around Mount Pinatubo volcano with heavy
rain, unleashing 1.5-meter (5 foot) avalanches of volcanic material
from the mountain's slopes. Most of the material was carried safely
away by swollen rivers.
	   It was second devastating storm in the Philippines in a week.
Last week, Super Typhoon Zeb killed at least 74 people in the
northern Philippines and 43 more in Taiwan and Japan.

Weapons experts wrapping up review of tests for Iraqi nerve agent
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous to UPDATE with Britain proposal for
comprehensive review, CHANGES byline &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council would conduct a
``comprehensive review'' on Iraq sanctions soon after Baghdad
resumes cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors but won't prejudge
whether sanctions could be eased as a result, according to a
British draft proposal.
	   The proposal, in the form of a letter Friday to the U.N. chief,
came after Secretary-General Kofi Annan's office indicated earlier
this week that it couldn't continue negotiating with Baghdad on an
end to the impasse on weapons inspections without more direction
from the council.
	   The U.N. chief proposed conducting a ``comprehensive review'' of
Iraq's progress to disarm itself in an effort to persuade Iraq to
rescind its Aug. 5 decision to halt cooperation with arms
inspectors.
	   The move has paralyzed surprise searches by U.N. weapons experts
who must certify that Iraq has destroyed its weapons of mass
destruction before the council will lift sanctions.
	   Baghdad has sought certain assurances from both Annan and the
council that the review would be carried out quickly and that there
would be a clear path to how sanctions could be eased.
	   According to the British draft proposal, the review would detail
the steps Iraq must take to comply with U.N. demands that it
destroy its weapons of mass destruction, and envisions a likely
timeframe to complete those steps ``assuming full Iraqi
compliance.''
	   It says the council sees no reason why the review couldn't start
soon after Iraq reverses its Aug. 5 decision and inspectors report
that they are receiving full cooperation from Baghdad.
	   However, the draft falls short of endorsing detailed modalities
for the review offered by Annan earlier this month. Annan proposed
a review that specifically would allow the council to determine
whether sanctions could be lifted.
	   ``Clearly council members cannot prejudge the outcome in advance
of their consideration of these reports,'' from inspectors and Iraq
on the progress of disarmament, says the draft from the president
of the council, Jeremy Greenstock of Britain.
	   Council members had been reluctant to give Baghdad any details
of how it planned to carry out the review, demanding first that
Iraq reverse the Aug. 5 decision.
	   The council was expected to discuss the proposal next week.
	   Also next week, the chief U.N. weapons inspector, Richard
Butler, was to report to the council on the outcome of two days of
talks by chemical weapons experts examining tests by U.S., French
and Swiss laboratories to determine whether Iraq loaded the deadly
nerve agent VX into missile warheads.
	   Iraq claims it was never able to produce enough VX nerve agent,
or stabilize it sufficiently, to load into missiles. But U.S. tests
showed traces of VX on fragments of warheads that Iraq filled
before the 1991 Gulf war.
	   The Iraqis challenged the validity of the U.S. test results,
prompting the United Nations to authorize a second series of tests
by French and Swiss scientists, which were being assessed by 17
experts from seven countries.
	   Butler has said that even if the French and Swiss labs don't
turn up traces of VX, Baghdad still has to account for the findings
by the U.S. Army's Aberdeen Proving Ground laboratory.

	   POERTSCHACH, Austria (AP) _ European Union leaders welcome two
new kids on their block Saturday _ German Chancellor-elect Gerhard
Schroeder and Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema _ at a summit
devoted to brainstorming about where the EU is going.
	   The debuts of Schroeder, a social democrat who takes office next
week, and D'Alema, an ex-communist sworn in this week, gives the
line-up of the West European leaders a stronger leftist tint.
	   Eleven of the 15 EU governments are headed by left-wing or
center-left leaders, two others are coalitions with socialists and
only in Ireland and Spain are conservatives in power.
	   In addition, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat was to brief
summit leaders on a West Bank land-for-peace accord during a
stopover Saturday in Austria on his way back from talks in the
United States, according to the Austria Press Agency.
	   The line-up at the top may have changed, but not some vexsome
issues facing West European leaders.
	   They must debate ways of maintaining Europe's economic recovery,
tackle high unemployment and say how they plan to implement painful
agricultural, budget and decision-making reforms needed if the EU
is to take in half-a-dozen newcomers in the years ahead.
	   The EU will launch a single currency in January _ after years of
debate and the leaders will be urged not to let the euro be the end
of the line.
	   ``A signal must be sent from Poertschach that a single market
and a single currency is not the end of the EU journey,'' Austrian
Chancellor and summit chairman Viktor Klima said ahead of the
summit.
	   Forecasts issued this week showed the financial turmoil sweeping
Asia, Russia and Latin America will drag EU growth down to 2.4
percent in 1999, from a previously predicted 3 percent.
	   That outlook and the emergence of more leftist leaders is
creating pressure for a more hands-on approach to boost growth
through more public investment or cutting interest rates.
	   ``The competitiveness of our companies ... must be further
bolstered,'' French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said this week in
Paris. ``A decline in interest rates is essential to that end.''
	   Schroeder and other euro-Socialists have also indicated rates
should be lower, but central bank governors have resisted that.
They argue rates in key EU economies such as France and Germany are
already among the world's lowest.
	   The EU leaders will be keen to hear British Prime Minister Tony
Blair's views on a common European defense policy. Blair said this
week he may be prepared to drop the long-standing opposition of his
Conservative predecessors to giving the EU a military capability
within the NATO alliance.
	   His spokesman Alistair Campbell explained Blair wanted European
countries to be able to mount peacekeeping or combat operations to
deal with crises like Bosnia or Kosovo.
	   ``Poertschach provides an excellent opportunity to relaunch the
debate on the future of the Union,'' said EU Commission President
Jacques Santer, in a letter to the leaders. ``Europe must rid
itself of its cliched image of an economic giant but political
dwarf.''
	   Acknowledging the EU's political importance to the Palestinians,
Arafat was to fly to Austria to brief leaders on the U.S.-brokered
peace deal, the Austria Press Agency reported Friday.
	   Quoting the chancellor's office, APA said Friday that Austrian
Chancellor Viktor Klima had won agreement from the other EU leaders
to invite Arafat to brief them on the outcome of the talks at Wye
Plantation in Maryland.

Auburn coach Bowden resigns

<TEXT>
	   AUBURN, Alabama (AP) _ Terry Bowden, more successful in his
first five years than any football coach in Auburn history,
resigned Friday amidst the team's worst start in 52 years.
	   Bowden said his resignation was effective immediately. Defensive
coordinator Bill Oliver will become the interim coach for
Saturday's home game against Louisiana Tech.
	   ``There continues to be a very serious and divisive public
debate about the certainty of my status at Auburn University,''
Bowden said in a statement. ``This is extremely harmful to the
morale of the Auburn fans, our football staff, and most importantly
the young men who play football at Auburn.
	   ``It is because of my love for these players and of Auburn
University that I cannot allow this painful controversy to
continue. Someone must be willing to step up to the plate and put
closure to this endless debate if Auburn is going to move forward.
I believe that someone must now be me.''
	   Bowden's Tigers are 1-5 this season, his sixth. His first five
years were unmatched in Auburn football history. He was 20-0 in his
first 20 games and took Auburn to the Southeastern Conference
championship game last year. He had signed a seven-year contract in
December.
	   Bowden, 42, son of Florida State coach Bobby Bowden and brother
of Tulane coach Tommy Bowden, came to Auburn from Samford in 1993.
He went 11-0 his first season, a probation year at Auburn in which
the Tigers were prevented from going to a bowl.
	   He extended his winning streak to 20 straight and never lost
more than four games in a season. He was 46-12-1 through his first
five seasons.
	   But injuries, off-field problems and a poor recruiting class
have hounded Bowden all season. The Tigers lost five centers, a
fullback and a backup running back to injuries while playing one of
the nation's toughest schedules.
	   Auburn also lost seven signees due to grades. And that news came
after starting safety Martavius Houston was kicked off the team for
rules violations and starting receiver Robert Baker was dismissed
when he pleaded guilty to cocaine trafficking.
	   Headed into last week's game against Florida, athletic director
David Housel had refused to discuss Bowden's future.
	   ``We are not going to get involved with rhetoric and negativity.
Coach Bowden is our football coach,'' Housel said.
	   During his weekly news conference Tuesday, Bowden had tried to
sound upbeat.
	   ``You have to just keep believing in yourself and your
players,'' Bowden said. ``You've got to have a little more
conviction and perseverance and convey it to your players ... a
little stronger will, a little tougher skin.''

	   HONOLULU (AP) _ The record for the Koolau Golf Club is 63.
That's not strokes _ it's for balls lost in one round.
	   The course, at the base of a spectacular mountain range
separating downtown Honolulu from the western side of the island,
is considered the toughest in the United States _ and has been
called many more unprintable names.
	   New owners, however, are trying to soften its image to the
``most challenging.'' They've made some of the king-sized traps
smaller, widened the fairways and cut back some of the lush
tropical vegetation that made for peekaboo shots around corners and
trees. They've also installed a new computer system that guides
players around the course.
	   That's good news for any golfer who ever struggled around the 80
bunkers and over the six rain-carved ravines that each carry
100-plus yards. The layout measures a formidable 7,310 yards (6,652
meters) from the championship tees and a more manageable 5,102
yards (4,642 meters) from the front tees.
	   Just to hear the name Koolau brought a pained smile to Scott
Simpson, the 1987 U.S. Open champion who used to live in Hawaii.
	   ``It's the hardest I've ever played,'' he said. ``I've played it
from the back tees and it's a monster. And it's beautiful, all at
the same time.''
	   For those who follow such things, the USGA's slope rating for
the 6-year-old course is 155, the maximum allowed. But the rating
is really a lot higher.
	   When the local section of the PGA rated the course, it came up
with a 162. Impossible, said the national PGA, which sent a team of
officials for precise measurement. Its rating was higher, topping
out at 172.
	   It's been said players should plan on losing a ball for every
stroke of their handicap _ at least.
	   ``It's a nice place to have a picnic,'' weekend golfer Leslie
Miller said. ``It's not fair because the carries are too long. My
best is a 96 from the red tees. I was happy with my score, but
happier that I lost only six balls.''
	   Dean Wilson, who plays on the Asian PGA Tour, holds the course
record at 69.
	   Rob Nelson, who has transformed several other courses in Hawaii,
was brought in by American Golf Corp. to soften the course's image
and make it more playable.
	   ``We have already made giant strides,'' the new general manager
said as he looked out over the fairway from the marble-and-glass
clubhouse. ``All the bunkers, which were designed to trap drives,
have been rebuilt.
	   ``We don't want the reputation of being a one-time golf course.
We want to be a user-friendly course.''
	   To help players, Koolau has also installed the ParView Global
Positions System (GPS) as part of its dlrs 1.8 million renovation.
The state-of-the-art ``Information Superfairway'' is a small
monitor in all the carts that can tell players where they are on a
hole, where they want to be and pretty much everything but what
they had for breakfast.
	   Don't laugh, it can actually place lunch and dinner orders for
players approaching the ninth and 18th holes.
	   ``It helps tremendously,'' Nelson said. ``It shows you where
you're going and what you should do.''
	   At the first tee, the system overview lists distances to hazards
and through them. There is a paragraph from the host pro about how
best to play the hole.
	   On the fairway, the GPS keeps players updated on how far they've
come and how many yards remain to the center of the green. Once
they're within 200 yards (182 meters), the overview transforms into
a view of the hole, showing pin placement, slope and undulation.
	   The system clock starts after players hit their first tee shots
and is set for a 4 1/2-hour round. If they're on the second green
but should be on the third tee, the computer tells them.
	   ``You really need it on a course like this where you have blind
shots,'' Nelson said. ``The first time you're out here, you have no
clue and the 10th time, you want to know how far.''
	   All the changes are welcomed by golfers, including Simpson,
whose best score at Koolau was a 71.
	   ``There's just no margin for error,'' he said. ``I should go
back and try to see what I could shoot. It's fun to play it once in
a while because it's the ultimate test.''

Storms bring severe floods to Wales, at least one killed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CARDIFF, Wales (AP) _ Heavy rains and gale-force winds brought
severe flooding to south Wales, where at least one person was swept
away by a swollen stream and killed. A second man was missing and
feared drowned on Friday.
	   Flooding has also affected Scotland and central, north and
southwest England.
	   Thousands of acres of farmland were under water in a wide belt
stretching across south Wales from Cardiganshire to Monmouthshire,
and 400 people were moved from their homes.
	   A man was seen swept away in a fast-flowing stream in the
Treorchy area of the Rhondda Valley, 20 miles (30 km) west of
Cardiff, on Thursday night. After a police search, his body was
discovered Friday, but he was not immediately identified.
	   Farmer William Mason, 62, was missing after he went out in the
storm to save his livestock from the flood-swollen River Wye near
his home at Clifford, 50 miles (80 km) north of Cardiff.
	   Police and fire crews in parts of south Wales moved scores of
people from their homes to the shelter of local schools and
emergency centers after rivers burst their banks.
	   Emergency services in Abergavenny, 25 miles (40 km) northeast of
Cardiff, plucked drivers to safety after they were trapped in their
vehicles by seven feet (2 meters) of floodwater when the River Usk
overflowed.

Belle invokes free agency clause after White Sox refuse to up

	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Albert Belle became eligible for free agency
Friday when the White Sox refused his demand for a dlrs 4.25
million raise over three years, then said he wants to remain in
Chicago.
	   Belle's contract contains a unique provision allowing him to
demand the White Sox keep him one of the three highest-paid players
in baseball.
	   ``I've said all along I was happy I'm in Chicago and I would
like to stay in Chicago,'' Belle told The Associated Press. ``I
consider this a starting point. There's nothing to get all bent out
of shape about.''
	   ``I'm going to leave it up to (agent) Arn Tellem and (owner)
Jerry Reinsdorf to work out a deal,'' he added. ``There are ways to
work out things where both sides are happy.''
	   After one of the best seasons in his career, Belle becomes the
top outfielder available in a class that already includes Bernie
Williams of the New York Yankees and Henry Rodriguez of the Chicago
Cubs. Belle hit .328 and hit 49 home runs and 48 doubles. He led
the AL in slugging percentage (.655) and total bases (399), and set
club records for homers, doubles, total bases, extra-base hits (99)
and RBIs (152).
	   He was second in the AL in doubles, homers and RBIs. He won a
Silver Slugger award earlier this week.
	   Belle signed a dlrs 55 million, five-year contract with Chicago
as a free agent in November 1996. But his contract allows him to
demand a raise if he drops out of the top three in salary.
	   He fell into a tie for fourth after Gary Sheffield received dlrs
7.5 million from the Florida Marlins and Los Angeles Dodgers to
waive his no-trade clause and accept a trade to the Dodgers in May.
Under the definition of salary in Belle's contract, he is tied for
fourth at dlrs 10 million with the Cubs' Sammy Sosa, trailing
Boston pitcher Pedro Martinez (dlrs 12,083,333), Atlanta pitcher
Greg Maddux (dlrs 11.5 million) and Sheffield (dlrs 11,416,667).
	   ``Albert enjoyed a tremendous second half and a season that
ranks among the best offensive years in franchise history, but we
are not going to allow anything to disrupt the on-field direction
Jerry Manuel has established for this team,'' general manager Ron
Schueler said in a statement.
	   Belle has 30 days to test the free agency market, and can either
sign with another team or return to the White Sox. Belle said he
and Tellem will listen to all offers, but staying with Chicago is
his first choice.

	   EDITOR'S NOTE: The Titanic lies 2 1-2 miles (4 kilometers)
beneath the waves; more people have gone into space than have dived
this deep. One who has is AP national writer Helen O'Neill, who
covered the first tourist dive to the wreck in September. This is
her report.

 &UR; By HELEN O'NEILL &QC; 
 &UR; AP National Writer &QC; 
	   AT THE BOTTOM OF THE NORTH ATLANTIC (AP) _ In the deepest black
of the ocean, the tiny egg-shaped craft glides toward the wreck
like a curious spaceship from another world.
	   Up the enormous hull it climbs, over the mangled decks. Hovering
by the hole that was once the grand staircase it pauses just long
enough for passengers to glimpse a chandelier. Then it's off again,
flying by cabins and capstans, plunging past rivers of rust,
skirting the jagged overhangs by the promenade deck where the rich
and famous once strolled.
	   Squashed beside a pilot in the 7-foot (2-meter) cockpit of a
26-foot (8-meter) submarine, the two tourists gasp.
	   Titanic.
	   Nose to nose with the great ship's bow, they are deeper than
almost anyone has dived. Barely 2 inches (5 centimeters) of nickel
and steel separate them from eternity.
	   ``Magnificent,'' whistles one. ``Like a ghost.''
	   The submersible shudders and swings to the right, banging into
one of the tears of rust that drip from the wreck like stalactites.
Sediment swirls around the portholes. For a moment it seems like
they're lost.
	   The pilot frowns. The radio crackles. The tourists fall silent.
	   At 12,500 feet (3,810 meters), no one doubts the power of the
``unsinkable'' Titanic to drag a few more victims down.
	   Or of nature to blow technology to shreds.
	   They wore fleeces and hats and heavy jumpsuits. They packed
Styrofoam cups into exterior baskets and watched as the pressure
(6,000 pounds per square inch or 420 kilogram per square
centimeter) compressed them to the size of a thimble. They brought
cameras. And they brought questions.
	   Do tourists really belong here? Does anyone?
	   This summer a dozen sightseers paid dlrs 32,500 each to be
ferried to the middle of the North Atlantic and dropped into the
ocean in an 18-ton sphere. They spent 14 hours in a cold, cramped
three-person submersible, after free-falling to one of the most
inhospitable places on earth, with little to do during the descent
except watch the plankton swirl and contemplate their reason for
being there.
	   What did they hope to accomplish in their glowing cocoon,
creeping through the remains of another era, past other peoples'
teacups and suitcases and bedsprings? Reverent pilgrims come to pay
their last respects, or brash intruders desecrating sacred ground?
	   The answers lie on the ocean floor.
	   Resting in her lonely berth about 400 miles (640 kilometers)
southeast of Newfoundland, Titanic is majestic and ghostly and
eerily frail. The only natural light is the blue-green glow of the
luminescent fish that dance around her bow. The only air is inside
the white and orange sphere that keeps the visitors alive.
	   On April 14, 1912, the world's most luxurious passenger liner
steamed into an iceberg and split apart with a wrenching roar,
scattering more than 1,500 bodies into the ocean. Their cries,
wrote one survivor, echoed across the water ``like locusts on a
midsummer's night.''
	   Eighty-six years later, the beep, beep, beep of a sonar echoes
across the same spot, like a heartbeat-monitor reassuring visitors
they are safe.
	   But they can't escape the cries of those who went before. Or the
tremors they feel as they squeeze through the submersible's narrow
opening and hear the hatch slammed shut.
	   ``The night before my dive, the sea was so dark and I was
looking out of my cabin, wondering about all those people who had
died, and how they had probably looked out of their cabins at the
same sea,'' said Heike Schnellbach, a 33-year-old from Wiesbaden,
Germany, who won her dive in a contest. ``That is when I really
wondered what I was doing here.''
	   The first Titanic tourists included five Americans, five
Germans, an Australian and a Briton. They boarded the 400-foot
(122-meter) Russian science ship, the Akademic Keldysh, at St.
John's, Newfoundland, and spent 36 hours heading south. For the
next seven days they lived at sea, floating over Titanic's grave.
	   Titanic sank just south of the Grand Banks, where the cold
Labrador Current collides with the warm Gulf Stream, churning up
some of the roughest seas on earth. The weather is notoriously
unpredictable here, changing from sunny to stormy in hours. The
greatest danger, as the tourists were reminded, is not the safety
of the submersibles _ Mir 1 and Mir 2 _ but the fickleness of
nature.
	   ``Attention all passengers. We are arriving at the Titanic
site.''
	   The message booms through the ship's intercom, and everyone
hurries on deck. The morning is warm and sunny, so peaceful it's
hard to focus on sorrow. Those who try soon give up. In silence,
they watch the crew drop four acoustic transponders that will form
an electronic grid around the wreck, navigation guides for divers
below.

	   ``I keep trying to remind myself of the people clinging to the
sides and the screaming and the horror,'' says Anne White, a
63-year-old retired teacher from Taunton, England. ``But I just
can't.''
	   On the ocean floor, reminders are everywhere.
	   Titanic's wreckage is strewn over at least a mile (1.6
kilometers), the bow resting nearly 2,000 feet (610 meters) from
the stern. In the middle is the so-called debris field, dotted by
great chunks of black coal, some decorated with feathery pink
plants, others with delicate white spider crabs. An occasional
rattail fish swims by. Nothing else moves but the sub.
	   Scattered amid the coal are fragments of everyday life. Wine
bottles and teapots, a hot-water bottle, a comb, a toilet bowl _
images so stark, so ordinary, they will haunt some divers for days.
	   Mir 2 lands next to a shiny white plate that sits upright on the
sand as though it were dropped there yesterday. In the center, the
red flag and white star insignia of Titanic's owner, the White Star
Line. Two and a half miles (4 kilometers) above, on the white linen
tables of the Keldysh, other tourists dine off replica plates.
	   A murky shape looms in the right-hand porthole. A suitcase
perhaps, or a chest.
	   ``Books,'' cries one passenger. ``It's a bookcase.''
	   So it is, covered in sediment, bent and misshapen, barely
recognizable, but still doing its job. A couple of thick,
leather-bound books are tucked into the top shelf, so close they
look as if you could dust off the jackets and start reading.
	   Evgeny Cherniaev, the 43-year-old Russian pilot, an intensely
serious man who knows the wreck as well as anyone, allows himself a
smile. He has made hundreds of submersible dives, including 25 to
the Titanic. He piloted James Cameron in 1995 when the film
director was shooting scenes for his movie.
	   But Cherniaev has never seen the bookcase before, never landed
at this section of the wreck.
	   ``Titanic,'' he says softly, ``shows you something different
every dive.''
	   He guides the spotlights past the books to the shadowy outline
of a pair of shoes, spaced a few inches (centimeters) apart in the
sand. Large and flat, they look like a man's.
	   ``Size 9 1-2 ,'' guesses one of the passengers, breaking the
shiver of unease that has crept into the cockpit.
	   Quietly, they discuss who might have worn them. Perhaps one of
the band members who played ragtime on the decks as the last
lifeboats were lowered. Or one of the young radio operators, so
swamped with messages from passengers eager to try the new Marconi
system, they ignored six iceberg warnings from other ships.
	   Could the shoes have belonged to Captain Edward J. Smith, known
as the ``millionaires' captain'' for his loyal following of wealthy
transatlantic passengers? Smith had planned to retire after
Titanic's maiden voyage from Southhampton to New York. Had he ended
his career clinging to a bookcase as it sank to the bottom of the
world?
	   ``It took the ship 2 1-2 hours to sink,'' whispers one of the
tourists. ``And it has taken us two and a half hours to get here. I
wonder how long it took the owner of those shoes?''
	   ``Shoes,'' Cherniaev says with a shrug. ``We will see many
shoes.''
	   The enormity of the tragedy hits some divers in the debris
field. A copper kitchen pot reminds an Australian restaurateur of
the pots he cooks with back home. The captain's porcelain bathtub,
gleaming white against the murky hole that was once his cabin,
unsettles a German woman's sleep.
	   Others are moved by the fallen mast and the empty space of the
crow's nest, where lookout Frederick Fleet shouted ``iceberg right
ahead'' and rang the alarm three times.
	   For some, the enormous black hull, with its endless rows of
portholes, glass still intact, reminds them of Titanic's size _ and
shocking vulnerability.
	   ``You see the size,'' says Pat Brown, a 35-year-old undertaker
from Vallejo, California, ``and you are reminded how small you
are.''
	   For many, living above Titanic's grave was reminder enough.
	   Rocked by the waves where so many lost their lives, they
pondered the arrogance of those who built a 882-foot (269-meter)
luxury liner, equipped it with Turkish baths and a Parisian cafe _
and only enough lifeboats for half on board. They wondered about
the rigidity of a class system, where emigrants from steerage were
far less likely to survive than millionaires from first-class. And
they talked about the gallantry of a bygone era when the band
played on, women and children were lowered into lifeboats first,
and gentlemen changed into dinner jackets to die.
	   What would happen today, they wondered, if the Keldysh hit an
iceberg, or one of the submersibles sprung a leak? Would they
witness the same muddled acts of bravery and desperation? Would
wealth matter?
	   And what of their own little society on the ship? Like Titanic,
the Keldysh was making the voyage of a lifetime. Like Titanic it
carried a mixture of people who may never have mingled otherwise:
wealthy adventurers, lucky contest winners who had won ``Titanic
Dive'' prizes in Europe and Australia, journalists. Like Titanic,
its crew, including a dozen scientists, were more worried about
survival than adventure.

	   With little government money in Russia for science, they had
leased their ship to tourists, as they had to filmmakers in the
past. It seems the only solution if the Keldysh is to continue
exploring ocean beds around the world.
	   ``Like us, the passengers on the Titanic took it for granted
they were safe,'' says Anne White, ``Like us, if something goes
wrong, the ocean will make equals of us all.''
	   For the most part, such reflections came later. On dive days,
the drama of watching the submersibles swung by a crane over the
side of the ship and dropped into the heaving sea took everyone's
mind off the tragedy.
	   ``There is so much going on in terms of the technology,'' says
Buck Kamphausen, a 59-year-old undertaker from Vallejo, California,
who also runs a commercial diving company. ``During the dive, the
submersible earns all your respect.''
	   Others confessed an uncomfortable guilt at not feeling more.
	   ``You get so caught up in the adventure of it,'' says Oliver
Hesse, a 24-year-old student from Berlin, Germany, pale and silent
before his dive, ecstatic as he drank a celebratory beer afterward.
``There are just a few of us and we are going somewhere few will
ever go, seeing something that will be gone in a generation.''
	   Scientists aren't sure how long Titanic will survive, but they
agree she doesn't have much time. The iron-eating rusticles that
lend her such grace are consuming her. Within decades Titanic will
likely collapse into a heap on the ocean floor.
	   Submersibles have undoubtedly accelerated the process. Since
Titanic was discovered in 1985, scientists, explorers, salvors and
filmmakers have all left their mark. This summer, an American
salvage company, which earlier retrieved thousands of Titanic
artifacts, yanked up a 26-by-20-foot (8-by-8-meter) segment of
hull.
	   Titanic's debris field is now littered with modern debris _
sacks of weights and ropes that some submersibles drop as ballast
to ascend to the surface. The Mirs drop only water yet they, too,
lose small parts or bump into pieces of the wreck during dives.
	   On this expedition, the Mirs made four dives each over a
five-day period, ushering 16 visitors to the deep.
	   Before the dives, the tourists immersed themselves in Titanic
lore, learning about the history of the ship, those who built her
and those who sailed in her. They studied the wreck and the
technology that would take them there: hydraulics and navigation,
sonar imaging and emergency systems. They learned what not to lean
against during their 2 1-2 hour descent.
	   They were told that they would dive with enough food and oxygen
for three days. And that they would see no bodies on the ocean
floor.
	   Anatoly Sagalevitch, head of the manned submersible laboratory
of the P.P. Shirshov Institute of Oceanology in Moscow, which owns
the Mirs, wrestled at first with the idea of guiding tourists to
Titanic. More people have gone into space than have dived so deep,
he thought. Perhaps it was better to leave history be.
	   Piloting the first dive, he had no qualms.
	   ``Titanic makes people think,'' Sagalevitch says, ``about good
and bad, about bravery and cowardice, about how small we are as
humans, and how fragile life is. Most of all, it makes us think
more deeply about how we should lead our lives.''
	   Munching ham and cheese sandwiches in the red glow of their
submersible, suspended over Titanic's bridge, the tourists have no
misgivings. Sure, they feel uneasy as they bump the ocean floor.
Sure, they contemplate their own mortality. And yes, they can't
wait to show the world their little compressed coffee cups and
boast, ``I had lunch on the Titanic.''
	   But as they gaze at the shiny bronze pedestal that was once the
ship's wheel, as they listen to the theme song from the movie, as
they say a silent prayer for those who died, no one doubts their
right to be here.
	   ``I think the dive changes you a little,'' says Hendrik Hey, a
33-year-old television producer from Munich, Germany. ``And I think
the change will stay with you for the rest of your life.''
	   When they surface, they will be criticized _ by descendants of
victims, among others _ who say the wreck is a mass grave that
should be left alone. They will be vilified in a Russian newspaper
as thrill-seeking ``nouveaux riches'' with nothing better to do
than fling their money at ghosts. They will be threatened with
legal action.
	   Soaring above Titanic's bow, they know exactly what they will
say.
	   That visiting this place is to honor it. That learning about the
dead, and remembering them, is to respect them. That crunched into
an underwater sphere in the cold and the dark, they have never been
so sure of the limits of mankind, the vulnerability of technology,
the power of nature.
	   That the tragedy of the Titanic, which one survivor said ``made
the world rub its eyes and awake,'' still has the power to do so.

Ulster Unionist leader under pressure on new government

	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Nobel Peace Prize-winner David
Trimble is under pressure from all sides as his Ulster Unionist
Party holds its annual conference Saturday.
	   The Protestant leader shared this year's prize with Catholic
moderate John Hume. However, it is unclear if the international
acclaim will strengthen Trimble's ability to keep his party from
splitting over formation of a cross-community government for
Northern Ireland.
	   Trimble was credited with delivering a bare majority of
Protestant support for April's accord on Northern Ireland. A
legislative Assembly was elected in June and nominated him to head
a new administration. But he commands support from only 30 of the
58 Unionist members in the Assembly.
	   Trimble has insisted he won't agree to form any government
involving the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party unless the Irish
Republican Army starts disarming.
	   Sinn Fein leaders blame him for the gridlock in formation of the
government _ intended as the bedrock of the agreement.
	   Hume's Social Democratic and Labor Party, the major
representative of the north's Irish Catholics, says Trimble is
wrong to insist on disarmament now since the agreement specifies
only that it should happen by mid-2000.
	   But many in Trimble's party are determined not to take part in a
government with Sinn Fein as long as the IRA reserves the right to
hold stockpiled weaponry.
	   ``The Nobel is a great personal honor for David Trimble. But the
Ulster Unionist grassroots would be suspicious of what Mr. Trimble
may have had to give away in exchange for that prize,'' said Peter
Weir, a former Trimble ally who broke with his leader on the eve of
the agreement.
	   Sinn Fein leaders say the Ulster Unionist chief should wield the
Nobel honor as a weapon against his critics.
	   ``He must tell them that they have had their day,'' said Martin
McGuinness, a reputed former IRA commander, who is believed likely
to be one of Sinn Fein's two representatives in any new
adminstration.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Three days ahead of its deadline for
Slobodan Milosevic to comply with Western demands, NATO was sending
two top generals to Belgrade on Saturday to demand more Kosovo
withdrawals by the Yugoslav president.
	   Gen. Wesley Clark, the alliance's supreme military commander,
and German Gen. Klaus Naumann were headed to Belgrade on Saturday
to seek more pullbacks of police units and equipment from the
separatist province, where scattered skirmishes continue.
	   NATO says it will reimpose the threat of airstrikes on Serbian
military targets if Milosevic doesn't back up all his pledges from
an Oct. 12 agreement by Tuesday.
	   NATO likely will set up a base for its air surveillance mission
over Kosovo near the Macedonian capital of Skopje, Macedonian
defense minister Lazar Kitanoski said Friday.
	   With Western nations only beginning to organize a 2,000-strong
group of unarmed monitors to verify Yugoslavia's actions in Kosovo,
the deadline is widely expected to be pushed back for a second
time. But no official action by NATO is expected until Monday.
	   A NATO official, briefing reporters in Brussels, Belgium, on
condition of anonymity, said Friday that ``we have seen great
progress but we are far from adequate compliance.''
	   The Serb-led Yugoslav government reiterated claims that it has
fulfilled its terms of the agreement with U.S. envoy Richard
Holbrooke and that ethnic Albanian rebels are responsible for
continuing violence.
	   Serbian Premier Mirko Marjanovic said it was time the West
realized that the crisis in Kosovo was caused by ``terrorism of
Albanian separatists.''
	   While fighting in Kosovo effectively halted in late September,
there is sporadic gunfire and almost nightly shelling in different
locations _ evidence the conflict has not ended.
	   Under the agreement, Milosevic pledged to withdraw special
police and army units sent to the province after he launched his
crackdown on the KLA Feb. 28. Hundreds of people have been killed
and an estimated 300,000 driven from their homes.
	   Milosevic also agreed to let refugees return home safely and
enable international relief agencies to bring them aid. He also
pledged to negotiate with ethnic Albanian leaders on the future of
Kosovo, a province of the main Yugoslav republic Serbia.
	   Ethnic Albanians make up about 90 percent of the province's 2
million inhabitants, and most favor independence or self-rule.
	   The KLA issued a statement Friday reiterating that it is keeping
to a general cease-fire but saying it would respond and defend
villages if Serb and Yugoslav forces move on them.
	   U.S. envoy Christopher Hill was in neighboring Albania to brief
government officials and urge them to support the U.S.-led peace
effort. Albania had permitted rebels to set up sanctuaries in the
north.
	   ``We are looking for full compliance,'' Hill told reporters.
``We'd like to see full compliance. I don't want to predict when
exactly we'll see it but we are working very hard to ensure it.''
	   At the United Nations, the Security Council was planning to vote
Saturday on a resolution endorsing the Kosovo peace accord, despite
potential opposition from China and Russia over language that would
allow NATO to ``take appropriate steps.'' to enforce the agreement.
	   The council is under pressure to adopt a resolution enshrining
the accord so the verifiers can begin Kosovo.
	   The American head of the Kosovo ground verification mission,
William Walker, arrived Friday in Kosovo after meeting Milosevic,
vowing to improve conditions for refugees and help guarantee
success of the peace agreement.

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Despite opposition from China and Russia,
the Security Council pressed ahead to vote on a resolution
endorsing the Kosovo peace accord and allowing NATO to enforce it
by taking ``appropriate steps.''
	   A draft resolution formally tabled late Friday and expected to
be adopted Saturday notes that in the event of an emergency,
``action may be needed'' to ensure the safety of unarmed monitors
who will patrol the southern Serb province to make sure fighting
between Yugoslav forces and ethnic Albanians has stopped.
	   Russia and China have opposed any language threatening Serbs and
ethnic Albanians with force if they don't comply with the Oct. 12
agreement, which averted NATO strikes on Serb targets.
	   It wasn't clear if the two permanent council members would veto
the resolution or simply abstain from it. Both were awaiting word
from their governments ahead of further consultations Saturday
morning and a scheduled vote later in the day.
	   ``We are not in favor of the current draft,'' Chinese Ambassador
Qin Huasun said after consultations Friday evening.
	   The Security Council is under pressure to adopt a resolution
enshrining the accord and protecting the verification team.
Potential troop-contributing nations are concerned about safety of
their forces and want the council to endorse the plan first, with
provisions for enforcement.
	   Fighting between Serb forces and ethnic Albanians _ who make up
90 percent of Kosovo's population _ has killed hundreds of people
and forced around 300,000 from their homes since a Serb crackdown
began in February.
	   Under the deal brokered by U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke,
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic agreed to a cease-fire, to
withdraw his special police forces from the province, and to allow
a 2,000-strong team to verify the agreement.
	   Russia has religious and cultural ties to the Serbs, and Russian
lawmakers warned NATO Friday that airstrikes on Yugoslavia would
prompt Moscow to offer weapons to Serbs. China is traditionally
opposed to any military intervention into what it considers an
internal matter, fearing a precedent could be set for its own
disputes with Taiwan and Tibet.
	   Diplomats said China and Russia specifically objected to
elements of the resolution that would give NATO the right to take
``steps'' to ensure full implementation of the deal and the safety
of the verification team from the Vienna-based Organization for
Security and Cooperation.
	   The final draft incorporated some suggestions floated by Russia
in its own draft resolution circulated earlier Friday. But it
discounts Moscow's calls for Yugoslavia and ethnic Albanians _ and
not NATO _ ``to take appropriate steps'' to ensure that the
agreement is enforced and that the verification personnel are
protected.
	   Russian Ambassador Sergey Lavrov declined to say how he would
vote, saying only: ``There are no changes in the Russian
position.''
	   Russia has said that it would not go along with any resolution
that was tougher than a Sept. 23 resolution which helped form the
basis of the Holbrooke deal. That resolution said the council would
consider unspecified measures if both sides didn't comply but
didn't give any explicit threats of force.
	   The current draft resolution endorses the Oct. 12 deal and
requests OSCE, NATO and their member states ``to take appropriate
steps to ensure their full implementation.''
	   It demands ethnic Albanians and Yugoslav forces comply fully and
swiftly with previous U.N. resolutions and cooperate fully with the
verification mission. It stresses the need for both sides to start
talks on a political solution.
	   The draft welcomes Yugoslavia's commitment to protect the OSCE
monitors and decides that an arms embargo imposed in a March
resolution won't apply for weapons and equipment destined for the
OSCE or NATO or their member states.

	   Facts about Titanic, which split apart and sank April 14, 1912,
with the loss of some 1,500 passengers and crew after it struck an
iceberg in the North Atlantic:
	   _ The largest moving object ever built by man. At 882 feet, 8
inches (269 meters), it was as long as four New York City blocks
and as tall as an 11-story building.
	   _ The first ocean-liner with a swimming pool and a gymnasium.
The ``Queen of the Ocean'' also boasted Turkish baths, a kennel for
first-class dogs, a 50-phone switchboard, a jeweled copy of the
Rubaiyat and 6,000 tons of coal.
	   _ Titanic took about 2 1-2 hours to sink. Lookout Frederick
Fleet spotted the iceberg at 11:40 p.m. At 2:20 a.m., Titanic's
stern vanished into the ocean.
	   _ Number on board: about 2,210, including about 900 crew. Only
705 survived.
	   _ Titanic's most prominent passenger was John Jacob Astor, a
real-estate mogul worth dlrs 100 million. He went down with his
Airedale, Kitty. His pregnant wife survived.
	   _ Other notable victims include Isidor Straus, founder of Macy's
department store, and his wife, Ida; millionaire playboy Benjamin
Guggenheim, traveling with his mistress, Madame Aubert of Paris
(who survived); and George Widner, heir to the largest fortune in
Philadelphia.
	   _ J. Bruce Ismay, managing director of the White Star Line,
which owned Titanic, survived the disaster but not public scorn. He
was vilified in the press as ``J. Brute Ismay.''
	   _ The band played ragtime as lifeboats were lowered. Legend has
it that their last number was ``Nearer My God to Thee.''
	   _ Titanic's maiden voyage had an ominous start. The luxury liner
narrowly avoided colliding with another ship, The New York, as it
pulled out of Southampton harbor.
	   _ Two baby boys from France, who became known as the Titanic
waifs, survived. They had been kidnapped by their father, who
boarded the ship under an assumed name and put them in the last
lifeboat. They were later reunited with their mother.

	   BABYLON, Iraq (AP) _ Consider the difficulties of visiting Iraq:
No airline flies here, the hotels are rundown and there are
periodic threats of American military attacks.
	   Not surprisingly, few tourists, except Muslim pilgrims, have
come since the 1990 Gulf crisis.
	   But small groups of determined travelers _ mostly retirees and
archaeology buffs from Europe _ are beginning to brave obstacles to
see Iraq, breathing new life into a tourism industry that all but
died during eight years of U.N. trade sanctions. The sanctions,
which are still in effect, were imposed to punish Iraq for its 1990
invasion of Kuwait.
	   With no publicity or official fuss, the first tourist groups
this year arrived in late March from France, Germany, Switzerland
and Austria.
	   ``After I checked in, I went to my room, opened the windows and
said `now I am here at last,''' said Maren Rudholz, a 75-year-old
retired history teacher from Hamburg.
	   It was her lifelong ambition to come to Iraq, Mrs. Rudholz said.
So she jumped at the chance when her travel agent sent brochures
about a tour.
	   ``We are brave girls, grown ups, made tough by life,'' she said,
talking excitedly at the breakfast table with others in her group
of 14 Germans _ all above 60 years of age and most dressed in
shorts, sneakers and straw hats.
	   Showing little sign of fatigue from the 16-hour journey from
Frankfurt, the Germans boarded a bus for Babylon, the city where
King Hammurabi developed one of the greatest ancient legal codes
about 3,700 years ago.
	   Because U.N. sanctions bar flights to and from Iraq, the usual
way to get to Baghdad is to fly to Amman, Jordan, then take a
10-hour bus ride across bleak desert landscape to the land of the
Tigris and Euphrates rivers.
	   A day after the German group toured Babylon's palace, built by
King Nebuchadnezzar, a couple of visitors had the whole place to
themselves except for a group of Iraqi schoolboys, their shouts
echoing in the courtyards and in the throne room, where tradition
holds that Alexander the Great died in 323 B.C.
	   Using the ruins as foundation, Iraqi archaeologists rebuilt the
palace complex on President Saddam Hussein's orders between 1982
and 1989 with similar baked mud bricks. Some of the ancient bricks
are stamped with the name of Nebuchadnezzar, who died in 562 B.C.;
the new ones have Saddam's name.
	   Iraq offers more than 1,000 tourist sites, including the ruins
of Erech in the south where Sumerians established a flourishing
urban civilization in 3,000 B.C. and invented cuneiform writing.
	   Before 1990, about a million people used to visit Iraq each
year, the chairman of Iraq's tourist board, Sirwan Abdul-Kadir,
said in an interview. He wouldn't give figures for later years.
	   ``The figures are low. ... They are well behind the 1990
dateline ... yet they are increasing,'' Abdul-Kadir said.
	   Travel agents say tourism was virtually nil in the first few
years after the 1991 Gulf War when U.S.-led allies drove Iraq out
of Kuwait.
	   Falah Abdul-Hadi, a former archaeologist who has run a souvenir
shop since 1988 in Babylon, said tourists began returning in 1995.
Last year, a few thousand tourists came, he said.
	   Before 1990, about 70 percent of visitors to Iraq were
Westerners and the rest pilgrims visiting Shiite Muslim shrines in
southern Iraq. Today, most of the foreign arrivals are Shiite
Muslims from Iran, India, Pakistan and Lebanon on pilgrimage to the
shrines in Karbala and Najaf.
	   The 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war dried up the flow of pilgrims from
Iran, the largest Shiite nation, for 18 years. But amid warming
relations, the former foes reached an agreement on reopening the
pilgrim route in mid-August.
	   Since then, diplomats say, at least 25,000 Shiites, including
15,000 Iranians, have been visiting religious places in Iraq every
month, likely injecting about dlrs 480 million a year into the
economy.
	   The downside is that the crumbling hotel industry will not be
able to cope with the influx, says Abdul-Kadir, the tourist
official.
	   Iraq faces widespread shortages from U.N. sanctions that ban all
imports except food, medicines and other humanitarian goods.
	   Guests at Iraq hotels have become used to chipped plates, dull
silverware, rickety furniture and threadbare carpets.
	   But more than the inconveniences, foreigners stay away because
of the constant flow of bad news about Iraq, said Luay Sarsam, an
Austrian whose company in Vienna specializes in Middle Eastern
tours.
	   ``We are fighting against the storm,'' Sarsam, an ethnic Iraqi,
said during a visit to Baghdad.
	   He said many Europeans canceled trips during Iraq's dispute with
the United Nations in December 1997 over searching presidential
sites for banned weapons. U.S. military threats raised fears of
war, but the row ended in a negotiated agreement Feb. 23.
	   Mrs. Rudholz, the retired German teacher, said her son didn't
want her to go.
	   ``He said to me, `It is your own free will. Go. Hope to see you
again, if you are alive,''' she recounted.

	   Here are brief descriptions of the most popular tourist
attractions in Iraq:
	   BABYLON: The ruins of King Nebuchadnezzar's palace (605-562
B.C.) where some mud bricks can still be seen with stamps bearing
his name in cuneiform writing. The palace and other buildings were
reconstructed on President Saddam Hussein's orders with matching
mud bricks. Hundreds of them are stamped with an Arabic
inscription, saying Saddam, ``the protector of Iraq and the great
Iraqi civilization,'' rebuilt Nebuchadnezzar's palace between 1982
and 1989.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   ERECH: A Sumerian city between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers
where cuneiform writing was developed about 3,000 B.C. The first
city-states sprang up here in verdant farmlands crisscrossed by
man-made irrigation systems. Gilgamesh, a famous epic poem written
on clay tablets about 2000 B.C., is about a legendary king of
Erech. Iraq has restored part of the ruins, which are mostly heaps
of mud brick.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   UR: Sumerian site (2113-2006 B.C.) known for its ziggurrat, a
temple made of stacked rectangles of baked bricks. Long flights of
stairs lead up the three stories to the shrine that capped it.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   KARBALA: The golden-dome tomb of Hussein ibn Ali, the grandson
of Prophet Mohammed, who was killed here along with 72 companions
in 680 A.D. by soldiers of the Ommayad Caliph, Yezid, in a power
struggle for the leadership of Islam. The massacre led to the
schism in Islam, creating the Sunni and Shiite sects.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   NAJAF: The tomb of Ali, the Prophet's son-in-law and Hussein ibn
Ali's father. He was murdered 19 years before the Karbala massacre
in the doorway of his recently completed mosque at Kufa.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   HATRA: Well-preserved ruins of a honey-colored city from the
third century A.D. It is Iraq's sole stone ruin. The statuary here
shows Greek, Roman, Parthian influences. Along with Hatran gods _
Maran, Martan and Barmarin _ one can also see Hercules, Poseidon,
Eros, Hermes and Apollo.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   CTESIPHON: The arch of the great banqueting hall of King Sapor
(241-272 A.D.), the widest single-span vault of un-reinforced
brickwork in the world. It is about 75 feet wide and 110 feet high
(23 meters wide and 34 meters high).

Messier scores 600th career goal

	   SUNRISE, Florida (AP) _ Mark Messier of the Vancouver Canucks
became the 10th player in National Hockey League history to score
600 goals when he connected against the Florida Panthers at 12:58
of the third period.
	   Messier, a member of six Stanley Cup-winning teams, took a pass
from behind the net by Alexander Mogilny and hit a one-timer that
sliced between the near post and goaltender Kirk McLean. His third
goal of the year gave the Canucks a 5-0 lead.
	   Messier's teammates streamed out from the Vancouver bench to
congratulate their captain. The crowd of 18,070 gave Messier warm
applause.
	   The 20-year veteran joined former Edmonton linemates Wayne
Gretzky and Jari Kurri in reaching 600. Gretzky, now with the New
York Rangers, is the career leader with 886 goals. Kurri retired
after last season with 601.
	   Gordie Howe is second on the career list with 801, followed by
Marcel Dionne (731), Phil Esposito (717) and Mike Gartner (708).
Messier needs 14 goals to move into sixth place ahead of Mario
Lemieux (613), Bobby Hull (610) and Dino Ciccarelli (602).
	   ``I've never been focused on individual goals and milestones,
but this one _ only nine players have done it,'' Messier said
before the game. ``It gives merit to longevity. To do something
like this, it takes playing on some great teams with some great
players.''
	   Messier won five Stanley Cups in the 1980s in Edmonton, four
with Gretzky as a teammate. Messier also led the New York Rangers
to the 1994 Stanley Cup, becoming the first player to captain two
teams to the NHL title.
	   Messier has 1,619 career points, fourth on the career list and
second among active players behind Gretzky's 2,801.

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Like an overlapping series of giant
billowing spinnakers, the roof of the harborside Sydney Opera House
seems as if it could lift the building to the open sea.
	   But the architectural wonder is well anchored to Bennelong
Point, where Verdi's ``Rigoletto'' is on the schedule in one
theater, while jazz, Mozart, and a puppet show are scheduled in
others.
	   Outside, families step off a Sydney ferry or emerge from the
Botanic Gardens and climb the Opera House steps for a photo.
Socialites chat over coffee or a glass of chardonnay at the outdoor
cafe in one of the world's most beautiful settings.
	   Since it opened 25 years ago, the Sydney Opera House has been
lauded by architects, tourists and Sydneysiders alike. Danish
architect Jorn Utzon's vision of ``a grand synthesis'' of geometric
shapes blending with its environment has become, with the Sydney
Harbor Bridge and Ayers Rock, one of Australia's best-known
landmarks.
	   Time magazine this year named it one of five outstanding
examples of architecture this century, ``a union of unique
structure and breathtaking location.'' The International Dictionary
of Architects and Architecture calls it ``a sensuous welcome to
anyone entering the city by sea,'' giving Sydney its visual focus.
	   It was not always thus. Utzon won an international contest in
1957 to design Australia's first top-class opera venue, with
sketches even the judges conceded were ``diagrammatic.'' Frank
Lloyd Wright scoffed at the plans: ``The circus tent is not
architecture.''
	   Even now, debate smolders about whether Utzon's original vision
was realized.
	   In 1955, an unused tram yard at Bennelong Point was chosen as
the building site. At the the southern end of Circular Quay, the
busy transport hub of Sydney harbor, it was just 500 yards from
where Australia's founding fathers landed in 1788 and established
the first colony, at Sydney Cove.
	   The point was named after an Aborigine who was befriended by
Arthur Phillip, the first governor, who was trying to improve
communications between the races and stop a rash of bloody
skirmishes. It is believed Aborigines used the point for sacred
ceremonies.
	   When construction began in 1957, it was to be completed in four
years at a cost of about dlrs 4.2 million. Sixteen years later, in
1973, the center was opened by Queen Elizabeth II at a final cost
of dlrs 60 million.
	   During construction Utzon and the New South Wales state
government were at loggerheads over his demands for control over
every aspect of the design and over the cost overruns. By the
mid-60s, it was considered a national joke which was tarnishing
Australia's image.
	   In 1966, after a heated argument with the government, Utzon
resigned from the project and left Australia, never to return.
	   ``I don't care if they pull the Opera House down,'' he was
reported to have said.
	   A panel of Australian architects was appointed by the government
to oversee changes and cut costs. Almost as soon as it was
finished, the Opera House began winning architectural awards in
Britain, Australia and Europe.
	   More than 1,200 events are staged in the Opera House each year.
Performances have ranged from the New York Philharmonic Orchestra
to Peter Allen, opera's Dame Joan Sutherland to Sammy Davis Jr. In
1986, Pope John Paul II gave an address, as did Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright earlier this year. When President Clinton went
jogging in Sydney in 1996, his destination was the Opera House
steps.
	   The official anniversary is Oct. 20, but organizers have planned
a full month of events in and around the center, including operas,
symphonies, plays, circus acts, children's theater and rock'n'roll.
A Sydney Opera House Web site has been opened at www.soh.nsw.gov.au
	   Michael Lynch, chief executive of the Opera House Trust, said it
has evolved into one of the world's great performing arts centers.
	   ``It's an internationally renowned cultural landmark recognized
for its creative brilliance in both art form and architecture,'' he
said.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Typhoon Babs raced toward southern
China on Saturday, leaving behind a trail of destruction on the
Philippines' main island where at least 119 people died and
hundreds of thousands were forced to flee their homes.
	   Philippines President Joseph Estrada declared three provinces
and a city in the worst hit area on the southern tip of Luzon
island under a state of calamity. He was expected to add more
provinces to the list once the full extent of the damage was
determined.
	   Disaster officials said the toll on lives and property would
rise as telephone service is restored and roads blocked by
landslides and flooding are reopened in the worst hit areas.
	   By early Saturday Babs had moved out over the South China Sea,
280 kilometers (175 miles) west-northwest of Dagupan City in
Pangasinan province, weather officials said. It had sustained winds
of 120 kph (75 mph), with gusts up to 150 kph (95 mph), and was
headed toward southern China.
	   Meteorological officials expect the typhoon to reintensify over
water as it nears Hong Kong by early Sunday.
	   Of the 119 deaths reported so far in the Philippines, 62 were
attributed to landslides on Catanduanes island where Babs first
landed on Thursday, the Office of Civil Defense said.
	   ``Catanduanes received the first punch and it was a hard hit,''
said Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado, who is overseeing the
relief and rescue work.
	   Thirty others died in landslides in nearby Camarines Sur
province and another 102 people were injured by flying debris in
Sorsogon province, both located in the impoverished Bicol region
along the Philippines' eastern coast. Nine other people were
injured elsewhere in Bicol.
	   More than 320,000 people in the area were forced out of their
homes, disaster relief officials said. Tens of thousands of others
were stranded as ports were shut and ships forbidden to sail.
	   The fatalities included 16 drownings, three people hit by
falling trees, a man who died of shock, two children who were
killed by a landslide in central Iloilo province, and a fireman
crushed to death after his van overturned on a slippery road,
officials said.
	   Eight other people were reported missing.
	   In the metropolitan Manila area, Estrada ordered at least 10,000
people living along swollen creeks and rivers out of their homes
and into government shelters.
	   Many areas in Manila and nearby provinces were still under water
early Saturday. In Pampanga province north of the capital, 35
villages in the township of Candaba were submerged, Mayor Ben Gatus
said.
	   Babs also pounded areas around Mount Pinatubo volcano with heavy
rain, unleashing 1.5-meter (5 foot) avalanches of volcanic material
from the mountain's slopes. Most of the material was carried safely
away by swollen rivers.
	   It was second devastating storm in the Philippines in a week.
Last week, Super Typhoon Zeb killed at least 74 people in the
northern Philippines and 43 more in Taiwan and Japan.

	   SALEM, Massachusetts (AP) _ It's a lovely old city absorbed in
the past, where for several weeks a year revelers dress in
costumes, throw masked balls and crown a king and queen.
	   New Orleans during Mardi Gras?
	   Actually, it's the annual ``Haunted Happenings'' festival in
Salem, one of the most popular Halloween destinations in the United
States.
	   Between 300,000 and 500,000 visitors are expected during the
festival, which began Oct. 9 with a parade and ends Oct. 31 with a
crowning of the King and Queen of Halloween and a guest appearance
by a real-life countess from Transylvania.
	   The festival _ this is the 18th _ is the creation of local
entrepreneurs capitalizing on Salem's history of witchcraft.
	   The city, 16 miles (26 kilometers) north of Boston, was home to
the infamous witch trials in 1692 _ as well as to author Nathaniel
Hawthorne and some of the nation's first wealthy seafaring
merchants.
	   The witchcraft scare began when a West Indian slave named Tituba
told voodoo tales to a group of young girls. When the girls became
excited, a physician said they were bewitched. Tituba and two
others were accused of being witches and sentenced to death. Before
the hysteria ended about a year later, 19 people were hanged as
witches and one was pressed to death.
	   Today, Salem, population 38,000, is fraught with fright and more
pleasant fare as well as history. Two witch museums, a witch
village, a witch dungeon, fortune-tellers and haunted houses (at
least four) flourish along with the House of the Seven Gables, of
Hawthorne fame, and some of the finest Federal-style mansions in
the country.
	   Salem's commercial exploitation of witches past doesn't always
sit comfortably with those who take a more serious view of history.
	   There have been complaints that the Salem Wax Museum of Witches
and Seafarers blasts recorded haunted-house sounds into the city's
1637 Old Burying Point Cemetery, where witch trial Judge John
Hathorne is buried.
	   Former Salem resident Joe Cultrera filmed a documentary, ``Witch
City,'' which took an uncomplimentary look at Salem's witch
industry. The film, released last year, had the city's promoters
defending its Halloween activities as simply wholesome family fun.
	   Bridging the gap between witchery and Salem's rich maritime
history and literary tradition is the Peabody Essex Museum, the
world's largest collection of Asian export decorative arts.
	   During October, the museum presents ``Eerie Events,'' in which
costumed characters tell tales of New England ghouls and ghosts in
five historic homes decorated for Halloween.
	   ``Terror on the Wharf,'' in contrast, features Professor
Nightmare. It offers a frightening experience on Pickering Wharf
with props from classic horror movies and animated characters.
	   ``We use startle,'' said John Denley, president of Boneyard
Productions, which runs 'Terror on the Wharf.' We're very
responsible toward families. No gore, nothing disgusting. We stay
away from serial killers.''
	   Many visitors leaving Boston for Salem on Oct. 9 rode the Fright
Train, a commuter train decorated for Halloween, replete with
costumed characters.
	   Every day, visitors can take the new high-speed ferry across
Boston Harbor from Boston or Logan International Airport.
	   Salem can be toured by the Salem Trolley, the amphibious ``Moby
Duck'' tour-mobile or horse-drawn carriage.
	   Kathie Driscoll-Gauthier owns ``A Touch of the Past'' boutique
and is chairwoman of the Salem Halloween Committee this year. Her
favorite event is the kickoff parade, which features floats,
costumes, marching bands and politicians.
	   ``It's almost like a Mardi Gras,'' she said. ``It's not quite on
that level, but we're getting there.''

Independence Hall gets rare versions of Revolution papers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) _ Independence Hall plans for the first time
to display rare copies of two documents that were written there:
the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution.
	   The Pew Charitable Trusts has announced it will give nearly dlrs
1 million to the National Park Service to display the papers in the
hall's west wing. The documents are among the first printed
versions of the originals, which are on display at the National
Archives in Washington.
	   A silver inkstand used in the signing and an original copy of
the Articles of Confederation also will be part of the permanent
display.
	   The documents had been at the Second Bank of the United States,
where they attracted little attention. About 800,000 people visit
Independence Hall a year, while the Second Bank gets about 100,000
visitors annually.
	   The inkstand had been on display in the Assembly Room at
Independence Hall, where visitors are allowed just inside the door.
	   The park's copy of the Declaration of Independence is believed
to have been used for the first public reading, on July 8, 1776.
	   Pew's grant will be used for airtight display cases and
increased security in the west wing.
	   The exhibit is expected to be ready by the fall of 1999.

 &UR; Rock and Roll Hall of Fame posts loss for 1997
	   CLEVELAND (AP) _ Steadily declining attendance at the Rock and
Roll Hall of Fame and Museum contributed to a dlrs 1.37 million
loss last year, according to the museum's annual report.
	   Revenues totaled dlrs 16.8 million in 1997, down 17 percent from
1996, the private, not-for-profit museum said. Total expenses for
1997 were dlrs 18.2 million.
	   Attendance dropped from 867,000 visitors in 1996 to 615,000 last
year. The hall opened in 1995.
	   A major exhibit on rock's psychedelic era took a big chunk of
the budget, dlrs 750,000. There was no underwriter.

 &UR; United Airlines to expand service at Denver hub
	   DENVER (AP) _ United Airlines, which carries about two-thirds of
the passengers who fly through Denver International, is planning to
expand at its Colorado hub.
	   Despite gloomy economic forecasts, United officials expect daily
departures from Denver to increase to 400 from 303 by 2002.
	   Rono Dutta, senior vice president for planning, said last week
the carrier expects to add service from Denver to three or four new
destinations next year. He declined to identify the cities but some
analysts have mentioned Cincinnati; Pittsburgh; Memphis, Tennessee;
and Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina, as possibilities.
	   United officials predict 3 percent growth for next year despite
a 1999 recession forecast by economists.
	   United is the dominant airline in Colorado, with about 9,000
employees.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ He escaped Cuba, risking everything for the
freedom to play pro baseball. He signed a rich contract with the
New York Yankees, then won their most important game of the year
and secured the adoration of a city's baseball fans.
	   But until Friday, Orlando Hernandez didn't have it all because
he didn't have his family. There were stories that he had wept in
the clubhouse, longing for his children, left behind in Cuba with
his ex-wife.
	   That all changed, just in time for a beaming Hernandez to hoist
his kids above the clamoring crowds during Friday's ticker-tape
victory parade up Broadway. The skyscraper canyon resounded with
chants of ``Du-que! Du-que!''
	   ``God heard my prayers,'' Hernandez said.
	   Hernandez pleaded with Cardinal John O'Connor to help get his
family to America. The cardinal sent a message to President Fidel
Castro, and the Cuban ambassador to the United Nations told
O'Connor late Wednesday that a visit had been approved, according
to Joe Zwilling of the New York Archdiocese. Hernandez's agent, Joe
Cubas, said the family had a 30-day visa.
	   Early Friday, at an airport in New Jersey, the Yankee pitcher
saw his mother, Maria Julia Pedroso Cruz, and daughters Yahumara,
8, and Steffi, 3, for the first time since last December when he
and seven others packed in a small boat, slipped into the sea and
made it to a remote Bahamian island.
	   The reunited family wept and hugged while friends stood by with
bottles of champagne.
	   Hernandez ``keeps pinching himself to make sure that it's all
really happened,'' Cubas said.
	   ``I am very happy that I will be able to see my dad,'' Yahumara
said during a stopover in Miami, when the family switched from a
charter plane to George Steinbrenner's private jet. ``I have missed
him.''
	   ``I'm very proud of my son,'' said his mother. ``He hasn't
changed, in spite of the fact that he has all that money.'' Since
Hernandez left, she said, ``It has been very difficult for us, but
we have survived the situation.''
	   Hernandez's ex-wife, the mother of his children, joined them for
the trip.
	   Hernandez signed a three-year, dlrs 6.6 million contract with
the Yankees and became a reliable starting pitcher. In the American
League championship series, he showed no fear, winning a game the
Yankees desperately needed. He also won Game 2 of the World Series,
and his wife, Noris Bosch, and other friends and relatives waved a
Cuban flag in the stands afterward.
	   On a parade float with other Yankees pitchers Friday, Hernandez
was joined by his wife and both daughters. At the City Hall
ceremony, he doffed his cap, showing his smooth head, and bowed.
	   ``Du-que! Du-que!'' the crowd chanted again.
	   At Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's suggestion, Hernandez took the
microphone to address the Yankees' Latino fans. ``I don't speak
English,'' he said first, then switched to Spanish and said, ``I
love you New York'' to more thunderous cheers.
	   ``He cannot believe he went from all the pain and suffering he
was enduring in Cuba to being one of the top pitchers for the New
York Yankees,'' Cubas said. ``It's really a surreal situation.
	   ``He wants to try to spend as much quality time as he can with
his daughters and his mother,'' the agent said, and that might
include a boat trip in New York Harbor. The girls, he said, want to
see the Statue of Liberty.

U.N. chief calls for global solution to economic crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ In a message marking United Nations
Day, U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan urged the world Saturday to
work together to help those in developing nations who have been hit
hard by the global economic crisis.
	   ``Millions still live poor and isolated lives. Millions more
have found their lives disrupted, even destroyed, by global
economic forces they do not understand and can not control,'' Annan
said.
	   The U.N. chief called for multilateral answers to these global
problems and said ``the weak and the vulnerable must have their
say'' in coming up with remedies.
	   Annan was on a three-day visit to Seoul, his first trip to South
Korea since taking office in January last year. On Friday, he
received the dlrs 200,000 Seoul Peace Prize, a biennial award set
up in 1990 to commemorate the 1988 Seoul Olympics.
	   Annan dedicated his prize to the 1,500 people killed in U.N.
peacekeeping operations and donated the award money to a U.N. trust
fund for preventing armed conflicts around the world.
	   On Saturday, he received an honorary doctoral degree from
Seoul's Kyung Hee University.
	   Annan was to leave for New York later Saturday after touring
South Korea's National Folklore Museum and other sites in Seoul.

Union leaves galvanized, next stop New York
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous to show Hunter and Granik may meet this
weekend. &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ There were 240 National Basketball Association
players at the largest gathering in their union's history. Next
week, the players promise an even larger showing in New York, where
collective bargaining talks will resume.
	   After a militant meeting at which conciliatory players like John
Stockton were shouted down, many players left town Friday with the
realization that their careers and paychecks probably won't be
resuming soon.
	   NBA deputy commissioner Russ Granik and union director Billy
Hunter spoke on the telephone Friday, and may meet this weekend. A
much larger meeting could be held Wednesday when the league's Board
of Governors will be in New York. Their two-day meeting begins
Tuesday.
	   Hunter said the union would try to get all its members _ about
400 players _ to show up Wednesday. The 240 who came to Las Vegas
voted unanimously to never accept a hard salary cap, Hunter said.
	   ``Every member of the union has a right to be present,'' Hunter
said. ``It doesn't mean they'll be involved in negotiations. But
it's important for them to be there and hear David Stern say he
wants a hard (salary) cap.''
	   There have been no negotiations since Oct. 13.
	   When the sides meet Wednesday _ a faceoff that could include
more than 500 people _ the lockout will be in its 120th day.
	   The owners, demanding cost certainty, want an absolute ceiling
on player salaries in the next collective bargaining agreement.
They had the right to seek a new labor agreement if the percentage
of revenues devoted to salaries exceeded 51.8 percent, and it
reached 57 percent in the 1997-98 season.
	   In their most recent proposal, owners asked that the percentage
be reduced to 52 percent in the 2000-01 season, 50 percent in
2001-02 and 48 percent in 2002-03.
	   The union has offered two methods to tighten the salary cap if
the percentage rises to 63 percent, as well as a ``tax'' on the
salaries of the highest-paid players.
	   According to several sources who attended Thursday's player
meeting, Stockton and teammate Jeff Hornacek were shouted down when
they tried to move the discussion from militant speeches to a
dialogue on what percentage of revenues the players could live
with.
	   ``Everybody could speak, the mike was open,'' Charles Barkley
said.
	   Among the most vocal players were Karl Malone and David
Robinson. Everyone paid the most attention when Michael Jordan
spoke, sources said.
	   ``I was not surprised to see Michael here,'' Barkley said.
``He's the most dominant guy in the league, and that shows how
unified we are.''
	   Shaquille O'Neal, Scottie Pippen and Kevin Garnett were among
the other high-profile players. Grant Hill, Allen Iverson and Penny
Hardaway were among the notable absentees.
	   ``One of the reasons they wanted all of the stars here is to let
them know we're in this,'' Barkley said. ``They (the owners) want
it to be about the haves and have-nots. It's not.
	   ``Rest assured, and I'm one of the haves, if I never work
another day in my life, I'm going to be fine. But it's not our
intention to leave the young guys or the middle of the road guys
out in the cold. If that's the owners' intention, they are going to
be seriously mistaken.''
	   The lockout, which began July 1, has cost the players about dlrs
100 million in lost salaries.

Report: Nationalized Japanese bank issued sham assessment of
</HEADLINE>
problem loans

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A major Japanese lender which was nationalized
after becoming insolvent misled financial authorities earlier this
year about its exposure to problem loans, a newspaper reported
Saturday.
	   The Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd., the first Japanese bank
to be put under state control since the end of World War II,
understated the amount of its problem loans by about 1.4 trillion
yen (dlrs 11.7 billion), the Yomiuri newspaper said.
	   In a report issued earlier this year to Japan's Financial
Supervisory Agency, the LTCB denied having any uncollectable loans
and said questionable loans amounted to only 2.82 trillion yen
(dlrs 23.7 billion), the nation's largest-circulation daily said.
	   But the agency has since found the bank's load of problematic
loans was actually almost double that number _ 4.23 trillion yen
(dlrs 35.5 billion), including 137.3 billion yen (dlrs 1.15
billion) in uncollectable loans, the paper said.
	   It also said the LTCB extended financing to ailing affiliates so
that they could meet payments on existing loans and appear to be
sound borrowers.
	   In a widely expected move Friday, the government took over the
LTCB, which had liabilities exceeding assets by some 340 billion
yen (dlrs 2.85 billion).

Canucks 5, Panthers 0
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SUNRISE, Florida (AP) _ Mark Messier scored his 600th career
goal and Todd Bertuzzi added two goals as the Vancouver Canucks
handed the Florida Panthers their first loss with a 5-0 win Friday
night.
	   Alexander Mogilny had a goal and three assists to spark
Vancouver to consecutive wins for the first time this season. The
Canucks (4-2) won for the second time in three outings on their
five-game Eastern road trip.
	   Messier became the 10th player in NHL history to reach the
600-goal plateau when he scored on a one-timer from Mogilny to cap
the scoring at 12:58 of the third period.
	   He joined former Edmonton linemates Wayne Gretzky and Jari Kurri
in reaching the 600-goal milestone. Gretzky, now with the New York
Rangers, is the career leader with 886 goals.
	   The Panthers (2-1-2), who were the NHL's last unbeaten team this
season, looked sluggish despite firing 35 shots at Garth Snow.
 &UR; Maple Leafs 5, Red Wings 3 &QC; 
	   In Detroit, Scotty Bowman's return to the Detroit bench was
spoiled by the Toronto Maple Leafs.
	   Bowman, whose 1,057 victories are the most in NHL history,
coached the Red Wings for the first time this season after
returning from health problems. But his presence didn't help as the
two-time defending Stanley Cup champions had their four-game
winning streak snapped by the Maple Leafs.
	   Sergei Berezin had two goals and one assist for Toronto, which
also handed Detroit its only other loss this season. Mats Sundin,
Tomas Kaberie and Steve Thomas also scored for the Maple Leafs.
	   It was the first time the Red Wings played with Bowman behind
the bench since sweeping the Washington Capitals for their second
straight Stanley Cup championship last June. Since then, the
65-year-old coach had a blocked artery cleared and had his left
knee surgically replaced.
 &UR; Lightning 3, Kings 2 &QC; 
	   In Tampa, Florida, Mikael Renberg and Pavel Kubina scored
third-period goals as the Tampa Bay Lightning beat the Los Angeles
Kings.
	   Craig Janney drew the defense toward the slot and sent a
backhanded pass to Renberg, who scored on a wrist shot from the
right circle at 4:55 to break a 1-1 tie.
	   Kubina made it 3-1 with 2:59 remaining as the Lightning won
their second straight after snapping a 15-game winless streak.
	   Ray Ferraro scored for the Kings with 1:42 left.
	   Manny Legace became the third Kings goaltender to get hurt this
week, leaving the game after becoming nauseous and woozy shortly
after Tucker crashed into him after scoring a goal.
 &UR; Capitals 1, Sabres 0 &QC; 
	   In Buffalo, New York, Olaf Kolzig made 30 saves for his second
shutout of the season and Jaroslav Svejkovsky scored in the third
period as the Washington Capitals beat the Buffalo Sabres.
	   The Capitals, who eliminated Buffalo from the playoffs last year
with an overtime victory in Game 6, won another close one over the
Sabres. Four of the six playoff games last season also were decided
by one goal.
	   Svejkovsky, who did not skate in the playoffs against the Sabres
last season, scored at 7:16 of the third period. Dominik Hasek, who
made 35 saves for Buffalo, stopped Brendan Witt's drive from the
left point and Peter Bondra's shot off the rebound before
Svejkovsky got one past the goalie.
 &UR; Flames 4, Predators 3 &QC; 
	   In Nashville, Tennessee, Cory Stillman scored with 7:22
remaining as Calgary snapped a three-game losing streak.
	   Stillman skated in alone from the left side on goalie Mike
Dunham, deked Dunham to the ice, and pushed a backhander past him
for his first goal of the year.
	   Nashville's Jan Vopat had just tied the game 50 seconds earlier.
	   The Flames had to kill off a two-man Nashville advantage that
lasted 1:31 in the closing minutes. It was the Predators' third
5-on-3 power play of the game.
	   Phil Housley, Marty McInnis, and Jarome Iginla also scored for
Calgary. Sergei Krivokrasov and Jeff Nelson scored for the
expansion Predators, who lost consecutive games for the first time
in their six-game history.
