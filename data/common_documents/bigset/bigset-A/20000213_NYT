TOM LANDRY, 75, DALLAS COWBOYS COACH 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to correct graf on survivors)  
 (HLW)  
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tom Landry, the taciturn Texan who coached the Dallas Cowboys
for their first 29 seasons and led them to five Super Bowls, died
Saturday night in Dallas. He was 75.
</P>
<P>
   Landry died at Baylor University Medical Center, where since May
he had periodically undergone treatment for acute myelogenous
leukemia, a hospital spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Landry was head coach of the Cowboys from the team's inception
in 1960 through 1988, and he created a stir in the National
Football League with innovative schemes and his team's success.
After six mediocre seasons, including an initial 0-11-1 year when
the team played before small crowds at the cavernous Cotton Bowl,
Landry's Cowboys ran off 20 consecutive winning seasons, an NFL
record. During that span, Dallas won 13 division titles, made 18
playoff appearances and won two Super Bowls in five appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing his trademark fedora and conservative suit, Landry was
the cool, stoic man on the sideline for the franchise that under
his leadership became known as America's Team.
</P>
<P>
   Landry's 270 victories are the third most in NFL history behind
Don Shula and George Halas. His overall record as the Cowboys' head
coach was 270 victories, 178 losses and 6 ties for a .601 winning
percentage. Landry entered the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   But despite his overall success in Dallas, Landry's last three
seasons there produced records of 7-9, 7-8 and 3-13. The team was
bought in February 1989 by its current owner, Jerry Jones, and
Landry was dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Landry's contributions to pro football were significant. As a
player-coach and then as an assistant coach for the Giants in the
1950s, Landry devised the 4-3 defense, a formation featuring four
down linemen and three linebackers. It remains a staple of pro
football. Landry's defensive units, featuring Roosevelt Grier, Andy
Robustelli, Dick Modzelewski and Jim Katcavage on the line, Sam
Huff as the middle linebacker and Emlen Tunnell and Jimmy Patton in
the secondary, played a major role in the Giants' successes of the
late 1950s. With Landry running the defense, the Giants won three
Eastern Conference titles and an NFL championship in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   In Dallas he created the umbrella-like flex defense, and his
Dallas coaching staff was the first to use computers to gain an
edge in scouting, preparation and game planning. He reintroduced
the shotgun formation to pro football, and his offenses presented
multiple formations that confused defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Tex Schramm, the longtime Cowboys president, once said of him,
``He provided the leadership that set our sails.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Wade Landry was born on Sept. 11, 1924, in Mission,
Texas. He played fullback at Mission High School (his team
outscored opponents by 322-0 in his senior year) and entered the
University of Texas. After playing in the 1942 season, under the
renowned coach Dana X. Bible, he was off to the Army Air Forces. He
would fly 30 B-17 missions over Europe as a member of the 8th Air
Force in Europe in World War II and survived one crash landing.
</P>
<P>
   Discharged in November 1945 as a first lieutenant, Landry
returned to Texas and played fullback and a bit of quarterback,
behind the all-American Bobby Layne; he also played defensive back
for the Longhorns. He won all-Southwest Conference honors as a
junior and was a co-captain as a senior. He played on Texas teams
that won the 1948 Sugar Bowl over Alabama and the 1949 Orange Bowl
over Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   After playing for a year with the New York Yankees football team
of the All-America Conference, Landry joined the New York Giants of
the NFL in 1950. He was a Giants star through the 1955 season as a
left defensive halfback, playing on the same side with the Hall of
Fame safety Tunnell. Landry intercepted 31 passes with the Giants,
returned three of them for touchdowns and was named All-Pro in
1954.
</P>
<P>
   In his first season with the Giants, under the veteran head
coach Steve Owen, who had only a few assistants, Landry was already
showing leadership. ``I was playing left defensive halfback, and I
thought someone really had to coordinate us back there,'' Landry
would recall. ``If the end moved out into the flat, I had to know
where I was going and where Em Tunnell was going to go, and so on.
So I kind of just took it upon myself at practice to direct a lot
of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Landry became a player-coach, handling the defense, when Jim Lee
Howell was named the Giants' head coach in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   He retired as a player after the 1955 season and then served as
the Giants' defensive coordinator from 1956 through 1959, teaming
up most of that time with the offensive coordinator Vince Lombardi,
later the revered Green Bay Packers coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vince was a pure teacher, but he could not get what he wanted
off films as quick as Tom,'' Wellington Mara, the Giants' owner,
once said. ``In fact, there were few people who were as quick a
study as Tom.''
</P>
<P>
   Mara tried to hire Landry as the Giants' head coach in 1960. But
Landry took the Cowboys' coaching job instead. He was living during
the off-season in Dallas and knew the men building the expansion
team _ Clint Murchison Jr., the owner, and Schramm, the general
manager.
</P>
<P>
   Landry remembered that when Schramm offered him the job, ``I
said to my wife: `Oh, well, we might as well try it. We'll probably
be fired in two or three years but what the heck.'''
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Lee Roy Jordan once said: ``He taught that if you
depend on emotion and you lost that, the result will be
disappointing. If you play on execution and knowledge, you won't
have those valleys.''
</P>
<P>
   Landry was known as an emotionless coach who kept a distance
between himself and his players. But describing his last meeting
with his Cowboys players, he wrote: ``This was going to be even
harder than I thought. I tried to clear my throat but a huge lump
remained. I could feel tears rolling down my cheeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Landry's dismissal from the Cowboys hurt him deeply. He once
wrote: ``People say you have to know when to retire, which is a
dumb thing to say. If you want to go out on top, yeah, it becomes
important when you quit. But I wasn't afraid of that. And I wasn't
worried about getting fired. I knew the risk. To me, it's not an
ego thing. I enjoy coaching. I enjoy helping people achieve
something. But it's all over now. And I can't worry about things
over which I have no control.''
</P>
<P>
   Landry is survived by his wife of 51 years, Alicia; a son, Tom
Jr.; and one daughter, Kitty Phillips. Another daughter, Lisa, died
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Landry often spoke of his Christian faith. During and after his
football career he worked nationally for the Fellowship of
Christian Athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom has the ability outwardly to appear very level, but he is
human,'' Schramm once said of him. ``I know some of the losses must
have torn him up pretty good inside.''
</P>
<P>
   The folded arms on the sideline. The rugged, set jaw. The
fedora.
</P>
<P>
   Landry once said of his headgear: ``My hats did give me an
identity. In fact, if I had a dollar for every time someone has
seen me bareheaded and said, `I almost didn't recognize you without
a hat on,' I could have bought the Cowboys myself.''

PANTHERS KEEP BRUINS STUCK IN REVERSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Their offense apparently having gone south for the winter, the
Bruins' margin for error in every game lately has been reduced to
the size of a miser's heart.
</P>
<P>
   And their playoff chances are shriveling at the same rate, their
season unraveling as rapidly as the team did the past two nights,
capped by Saturday evening's 5-1 humbling by the Florida Panthers
before a FleetCenter crowd of 17,565 that spent the last 10 minutes
indulging in bloodthirsty booing.
</P>
<P>
   This lost weekend was the Bruins' season in microcosm. With a
chance to gain precious ground in the Eastern Conference, they
suffered two deflating losses in 24 hours _ beginning with Friday's
5-2 killer in New York _ both because of eyeblink lapses in the
third period that proved fatal.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, they're now in far worse shape than when they began
the weekend. Having taken the ice at Madison Square Garden with a
chance to match the Rangers for the eighth and last conference
playoff berth, they instead remain on a ninth-place treadmill. And
now they have company, caught by the Buffalo Sabres, who have a
game in hand and Dominik Hasek back in the net.
</P>
<P>
   Still, they had a chance to close in on the new eighth-place
club, the Pittsburgh Penguins, who lost to the New York Islanders
Saturday night but retained a 3-point lead on Boston with two games
in hand.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins still have 25 games to erase that slim deficit, but
as captain Ray Bourque said, ``Every loss hurts big time right now.
Pretty soon, we're going to run out of games. We need to get on a
roll. Win-one, lose-one ain't going to get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins would have settled for that this weekend. And they
seemed to have a chance for a split. Though they entered the third
period trailing the Panthers, 2-1, they had carried the play for
much of the first 40 minutes _ but unfortunately for them, they
didn't start asserting themselves until they were two goals in
arrears.
</P>
<P>
   And then they replicated their downfall of the previous night,
when the Rangers' Jan Hlavac completed his first career hat trick
in a 46-second span to break open a 3-2 game.
</P>
<P>
   This time the coup de grace was applied by Florida dervish Pavel
Bure, who gets around faster than a tabloid rumor. At 8:32 of the
third period, Bure zoomed into the left side of the Bruins' zone
and launched a slap shot that trickled between the pads of goalie
Byron Dafoe, who had come out of his crease to cut down the angle.
The puck kept rolling; before Dafoe could recover, it was at the
left post, and so was Bure, nudging it home for his NHL-leading
39th goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it was 3-1, I thought they still had a chance,'' said
Bure, who is either extremely polite or painfully unaware of the
Bruins' finishing futility.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, it became academic when Florida struck for two
goals within seven seconds _ and chased Dafoe _ starting at 10:35.
</P>
<P>
   With Joe Thornton in the penalty box for charging, Mark Parrish
was at the left side of the Boston crease to take a feed from Ryan
Johnson. Dafoe went horizontal to stop the initial shot, but he was
helpless as the puck ricocheted off his pads back to Parrish, who
lifted it to the far side for his _ and the Panthers' _ second
power-play goal. That certainly won't improve the mood of Bruins
owner/shorthanded critic Jeremy Jacobs, assuming he was tuning in
from Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe barely had time to regain his feet before Paul Laus belted
a prayer from just outside the right circle that caromed off the
goalie's pads and inside the near post. At that point, coach Pat
Burns mercifully replaced Dafoe _ who may sit out a game or two _
with Rob Tallas, but there was no escape for the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, their inability to convert a bushel of scoring
chances left them vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a black cloud over us in all aspects right now,'' said
Burns, whose job is continually rumored to be in jeopardy despite
vigorous disclaimers from president/general manager Harry Sinden.
``It's wins and losses and ties and the uncertainty around the
team, what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Bruins are to go on past April, they'll need to do a
better job of finding the net than they did the past two nights.
Against the Panthers, only Shawn Bates was able to get the puck
past goalie Mikhail Shtalenkov. And by the time he struck at 13:15
of the first period, Johnson (5:27) and Parrish (12:06) already had
victimized Dafoe by cashing in wide-open setups.
</P>
<P>
   Burns insists that there is no quit in his team _ ``I wish
people would (get off) that'' _ but there are no results, either.
``I can't teach finishing,'' said the coach.

KWAN COMES THROUGH FOR ANOTHER CROWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ This time, she had her game face on. This time,
Michelle Kwan was fighting for her competitive life against the
orthodontic generation, and she knew it. So she shrugged off
another fall, pulled herself back together, and won the US women's
figure skating title for the fourth time in five years Saturday
night before 15,435 inside Gund Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was all business today, concentrated and centered,'' said
the 19-year-old Kwan after climbing out of third place to outpoint
15-year-old Sasha Cohen and 14-year-old Sarah Hughes. ``I came into
the ring determined. I said, `Michelle, you've got something to do;
do it. Don't fool around on the ice.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Kwan had been in serious trouble after falling on a simple
triple toe loop toward the end of Friday's short program. Hughes,
with her two triple-triple jump combinations, had a tougher long
program. And Cohen, the leader going into the evening, had an
impressive blend of skill and artistry.
</P>
<P>
   Had one of them skated cleanly, she might have knocked off the
two-time world champion, who hasn't skated without error for an
entire major event since the 1998 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   But Hughes, a ninth-grader from Great Neck, N.Y., singled the
back end of her triple toe-triple loop combo, fell on a triple
salchow 10 seconds from the end, and finished third. ``I had a
little trouble at the end; that was obvious,'' said Hughes, who
still made the team for next month's world championships in France.
``I fought through the program and tried to make every moment
count. If I didn't, I would regret it later.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen seemed headed to a flawless outing after landing a pair of
triple-double combinations early on. With 20 seconds left in her
four-minute program, Cohen's only bobble had been a double-footed
triple lutz. Then, out of nowhere, she splattered her triple toe
and ended up second.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy with the way I skated, but disappointed with the
last jump,'' said Cohen, who is technically too young to compete in
the world championships but can earn a ticket if she wins a medal
at next month's world junior event. ``But I really don't think I
would have won even if I had landed it. Michelle is a world and
Olympic skater, and she has a reputation that I don't have.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen's fall left her with only five triples, one fewer than
Kwan. That, plus Kwan's more nuanced artistry and the extra triple
toe she tossed in, was the difference.
</P>
<P>
   It was a slender, shaky difference, though, and Kwan knew it.
The juniors who once gazed at her in awe have drawn even, and there
are more on the way. Jennifer Kirk, the 15-year-old rookie from
Newton, Mass., and the Skating Club of Boston, finished sixth in
the long program and seventh overall. And Deanna Stellato, jumping
up from novices, was ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Kwan survived because her immature rivals slipped. Next year,
they might stand tall. ``I really feel I have to up the ante,'' she
said. ``There's a lot of skaters doing triple-triples, and I feel
I've got to do one of them. Or maybe two of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Two will probably be the opening bid at the FleetCenter. And
more people will be drawing cards at the table. ``We know that
Michelle is a wonderful champion, the premiere skater, but she's
being challenged by the youth of America,'' said John Nicks, who
coaches Cohen. ``It's been the tradition of American ladies'
skating that the champion never rests easy on her throne.''

US SHUTS DOWN HAITI 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The US national team had only a handful of supporters at
the Orange Bowl to witness its 3-0 victory over Haiti Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, much of Little Haiti, plus busloads of immigrants
from Boston, Montreal, New York _ and Rene Preval, the president of
the Republic of Haiti _ created a festive atmosphere in the kickoff
game of the Gold Cup. The Haiti team has skill and style, but lacks
the experience to duplicate the exploits of its coach, Emmanuel
Sanon, who helped Haiti qualify for its only World Cup final in
1974.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are used to it because we've played a lot of games in LA
and on the East Coast where the crowd is like that,'' said US
striker Eric Wynalda, who scored his 34th international goal on a
second-half penalty. ``It's not like it hurts our feelings or
anything. This is the only time Haitian-Americans have a chance to
see their team play in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   US supporters will likely again be in the minority in
Wednesday's game against Peru.
</P>
<P>
   But the United States finally seems capable of winning over
critics and hyphenated American soccer fans. The team performed
with poise, thanks to the midfield composure of Claudio Reyna. It
was able to set the tempo, retain possession, vary the speed of the
game. The efficiency of the US midfield and the tenacity of the
defending prevented Haiti from establishing a rhythm and enabled
Eddie Lewis to find space on the left flank, and Wynalda, Cobi
Jones, and Jovan Kirovski to maneuver through the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Kirovski scored in the 18th minute, heading off the underside of
the crossbar after Wynalda centered a Reyna cross.
</P>
<P>
   Reyna was taken down in the penalty area in the 55th minute, and
Wynalda blasted the penalty past goalkeeper Didier Menard.
</P>
<P>
   Jones scored a last-minute goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an honor to play against the US, which is one of the
most improved and best teams in the world now, especially with
thousands of Haitians here,'' forward Sebastien Vorbe said. ``It is
going to take a while for us to get to the level we want to be at.
We need a lot of big games but it is hard to find big games because
teams are booked and they don't want to play Haiti.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Bruce Arena altered the US lineup after an irregular
heartbeat was detected in Brian McBride.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brad Friedel and Jones played for the US team the last time it
met Haiti, taking ictory in a Barcelona '92 Olympic
qualifier in Port-au-Prince . . . ``We have a lot of natural
talents, soccer technicians,'' said Patrice Dumont, who coached the
Olympic team. ``But since 1977, we haven't had a lot of activity
with the national team, so we are not here to win this tournament.
This is a chance to work on preparing for international
tournaments.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Gold Cup continues with Canada-Costa Rica and
Mexico-Trinidad and Tobago games in San Diego Sunday. Former
Revolution players include defender Mark Watson (Canada) and
midfielders David Nakhid and Evans Wise (Trinidad and Tobago) . . .
The tournament winner qualifies for the Confederations Cup, but
Mexico coach Manuel Lapuente is using a young team since the
Mexicans automatically qualify as defending champions. Lapuente
will be missing players because America and Atlas players will be
participating in the Copa Libertadores. ``But Lapuente believes
this is the best team Mexico has, regardless of age,'' said
Rigoberto Cervantes of Los Angeles' La Opinion. Mexico has won
every Gold Cup title since 1991, when the US upset the Mexicans in
the semifinals.

EX-COP BURNS KNOWS ENOUGH TO WATCH HIS BACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cops and coaches have a lot in common. They both have jobs where
instincts matter more than anything else on their resumes. They
understand that skepticism is good and paranoia is necessary;
you've always got to know when someone is trying to pull some
chicanery behind your back.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Burns was a cop and is a coach. That's why I am convinced
that he knows what is happening to him now. He has to know he is
being set up by his employers. They have all but framed his
likeness, raised it above their heads, and screamed to the world
that this is the suspect who has brought down the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to be skilled in police work to know what an
insult that is.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, the case for Burns is not a very good one. His
team lost to the Panthers Saturday night at the FleetCenter, 5-1.
There were boos for Byron Dafoe, who was pulled. There were boos
for the team that seemed to master the art of shooting and missing.
There were boos for failed power plays. There were boos for the
absentee defensemen who allowed Pavel Bure to shoot, miss, secure
his own rebound, and score as he guided the puck past a sprawled
Dafoe.
</P>
<P>
   Games like these and times like these are dangerous, in any
sport. Rough times make people do strange things. Like revise
history. Obviously Burns is not blameless in the collapse of the
Bruins. But if you look at some of the other things that have
happened to the Bruins since last summer, are you surprised that
they are currently playoff outsiders?
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, you can bring anybody in here and they're not
going to do a better job than Pat's done,'' Ray Bourque said after
the loss. He also said it would be silly to fire the coach at this
point in the season. What he didn't say is that the evidence
against owner Jeremy Jacobs, president/general manager Harry
Sinden, and assistant general manager Mike O'Connell is just as
damning as the stuff against Burns.
</P>
<P>
   You can't bring in a Sprewellian guy (Joe Murphy) who cusses out
the coach and expect it not to affect your team. You can't have the
owner _ sitting in Buffalo watching DirecTV _ questioning the
coaches in the newspaper and expect it not to affect the team. I
certainly wouldn't have re-signed Dmitri Khristich, either, but you
still have to expect that losing your leading goal scorer will hurt
you. The same is true with Tim Taylor, a terrific penalty killer.
And don't forget the injury to Jason Allison, the center who seems
to calm everyone when he is on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   After watching Dafoe Saturday night, it is apparent that he is
not the same as he was during his 10-shutout 1998-99 season. There
are two ways to analyze his skittish play so far. A cynic would say
he has relaxed because he has a new contract. I would argue his
lack of training camp _ due to his contract showdown with Sinden _
still is limiting his performance. Burns had said that he would
rely heavily on his goaltender, but Saturday night the coach said
he is considering a Dafoe-Rob Tallas swap.
</P>
<P>
   We have found out in the last few days that pro sports are not
always about loyalty or fairness. So in a sense, it doesn't matter
that Burns came to town in 1997 and took hockey's worst team to the
playoffs. And it probably doesn't matter that he has had to try to
get the best out of many players who are _ or have been _ clearly
annoyed with the words and/or negotiating tactics of management.
</P>
<P>
   I remember talking with Burns last month in his office. He said
that most good coaches know when they are about to be fired. There
are no surprises. ``They may say they are surprised,'' he said at
the time, ``but if they were paying attention, they knew it was
coming.''
</P>
<P>
   He knows.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, as Burns spoke, I couldn't help thinking that he
was defending himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the puck is there and the goalie is not there and we don't
put the puck in the net, is that coaching?'' he said. Eventually,
he was asked about the speculation surrounding him. There always
seems to be a Burns report from someone. Recently, Channel 4
reported that this weekend was critical to Burns's future. Burns's
team was outscored, 10-3, over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Sinden said there would be no in-season firing of
Burns. But he said nothing of 2000-01. He implied the media have
been irresponsible in their speculation, even though the owner of
the team publicly criticized the coach.
</P>
<P>
   If Burns is fired, it would only be fair if Jacobs comes to
Boston and does it face to face. And after that, it would be
refreshing if he attended the press conference and agreed to take
questions. So far, Jacobs has been like the ``Charlie's Angels''
voice in the squawk box.
</P>
<P>
   Burns said he doesn't pay attention to the newspapers. He said
he doesn't watch the television shows. ``If I did, it would drive
me crazy,'' he said. But he doesn't have to read the paper or watch
TV to know what is happening around him. It's a job of instincts.

 &HT;    INDUSTRY, ENVIRONMENTALISTS DISCUSS BOTTLE DEPOSIT LAWS
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Environmentalists and plastics recyclers are asking
the Turner Foundation and the U.S. affiliate of Mikhail Gorbachev's
Green Cross International to support a campaign to increase the
recycling rate of plastic bottles.
</P>
<P>
   Among strategies being discussed is an age-old anathema for the
beverage industry: getting more states to enact beverage bottle
deposit laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, there has always been interest in the environmental
community in increasing the recycling rates,'' said Pat Franklin,
executive director of the nonprofit Container Recycling Institute
of Arlington, Va. ``But the fact that manufacturing people are
considering supporting it really changes the dynamics.''
</P>
<P>
   Franklin said the talk of an environmental-industry recycling
alliance ``is not a done deal. It's in the formative stages.''
</P>
<P>
   She said industry interest in the proposed alliance is driven by
the failure of existing recyling programs to provide enough
recycled polyethylene terephthalate, or ``PET,'' plastic to keep
pace with a growing demand for the material.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Franklin's organization, groups involved in the
discussions include:
</P>
<P>
   _ The GrassRoots Recycling Network, an Athens, Ga.,
environmental group that has been pressuring the Coca-Cola Co. to
use more recycled PET in its bottles.
</P>
<P>
   _ Beaulieu of America, a Dalton, Ga., carpet manufacturer that
annually converts tons of PET into carpet fibers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Scott Seydel, president of Atlanta-based EvCo Research Inc., a
company that has developed numerous products containing recycled
PET.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Turner Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   _ Global Green USA, the American affiliate of the international
environmental group Gorbachev started after.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the recycling rate for PET is less than 25 percent,
according to the National Association for PET Container Resources
(NAPCOR), an industry trade group.
</P>
<P>
   However, it is much higher in the 10 states with bottle deposit
laws, especially Michigan, which requires retailers to collect a
10-cent deposit on each beverage container and recovers an
estimated 95 percent of PET containers.
</P>
<P>
   Seydel said the conversations involve ``any group you would find
if you did a Web search on the word 'PET.' ``
</P>
<P>
   He said he had been talking with soft drink companies and NAPCOR
about alternate strategies for increasing the amount of PET that is
recycled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ultimate goal is conserving resources,'' said Franklin.
``The folks who are talking now agree that they have a common goal,
which is recovering more PET bottles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some want to turn it into carpets and some want to stem the
flow of PET bottles going into landfills,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   She said groups were not committed exclusively to state bottle
deposit laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this gets off the ground, the program will be to increase
the recovery of PET and other containers,'' she said ``There is
only one system that has been proven to be effective and that
happens to be a deposit system. But the goal may not even be
deposit laws, if some other mechanism comes in.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the Turner Foundation, Beaulieu of America and
Global Green USA were not available for comment, but Franklin,
Seydel and Bill Sheehan of the GrassRoots Recycling Network all
said the foundations had been asked for financial support.

 &HT;    In proper text, there is a place for Bible in schools
 &HT;    By Martha Ezzard
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Critical teaching and study of the Bible neither reduces it to a
handbook for morals nor to a talisman for personal salvation.
</P>
<P>
   - James Fowler, director of the Center for Ethics, Emory
University
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The annual debate about teaching the Bible in public
schools rages on in state legislatures across the nation. It is
part of the larger issue about which religious texts can be
included in public schools without crossing the First Amendment,
which prohibits the state from favoring or disfavoring any
particular religion.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a new political strategy: Rather than bills that
call for reinstating prayer and Bible reading in school, both of
which the U.S. Supreme Court has barred, there's a call for
teaching the New and Old Testaments as history and literature.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, some parents associated with neither the left
nor the right say, ``Why not?'' Students are being cheated out of a
key dimension of human history because schools have become so
fearful of stirring up religious extremists that they avoid all
reference to religious and moral thinking _ themes that undergird
much of the development of western civilization.
</P>
<P>
   What's wrong, then, with legislation that simply requires
schools to offer elective courses on the Bible as history and
literature? The problem is that while the legislation calls for a
``non-devotional'' approach, it is written in a way that assumes a
literal interpretation, outlining what is to be taught.
</P>
<P>
   Fowler says no legislation is even needed to include such
electives in high school. Georgia state and local school boards
already have that power, and some have figured out how to use it in
a manner that provides for critical thinking, not indoctrination.
Fowler, who in the 1970s helped found Harvard's master's program on
teaching religion in public schools, says models for high school
courses that emphasize critical thinking already exist in Fort
Myers, Fla., Oklahoma City and several other school districts.
</P>
<P>
   If legislators, parents and educators truly want to fashion a
course that helps students understand the uniqueness and
similarities of many religions (which will inevitably help them
figure out their own personal beliefs in life), they should take
the time to form a task force to do it right and to provide the
in-depth training teachers need. Fowler suggests starting with
materials from the Freedom Forum, located at the First Amendment
Center in Arlington, Va. Charles Haynes, the center's senior
scholar, has coordinated an excellent guide, ``The Bible and Public
Schools'' (www.freedomforum.org). The guide is endorsed by 18
organizations, ranging from the national Association of
Evangelicals to the Anti-Defamation League and the Council on
Islamic Education. Haynes describes it as a ``third way,'' leaning
neither left nor right.
</P>
<P>
   Fowler's guidelines for critical study of the Bible are also
excellent starting points for parents and politicians. They
include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Acknowledge that the Bible is a document that took form over
several centuries in several languages, with contributions from
many sources.
</P>
<P>
   _ Differentiate between the forms and types of writing the Bible
encompasses, from myth to legend, from hymnic poetry to proverbs,
from laws and commandments to gospels, etc.
</P>
<P>
   _ Compare it with texts from other religious traditions _ not to
show its superiority, but to recognize both its uniqueness and
similarities.
</P>
<P>
   _ Be honest about the way it has functioned in different eras
and for different peoples. For example, it has been used both to
justify racial prejudice and as a reference point in drafting this
nation's founding documents.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it is easier to simply omit the Bible or to insist on
one interpretation of it than it is to facilitate students'
critical thinking about it, but we ought not give up on the
challenge. Sunday school is the place for teaching the Bible;
school is the place for teaching about it _ and about other
religious texts.

 &HT;    Internet freedoms endangered by Reno's vow to patrol
superhighway
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Attorney General Janet Reno has fire in her eyes
when she talks about tracking down Internet hackers.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's zeal to throw all the powers of government into the
search for the people responsible for the cybervandalism of Yahoo,
Amazon.com, eBay and a few other Web sites contrasts sharply with
her reluctance to pursue evidence of pervasive criminal
fund-raising conducted in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The cyberpunks, or punk, who jammed up the Web sites deserve
punishment, perhaps with a manual-labor job to repay the damage.
But Web site jamming does not threaten cherished national
treasures, undermine democratic principles or suggest double
standards of justice.
</P>
<P>
   There is something unsettling about the enthusiasm of the
Justice Department to issue cyberbadges to the FBI, and presumably,
every other government agency, so Big Brother can lurk behind
cyberbillboards ready to pounce upon digital vandals.
</P>
<P>
   Damage caused by anti-social hackers can be considerable and
should not be minimized.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the wide-open architecture of the Internet is an open
invitation to cyberhackers just as it opens the door to
advancements in communication, research, education, entertainment
and commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The downside to the Internet is that it is open to everyone
worldwide with access to a computer, which also is its strength.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet can be compared to a democracy where all people are
equal and have the power to control their own destinies.
</P>
<P>
   That egalitarian principle has threatened tyrants and elite
ruling classes throughout human history. The United States, one of
the world's youngest nations, happens to be the oldest democracy, a
condition Americans should jealously guard.
</P>
<P>
   Insecure and despotic governments fear giving too much freedom
to the people. Throughout history, monarchs and ruling classes have
passed all manner of restrictions to keep control and power out of
the hands of common people.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is not a government, a person or even an
institution. It's something brand new, or relatively new. It
doesn't even have an address. It is everywhere, presumably in every
nation and province.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is a new form of communication that embodies
several of the fundamental rights protected in the U.S.
Constitution's Bill of Rights, especially freedom of speech and of
the press.
</P>
<P>
   In some respects, the Internet offers the opportunity for every
person worldwide to publish his or her own newspaper as a personal
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet surely gives citizens everywhere a soapbox to stand
on to expound their thoughts, no matter how goofy or profound.
</P>
<P>
   The American press, unique among private institutions, is
independent of all branches of government. It has been a feisty
watchdog guarding the public against abuses from governmental or
private sectors of society.
</P>
<P>
   It is axiomatic, at least to guardians of the press, that free
speech and free press go hand in hand with a free society. The
freer the speech and the press, the freer the society.
</P>
<P>
   That's why I feel uneasy when the government's highest ranking
law officer promises to unleash the full weight of federal law
enforcement to make the Internet secure from cybervandals.
</P>
<P>
   What will be gained and what will be lost when the Internet
superhighway is patrolled by FBI, ATF, IRS, INS and other
government cybercops?
</P>
<P>
   The feds have no idea if the site jamming was done by an
American citizen. It could have been the act of a savvy but bored
goat-herder in Uzbekistan.
</P>
<P>
   The nature of the Internet might mean that it can never be
totally secure. We must be careful that we do not throttle the
freedom and the opportunities of the Internet while trying to make
it secure.

 &HT;    Scorsese makes
 &HT;    `Personal Journey'
 &HT;    through the movies
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's Valentines Day. And Martin Scorsese's heart
belongs to the cinema. ``I love movies so much,'' the director says
with a passion as profound as a slow-mo punch to Robert De Niro's
mug in Scorsese's visual poem to pugilism, ``Raging Bull.''
</P>
<P>
   He loves movies you've seen a thousand times. Like 1972's ``The
Godfather.'' Ones you've probably never heard of. Like 1949's ``Gun
Crazy.'' And bigger-than-life movies he saw as a kid, partly with
his eyes closed. Like 1946's ``Duel in the Sun.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A Personal Journey With Martin Scorsese Through American
Movies,'' airing in three 90-minute parts at 8 tonight through
Wednesday on Turner Classic Movies, is an often stunning,
fact-filled look at the role directors have played through most of
American cinema.
</P>
<P>
   With revealing clarity, Scorsese discusses the art elements
reflected in myriad directors' works: art vs. commerce; distinct
genres (the western, gangster movies and the musical); the
influence of technology; film language; and more. And he includes
clips. Lots of clips crossing several decades. ``The Bad and the
Beautiful,'' ``High Sierra,'' ``Point Blank'' and ``Meet Me in St.
Louis.'' ``The Birth of a Nation,'' ``East of Eden,'' ``Shock
Corridor'' and ``Bonnie and Clyde.''
</P>
<P>
   From his New York office, Scorsese recently talked about making
``Personal Journey,'' the Directors Guild of America's recent
snubbing of silent era legend D.W. Griffith and other opinions
about movies.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Tell me about your goals with this documentary. You show
clips from a lot of movies many people have never seen.
</P>
<P>
   A: I try to emphasize that I'm not a film critic. I love movies
too much to be a critic. I look at a film that may have one or two
scenes that are good and then the rest of it is not good. ... I
think it's important to look at the documentary not as a history
but a personal look and walk through as what affected me.
Therefore, it's not historical. I was interested in how these minor
films affected me and my filmmaking.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are there one or two directors in ``Personal Journey'' whom
you really want to champion?
</P>
<P>
   A: I really like Jacques Tourneur. Watching his films are like
spending time with family members you love. ``I Walked With a
Zombie.'' ``Cat People.'' It's like spending time with a piece of
music or a painting that moves. I can never tell what the plot is.
Like with ``Vertigo.'' There is no such thing as having seen it too
many times. ``North by Northwest.'' After seeing it 20 or 30 times,
you know the plot and the narrative seems to be most important.
Once you know the narrative, it's not as important anymore.
``Vertigo'' is more emotional and psychological. I see ``Cat
People'' as that way.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you think ``Personal Journey'' will inspire young
moviegoers to go beyond what's at
</P>
<P>
   theaters today?
</P>
<P>
   A: Oh, absolutely. I was surprised there was still more to find
in American cinema. In the past 10 years I've discovered silent
cinema. Up to about 12 years ago, silent films were shown very
poorly in America. You couldn't get emotionally involved with them.
With the restorations _ like ``The Four Horsemen of the
Apocalypse'' _ a whole other world has opened up to me. Even
``Nosferatu'' had a restoration. And it's a revelation. Back in
1962, I saw it in black and white. I always wondered why (the
vampire) was walking around in the daytime. Five years ago I saw
the restoration, and it's tinted blue. That means it's nighttime.
</P>
<P>
   Q:What kind of personal film library do you have?
</P>
<P>
   A:There are several thousand 16mm prints and 1,500 prints in
35mm.
</P>
<P>
   Q:What do you think about the Directors Guild of America's
decision to take D.W. Griffith's name off its special award?
</P>
<P>
   A:I understand it. ``Birth of a Nation'' is an extraordinary
movie. But the racial aspects are very disturbing. That's why I
like ``Intolerance.'' My personal view is that he was the one who
created everything we know about film. He inspired the Russian
montage of the '20s. We owe everything in the silent period to
Griffith. ... You can't deny that everything comes from him.
</P>
<P>
   Q:It's been awhile since your ``Last Temptation of Christ''
created a stir. Were you surprised by the reaction to it?
</P>
<P>
   A:I had no idea it would cause such a reaction. We knew it would
generate talk and discussion. I like throwing back out to the
public: ``What is the message of Christianity? Are we capable of
living out and behaving in such a way as that? Is it part of our
makeup or are we more in tune with the animal side of our nature?''
But it got bogged down in fundamentalism. In terms of
fundamentalism in America, they can't tell us what to believe.
There were some people who had some wonderful discussions out of
this.

 &HT;    Lewis steps up majority whip campaign, faces tough rivals
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) is ratcheting up his
campaign to be House majority whip if the Democrats win control of
the House next fall, raising money and campaigning for candidates
across the country.
</P>
<P>
   As Lewis sees it, the third-highest ranking post in the House
would give him a platform to bring the Democratic Party, ``under
one roof of one House _ the American House.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a builder of bridges,'' said Lewis, Georgia's senior
congressional lawmaker. ``I bring people together and I will use
that experience in the Democratic leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lewis faces formidable opposition in Reps. Steny Hoyer
(D-Md.), chairman of the Democratic Steering Committee, and Nancy
Pelosi (D-Calif.), a fund-raising machine from the nation's most
populous state.
</P>
<P>
   All three lawmakers are running highly competitive campaigns for
the job, which requires shrewd vote counting skills. The campaigns
are in full force despite an important fact: The Democrats don't
control the House now, and they won't have a chance to win it back
until November's congressional elections.
</P>
<P>
   If Democrats succeed in their mission next fall, Minority Leader
Richard Gephardt (D-Mo.) would likely become speaker and Minority
Whip David Bonior (D-Mich.) would move up to the majority leader
slot, leaving open the whip job.
</P>
<P>
   All three candidates have raised a tidy sum of money to dole out
to lawmakers and new recruits. The idea, perfected by the current
Majority Whip Tom DeLay (R-Texas), is to raise money for candidates
and then call in those chits to win the whip election.
</P>
<P>
   If Lewis defeats Hoyer and Pelosi, he would become the second
African-American elected to a leadership position in Congress,
behind former Democratic Rep. Bill Gray of Pennsylvania, who served
as majority whip from 1989 to 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The importance of such a distinction is not lost on Lewis, a
former civil rights leader and close confidant of Martin Luther
King Jr. Bringing diversity to the upper reaches of Congress is a
key aspect of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a history of fighting, of not giving up,'' Lewis said.
``But I also have a history of caring.''
</P>
<P>
   For months, Lewis ran a low-key campaign out of concern that it
would distract the 211-member caucus from the party's larger goal
of winning back the majority in the House.
</P>
<P>
   But last fall, it became apparent to him that Pelosi was gaining
momentum with her campaign by starting early. Lewis decided that he
``could not afford to stand on the sidelines.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last several months, Lewis has relentlessly gone on the
road to campaign for Democratic candidates, visiting some two dozen
districts over the last three months alone. He meets weekly with
his steering committee of 20 supporters and plans to host dinners
and fund-raisers to whip up support.
</P>
<P>
   To date, Lewis has raised $700,000 in his campaign fund. In
addition, he has given $270,000 to the Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I have more than money to offer,'' Lewis said. ``I
have gone to districts and met with members one on one. I have
shown how accessible I will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi, who would be the first woman elected to a House
leadership position, has raised $1.3 million for the DCCC.
</P>
<P>
   She has raised $700,000 for her political action committee and
contributed $550,000 to individual candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I can bring a fresher perspective,'' said Pelosi,
noting that California is the land of entrepreneurial spirit.
Issues that play big in the West such as urban sprawl,
transportation and the development of high-tech companies, are
starting to move East. The party needs her expertise, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to deal with each issue in a much more comprehensive
way than in the old, stale way,'' Pelosi said.
</P>
<P>
   While the Democratic Party leaders purposely avoided the fray
over the race, it has not stopped other key Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi has support from the ranking Democrats of three
committees. She also has the support of Rep. Cynthia McKinney
(D-Ga.) _ much to the dismay of Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's other Democratic representative, Sanford Bishop, is
solidly behind Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Hoyer has raised $240,000 for his political action committee
over the last year. He has raised $50,000 for the DCCC and plans to
give an additional $50,000 next week.
</P>
<P>
   Hoyer is betting that his years of experience in the Democratic
leadership will win him votes. Before the Republicans took over
Congress in 1994, Hoyer was chairman of the Democratic Caucus. He
narrowly lost the whip job to Bonior in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think members are going to make a judgment on who can best
bring us together,'' Hoyer said. ``Who can reach across regions of
our country from the Northeast to the South to the Midwest.''

 &HT;    The marrying kind: Once is not enough
 &HT;    By Denise Gamino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Dearly Beloved, we are gathered together as
readers this Valentine's Day to celebrate the whimsical love story
of an Austin couple who can't stop getting married.
</P>
<P>
   To each other.
</P>
<P>
   The once and future bride is Karen Richards, 48, owner of Accent
copy and graphics shop. Always at her side is the incurably
romantic repeat groom, Mike Hudkins, 58, owner of TOPS, an office
supply warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   How do they love each other? Let us count the ways.
</P>
<P>
   Dec. 7, 1987, Washington, D.C. _ Mike accompanies Karen on her
business trip to the nation's capital and ends up in the hotel bar
confiding to a stranger that he wants to get married. The newfound
friend choreographs an immediate wedding at a stained-glass church,
complete with an encore Rolls-Royce limo ride past all the
breathtaking monuments of American history.
</P>
<P>
   Dec. 31, 1988, Las Vegas _ Karen and Mike join Karen's parents
in the gambling dreamland for a 2 1/2-minute assembly-line chapel
wedding presided over by a minister who talks about 100 mph and
wears a white suit with huge pockets that only Captain Kangaroo
could love. Mike wipes away tears as they pledge to love and honor
each other til-- death parts them.
</P>
<P>
   Oct. 31, 1991, Austin _ A man and woman dressed as flower
children pull rose petals out of plastic pumpkins on Halloween
night as Mike and Karen march down a hotel lobby staircase to stand
before a minister outfitted as a 13th century friar. So many guests
wear costumes that the bride and groom can't tell who's a
party-crasher and who's not.
</P>
<P>
   June 6, 1993, Phoenix _ Karen and Mike wear shorts as they climb
1.2 miles up to Squaw Peak to stand before a minister. The heat is
so debilitating that when they realize the camera was left in the
car, no one wants to hike down and retrieve it for the magical
nuptial moment.
</P>
<P>
   And the wedding bells are still ringing.
</P>
<P>
   Beckoning as must-do wedding locations are Catalina Island off
the California coast, the Giant Sequoias in Northern California and
Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may skip a year or two if we don't feel like we want to get
married that year,'' Karen said. ``But every year we feel like it,
we're going to get married.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The last one is going to be in Paris, France,'' Mike said.
</P>
<P>
   There's a moment of hesitation, an almost imperceptible quiver
of panic, as Karen absorbs that last thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it won't be the last,'' Karen said. ``We're flexible.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucky, too. Though their paths intersected many times throughout
their lives, they didn't meet until each had experienced first love
and marriage. Each had lived in Indiana, California and Phoenix _
but never knew the other. The closest they came was when Mike's
mother mailed him an Army care package that contained Playboy
magazine photos of Karen, who represented Phoenix in an issue
devoted to beautiful secretaries. Mike and his family didn't know
Karen, but his mother figured her son would enjoy seeing someone
from his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   They met in Austin, where both had real estate jobs. Karen found
a romantic and sentimental man who dreams up unconventional
entrepreneurial schemes and treats her as an equal. Mike said he
found a beautiful, self-made businesswoman with more savvy than an
MBA who happens to share his interest in camping, sailing, travel
and gem shows.
</P>
<P>
   Mike had been married to another woman before choosing to be a
bachelor, and Karen had been married and divorced three times. The
idea of multiple marriages to each other blossomed after Karen
decided she wanted to be married to Mike more times than she had
been married before.
</P>
<P>
   ``That nullifies all those other marriages,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Karen: ``You're my fourth one, my fifth one, my sixth one and my
seventh one.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike: ``And eighth.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen: ``Soon to be ninth.''
</P>
<P>
   Oops. Let's double-check that matrimonial math.
</P>
<P>
   Karen: ``I'm losing count here.''
</P>
<P>
   They have to put the conversation on hold and run through the
nuptial numbers until they have things straight.
</P>
<P>
   Karen: ``So we're going to do the eighth.''
</P>
<P>
   That eighth marriage may happen soon. They plan to be in San
Diego this weekend to shop for a 35-foot sailboat so they can have
a wedding on deck in the harbor of Catalina Island.
</P>
<P>
   The number of weddings they've had is not the only thing Karen
and Mike can't keep straight. Forget trying to ask them the dates
of their weddings. It can take more than 30 minutes to
conversationally chew those numbers over. And they still can't
recite them correctly.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. This couple doesn't do anniversaries. When it's time
to celebrate, they just get married again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day is an anniversary,'' said Mike.
</P>
<P>
   And they truly live that philosophy, says their close friend
Lana Weill, who owns the Austin company that makes Lana's Eggrolls.
She was invited to the couple's third wedding, the Halloween
costume knot-tying gig.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very unusual, but at the same time very encouraging to
me,'' she said. ``It reminds other people that when you marry for a
long time, you tend to take things for granted. This way, you can
remind yourself that you just got married yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike and Karen don't just renew their vows. They always go to
the courthouse and file the proper paperwork for another legal
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   That's perfectly legal in Texas. The law prohibits court
officials from withholding a marriage license just because the
bride and groom already are husband and wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's legal,'' said Travis County Court at Law Judge David
Phillips. ``The family code even anticipates this. I don't know
why.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the Legislature has written a law that says this is OK,
and the county clerk may not refuse to issue a license on the
ground that the applicants are already married to each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that a U.S. law could ever stop this love story. And if it
did?
</P>
<P>
   They'll always have Paris.

 &HT;    Latino love connection
 &HT;    By Mark Bixler
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Jesus Zamoracq has a hard time meeting women. He
leaves home by 7:30 a.m. each day to work construction and does not
return until 8 p.m. He works Monday through Saturday and sometimes
on Sunday, a grueling schedule that leaves little time for dating.
All of his co-workers are men, and it's fun to hang out with them,
but he gets lonesome when he thinks about his ex-girlfriend in
Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   Zamora, 28, has had very few dates since he moved to Georgia six
months ago. So he wasted little time when an opportunity presented
itself as he listened to the radio in his home on Jan. 28.
</P>
<P>
   ``What kind of woman are you looking for?'' the announcer asked.
</P>
<P>
   Zamora had stumbled on a radio show wildly popular among
lovesick Latinos in metro Atlanta. People call the program, talk
about themselves and describe their ideal mate. They give their
phone numbers on the air, hang up and wait for the phone to ring.
</P>
<P>
   The calls have poured in to WWWA-AM (1100) recently from
Hispanics in search of a date for Valentine's Day. Most callers are
Mexican men in their 20s who work long hours painting or building
houses. They are away from home for the first time. Many spend
Saturday night at home because they do not have a car. A few of
them admit on the air that they've never kissed a girl.
</P>
<P>
   For them, broadcasting a request for companionship on AM radio
is the easiest way to get a date.
</P>
<P>
   Their matchmaker and guide on this amorous adventure is Mexico
native Alberto Alvearcq, an announcer whose voice rings with an
enthusiasm that encourages the shy, reassures the forlorn and
extends the promise that true love is only a phone call away. He
often reminds callers that ``there are lots of women listening at
this very minute to this program!''
</P>
<P>
   ``What is your name?'' he asked a caller recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Armando.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Arrrrrrr-mando!'' Alvear repeated in a tone that suggested he
had just won the lottery. ``Where are you from?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Guanajuato.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Guaaaa-nnnaaaaa-juato!''
</P>
<P>
   ``How long have you been in Atlanta?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Three months.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What kind of woman are you looking for?''
</P>
<P>
   Armando said he'd like to meet a woman who shares his interests
and is about his age. He's 22 and said he likes to dance and listen
to music _ not a thorough biographical sketch, perhaps, but enough
to elicit a call the next day from a Guatemalan woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a surprise,'' said Armando, a construction worker
fromthe central Mexicoan state of Guanajuato whose full name is
Armando Jimenezcq.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had a pleasant conversation with the woman who
called, but his hopes ebbed when she said she lived far from his
house near Hartsfield International Airport. He said he wasn't sure
if they would talk again.
</P>
<P>
   ``At times I get lonely,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The love lines are open from 11 a.m. to noon on weekdays on
WWWE-AM (1100), a Spanish-language station in Atlanta. Alvear calls
his show ``La Media Naranja''cq _ ``The Half Orange'' _ because of
a Latin American saying that compares the unattached person to an
incomplete orange made whole when he finds his other half.
</P>
<P>
   Companies with a financial stake in romance sponsor the show.
One big advertiser is a nightclub called La Pantera Rosa _ The Pink
Panther _ that urges listeners to come to a place ``where the party
never ends!'' so they can ``dance to the best groups and with the
prettiest girls!'' Dating services also advertise on the show.
</P>
<P>
   Since ``The Half Orange'' came to metro Atlanta seven years ago,
about 70 couples have married after meeting through the airwaves,
including Joel and Veronica Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Hernandez, 25, said he came to the United States from
Mexico in 1993 and worked as a janitor, cab driver, truck driver,
construction worker and deliveryman. He said it was hard to find
dates during his first few months here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the people here just work, work, work. I was lucky to
hear that program,'' he said. ``I called for fun, just for fun,
just to meet girls. I didn't realize I was going to meet someone _
my wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Veronica Hernandez, now 22, said it was hard to mino men
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that, number one, the men work a lot. Number two is
that they don't have a car,'' she said. ``They don't have the
opportunity to leave work. They don't go to the discotheque. They
don't go to the cafes.''
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the difficulties, she said, was that the men she met
soon after her arrival in 1996 never had anything of interest to
say. It was this frustration that turned her to the radio, where
she heard her future husband describe himself one morning a few
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I very much liked his manner of expression,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She called him, and they talked on the phone over the next three
weeks. Then they met at a restaurant and chatted over hamburgers.
They were soon married and now have two sons, 2-year-old Alexis and
3-year-old Allan. A third is on the way.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates to join the ranks of the betrothed-by-radio include
Cristobal Santos, a 42-year-old immigrant from Chiapas, a
mountainous state in southern Mexico. He came to this country two
years ago and worked in North Carolina tobacco fields and New York
apple orchards before coming to Atlanta six months ago.
</P>
<P>
   After he called Alvear's show, a 44-year-old Columbian woman
called him from her house in a Grayson, a town of about 575 people
Gwinnett County. Now they're seriously dating.
</P>
<P>
   ``She could be my wife one day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most callers are men seeking women, but Alvear said he also airs
calls from women seeking men. Less frequent are on-the-air calls
from men seeking men, and rarer still are calls from women looking
for women. Once in a while, a native-born American will call to ask
for a Hispanic mate. Alvear said occasionally reads letters from
single men in jails and prisons on the premise that the
incarcerated need love, too.
</P>
<P>
   Leo Jackson, producer of the program, said he didn't realize how
hungry people were for a date until the show first aired on WWWE-AM
in August 1998. Even though the program airs for only an hour a
day, Jackson said, phones in the studio ring all day with people
asking about someone they heard on a previous show _ usually they
heard someone interesting but they failed to write down a phone
number.
</P>
<P>
   The show's impact isn't just shown by the matches made, but by
mistakes as well. During one show, Alvear was one digit off in
reading a phone number. He accidentally broadcast the phone number
of a local law firm. Suddenly, workers in the law office were
getting calls for a Hispanic man they had never heard of.
</P>
<P>
   Even when there is interest _ and the right phone number _ it
doesn't always lead to a match.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus Zamora heard from three women after he called the show.
They apparently were impressed with the way he answered Alvear's
questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``What type of woman are you looking for?'' the announcer asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to meet a woman that _ well, I like to read, to
listen to good music, take walks and chat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you also like to dance?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Very little, but I would like to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What kind of music do you like?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I like rock, modern music, bolero, tango and
instrumental music.''
</P>
<P>
   Zamora talked with all three women, but said he worried that
they did not share his interests in things such as mathematics and
the environment. He eventually ruled out two but had a date with
the third that confirmed his hunch: no sparks.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after a hesitant venture into the dating world, Zamora has
rejoined the ranks of lonely Latinos without a date for Valentine's
Day. Together they form a fraternity of the luckless whose sole
membership requirement is a yearning for companionship. Members who
want to get out have their last best shot at a Valentine's date
today. They'll tune in by the thousands at 11 a.m. and listen for
that person who might make them whole.
</P>
<P>
   And if that person doesn't call? Not to worry. Another show airs
tomorrow.

 &HT;    Guidance system for RVs is gaining popularity
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The Dayton Camper and RV Show that ended Sunday
put some of the latest gizmos for the recreational vehicle market
on display.
</P>
<P>
   And John Baldwin, parts manager for Tom Raper RVs of Richmond,
Ind., said the industry is expecting a boom in demand for gadgetry
over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The large group of people who are retiring in the next few
years are used to using high-tech equipment,'' Baldwin said.
``They're going to want systems that tell them where they're going
and where they're going to stay when they get there.

<P>
   One futuristic guidance system suitable for the RV crowd already
is available, according to Carl Marotzke, owner of Stereo on
Wheels.
</P>
<P>
   The Eclipse Commander from Fujitsu TEN is able to understand
verbal requests for directions and guide motorists from place to
place using spoken directions.
</P>
<P>
   The Eclipse Commander, Marotzke said, is linked to the vehicle's
stereo. When the driver wants the system to plan a route, he simply
says ``navigator'' to turn on the system's map functions. He then
says ``route'' and spells out an address such as ``B-R-O-W-N 250''
for 250 Brown St.
</P>
<P>
   Before using the Commander, the driver has to program the
system's memory with a compact disc containing maps of the area
he'll be traveling. The Commander has a built in global positioning
system that uses information from orbiting satellites to determine
the vehicle's current position.
</P>
<P>
   The system looks up the requested address in its memory and
tells the driver the best way to get there. It gives directions
such as ``turn left at the corner 100 feet ahead'' and constantly
updates the driver as he approaches the destination.
</P>
<P>
   Marotzke said the Eclipse Commander also accepts voice commands
to tune its radio or turn on its CD player.
</P>
<P>
   Stereo on Wheels sells the system for $1,069, Marotzke said. For
additional information, visit the Eclipse Web site at

Virgin Atlantic Airways 15 years ago with one jumbo jet, now owns a
hodgepodge of more than 200 Virgin-branded businesses. Now he

   ECOMMERCE-COLUMN (Undated) _ Many e-commerce rookies approached
this post-Christmas season with apprehension, given the dearth of

<P>
   DIGICOM-COLUMN (Undated) _ Last week's Web site attacks were a

more complicated than that. Jim Bowden, the Reds general manager,

MICROSOFT FACES SKEPTICAL MARKET WITH WINDOWS 2000 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MENLO PARK, Calif. _ Will the dogs eat the dog food?
</P>
<P>
   It is a way of wondering whether the customers will accept the
product. And among the elite corps of Microsoft programmers who
labor to turn out each new operating system, the dog food aphorism
has become a way of life.
</P>
<P>
   But on the eve of the official release of Windows 2000, the
software giant's first new business-oriented operating system in
four years, PC power users like the venture capitalist Stewart
Alsop must be giving Microsoft Corp. pause.
</P>
<P>
   Last week at his desk on Sand Hill Road above Silicon Valley,
Alsop sat with two portable computers. On one side of his desk was
his old one, still running the crash-prone Windows 95, now a
half-decade old. On the other sat his brand- new Toshiba running
Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   As the rain pelted down on the Valley's green foothills, Alsop
puzzled over why his just-out-of-the-box computer was crashing each
time he attempted to change its screen resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Emphatically, he said he had no desire to try to master yet
another operating system any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not happy,'' Alsop said. ``Computers used to be fun.''
</P>
<P>
   And that, in a nutshell, is the chasm Microsoft must cross as it
endeavors to switch business users, large and small, to a new, more
powerful operating system that it says offers a host of benefits,
ranging from added stability for mission-critical business centers
to better power management for battery-hungry laptops.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a growing rumbling among early users and analysts
suggested that Windows 2000 might not be a runaway success. The
company's stock fell nearly 6 percent on Friday, closing at 99
15/16, after a Gartner Group report indicated that a significant
number of existing programs used by large corporations would not be
compatible with Microsoft's new operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, on Thursday night, during a conference call held by
Dell Computer to discuss earnings with analysts, the company's
founder and chairman, Michael S. Dell, threw more cold water on the
Windows 2000 launch, saying Dell did not expect a big boost in the
near future from sales of the new operating system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't see a massive immediate acceleration due to Windows
2000,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Microsoft has faced a skeptical media and industry
numerous times before, and the company has almost always managed to
outpace expectations.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, at a planned gala in San Francisco, Microsoft will
officially introduce what are in fact four different operating
systems aimed at different markets: desktop office users, Internet
and other network server applications, and, four months hence, a
data center version that for the first time will permit Microsoft
to compete in the very high end of the computer business.
</P>
<P>
   Windows 2000 boasts a huge array of advanced features _ the user
document describing the product is 253 pages _ intended to put
Microsoft on an even footing with the Unix operating systems that
dominate corporate back offices.
</P>
<P>
   That market is one that Microsoft has long coveted. Indeed,
during the past three years, Microsoft's new chief executive,
Steven A. Ballmer, has frequently sketched for reporters the
company's strategy for attacking Sun Microsystems, the leading Unix
computer vendor.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has long believed that by riding on a wave of
``commodity'' computer hardware _ the vast Intel-based PC industry
_ it would be able to push its operating systems both up and down
the computer industry food chain.
</P>
<P>
   To do that, it has continuously developed and expanded its
operating systems, from the original MS-DOS, which was quickly
cobbled together for the first IBM PC in the early 1980s, through
Windows 3.0, 95, 98, NT, CE and, now, 2000. Each version was aimed
at a different market.
</P>
<P>
   But until now, the high-end computer market has eluded the
giant.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Sun Microsystems was quick to discover the Internet and exploit
its market potential for selling servers and server software, and
Solaris, its version of the Unix operating system, now has an
inside position on most of the nation's largest e-commerce servers.
That has been a significant advantage for Sun, the Mountain View,
Calif., computer maker that was founded to manufacture technical
work stations in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, analysts who are optimistic about Microsoft's
chances at the high end of the computer industry believe that the
software publisher will finally make significant inroads against
its Unix rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Windows 2000 acceptance will be very, very large,'' predicted
Mark Anderson, a computer industry analyst and president of
Technology Alliance Partners. ``The replacement rate'' of
Unix-based systems, he said, ``will go to four-to-one or better.''
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring Anderson's optimism is a feature list for Windows
2000 that begins with its ability to handle larger tasks _ in
industry parlance, ``to scale'' _ running on computers based on as
many as 32 processors. Such systems have increasingly replaced
mainframe computers during the past decade and are now used
extensively in corporate computing centers.
</P>
<P>
   However, Microsoft's most pressing problem in the new corporate
computing market is that it must convince corporate computing
managers that Windows is an effective alternative to an
increasingly stable and scalable opponent: Linux, the free version
of Unix that has recently begun to gain adherents in corporate
settings.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft counters the free-Linux argument by saying that the
price of an operating system represents only a tiny portion of the
total cost of ownership for a complete computer system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cost of the software is a rounding error that can't be the
major deciding factor,'' said Jeff Price, group product manager for
Microsoft Windows.
</P>
<P>
   However, some financial analysts say that Linux's inroads will
make it difficult for Microsoft to expand its 38 percent share of
the corporate computer server market as rapidly as it was able to
grow its Windows 95 and Windows 98 consumer markets. And slowing
growth could hurt the larger Microsoft financial machine, which has
operated as a growth engine for two decades.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Sun executives say that despite Microsoft's
aggressive advertising, it has not developed a product that can
find the sweet spot of the growing Internet server market.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're out telling the world they're going to burn our house
down, but they don't realize we've moved,'' said Anil Gadre, vice
president and general manager of Sun's Solaris operating system
division.

   Sun executives say that Microsoft's assertion that its
32-processor version will match Sun's performance is premature. Not
only will the data-center version of Windows 2000 not appear until
later this year, but Sun is already far more scalable, delivering
clusters of up to eight 128-processor systems.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome of the battle for the very high end of the
computer industry, Microsoft is planning to spend as much as $200
million to convince corporate America that Windows 2000 is the
right operating system.
</P>
<P>
   But the company does not appear to be playing to a wildly
enthusiastic audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the greatest operating system on a variety of
accounts, but it's good enough,'' said Brian Livingston, co-author
of ``Windows 2000 Secrets'' (IDG Books Worldwide, 2000).
</P>
<P>
   And therein may lie Microsoft's biggest challenge this year:
Convincing computer users like Alsop that ``good enough'' is worth
the time and effort of the upgrade.

GOING DOWN TO THE WIRE IN SAN FRANCISCO 
INVESTOR QUANDARY FOR AN INTERNET MAGAZINE

<P>
   As the self-imposed deadline looms for the Hearst Corp. to find
a buyer for The San Francisco Examiner, speculation is intensifying
about who would run a combined newsroom with The San Francisco
Chronicle if they ended up merging.
</P>
<P>
   But it is still not certain if The Examiner, the newspaper that
gave William Randolph Hearst his addiction to journalism more than
a century ago, will fold. Any potential buyer has to make a move by
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, under pressure from local politicians and the
Justice Department, Hearst sweetened its sale offer, including not
just the afternoon newspaper's name and its circulation list but
its office building, delivery trucks and a printing plant.
</P>
<P>
   The economic foundation of a newspaper, however, is advertising.
Under a joint operating agreement the San Francisco Newspaper
Agency handles printing, distribution and advertising sales for The
Examiner (daily circulation 107,129) and The Chronicle (circulation
456,742). Hearst has offered about $660 million for The Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   The effort to sell or shut The Examiner has had problems.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department, which must approve of the dissolution of
the joint operating agreement, has been closely watching the case,
particularly in the wake of recent federal court decisions blocking
plans to end a joint agreement in Honolulu.
</P>
<P>
   In Honolulu, it was the state attorney general who went to court
to try to keep the city a two-newspaper town. In San Francisco, it
was Curt Reilly, a former mayoral candidate who has reason to
dislike The Examiner: In 1993, he broke an ankle in a scuffle with
The Examiner's editor, Phil Bronstein. A hearing on Reilly's suit
is set for March 7.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Barnett, a law professor at the University of California
at Berkeley, said Sunday that he did not expect Hearst to extend
its deadline if no suitors appeared. ``Hearst might go ahead and
consummate the merger, make it a fait accompli, and let Justice
sue,'' he said.

   Investor Quandry for an Internet Magazine
</P>
<P>
   The Industry Standard is the fastest-growing publication in the
Internet field. Advertising is up by more than 400 percent in the
last year. Times are good.
</P>
<P>
   Times are also good for Flatiron Partners, an Internet-focused
venture capital firm that has established more than three dozen of
some of the best-known Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the magazine's parent, Industry Standard
Communications, raised $30 million from private equity groups to
expand the business. The lead investor in the group of five?
Flatiron Partners.
</P>
<P>
   So how will The Industry Standard cover the foibles, failures or
successes of Flatiron and the other companies Flatiron has invested
in?
</P>
<P>
   The potential conflict was such that Jonathan Weber, editor in
chief of the magazine, wrote an editor's letter emphasizing the
magazine's integrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be the first to admit that The Standard is not likely to
be the best source for hard-hitting journalism about IDG (or, for
that matter, about The Standard itself),'' he wrote of IDG Books
Worldwide, majority owner of the magazine. ``But the new partners
have only a modest stake, and they are a good fit for us in part
because they present fewer potential conflicts than many other
possible partners.''
</P>
<P>
   Weber said in an interview that the arrangement was an issue of
concern for not only the magazine but for the media world in
general.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think certainly it is an issue that is increasingly common
for media organizations,'' Weber said. ``But certainly the issue of
covering them is a real one.'' He said that he was reassured by the
fact that Jerry Colonna, managing partner of Flatiron, had worked
at Information Week magazine, where he was the editor for three
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are editorially sophisticated about the media and that
helps us,'' Weber said. ``But it is a legitimate question to raise,
and I don't think that most news organizations do a very good job
of covering their owners.''
</P>
<P>
   Weber added that IDG Books was still the magazine's principal
owner. Flatiron has one seat on The Standard's board and the $30
million put in by the investment group _ of which Flatiron's was
the largest part _ represents 15 percent of the ownership in The
Standard.
</P>
<P>
   Orville Schell, dean of the graduate school of journalism at the
University of California at Berkeley, said there was room for
concern in the new arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Industry Standard has grown like one of those creatures in
a low-budget film,'' he said. ``But all of these fast-growing
nouvelle media outlets are in the territory where they have to be
very careful about not losing their journalistic souls. There are
gale-force winds of money blowing around out there, and it's not
always easy to know how to deport yourself given such pressures.''

   A Star Is Born, or Morphed, More Like It
</P>
<P>
   Move over, Diane Sawyer. Ananova Ltd., the interactive-services
division of the Press Association, Britain's domestic news agency,
has developed a computer-generated newscaster _ part bombshell,
part Max Headroom. The newscaster _ also named Ananova _ will begin
broadcasting news from a Web site (www.ananova.com) in April. Later
this year, it will give information from British databases, tapping
into the resources of ticket outlets and weather services.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Hird, director of new media at the Press Association, said
a colleague had suggested that the Press Association ``was sort of
faceless, so we decided to create a virtual face, a virtual star.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And there are a lot of technophobes around who don't
necessarily like to get their information from a database grid but
from a human voice and face,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Hird said that the next stage would be more utilitarian.
``She'll be able to say, `Such-and-such movie is playing at your
local cinema,' or she'll say, `I know you wanted tickets to ``The
Lion King,'' but it was sold out. I found some. Would you still
like to see the show?'''
</P>
<P>
   Hird said the virtual anchor's hair is blue-green in part to
avoid the blonde-brunette conflict that bedevils so many
broadcasters who are women, and in part to make the figure appear
not quite human.
</P>
<P>
   ``In focus groups, the more human she looked, the more people
generated their own opinions of her, which were not all positive.
So we tried to make her look a little bit otherworldly. And they
tended to favor that.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A moisture-laden storm system will move across New England on
Monday bringing heavy snow near the Canadian border while ice and
rain fall farther south. Earlier, heavy rain will fall into a
shallow layer of cold air trapped in many valleys from central New
York to central and northern New England resulting in a damaging
accumulation of ice on trees and power lines. The ice may reach a
thickness of an inch or more in some areas.
</P>
<P>
   Periods of rain will douse southern New England and the
Northeast Coast. Locally heavy rain and a few rumbles of thunder
will occur during the midday and afternoon as very mild air surges
north along the Atlantic Seaboard. Later Monday afternoon, the rain
will end as drier air arrives from the west. Farther west, patchy
snow will linger near the eastern Great Lakes where gusty breezes
from the north will prevail.
</P>
<P>
   A band of showers and a few potent thunderstorms will precede a
cold front as it moves toward the Southeast Coast. In the wake of
the front, cooler and drier air will spread south through the Ohio
Valley and interior Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   Tranquil conditions will cover the Plains. Areas of low clouds
will linger near a front from the southern Missouri Valley to east
slopes of the northern Rockies. Otherwise, ample sunshine will
cover the region.
</P>
<P>
   The latest in a series of Pacific disturbances will bring wet
weather near the Northwest Coast. Farther east, snow will be
locally heavy along west-facing mountain slopes from northern
California to central Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Severe Icing
</P>
<P>
   A few interior Northeast valleys will begin the day with heavy
icing. Ice is not uncommon in New England. However, severe icing
only occurs when either the frigid air cannot be dislodged or gelid
surface air is replenished from a new source. Monday's icing will
be caused by arctic air stuck in a few valleys of New England as
mild, moist air precedes a storm. The second process led to the
great icestorm of January 1998 in northern New England when
sub-freezing air kept slipping under a wedge of warm, moist air.
Monday's icing will be much shorter in duration and far less
widespread.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Richard Branson was fiddling with one of his new
Virgin-brand mobile telephones in the living room of his Notting
Hill town house here last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to think how it works,'' he said, staring at a
special button on the phone _ a red button, with the Virgin logo.
The button connects customers by voice to operators who also handle
distribution for the Virgin.com Web site. With such a call,
customers can order plane tickets, CD's and an assortment of other
products that Branson usually hawks by nondigital means. After
trying fitfully to explain the red-button function, he finally
conceded that he wasn't sure how it worked, and gave up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was one of those anti-mobile phone guys before we did Virgin
Mobile,'' he explained, referring to the cellular phone service
that he started in November and that has already signed up 300,000
subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Hands-on technical savvy or not, Branson is diving head first
into the digital economy. Call it the dot-comming of the Virgin
Group PLC.
</P>
<P>
   Branson, the brash, 48-year-old British billionaire who founded
Virgin Atlantic Airways 15 years ago with one jumbo jet plying the
London-New York route, now owns a hodgepodge of more than 200
Virgin-branded businesses. And he intends to turn his
tarmac-and-mortar world into something a bit more virtual.
</P>
<P>
   Having slapped the Virgin logo on planes, trains, soda, vodka,
clothing, movie theaters, music stores, a radio station, a
financial services company and even a wedding coordinator, Branson
means to expand his year-old Virgin.com Web site into a worldwide
e-commerce portal that he hopes will take on some of the qualities
of Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   The skeptics say he is already too late to the Internet market
and will surely stumble. ``A lot of traditional businesses have
made these kinds of plans and they've never worked out,'' said Noah
Yasskin, an analyst at Jupiter Communications in London.
</P>
<P>
   But Branson sees himself as specially suited for an
entrepreneurial leap onto the Web.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, unlike Amazon.com _ which began as a book
distributor and is now a diversified digital middleman _ the Virgin
Group has many of its own products to sell. That doesn't mean,
though, that Branson plans to hold his Web customers hostage to the
Virgin brand.
</P>
<P>
   ``If British Airways is selling better products than Virgin
Atlantic, we'll sell the British Airways product,'' he said. ``If
Fidelity is offering a better financial product than Virgin Direct,
we'll recommend the Fidelity product.''
</P>
<P>
   Branson says he will not get snagged on the sticking point that
has caused other brand-name companies to stumble on their way to
cyberspace _ the fear of cannibalizing the established offline
brands. ``It's a fact of life,'' he said, ``that the Internet will
kill off some of our business and severely damage a lot of
conventional industry.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the matter of management and money, which in
the case of the privately held Virgin Group resides chiefly in one
man: Richard Branson, boss and banker, rolled into one.
</P>
<P>
   Having sold 49 percent of his Virgin Atlantic unit to Singapore
Airlines for $965 million right before Christmas, Branson has cash
to burn. And unlike most dot-com's, he notes, his money is real _
not the paper wealth of newly minted Internet stock.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever the advantages Branson describes, Virgin is
entering the Internet arena too late to claim the ``first mover''
edge that Web executives like to tout.
</P>
<P>
   Yasskin, the Jupiter analyst, says that most of the major
sectors of the Web are already carved up by companies like Yahoo
and Amazon.com. ``At least in the U.S. market, Virgin will have a
very hard time competing,'' he said, adding that outside the United
States ``Virgin still has a little time to grab some market
share.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Branson maintains that the Virgin brand is so
strong internationally _ the company is already Britain's biggest
advertiser _ that his relatively late Internet move will not hurt
his chances. In fact, he said his timing might present an
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not lost hundreds of millions of pounds on the Net in
the few years the Net was developing,'' he said, a not-so-veiled
reference to companies like Amazon.com that have spent and lost
large amounts of money building their clientele. ``Our approach is
to come on the Net when the amount of people who are logging on to
the Net are considerable, and where we can actually see real
profits reasonably quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   His remarks may be self-serving, but for Branson and his
privately held company, it is crucial to quickly turn a profit.
Otherwise, he may find it necessary to relinquish some control over
the Virgin Group by raising money in the public stock market _ in
order to compete for big-time capital with the likes of Amazon.
</P>
<P>
   While he says that an initial public offering is on his mind, he
has no immediate plans for one, predicting that he can break into
the European Internet market without a major cash outlay for a
brand-building campaign. But the U.S. market is another matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``In America we're well ahead in the major cities,'' he said,
speaking of Virgin's brand recognition. ``But out in the sticks,
we've still got some way to go. America will be the toughest nut to
crack. We will have to spend big bucks in America.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many of the Internet pioneers who have paid handsomely to
simply get their name out, Virgin already has dozens of branded
products to help keep its name in the public eye. Branson said, for
example, that he intends to have ``Virgin.com'' painted onto the
sides of his planes in place of the ``No Way BA/AA'' slogan that
has adorned Virgin's fleet since his nemesis, British Airways,
announced an abortive plan for a far-reaching alliance with
American Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Without the dot-com money of a publicly traded company, Branson
seeks attention for himself and his company in ways beyond paid
advertising. Virgin generates press releases on an almost daily
basis, and he is not above publicity stunts like the Virgin Mobile
rollout in November. Creating a stir widely chronicled in the
British tabloids, he held a parade of sorts in the West End of
London, riding a float on which he surrounded himself with nude
models talking on Virgin Mobile phones. The slogan for the new
company: ``What you see is what you get.''
</P>
<P>
   He also primes the publicity pump by making himself freely
available for interviews. ``It's cheaper than buying a full-page ad
in The New York Times,'' he joked.
</P>
<P>
   Still, wielding his brand identity against Internet upstarts is
one thing. Taking on one of Europe's fasting-growing communications
powers is another. And that is precisely the collision course he
has set for himself with Virgin Mobile, a joint venture with the
Deutsche Telekom unit One2One. Despite its 300,000 subscribers in
Britain, Virgin Mobile, will be up against the combined 42 million
European subscribers of Vodafone AirTouch and Mannesmann, which
announced plans for the biggest industrial merger ever the week
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Branson predicts that Virgin Mobile will be able to gain ground
on Vodafone when the licensing begins this spring for Britain's
next generation of wireless telephones _ digital devices that are
to combine voice, Internet access and other digital features.
Toward that end, he has put together a group of investors that
include the Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen and the venture
capitalist George Soros.
</P>
<P>
   But again, Branson may be a bit late, some contend. ``It's going
to take Virgin years to build a network,'' Yasskin said. ``And by
the time they do, they will have missed the huge growth period.
Anyway, the incumbents always have an advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Branson nonetheless says that he will be able to compete with
established players like Vodafone. ``There is no reason we can't
offer anything that Vodafone can,'' he said. ``We will by no means
be as big as them, but we will have a slice of the market.''
</P>
<P>
   All of his businesses that have succeeded so far have done so by
carving out a niche in a mainstream industry by emphasizing service
and style _ whether it be Virgin Atlantic, with its interactive
movie and game system in every seat in economy class, or Virgin
Bride, a one-stop shop for weddings.
</P>
<P>
   Virgin's philosophy, Branson said, is to improve upon
established businesses by adding a Virgin-esque sensibility.
</P>
<P>
   With Virgin Mobile, for example, he is taking the unusual step
of giving away an earpiece with a built-in microphone with each of
the company's mobile phones, so users do not have to hold them to
their heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``A friend of mine got a brain tumor, and before he died we had
dinner and he said his surgeon was convinced that using a mobile
phone may have been a factor,'' Branson said, raising a
product-liability specter that the head of a public company might
be likely to suppress.
</P>
<P>
   And the Virgin Web site will cater to Branson's digital naivete.
``Any jargon that I don't understand'' will be stripped out, he
said. ``I assume that I am representative of the vast majority of
the people out there.''
</P>
<P>
   That thinking may explain why for Branson _ who in the past has
attempted a solo, round-the-world balloon flight and who owns an
island in the Caribbean _ taking his business onto the Internet
does not seem as as much fun as some of his previous endeavors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't excite me in the same way that starting Virgin
Atlantic did,'' he admitted. ``It's because I could deal with
people. And with the Internet, you're one step removed from the
people.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Tom Landry, the taciturn Texan who coached the Dallas Cowboys
for their first 29 seasons and led them to five Super Bowls, died
Saturday night in Dallas. He was 75.
</P>
<P>
   Landry died at Baylor University Medical Center, where since May
he had periodically undergone treatment for acute myelogenous
leukemia, a hospital spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Landry was head coach of the Cowboys from the team's inception
in 1960 through 1988, and he created a stir in the National
Football League with innovative schemes and his team's success.
After six mediocre seasons, including an initial 0-11-1 year when
the team played before small crowds at the cavernous Cotton Bowl,
Landry's Cowboys ran off 20 consecutive winning seasons, an NFL
record. During that span, Dallas won 13 division titles, made 18
playoff appearances and won two Super Bowls in five appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing his trademark fedora and conservative suit, Landry was
the cool, stoic man on the sideline for the franchise that under
his leadership became known as America's Team.
</P>
<P>
   Landry's 270 victories are the third most in NFL history behind
Don Shula and George Halas. His overall record as the Cowboys' head
coach was 270 victories, 178 losses and 6 ties for a .601 winning
percentage. Landry entered the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   But despite his overall success in Dallas, Landry's last three
seasons there produced records of 7-9, 7-8 and 3-13. The team was
bought in February 1989 by its current owner, Jerry Jones, and
Landry was dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Landry's contributions to pro football were significant. As a
player-coach and then as an assistant coach for the Giants in the
1950s, Landry devised the 4-3 defense, a formation featuring four
down linemen and three linebackers. It remains a staple of pro
football. Landry's defensive units, featuring Roosevelt Grier, Andy
Robustelli, Dick Modzelewski and Jim Katcavage on the line, Sam
Huff as the middle linebacker and Emlen Tunnell and Jimmy Patton in
the secondary, played a major role in the Giants' successes of the
late 1950s. With Landry running the defense, the Giants won three
Eastern Conference titles and an NFL championship in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   In Dallas he created the umbrella-like flex defense, and his
Dallas coaching staff was the first to use computers to gain an
edge in scouting, preparation and game planning. He reintroduced
the shotgun formation to pro football, and his offenses presented
multiple formations that confused defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Tex Schramm, the longtime Cowboys president, once said of him,
``He provided the leadership that set our sails.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Wade Landry was born on Sept. 11, 1924, in Mission,
Texas. He played fullback at Mission High School (his team
outscored opponents by 322-0 in his senior year) and entered the
University of Texas. After playing in the 1942 season, under the
renowned coach Dana X. Bible, he was off to the Army Air Forces. He
would fly 30 B-17 missions over Europe as a member of the 8th Air
Force in Europe in World War II and survived one crash landing.
</P>
<P>
   Discharged in November 1945 as a first lieutenant, Landry
returned to Texas and played fullback and a bit of quarterback,
behind the all-American Bobby Layne; he also played defensive back
for the Longhorns. He won all-Southwest Conference honors as a
junior and was a co-captain as a senior. He played on Texas teams
that won the 1948 Sugar Bowl over Alabama and the 1949 Orange Bowl
over Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   After playing for a year with the New York Yankees football team
of the All-America Conference, Landry joined the New York Giants of
the NFL in 1950. He was a Giants star through the 1955 season as a
left defensive halfback, playing on the same side with the Hall of
Fame safety Tunnell. Landry intercepted 31 passes with the Giants,
returned three of them for touchdowns and was named All-Pro in
1954.
</P>
<P>
   In his first season with the Giants, under the veteran head
coach Steve Owen, who had only a few assistants, Landry was already
showing leadership. ``I was playing left defensive halfback, and I
thought someone really had to coordinate us back there,'' Landry
would recall. ``If the end moved out into the flat, I had to know
where I was going and where Em Tunnell was going to go, and so on.
So I kind of just took it upon myself at practice to direct a lot
of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Landry became a player-coach, handling the defense, when Jim Lee
Howell was named the Giants' head coach in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   He retired as a player after the 1955 season and then served as
the Giants' defensive coordinator from 1956 through 1959, teaming
up most of that time with the offensive coordinator Vince Lombardi,
later the revered Green Bay Packers coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vince was a pure teacher, but he could not get what he wanted
off films as quick as Tom,'' Wellington Mara, the Giants' owner,
once said. ``In fact, there were few people who were as quick a
study as Tom.''
</P>
<P>
   Mara tried to hire Landry as the Giants' head coach in 1960. But
Landry took the Cowboys' coaching job instead. He was living during
the off-season in Dallas and knew the men building the expansion
team _ Clint Murchison Jr., the owner, and Schramm, the general
manager.
</P>
<P>
   Landry remembered that when Schramm offered him the job, ``I
said to my wife: `Oh, well, we might as well try it. We'll probably
be fired in two or three years but what the heck.'''
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Lee Roy Jordan once said: ``He taught that if you
depend on emotion and you lost that, the result will be
disappointing. If you play on execution and knowledge, you won't
have those valleys.''
</P>
<P>
   Landry was known as an emotionless coach who kept a distance
between himself and his players. But describing his last meeting
with his Cowboys players, he wrote: ``This was going to be even
harder than I thought. I tried to clear my throat but a huge lump
remained. I could feel tears rolling down my cheeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Landry's dismissal from the Cowboys hurt him deeply. He once
wrote: ``People say you have to know when to retire, which is a
dumb thing to say. If you want to go out on top, yeah, it becomes
important when you quit. But I wasn't afraid of that. And I wasn't
worried about getting fired. I knew the risk. To me, it's not an
ego thing. I enjoy coaching. I enjoy helping people achieve
something. But it's all over now. And I can't worry about things
over which I have no control.''
</P>
<P>
   Landry is survived by his wife of 51 years, Alicia; a son, Tom
Jr.; and one daughter, Kitty Phillips. Another daughter, Lisa, died
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Landry often spoke of his Christian faith. During and after his
football career he worked nationally for the Fellowship of
Christian Athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom has the ability outwardly to appear very level, but he is
human,'' Schramm once said of him. ``I know some of the losses must
have torn him up pretty good inside.''
</P>
<P>
   The folded arms on the sideline. The rugged, set jaw. The
fedora.
</P>
<P>
   Landry once said of his headgear: ``My hats did give me an
identity. In fact, if I had a dollar for every time someone has
seen me bareheaded and said, `I almost didn't recognize you without
a hat on,' I could have bought the Cowboys myself.''

PACIFIC ISLANDS SEEK CONTROL OF `DOT-COM' DESIGNATIONS
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The 49 residents of Pitcairn Island, a British
territory in the South Pacific, are proud descendants of the
infamous Bounty mutineers. So perhaps it is fitting that they are
now leading a mutiny of sorts on the Internet _ a rebellion of the
little guys that has already spread to one other Pacific island and
is expected to mushroom among tiny nations and territories
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   What has these mini-polities in a roil is the loss of a dot and
two letters _ the suffixes originally assigned to denote the
territories in Internet domain names.
</P>
<P>
   In Pitcairn's case, its suffix, known as a top-level domain, is
.pn, and it ended up controlled by a British company after Tom
Christian, the great-great-great-grandson of the Bounty's head
mutineer, Fletcher Christian, cut a deal with the company.
</P>
<P>
   Why are these little suffixes such hot properties? Because all
the good names that end in dot-com have been taken. So a customer
that wants, for example, a domain based on the name apple, goes to
one of dozens of renegade registrars around the globe and buys a
domain like apple.pn.
</P>
<P>
   But that practice may be about to end.
</P>
<P>
   Acting on a petition signed by all but two of Pitcairn's adult
inhabitants, the U.S. government and the Internet Corp. for
Assigned Names and Numbers, or Icann, on Friday confiscated .pn
from the registrar company that had been passing it out and gave it
back to the island community.
</P>
<P>
   It was an unprecedented and controversial act, and Icann
officials expect it will be just the first of many showdowns
between early Internet profiteers and small countries and
territories. Because they were late to the Internet and e-commerce,
many of these tiny, often remote places are only now discovering
that the two-letter Internet addresses set aside for them in the
early 1990s have been lost to far-away companies.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Touton, Icann's vice president and general counsel, said
several small countries and territories had already made inquiries
about reclaiming their domains. He said that at its board meeting
in March, Icann, which runs the Internet's address system, expects
to consider a formal proposal to restore to all nations and
territories sovereign control of their domains.
</P>
<P>
   The next big showdown could come from another South Pacific
territory, American Samoa, whose designated country code, .as, is
similar to the English ``Inc.'' in Denmark.
</P>
<P>
   Allegations that the governor of that island might have several
years ago signed it over to insiders to market at a profit in
Denmark has become a political scandal in Samoa, a cash-strapped
territory with a long history of political corruption.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, American Samoa's Legislature, or Fono, explored the
question of who gave control of .as to a Samoan man now living in
Hawaii and who was behind a partnership with a New York company
that markets it in Scandinavia.
</P>
<P>
   Afoa Lutu, director of the island's Legislative Reference
Bureau, said the investigation was started out of concern that the
territory's domain was being sold ``without any benefit to the
territory in times of deep financial trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Dot-as domains are currently available for $45 a year from a New
York company, GDNS. The number already registered is not known, and
GDNS officials could not be reached for comment on Friday. In the
past, however, one source close to the operation referred to it as
a ``nice little business.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitcairn's island council first began trying to reclaim its
domain in 1997, after the island realized it was seeing no
financial benefit from Christian's arrangement. The island
currently has just one satellite phone and no e-mail capabilities.
But Icann said the council wanted control of the domain both to
raise money to bring Internet connectivity to its residents and to
build a Web page with information about the island.
</P>
<P>
   In all, there are 246 ``country codes,'' all of which were
created and assigned by Jon Postel, one of the Internet's founders.
The question of whether governments should be able to make
sovereign claims to them has been brewing since the Clinton
administration in 1998 selected Icann to take over international
administration of the domain name system.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Icann's government advisory committee is expected to
deliver its policy recommendations for handling such disputes.
Officials at the Commerce Department, which helped draft the
proposal, said the document was intended to preserve the spirit of
the informal and hard to implement rules that had been followed by
Postel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our hope,'' said Andrew J. Pincus, general counsel for the
department, ``is that these principles can be used to craft
agreements that facilitate delegation of'' the country codes ``in a
manner that serves the interests of the relevant local community
and reduce conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal will be considered by Icann at its next board
meeting in Cairo on March 7 through 10.
</P>
<P>
   Critics assert that the document goes beyond Postel's informal
rules and gives too much power to governments and to Icann.
</P>
<P>
   ``The document, as I've seen it, is essentially a sop to Icann's
authority,'' said Antony Van Couvering, who works with a coalition
of companies that traffic in country-code domain names and opposes
giving countries sovereignty over their domain names.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing in that (document) that talks about due
process for discovering if a domain has been badly managed,'' he
said. ``There's nothing in there that talks about what if it's
badly managed by a government.''
</P>
<P>
   Postel's original guidelines for country codes clearly stated
that to get control of a domain, a registrant had an
``administrative'' partner within the country or territory that
owned the suffix and that ``these designated authorities are
trustees for the delegated domain, and have a duty to serve the
community.''
</P>
<P>
   But when the Internet gold rush began, a number of companies
looking to enter the domain name registration business found codes
for islands and small countries that had not yet been assigned,
then found someone in those areas to get the domain for them.
</P>
<P>
   Those contacts were sometimes government officials, and the
agreements were not always just for profit. For example, the
profits from the sale of domains for the Cocos Islands, .cc and
.cs, have financed Internet connections for residents.
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, however, the domains were set up with no formal
authorization, sometimes without the knowledge of the communities
in question. Such apparently is the case in American Samoa, where
the domain was claimed in 1997 by a man named Joseph Matua of AS
Domain Registry, whose address is a post office box in Pago Pago.
It is now being marketed by GDNS to companies in Denmark.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to find out who gave permission or authority to
the private business to market the domain dot-as and what if any
benefits have been received by this private business in the
marketing of this,'' Lutu said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question here,'' he added, ``is what is the government
doing when its top domain is being used by a private company
without input, without policy guidelines _ and what benefits is the
American Samoa government receiving.''

PUBLISHERS ARE ACCUSED OF USING FALSE CLAIMS TO   DECEIVE READERS

   NEW YORK _ Two years ago, the authors of ``The Beardstown
Ladies' Common-Sense Investment Guide'' watched their sales
deteriorate along with their savvy reputation when the group of
women from Beardstown, Ill., acknowledged that their dust-jacket
boast of having beaten the stock market with 23.4 percent annual
returns was actually inflated by a computer data error.
</P>
<P>
   Now, long after their stock-picking acumen was cast in doubt,
the ladies from that small Illinois town have inspired another
tempest in a book jacket.
</P>
<P>
   The cover of the group's ill-fated investment guide inspired two
false-advertising lawsuits in California and New York that have
resulted in diametrically opposed legal judgments.
</P>
<P>
   The suits also appear to have spawned imitator plaintiffs who
have pressed a class-action lawsuit against other major publishers,
demanding unspecified damages in connection with the 1999
publication of ``McNally's Dilemma,'' a Florida Gold Coast mystery
with a dead author's name splashed in bold on the cover and the
real writer's credit squeezed in fine print on the copyright page.
</P>
<P>
   The basic question raised by such claims is whether some of the
standard puffery and hyped claims on a book jacket amount to free
speech protected by the First Amendment. If a grammar-challenged
celebrity writes a book with the discreet help of an unnamed ghost
writer, is it false advertising if the celebrity gets the credit on
the cover?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Beardstown Ladies'' presents a perplexing issue to judges
in California and New York.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of book buyers sued the publisher, Hyperion, through
its parent company _ Walt Disney's Buena Vista Publishing unit _
contending that they were deceived. The complaint was not about the
words between the covers, which are clearly protected by the
free-speech provisions of the First Amendment. Their argument was
that a cover of a book is something different: an advertisement
designed to increase sales, and thus a form of commercial speech.
</P>
<P>
   Last month a New York judge scoffed at the claim, dismissing a
lawsuit brought by three book buyers in Connecticut and New York
who accused Buena Vista Publishing of tricking them.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Herman Cahn of the New York state Supreme Court in
Manhattan found that the book-jacket copy summed up information
from the text and was not commercial speech. ``While an erroneous
statement of fact is not worthy of constitutional protection, it is
inevitable in free debate,'' he wrote, noting, ``Thus, the First
Amendment requires that even some falsehood be protected in order
to protect speech that matters.''
</P>
<P>
   A California judge also dismissed a suit involving the
investment guide, on similar grounds, but a state appellate court
took a different view, ruling that it was commercial speech with
verifiably false claims that are not protected by the First
Amendment. The publisher is seeking a review of the appellate court
decision by California's high court.
</P>
<P>
   ``That sent shock waves through the publishing industry, and
it's not just limited to publishers,'' said Victor A. Kovner, who
represented Buena Vista. ``It could affect magazines and motion
pictures.'' He noted that in the last year there had been ``a
cottage industry growing of class-action cases against book
publishers for false advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York, a different law firm, Beatie &AMP; Osborn, handled the
Beardstown lawsuit against Hyperion and is also pressing
false-advertising claims against Penguin Putnam, which published
``McNally's Dilemma,'' and Simon &AMP; Schuster, which produced the
audio version of the novel.
</P>
<P>
   The mystery book features Lawrence Sanders' classic detective
character, Archy McNally, but the book was not written by Sanders,
the author of some 38 novels and thrillers who died in February
1998. Backed by Sanders' estate, the writer, Vincent Lardo, created
the tale, although Sanders got the credit from the grave, with his
name appearing in large letters at the top of the cover.
</P>
<P>
   Russel H. Beatie Jr., the lawyer pressing the lawsuit against
Penguin Putnam for a book buyer named Isaac Kahan, said that
initially he had doubts about pursuing the issue. ``My reaction
was, get something real,'' he said, adding that he had changed his
mind after going to lunch with a friend who had read the same book
and felt he had been deceived when he learned Sanders was not the
author.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   His firm is working with another New York law firm, Camhy
Karlinsky &AMP; Stein, to prepare to appeal the New York dismissal of
the lawsuit involving ``The Beardstown Ladies.'' But in the
meantime, Beatie has continued to explore the issue of authors who
write from the grave. Beatie said that the firm had discovered two
other instances of ``resurrection'' books and is prodding some of
the same publishers to join their negotiations for a potential
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Would Beatie take issue with a celebrity author who secretly
relies on a ghost writer _ a common practice in the publishing
industry?
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't thought about it enough to know how to deal with
it,'' he said. ``I think the question that we're dealing with is
the guy's dead. He didn't have anything to do with the plot. In
another case, the guy has been dead nine years. I think it's just a
different fact situation.''

COVERING THE CAMPAIGNS FOR THE CITIZEN-BROWSER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every reporter who has ever dreamed of a world without editors
might see Jacob Weisberg as a man who has achieved nirvana. Every
libertarian Internetophile who believes that the World Wide Web
will democratize information might see Weisberg, Slate magazine's
leading political correspondent, as the man to unlock the medium's
revolutionary potential.
</P>
<P>
   How, then, would the restless reporters feel if they knew that
Weisberg has thousands of editors _ readers who react instantly and
viscerally to his work? And how would the Net libertarians take it
if they knew that the political news media see Weisberg as one of
their own?
</P>
<P>
   Many old-media hacks, whose conventions (objectivity, anyone?)
were supposed to be exploded by the Web, read his online Ballot Box
submissions regularly.
</P>
<P>
   Slate, the liberal magazine Salon.com and the Web site of the
conservative National Review are cited regularly in The Hotline,
the Washington-based online bible of who wrote what about whom.
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, said one old-media correspondent, Weisberg and
some of his online magazine competitors _ Jake Tapper, who reports
for Salon.com, and the National Review's Richard Lowry, John J.
Miller and Ramesh Ponnuru _ are using the Web to create national
alternative newspapers, which publish early and often.
</P>
<P>
   ``Day to day,'' said Dan Balz, a reporter for The Washington
Post, the Web magazines offer ``the ability to be very irreverent
about all aspects'' of the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet, whose armies have laid waste to the conventional
beliefs of retailing, brokerage houses and help-wanted advertising,
has had a more subtle impact on political journalism so far.
</P>
<P>
   The Web's growing legions of campaign reporters have married
into the local population, spreading Web culture in a way
comparable to the way Alexander the Great's troops spread Greek
culture. They wear the local costumes: Daily dispatches on
MSNBC.com seem like wire service wrap-ups; ABCNews.com's brief,
daily reports read like campaign diaries.
</P>
<P>
   Weisberg's elegant satire and analysis would seem at home in The
New Republic. Tapper could have dominated an alternative
newspaper's cover with his dogged pursuit of Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas, for example, in writing about the Republican candidate's
appearance at a fundamentalist university that bans interracial
dating.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a difference. If this column had been written for
the Web, for instance, by now you might have seen hot links to
everything from a map of Alexander's campaigns to the Bob Jones
University home page. If this had been written for the Web, the
writer's e-mailbox would be clogged with missives from readers
reacting to these ideas.
</P>
<P>
   As Weisberg said last week on the telephone, ``At New York
magazine'' _ where he worked before joining Slate in 1996 _ ``I had
to be finished with a story Wednesday morning that would not be
read by people until the next Monday. It was an exercise in
guessing what was going to happen, bluffing, pretending you knew
the results of things you couldn't possibly know.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Internet, he said, ``you're unscoopable. If you have a
good idea, there is no reason not to put it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Slate's editor, Michael Kinsley, lets Weisberg post his
writing unedited. ``He has the car keys,'' Kinsley said. (Weisberg
does have old-media ties as a contributing writer for The New York
Times Magazine.)
</P>
<P>
   This year's political coverage in the online magazines is far
closer to mainstream journalism than Hunter Thompson's manic 1972
work for Rolling Stone or the blaring of talk radio in 1992. Still,
the reader-reaction ``threads'' on the Web sites have talk radio's
visceral feel.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And both Slate and Salon.com have actively tweaked tradition
this year.
</P>
<P>
   On the day of the New Hampshire primary, Slate flouted the media
pact to withhold exit-polling data until the polls closed; its
readers learned of projections of the lopsided win by Sen. John
McCain of Arizona in the Republican primary by 4:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Salon.com assigned its contributor Dan Savage to the Iowa
caucuses. He posted a piece saying that, while nursing the flu, he
had licked the doorknobs of the campaign headquarters of Gary
Bauer, the conservative Republican candidate, then licked a pen and
presented it to Bauer. Reader reaction reflected the Web's
emotionalism and ambiguity: If the account was a spoof, one person
wrote, ``it is hugely amusing and creative''; if not, he said, ``it
violates my definition of media ethics.''
</P>
<P>
   The Web journalists do take advantage of their medium. Weisberg,
who at 35 is the dean of the lot; Tapper, 30; and the members of
the National Review's staff, who range in age from 25 (Ponnuru) to
31 (Lowry, the editor), all have their articles forwarded by e-mail
to friends, competitors and sources. All use hyperlinks, which
allow them to make a shorthand reference to an issue, then, via
links, send the reader to the appropriate position paper.
</P>
<P>
   Weisberg believes ``the format doesn't have to be as rigid.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is more spontaneous,'' he said. ``I was someone who never
used the personal pronoun in writing. In the Internet, your being
there is such an important part of your readers' experience.''
</P>
<P>
   As a weekly columnist for MSNBC.com, Howard Fineman, the
Newsweek columnist and political commentator, is getting to know
the Web's horde of impromptu editors. ``My byline is hot-linked,
meaning that as soon as I send my words of wisdom to the world, I
am immediately brought up short by people e-mailing me back.''
</P>
<P>
   Ponnuru, one of the National Review's on-again, off-again
campaign correspondents, said the medium lends itself to analysis
with attitude; it ``does scramble expectations about what one is
supposed to do and one isn't.'' On Friday, after examining Bush and
McCain's claims and counterclaims in their tax proposals, Ponnuru
and Miller wrote, ``Maybe it's a pointless exercise: McCain knows
that he can wing it and then spin his way out of trouble because
voters aren't thinking about issues. It would be nice if a few
journalists were.''
</P>
<P>
   Such barbs are hardly revolutionary. John Heilemann, who in 1996
was Hotwired.com's campaign correspondent, believes political
coverage on the Web missed its revolutionary moment, because it
transformed from an alien presence to a conventional one so fast.
</P>
<P>
   The moment may have come and gone in 1998, he said. There was no
presidential campaign then, but during the Lewinsky scandal, Matt
Drudge nipped at journalists' flanks, biting off a mixture of
gossip and fact. This time around, Drudge's Web site has been the
dog that did not bark.
</P>
<P>
   Heilemann, who is writing a book on Silicon Valley, said in an
interview, ``So much has happened in the last four years that the
Web doesn't feel avant-garde anymore. We went from the year when it
was off the charts to the year when it was mainstream.''
</P>
<P>
   Up to a point. Salon.com's Washington bureau chief, David Weir,
believes that Web-based political journalism has a new emotional
immediacy. And, he said, there is ``an accountability factor _ how
fast your audience can come back to you,'' or check a writer's
documentation.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign coverage, he said, shows that ``the whole
relationship between the journalist and the audience is undergoing
a gradual, subtle transformation. But we don't know where it all
leads.''

GUINNESS TRIES LIGHTER IMAGE TO ATTRACT A NEW GENERATION
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For decades, Heineken has proclaimed in a popular British
campaign that it ``refreshes the parts other beers cannot reach.''
Now a British competitor of Heineken is mounting an ambitious
campaign in the United States, asserting that it offers similar
refreshment.
</P>
<P>
   The Guinness Bass Import Co., the unit of Diageo PLC that
distributes and markets Guinness stout in the United States, is
overhauling its sales pitch in substantive ways meant to make the
brand seem less intimidating to those Americans, particularly in
their mid-20s, who typically favor imported beers. That demographic
group is often put off by the iconic, even imperial, image of
Guinness _ not to mention widespread perceptions that it's more
sour and chewy than the signature bread of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   A revamped advertising, promotional and public relations
campaign, carrying the new theme ``Guinness refreshes the spirit,''
began running last week. Guinness Bass plans to beef up the budget
for the campaign, with ads being created by the company's longtime
agency, Weiss Stagliano Partners in New York. Spending is to be
increased to $40 million for 2000 from the mid-$30 million range
previously; about half is for advertising and the rest for
promotions and public relations.
</P>
<P>
   The shifts for Guinness are indicative of the responses by a
wide variety of marketers to the challenges they face in seeking to
appeal to a generation of consumers substantially different from
its predecessors, yet still retain the loyalty of current, older
customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This comes from what our current consumers think of the
brand,'' said James Thompson, vice president for marketing at
Guinness Bass in Stamford, Conn., summarizing the results of
research, ``and from people who want to try the brand, who need
that extra push to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a momentum behind the Guinness brand, which has more
than doubled its sales in the U.S. in the last five years,'' he
added. ``But if we reached just 1 percent of the American beer
market, that would double our sales again.'' Guinness Bass shipped
9.5 million cases of Guinness to distributors in 1999, an increase
of 8.8 percent from 8.7 million cases in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The new campaign replaces one that has run in the United States
for almost three years and which was known as ``The perfect pint''
because it concentrated on the physical attributes of Guinness like
its color, creaminess and carbonation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Internally, we used to call it the Pavlov's dog campaign,''
said Adam Stagliano, president and account planning director at
Weiss Stagliano, because those ``very product-centric ads were
about the incredible power of Guinness, and the anticipatory
process of drinking the product, to get people salivating.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We always wanted to celebrate product virtues, not combat
perceived vices,'' he added, referring to the beliefs that Guinness
is a heavy, highly caloric drink best when served warm. ``But if
you just play on the success of the past, you're already falling
behind.''
</P>
<P>
   So the new campaign, appearing in what Thompson called key
markets across America like Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles,
New York and San Francisco, is intended to eschew hero-izing the
sensory appeal of the product, he said, in favor of ``focusing much
more on the emotional benefit, which starts where the senses
finish.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea is that ``whatever you're doing, Guinness can make it
just that little bit better,'' Thompson said. And that is conveyed
primarily by presenting the brand being enjoyed in a more rich
social context with greater energy and colors that have been
lightened up.
</P>
<P>
   Darker, moody ads, each of which showed a sole drinker
contemplating a glass of Guinness, are being supplanted by cheery
paeans to sociability that honor gregarious groups.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a television commercial begins with three friends
in a bar, then shifts to a surreal, brightly lighted reverie
involving a train filled with people singing ``Carmina Burana,'' a
1930s cantata that is featured in contemporary works of the
hip-hoppers Sean (Puffy) Combs and NAS.
</P>
<P>
   A humorous radio spot lays it on a bit thicker. An announcer
describes how someone sipping a Guinness ``is experiencing a
connectedness with his fellow Guinness drinkers, a shared
appreciation for their moment together'' and declares: ``That's
what Guinness is all about. Embracing life.''
</P>
<P>
   And pastel-colored print ads and posters associate Guinness with
vigorous activities like a crew team rowing on a river.
</P>
<P>
   Can the new tack work? There's a tale told along Madison Avenue
about the pitfalls of the previous approach: A British cigarette
brand named Strand was introduced with a campaign developed from a
research insight that smokers tended to see themselves as lone
wolves.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the story goes, the campaign came out with the
theme ``You're never alone with a Strand'' _ and British smokers
hated it. The reason? They believed buying the brand branded them
as lonely losers, not loners.
</P>
<P>
   So in America, where loneliness is typically deemed next to
godlessness, it makes sense to portray Guinness drinkers in
bunches. After all, even the bottles come in packs.

IN MERGING, COREL AND INPRISE AIM FOR A SOFTWARE NICHE
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Calif., Canada)   (nk) 
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Can two losers from the Windows world marry and find happiness _
or at least better sales _ in the Linux world? It may seem like a
long shot, but that is the bet Corel Corp. appears to have made in
announcing last week that it will merge with Inprise/Borland Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Corel's primary product is WordPerfect Office, a suite of
productivity applications, including word processing, spreadsheet
and database, that runs a very distant second in the market to
Microsoft Office. Corel actually acquired most of the parts of its
suite from Novell Inc., which had bought some of them from Borland
before Borland withdrew from the Windows application market to
concentrate on software development tools under the Inprise name.
</P>
<P>
   Though there remains a loyal core of WordPerfect users,
primarily in law offices and corporations, and though many
programmers still use Borland products to create new software,
neither Corel nor Inprise has managed to achieve profitable growth
for some time.
</P>
<P>
   But last year's introduction of Corel Linux added a bit of
luster to the company's image, and a few points to its share price,
allowing it to use those shares for its planned acquisition of
Inprise in a stock swap valued at $1.07 billion, or about $14.94 a
share.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Corel, which is based in Ottawa, closed on Friday at
$17.50 in Nasdaq trading, after dropping as low as $2 the last 52
weeks. Inprise, based in Scotts Valley, Calif., closed at $11.5625.
When it was known as Borland, the company once traded in the
mid-'80s.
</P>
<P>
   Linux is the popular free variant of the Unix operating system
developed by the Finnish programmer Linus Torvalds. Widely praised
as a lower-cost and more reliable alternative to Microsoft's
Windows NT, Linux has made surprising gains in the market for the
powerful computers that are used as network servers. It has been
particularly successful among owners of Web servers based on the
Intel Corp.'s Pentium chips. And although it is available free, a
couple of dozen companies have sprung up to sell enhanced versions
of Linux packaged with other software and services.
</P>
<P>
   But Corel Linux differs from the products offered by companies
like Red Hat or VA Linux Systems in that Corel's Linux is aimed not
at servers but at desktop computers, a market in which Microsoft
holds a monopoly with Windows 95 and 98.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Corel recommends that users who need an operating system
for their network servers install Red Hat's product, though a
server version of Corel Linux is in the works. Corel has also
released a Linux version of its WordPerfect word processor, and it
is promising a suite of desktop Linux applications by April.
</P>
<P>
   This is a market that is wide open. The only existing
productivity suite for Linux is Star Office, a set of applications
distributed free by Sun Microsystems that has not gained wide
corporate acceptance. Sun has not indicated a timetable for
releasing improved versions of the suite.
</P>
<P>
   And at least for the foreseeable future, Microsoft is not
expected to develop a Linux version of its industry-leading Office
suite, because that could help legitimize Linux and discourage
wider adoption of Windows 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The logic behind Corel's acquiring Inprise is straightforward.
Inprise gives Corel a full range of software products, including
programming languages and software development tools, an operating
system and desktop applications. The only other company that can
claim all three categories is Microsoft, and though the combined
1999 sales of Corel and Inprise, $418 million, are dwarfed by
Microsoft, the combination of Corel and Inprise is larger than any
Linux company.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Inprise/Borland's leadership in the software development
community and Corel's Linux desktop operating system and
productivity applications, we have an extraordinary opportunity to
reach all facets of the exploding Linux market,'' said Michael C.
Cowpland, Corel's president. ``This merger enables us to offer
end-to-end product solutions and global support to all of our
shared customers.''
</P>
<P>
   But analysts question the size of the opportunity. Linux has had
phenomenal growth, but from a tiny base, and total 1999 Linux sales
for all companies came to just $63 million, a tiny fraction of
total operating system sales, according to the International Data
Corp. Virtually all of that was at the server level, and it is not
clear whether there is anycompelling reason to run Linux on the
desktop. No major manufacturer offers Intel-based desktop machines
without Windows already installed, and the purported advantages of
Linux, like freedom from crashes, are less critical on desktops.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not exactly an immense market for Linux desktop
applications,'' said Jeffrey Tarter, editor of Softletter, an
industry newsletter. ``No. 2 has to find places where No. 1 is
vulnerable, and certainly Microsoft is never going to develop
credible applications for Linux. This is a place where Corel can go
and not have competition from Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Whatever size that market is, I'm sure Corel is
going to get most of it. The interesting question is whether Corel
can make any money on these fringe markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Another issue is whether Corel can maintain credibility among
proponents of ``open source,'' the development strategy by which
the source code of a program is made freely available to the
public, enabling any programmer to offer enhancements or fixes.
Linux was developed under this philosophy by unpaid programmers
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Corel antagonized open source proponents last year when it
required the signing of nondisclosure agreements to view the beta
versions of Corel Linux. Corel said it did not want unfinished code
to hurt its reputation or to be copied and distributed by others,
and it later amended the text of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But Corel cannot really afford to commit fully to the open
source philosophy, because almost all its current revenue derives
from the products it makes for Windows users.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the business, almost in its entirety, comes from
Windows,'' said Maureen O'Gara, editor of Client/Server News, a
trade publication. ``They've got to keep the Windows people calm
while they go off and build this new empire.''
</P>
<P>
   And she said that although Corel is dwarfed by Microsoft, it has
also been ``a bit of a comeback kid'' in the Windows world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't all that long ago it was trading at a dollar,'' she
said.

 PERFECTING THE DOUBLE-DUTCH MACHINE  
 GREETING CARDS FOR HEALTH  
 NO MORE SOGGY BAGELS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: Photo NYT5 of Tahira Reid is being sent to NYT photo
clients. Nonsubscribers can make individual purchase by calling
888-603-1036 or 888-346-9867.) 
(mk) 
 By TERESA RIORDAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1985, when Tahira Reid was in third grade at Public School 97
in the Bronx, she dreamed up an invention that would allow her to
double-dutch jump-rope even when she couldn't find two friends to
swing twin ropes in egg-beater fashion for her. Her poster drawing
of the hypothetical double-dutch machine won her a first prize in a
schoolwide competition.
</P>
<P>
   Reid went on to jump for a professional double-dutch team in
junior high, whirring in and out of the speedy ropes while she
danced hip-hop and performed gymnastics. But she didn't much think
about her double-dutch machine again until she was a sophomore at
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y., and enrolled in an
introductory engineering design class whose theme was ``Challenging
the Limits in Sports and Recreational Activities.''
</P>
<P>
   There, with the help of classmates, she began working up a more
sophisticated version of her third-grade idea. Two and a half years
later, Reid, who is now a senior at RPI, has received a patent for
the device.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, I just figured, hey, it would be a cool
project,'' Reid says. ``I didn't foresee a patent or anything.''
When Reid came up with her idea, recalls Burt Swersey, who teaches
a course in invention at RPI, ``I said, `Wow, this is a great idea.
There's a market for it but nobody's making it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Reid is not the first to envision a double-dutch machine. A
handful of inventors have already patented different permutations
of the idea. But, according to Swersey, none of them is practical.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we teach here is that a lot of people have great ideas,
but you have to reduce them to practice,'' he said. Reid and a
group of students working on a second prototype hope eventually to
produce a double-dutch machine that can serve as a training device
for jumpers who want to hone their skills as well as for kids who
just want to have fun. Reid's fellow students currently on the
project are Kevin Haynes, Maneesh Shrivastav, Kwasi Frye and
Colleen Conlon.
</P>
<P>
   The machine consists of two drive systems that sit 10 to 15 feet
apart and about 30 inches off the ground. Each drive system has its
own motor, which, through the help of a set of pulleys, turns two
arms that grasp two different ropes.
</P>
<P>
   Two of these pulleys are connected with a belt configured in a
criss-cross manner. This criss-cross causes the ropes to turn in
the contrapuntal fashion that simulates the double-dutch pattern
that jump-roping children love.
</P>
<P>
   The double-dutch machine has already gotten some national
recognition. Two years ago Reid's team received a National
Collegiate Inventors and Innovators Alliance grant for $10,000 to
cover patent and prototype costs. And the device was part of an
alliance exhibit at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum
of American History.
</P>
<P>
   Swersey acknowledged that Reid was still refining the invention.
``This double dutch is a good idea but the way it stands now it's
not quite right,'' he said. ``Tahira and her teammates are working
to come up with design features that will really make it low cost
and practical for people.''
</P>
<P>
   Patent 5,961,425 was assigned to Reid and to Andrew Burdick, an
aeronautical engineering student at RPI who worked on the original
prototype.
</P>
<P>
   Be My Valentine, and Get a Cancer Test
</P>
<P>
   There are as many ways to woo as there are varieties of candy in
a 2-pound Whitman's Sampler. Some suitors demonstrate their love
with flowers, others with perfume. But a Valentine's Day card that
features a colon-cancer screening kit?
</P>
<P>
   ``Colon cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer,'' said Dr.
March Seabrook, a gastroenterologist in West Columbia, S.C., who
has patented such a card. ``Unfortunately, we don't do a good job
screening for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Seabrook's card includes an at-home version of what is called a
``fecal occult blood test.'' The recipient smears a tiny stool
sample onto different testing strips and then mails the samples to
a laboratory, which tests for blood in the stool _ a sign of
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   So far Seabrook produces only the birthday version, through his
company, Health Cards. But his patent says the cancer-screening
card can be tailored to any occasion: birthdays, Christmas, Yom
Kippur, Father's Day, Mother's Day and, of course, Valentine's Day.
</P>
<P>
   Seabrook received patent 5,954,369.
</P>
<P>
   Hot Coffee to Go, But Hold the Leaks
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers of all stripes are bound together by a single common
experience, according to Brett Stern, an industrial designer in
Manhattan. And that is? Leaking coffee cups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every morning I go out for a cup of coffee and a bagel,''
Stern said. ``By the time I get to my office, the coffee has leaked
out of the top of the container, soaked the napkins and made the
bagel all soggy.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern's solution is a dime-sized piece of hydrophobic material
that sticks on top of the coffee-lid vent hole. ``You need the vent
hole there to allow steam to escape,'' Stern said. ``Otherwise the
lid would pop off.''
</P>
<P>
   The material allows air molecules to escape but is impervious to
liquid molecules.
</P>
<P>
   Stern, who is looking to license his invention, received patent
5,988,426.
</P>
<P>
   Patents may be viewed on the Web at www.uspto.gov or may be
ordered through the mail, by patent number, for $3 from the Patent
and Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231.

NEW AT&AMP;T SYSTEM DISPLAYS A `MILLIONAIRE' BONUS  
 THE DOCTOR IS NOW ONLINE AND TAKING REFERRALS

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There sure are a lot of people who want to be a millionaire
these days.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday in Bedminster, N.J., AT&AMP;T held a grand opening for
its new $90 million network operations center _ mission control for
one of the world's most complex communications webs.
</P>
<P>
   Outsiders, or at least members of the media, are rarely invited
to peek behind AT&AMP;T's veil. So dozens of reporters showed up to ooh
and aah at the cavernous hall's complex-looking computer displays.
</P>
<P>
   But the most striking aspect of the event was only tangentially
related to AT&AMP;T _ although it was yet another testament to the
dominant television program at the moment, ABC's ``Who Wants to be
a Millionaire?''
</P>
<P>
   On a wall screen, a computer displayed the number of current
business calls, compared with a chart for the previous Thursday,
Feb. 3.
</P>
<P>
   The older chart showed a typical pattern, with a high volume of
calls during the day trailing off steeply into the evening. But the
graph showed a spectacular spike at 10 p.m., at the TV program's
conclusion, representing hundreds of thousands of calls to the
toll-free line for would-be contestants _ and untold revenue for
``our friends at AT&AMP;T,'' as the show's host, Regis Philbin, would
put it.
</P>
<P>
   _ SETH SCHIESEL
</P>
<P>
   The Doctor Is Now Online, and He's Taking Referrals
</P>
<P>
   Forget toasters and airline miles _ and privacy, for that
matter. In what could be a first in Internet marketing, a new Web
site devoted to discussing sex and relationships is giving away
condoms to anyone who registers, and yet more condoms for referring
friends to the site.
</P>
<P>
   The promotion is all part of the rollout of drDrew.com, an
online spinoff of the popular nighttime TV talk show and radio
program ``Loveline,'' starring Dr. Drew Pinsky, a 41-year-old
physician.
</P>
<P>
   Like the broadcast programs, the site is aimed at teen-agers and
young adults who are trying to sort out the issues of sex,
relationships and dating.
</P>
<P>
   Some people might be reluctant, of course, to give their own
names and e-mail addresses to a company distributing condoms. And
many other people might not want friends and colleagues to give out
theirs, either. But in fact, friends-and-family referrals are a
goal of the promotion; each referral that results in a registration
will yield another condom for the person who passed along the name
and address.
</P>
<P>
   Heidi Sinclair, vice president of marketing for drDrew.com, said
the company was simply trying to promote safe sex, as well as
attract attention to the site.
</P>
<P>
   Although the registration form for the condoms asks for the
person's name, address, e-mail address, gender and age, the company
said it would use the street addresses only for mailing the condoms
and would not add those addresses to its database. Registered
members will receive drDrew.com's online newsletter and periodic
e-mails about future events.
</P>
<P>
   Members of drDrew.com can get advice on sex and sexual health
from Dr. Pinsky, as well as chat with other members, attend online
forums with celebrities and read features like ``Get a Life, Then
Get a Man'' or a how-to on preparing aphrodisiacs.
</P>
<P>
   Through the promotion, the Los Angeles-based company will send
out a three-pack of condoms, labeled with drDrew.com's logo, to
anybody who registers for the site or who has already registered.
The site's promoters plan to give away a million condoms through
the site, as well as on college campuses and at bars and nightclubs
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   But be forewarned: One must be at least 16 years old to receive
the condoms; anyone younger than 16 who registers for the site will
receive drDrew.com stickers instead.

ONLINE SELLERS OF GIFT CERTIFICATES RELY ON BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS
SALES
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many e-commerce rookies approached this post-Christmas season
with a fair measure of apprehension, given the dearth of remaining
advertising money and nagging questions about how many of their
customers would return after all the gifts had been bought.
</P>
<P>
   Few had as much to worry about, however, as those companies
whose core function was selling gift certificates online. With so
much of the business dependent on holiday shoppers, and with so
many companies crowding into this niche, even executives of the
most well-known sites felt uptight about what the new year would
bring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely something we were concerned about,'' said
Robert Levitan, chief executive of Flooz.com, a site that enables
users to buy and send an online scrip _ essentially the equivalent
of gift certificates _ that can be redeemed at various stores on
its site. ``Would we have a big drop? Would our business be too
cyclical?''
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly enough, Flooz and its cadre of competitors _
including GiftCertificates.com, Giftpoint.com and
800GiftCertificate.com, among others _ need not have lost sleep. So
far this year, most of these sites report that weekly revenues are
actually increasing, despite the fact that post-holiday sales to
consumers have leveled off.
</P>
<P>
   Sound like a contradiction? As it turns out, the online
gift-certificate business is benefiting from, of all things, the
nation's labor shortage. As companies struggle to attract and
retain workers, many are turning to corporate gift programs _ and
online gift certificates, they say, are a cheap easy and way to
bestow employee perquisites.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Cohen's Fashion Optical, a regional chain of
eyewear stores, rolled out a program six months ago with
800GiftCertificate.com. When they meet certain sales goals, the
company's 300 employees receive points they can redeem for gift
certificates, according to Robert Cohen, the company's chief
executive. ``Employees use them to buy books, dinners _ they're all
over the place with them,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   For management, one of the primary benefits of such a program is
that workers can log onto a page on the 800GiftCertificate site to
track points earned toward their awards. The service, Cohen said,
saves ``tons of paperwork'' and eliminates a multitude of phone
calls to the human resources manager by employees checking on their
incentive status.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Dermer, chief executive of 800GiftCertificate.com, said
that roughly 70 percent of the company's sales were to
corporations, not consumers. As a result, he said, the site is
buffered from the major seasonal swings that might otherwise beset
the gift business.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the fourth quarter, much of the corporate giving that
happens is about cash bonuses,'' Dermer said. As a result, the
company's corporate sales softened even as the consumer sales
jumped, resulting in less of an overall spike in holiday sales than
other types of e-commerce sites may have experienced.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Nielsen, chief executive of Giftpoint.com, said the whole
point of the company's business-to-business initiative was that it
would provide sales stability. ``We're clearly hoping Christmas
2000 will be gigantic _ and I can't believe I'm talking about
Christmas 2000 _ but the business-to-business program will level
things off'' between now and then, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Giftpoint.com offers buyers the choice of receiving gift
certificates through the mail or e-mail, many companies choose the
e-mail option ``because they want them to be more Internet savvy,''
Nielsen. ``In general, more of the business-to-business market is
moving to the online gift certificates.''
</P>
<P>
   Levitan, whose Flooz.com site has also experienced increasing
revenues in the post-holiday weeks, said corporate sales during
that time had exceeded 50 percent of the total. American Greetings,
he said, purchased 300,000 Flooz certificates for a corporate gift
program, while Starbucks also bought a large block of certificates
for its salespeople.
</P>
<P>
   Flooz.com typically makes a 5 percent commission on every sale
made through the site. Recently, however, Levitan said he had been
able to increase his take by negotiating a ``customer acquisition
fee'' from some retailers in lieu of a commission.
</P>
<P>
   Levitan would not disclose fees paid by specific retailers. But
he offered a hypothetical example. ``Instead of making $2.50 on a
purchase of $50, a store might pay, say, $20 for that customer,''
he said. ``You've got a 40 percent margin all of a sudden.''
</P>
<P>
   The company earns that acquisition fee regardless of how many,
or how few, times the customers return to the retailer through
Flooz. But that may change, Levitan said, as retailers seek to
fine-tune the fee structure.
</P>
<P>
   Levitan says Flooz can extract such fees, in part, because it
offers retailers near exclusivity within a particular category. For
instance, Flooz added Toys ``R'' Us.com, the Internet arm of Toys
``R'' Us Inc., to its store last week, he said, ``but we won't have
EToys.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People might say that with time, customer acquisition costs
will go down, but it's actually getting harder to find customers,''
Levitan said. ``And I don't see that changing anytime soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Such revenue-boosting strategies may become more important in
the coming months, analysts said, as more online gift companies and
gift certificate sites look to the so-called B-to-B _ or,
business-to-business _ sector for sales. If the economy continues
to steam ahead and the labor shortage drags on, a glut of
gift-giving companies is all but a sure thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's approaching the B-to-B market now,'' said Ken
Cassar, an analyst with Jupiter Communications. ``Rather than
spending huge amounts of money on branding efforts to appeal to the
consumer market, they can spend that money on sales forces to court
corporate America. But because everyone's pursuing that strategy,
they're going to find their sales forces tripping over each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   And they will also be tripping on the feet of companies outside
their category. Businesses like 1800Flowers.com and Proflowers.com
are moving more aggressively into the corporate gift market, as are
gift sites like Camdens.com and RedEnvelope.com. These businesses
can provide corporations a range of gifts for their customers to
select online, analysts said, just as the gift certificate
companies do.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the gift certificate companies are not being ignored
by consumers simply because the December holidays have passed.
``There's a lot of background noise gift giving that goes on all
year,'' said Jonas Lee, chief executive of GiftCertificates.com.
``Sales are still pumping. We're seeing a lot of birthdays, thank
you's, that kind of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Those types of gift-giving events are precisely the reason why
the chocolatier Godiva, a unit of the Campbell Soup Co., turned to
online gift certificates, and Flooz in particular, late last year.
Archie van Beuren, Godiva's chief executive, said: ``People tend to
think of Godiva around now, and around the holidays maybe. This
gives us a way to stay top-of-mind for other gift-giving times when
maybe they might not otherwise think of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Godiva had seen an increase in gift certificate
sales for Valentine's Day, van Beuren said ``sales are continuing
to build, but it's hard to tell if it's seasonal.''
</P>
<P>
   Dermer, of 800GiftCertificate.com, played down Valentine's Day
as a big holiday for his industry. There is a decided lack of
romance to receiving online scrip. ``At the end of the day, you're
still giving someone a code,'' he said, although he noted that his
company did offer an electronic gift certificate intended for
Valentines Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might work for moms and sons, maybe women buying for
husbands _ but definitely not for men to give to women,'' Dermer
said. ``I'm sure someone will try it, though, and get themselves in
a lot of trouble.''

`SENSATION,' GONE BUT STILL PROVOCATIVE
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ ``Sensation'' may have closed last month, but the
reverberations linger.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition of cutting-edge British art owned by the
collector Charles Saatchi, ``Sensation'' was meant to increase the
audience at the Brooklyn Museum of Art and ended up getting the
museum into a court battle with Mayor Rudolph Giuliani over city
financing. Now it has had a new life in a different context: Nearly
400 academics, arts administrators, students and others convened
here on Saturday to examine the relationship between the arts and
society in the wake of the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole controversy has been high entertainment and good
instruction,'' said W.T.J. Mitchell, an art historian at the
University of Chicago, whose fledgling cultural policy program
organized the one-day conference in the ornate maroon-and-gold
ballroom of the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. ``One thing
I liked about the show is that it burst open the relationship
between art and commerce. We even got to read e-mails. The role of
big capital in the art world was made visible.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more was revealed at the conference. Gilbert S. Edelson,
administrative vice president of the Art Dealers Association of
America, surprised many participants with the statement that some
museums take a commission on sales of new art exhibited on their
walls, just as dealers do.
</P>
<P>
   James Cuno, the director of the Harvard University Art Museums,
said he was shocked and called the practice inappropriate. Edelson
declined to name names, but when asked, Thelma Golden, who was a
curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art for 10 years, said
that the Whitney did it. ``It was in the loan agreement,'' said
Golden, who is now the deputy director for exhibitions and programs
at the Studio Museum in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   Edelson also cited other museum practices that muddied the
distinctions between museums and dealers. Some, including the
Metropolitan Museum of Art, sell original prints, crafts and other
unique works of art.
</P>
<P>
   At least one, he said, sells original prints on consignment from
dealers. And several regional museums, like the Nevada Museum of
Art, hold special exhibitions and sales of works by artists in
their communities, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pleased to welcome many museums to the ranks of art
dealers,'' Edelson said to laughter. ``We await their application
to join the Art Dealers Association of America.''
</P>
<P>
   This being academia, there were few conclusions at the end of
eight hours of sometimes humorous debate, discussion that included
the modest suggestion from Mitchell, who is also the editor of
Critical Inquiry, for a blockbuster show of ``offending images''
where those offended could hurl stones, eggs, paint and dirt as
therapy.
</P>
<P>
   The most sobering comments came from David Strauss, a University
of Chicago law professor. Although the courts ruled that Giuliani's
threat to withdraw financing from the museum for showing art he
thought was offensive was unconstitutional, Strauss warned against
relying on the ``false promise'' of the First Amendment for
protection against such attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message of the controversy to government officials is to
be careful about getting into this business of arts funding,
because once you get in you may not be able to get out,'' he said.
``The more often there are First Amendment decisions in court, the
more powerfully the message goes out to legislators to be careful.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a battle that can be won in court,'' Strauss
added. ``People who think that there is an important role for the
government to play in funding the arts have to win in the court of
public opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani declined an invitation to participate in the
conference.
</P>
<P>
   So did Arnold L. Lehman, the director of the Brooklyn Museum,
who is under fire for allowing Saatchi to take control of the
exhibition and for seeking financing from Saatchi, Christie's and
others with a commercial interest in the art. In a letter to the
organizers, with a copy to the museum's lawyer, Lehman objected to
the conference title, ``Taking Funds, Giving Offense, Making
Money,'' as inflammatory and judgmental.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll Joynes, the executive director of the university's
cultural policy program, said Lehman had asked that the title be
changed, without success. ``In part it was meant to be
inflammatory,'' Joynes said. ``It was meant to start a debate.''
</P>
<P>
   The title, he added, was hardly provocative when viewed in the
context of the advertisements Lehman had chosen for ``Sensation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The bag I got with the catalog had words like vomit, shock and
confusion, Joynes said.
</P>
<P>
   But Lehman was not on trial here, and neither was Giuliani. Both
took some criticism, and both had support (less for the mayor). The
program focused far more on issues of public and private financing
for museums and the impact on public trust, topics that Richard
Epstein, the University of Chicago law professor who helped set the
scene, called ``art and the grubby engines that are necessary to
drive it.''
</P>
<P>
   The participants' wishful thinking aside, hardly any of them
foresaw an increase in government money for the arts. That left the
discussion centering on private financing, usually from people like
Saatchi who have an interest in the art. Though museums have long
pursued collectors, they rarely discuss details like potential
conflicts of interest, and there are no written rules that museums
must follow. As a result, whether to show a collection and what
arrangements should surround it are decisions usually made on a
case by case basis; the consensus here held that was rightly so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether a museum should exhibit a private collection depends
on whether the collection is important enough to merit a museum
show,'' Edelson said. This time Cuno agreed with him and asked,
``What kind of collector is Saatchi?'' Cuno went on to characterize
Saatchi as someone who bought large quantities of art, showed it in
his own galleries, sold some of it (including works by artists in
``Sensation'' after its showing in London) and announced his
intention to open restaurants called Sensation that would exhibit
his artworks (which has not happened).
</P>
<P>
   ``Showing private collections and taking support from private
collectors, indeed even from commercial concerns like auction
houses and art galleries, are not in themselves opposed to the
public mission of a museum,'' Cuno said. ``It all depends on the
character and reputation of the collector.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, he and Edelson agreed, Paul Mellon, yes;
Saatchi, probably not.
</P>
<P>
   Saatchi and Lehman had a defender or two, notably Mitchell, who
suggested that it was late in the game to be outraged when museums
pander to the rich to survive. But many more conference
participants thought that the Brooklyn Museum violated the public
trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``The appearance of impropriety is absolutely crucial,'' Cuno
argued. ``Once one loses respect, it takes a long time to
recover.''
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that although Lehman, with ``Sensation,'' had set
out to expand his audience to those who felt no connection to the
museum, he ended up reinforcing the appearance that the museum is a
bastion of the elite united in the collusion of self-interest.

`THE DANISH GIRL': RADICAL CHANGE AND ENDURING LOVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(mk) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The historical fact is that in 1931 a Danish painter named Einar
Wegener became the first man ever to be transformed surgically into
a woman, changing her name to Lili Elbe and eventually leaking her
story to the press. In ``The Danish Girl'' David Ebershoff uses the
bare facts of Wegener-Elbe's story to summon a rich imagined
universe in which the main event is less the sexual transformation
itself than the way that transformation affected other people.
</P>
<P>
   This is Ebershoff's first novel, and it is a promising one.
``The Danish Girl,'' as Ebershoff tells us in a helpful afterword,
does not try to tell a true story. He has not only imagined most of
what he writes about Wegener's inner life, but he has also
fabricated all of the other characters in the book, most important
among them Wegener's blue-blooded American-born wife, Greta Waud,
who like Ebershoff comes from Pasadena, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Still, his novel, which takes place in Copenhagen, Paris and
Dresden (where the historical Wegener underwent his surgery), is
told with such psychological delicacy that one has the sense things
must actually have transpired the way Ebershoff presents them. His
writing is of a highly refined kind; his story is marvelously
furnished with period details, from the smell of the Danish cheese
that drifted from next door into a Copenhagen art gallery to the
look of the Elbe River in the early Dresden spring. Most important,
Ebershoff has written an unusual and affecting love story centering
on a confrontation with the mystery of the other.
</P>
<P>
   What makes his imaginative elaboration of a real historical case
especially compelling is his portrayal of Greta, who is a
wonderfully successful character, more so in many ways than Einar.
As the story begins, Greta and Einar are in their Copenhagen home
painting when Greta asks her husband to do her a favor. Will he
model a pair of shoes and a dress that she is using in a portrait
of Anna Fonsmark, a Danish opera singer who has failed to arrive
for a sitting?
</P>
<P>
   Einar puts on the dress, feeling its silky texture, and then:
``A strange watery feeling was filling Einar as he stood on the
lacquer trunk, the sunlight moving across him, the scent of herring
in the air...Einar was beginning to enter a shadowy world of dreams
where Anna's dress could belong to anyone, even to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly Einar's reverie is interrupted by the appearance of
Anna herself, who along with Greta jokes about his appearance.
``Greta said, her voice soft and careful and unfamiliar, `Why don't
we call you Lili?'''
</P>
<P>
   From that point, though the central event of the book is Einar's
inexorable transformation into Lili, Ebershoff's story belongs to
Greta and the quietly determined struggle she wages to allow her
love to triumph over her needs. Ebershoff sketches in a rebellious
and privileged life for Greta: her escape from the rigorously
conventional environs of Pasadena (where a first marriage ended
tragically) to the life of a Copenhagen portrait painter.
</P>
<P>
   She is the kind of woman who, as Ebershoff writes, could ``cross
her mother and debate her father and snub all of Pasadena and
Copenhagen alike, but in her chest was a bottomless well of
tolerance for the man she loved.'' She could say to herself that
she had no interest in dining with her husband, who was dressed up
as a girl, but she ``would keep such a thought to herself, biting
her lip until she could taste her own blood.''
</P>
<P>
   While Greta emerges with complexity and fullness, Ebershoff
doesn't manage quite as well with Einar and Lili, who are treated
all along as two separate people, as if in deference to Einar's own
preference in the matter. Lili's belief that she possesses an
individual will separate from Einar's and her early experiences of
sexual awareness are presented with a wonderful, believable
intimacy. The game that Einar plays, that he and Lili are not the
same person but live lives entirely apart from each other, is also
an element of stubborn reality that makes up a part of the
challenge to Greta's love and understanding.
</P>
<P>
   But this game strangely limits Einar as a character, making him
into something so automatic and unreflective as to strain
psychological credibility. Similarly, in Ebershoff's handling of
it, Lili's experience takes place in such a circumscribed world
that it presents almost no practical complications for Greta.
</P>
<P>
   One could argue that Ebershoff wanted to avoid any of the cheap
situation-comedy possibilities that Einar-Lili would present. But
in doing so, he skips over events _ like Einar-Lili's meeting in
Paris with a childhood friend with whom he once had a tormented
homoerotic relationship _ that would have caused more turbulence
than they do in the sometimes unconvincingly subtle world of ``The
Danish Girl.''
</P>
<P>
   But these are small questions about a book whose core, the
patient and enduring love that Greta forges for her husband and
that her husband fails to understand, is complex and deep. There is
a moment near the end of the novel when Lili, her transformation
nearly complete, says something that for the first time brings
Greta face to face with the fullness of her loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``You and me, we were married,'' Greta says quietly, ``and we
lived in that small dark space between two people where a marriage
exists.'' That statement is a kind of mourning, a valediction, and
it is also a poignant evocation of the human condition. Ebershoff
is telling us that love does involve a small dark space. The
intelligence and tactfulness of his exploration of it make his
novel a noteworthy event.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Not long ago I came upon a copy of the first and only story I
ever published. It did not appear to be absolutely dreadful, but
then I read only the first page. I have not written a story since.
The novel became my game.
</P>
<P>
   When I wrote that story, I was not unserious about becoming a
writer, though I hadn't a notion of what, over the years, that
might entail. Looking back, I cannot disown that shallow girl who
presumed she had an entry into a phantom world of letters. Now I
might ask her: What were you getting yourself into?
</P>
<P>
   Writing fiction is not about first love, that blush of self-love
when you discover your name in print. It's about passion and
endurance, a combination of desire and grunt work often at odds
with each other. More like a long marriage? Yes, the rekindling of
the love of writing and a commitment to the solitary hours finding
the word, tone, style _ and may I mention the meaning? _ why you
are telling this story that will become a book with its pages.
</P>
<P>
   This vocation, let's not call it a profession, has come to be
about witnessing my time, personal and public time that are joined
at the breast, inextricable. My education began in the Silent '50s,
a misnomer like so many tags pinned on an era. We had our say,
somewhat too politely, when Sen. McCarthy came to deliver his
incoherent ramblings at my women's college.
</P>
<P>
   Modernism was in high regard in the classroom. With reverence I
read Virginia Woolf, memorized long passages of Eliot's ``Waste
Land,'' thrilled to the order of Pound's ``make it new'' and the
bold grammar of Gertrude Stein while writing wry undergraduate
stories in imitation of sophisticated New Yorker fare.
</P>
<P>
   And in those years, the not-so-dowdy '50s, great American
writers _ Melville, Hawthorne, Poe and Emily Dickinson _ were taken
out of their glass bookcases, read with fresh attention by a new
breed of scholars, many of them paying off their debt to the GI
Bill.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the '50s were a feast for an earnest student who believed
literature should be awarded its capital L. Of course the
modernist's manifestoes and the works that I held dear were radical
more than 40 years earlier, if we go by Woolf's famous
pronouncement ``On or about December 1910 human character
changed.''
</P>
<P>
   The battle against the poetic eloquence of Victorian
versification and the soothing moral views of the Edwardian novel
was long over, yet the aims of modernism declared before World War
I were congenial to the years that followed World War II. Man's
dislocation in an uncaring urban landscape dovetailed nicely enough
with the loss of self we read in Eisenhower's prophecy of a
``military-industrial complex.''
</P>
<P>
   The reward of looking back must be the ability to move on,
otherwise I must count myself a period piece, like the ancient
beauty I see on my block with the pompadour, bright lipstick and
ankle bracelet of her day.
</P>
<P>
   And moving on I understood that the venerated works of my modern
masters and mistresses were not the only act in town. There
followed, in panoramic succession, the irreverent canticles of the
'60s, the liberating discovery of suppressed women's voices, the
playtime of postmodernism with its fair field (or cage) of irony,
the subdued mumble of minimalism and the literature of inclusion,
let us hope here for the long run.
</P>
<P>
   In this swift take on my 40 _ can that be right? _ 40 years of
writing, I see myself as stationary yet moving. It's rather like
standing on one of those conveyor belts in an airport. Eventually
the track deposits the traveler, and only I can know my
destination: the silent workroom of the solo flight in which the
dangerous adventure is to discover the center, the still point of a
novel that must be of my time yet not be swept along by fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Failure is written into the script. Like Ginger and Fred in the
pratfalls of their ice-skating routine, you pick yourself up, brush
yourself off and start all over again.
</P>
<P>
   I believe that's how I would tell it straight to that
star-struck girl who spent her last dollar on train fare to New
Haven, Conn., to hear Eliot's somber recitation of ``The Dry
Salvages.'' Or it may have been Robert Frost, whose readings were
somber, too.
</P>
<P>
   But in a collection of Eliot's essays I find a letter from
someone named Gerald telling me to take the 11:15 train from
Northampton, Mass., to arrive on time at Dwight Chapel. I borrowed
the money to return to college, perhaps from Gerald, but he is lost
to history.
</P>
<P>
   I admit to inventing female characters driven to lecture the
young on the past, on history if you will, both public and private.
Lecturing themselves, I'd say, in hopes that examining the time
they have lived through may tell them where they are, perhaps even
who they are. I'm instructing myself, for after all, I am my first
and most unforgiving audience.
</P>
<P>
   When did I first understand that handing the pages over to be
printed and bound, to be read by an audience beyond the workroom,
was an act of exposure? Oh, not in the manner of a pulpy tell-all
memoir, but in the flagrant display of myself in the rhythm of a
sentence, the shape of a paragraph, the coincidental turn of plot;
in the very subject of the decline of gritty cities and fractured
love chosen for a work of fiction.
</P>
<P>
   For all the voices and masks of my performance, there is an
intimacy with the reader. We are in this game together. Reading,
real reading, is a strenuous and pleasurable contact sport. Fun,
but it's not television. In ``Art Objects'' Jeannette Winterson
calls reading sexy. I'll go along with that smart idea. Reading, I
might say to my students, is not like dating; it's a matter of full
engagement.
</P>
<P>
   Moving on in time: What if, as a very bright student proposed
last semester, what if you don't feel entitled to what were once
considered serious, even heroic themes? What if you are fidgety,
embarrassed, speaking of commitment, never mind art? What if, in
the presence of mass media and vast systems, words fail?
</P>
<P>
   Then write to the market; there's nothing wrong with that.
Forget the poor marginalized literary novel with its shameless
dedication. But remember, even ``Seinfeld'' with so much ready wit
and amusing disenchantment has closed up shop.
</P>
<P>
   Look to the wonders and terrors that await us as the book faces
up to technology. The scribes went under with the invention of
movable type, but respect for language did not pass away. I now
look to the cursor's beat as well as the legal pad begging me for
the next sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Words: That's all I've got aside from a dollop of imagination,
but only think what it will be for you who come after. Technology
will elicit new forms, and you may be much like an itinerant
storyteller of old on the Internet, or whatever they will call it.
You may drop in to spin your yarn by any man's fire.
</P>
<P>
   I may not be around to scold you, if you do not take care with
words. In ``Modern Fiction'' Woolf imagined that if the art of
fiction came alive, ``she would undoubtedly bid us break her and
bully her, as well as honor and love her, for so her youth is
renewed and her sovereignty assured.'' There I go again, back to an
idol of my schoolgirl '50s, to her essay of 1919.

   As for me, I am writing about Audubon, the first time I have
attempted a historical tale. He killed all those birds for the love
of nature and science. Or for his art, I believe.
</P>
<P>
   But one day he winged a red cockaded woodpecker and brought it
live into his workroom. The bird went about its business pecking at
the walls, while the artist drew its black plumage ringed with
white stripes, its sharp bill and blue talons, the red feather in
its cap.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Birds of America'' three of these woodpeckers are
perched on a pine branch, a bit of invention to portray his
specimen in full dimension. In this way the naturalist's aims seem
much like the task of a writer of fiction, to record the truth
enhanced by fancy.
</P>
<P>
   I am writing in this time when dimension is virtual, an easy yet
marvelous manipulation of reality. But let me tell you the best
part of the Audubon story: When he was finished with his work, he
opened the window and let his subject go free.

INDONESIA'S PRESIDENT RETREATS ON RESIGNATION ORDER TO ACCUSED
GENERAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By SETH MYDANS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ President Abdurrahman Wahid changed tack
Sunday and told his defiant security minister _ Indonesia's most
prominent general _ that he could keep his job while he is
investigated for human-rights abuses in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked him to resign but he said he preferred to be
investigated by a legal process, and I said, `OK,''' Wahid said
after a two-hour meeting with his security minister, General
Wiranto. ``We have to give him a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first direct demand by the president, who returned
Sunday from a two-week tour abroad during which he had prodded
Wiranto almost daily to step down. And it was the first direct
refusal by the general.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid's acceptance of the refusal was seen here as a retreat,
although there may be other steps yet to come in what may be an
elaborate and face-saving game plan.
</P>
<P>
   Many Indonesians remained confused by their garrulous president,
and some analysts said he may have devalued the power of his word
by failing to demand obedience.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, it was notable that during two weeks of
sparring, Wiranto failed to garner strong support from within the
military, with several prominent commanders asserting their
allegiance to civilian control.
</P>
<P>
   While the president may have appeared weak or vacillating in
terms of his personal command, he did emphasize the supremacy of
law Sunday, placing the general's fate in the hands of the attorney
general.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would allow Wiranto to wait until the attorney
general decides whether he should stand trial for the violence and
destruction that followed a vote last August in East Timor for
independence from Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the right to change my ministers,'' the president said.
``But we have to abide by the law. If the results of the report
implicate him, then he must resign, as I have already said
before.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, what he has said is that he wanted the general to
resign immediately, even before any results or preliminary findings
are made. But he has declined to exercise his right to fire his
ministers.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Marzuki Darusman said Sunday that he would
immediately form a team to investigate accusations contained in a
report by a special government commission that named Wiranto as
``morally responsible'' for the horror in East Timor because he was
commander of the armed forces at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid began demanding Wiranto's resignation as soon as the
report was issued. The general had already been weakened two days
earlier when the president ordered his removal from the military
because he is a serving cabinet minister.
</P>
<P>
   The president's confusing style seems to have the effect of
pummeling his targets in his chosen direction with a mixture of
verbal rabbit punches, jokes and expressions of personal regard. He
is a difficult man to understand or to grapple with.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no problem,'' he said Sunday. ``Wiranto and I are
good friends. It is the media that perceives us to be enemies.''
</P>
<P>
   But the president must be held responsible for the perceptions
of the media, said Dewi Fortuna Anwar, a political analyst who was
a top aide to former president B.J. Habibie.
</P>
<P>
   The past two weeks had created unnecessarily a sense of
nervousness and uncertainty, including a surge of coup rumors to
which Wahid had himself contributed directly, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both are the losers here,'' she said of the president and the
general. ``And it was quite unnecessary. And it could all have been
done in a more dignified way.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the president had stated that one reason he
wanted the general to resign was to strengthen confidence among
foreign investors and financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   But the effect, in the short term at least, may have been the
opposite. Jakarta's stock exchange and the value of its currency
have slipped during the past two weeks and some analysts said they
expected further slippage in the coming week following Sunday's
seeming retreat by Wahid.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his seemingly impulsive verbal fits and starts, however,
there is a consistent direction to the president's policies, toward
democracy, openness, tolerance and the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   By refusing to rule by fiat, Wahid is revolutionizing leadership
in Indonesia following 32 years of autocratic rule by former
president Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   By delegating the outcome of his standoff with Wiranto to his
highly respected attorney general, Wahid is subordinating both the
executive and the military to the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   In Indonesia under Suharto, the law and the courts were simply
tools of his personal policies.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the strands of these changes will intersect as
Suharto faces a court summons on charges of corruption. He is
expected to try to avoid the summons by pleading ill health. But
the coinciding legal proceedings against the general and the former
president signal broad changes for Indonesia.

REBELS SEIZE THE OFFENSIVE AGAINST GOVERNMENT TROOPS IN ANGOLA 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By RACHEL SWARNS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUAMBO, Angola _ The astonishing news crackled over the radios
in this crumbling town of faded colonial mansions and rolling green
hills. One by one, the radio announcer said, the nearby rebel
strongholds were falling into government hands.
</P>
<P>
   And for three months, hope blossomed here.
</P>
<P>
   The mortars stopped falling. Relief workers made plans to send
thousands of refugees home. And Silvano Chingala Mindo, a
19-year-old student who saw his two friends killed by shrapnel last
October, began to believe he might live long enough to become a
veterinarian.
</P>
<P>
   But these days, the waves of war are once again lapping over
Angola, and over this weary city. The guerrillas are storming
through the countryside, villagers are fleeing to refugee camps and
the fragile hopes that buoyed this bullet-pocked town are waning.
</P>
<P>
   After a series of back-to-back victories late last year, the
government apparently thought it had finally triumphed over the
guerrillas known as Unita _ &UR;  &LR; the Portuguese acronym for the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, which until
1975 was a Portuguese colony. Now, in the seemingly endless war
that has raged ever since, pitting Unita's leader, Jonas Savimbi,
against his fierce rival, President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, the
rebels have seized the offensive once more.
</P>
<P>
   Unita claims to have killed 882 government soldiers over the
past month. This week, the government, which had repeatedly boasted
that it had destroyed 80 percent of Unita's war machine, publicly
acknowledged that the battle is far from over.
</P>
<P>
   Paulina Wenda discovered the rebels were still a potent force
last week when they opened fire on her village in nearby Mbave. She
grabbed her children and they ran barefoot, leaving their hut,
their pots, their clothes, their land.
</P>
<P>
   She had heard the radio broadcasts and the government officials
who claimed they were finally winning. ``But there's no
difference,'' Wenda, 35, said wearily as she stood in a refugee
camp near here. ``We're still losing everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Military experts say the government underestimated Unita, and
they predict the guerrillas will continue fighting to capitalize on
the rainy season here that has hobbled the government's tanks and
jets in thick mud and dense clouds.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought they had Unita on their knees and it's not so,''
said Johann Smith, a military analyst, who served as the South
African Defense Force's attache to Luanda, the capital here, in
1992 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've absorbed the initial shock of the successes against
them,'' said Smith, who still monitors the conflict and Unita.
``They're up and running. And they're definitely going to use this
window of time to strengthen their position.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all the action has been military, however. After the
government drove the rebels from their traditional strongholds of
Bailundo, Andulo and Jamba between September and December last
year, Unita announced that it wanted to reopen negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech broadcast on government radio last week, dos Santos
said he believed Angola was stable enough to hold national
elections next year and invited Unita's soldiers to lay down their
arms and organize their political party.
</P>
<P>
   That news was enough for Veronica Chilombo, 36, who lost her
left leg in an accident, to leave her village, which had been under
rebel control. For two days, she hobbled on wooden crutches until
she reached a hospital here in government-controlled Huambo, where
she could finally ask for an artificial leg.
</P>
<P>
   Valdemar Franco Secesec, a 25-year-old nurse, said he was
heartened by commercial flights flying into the airport again and
the trucks rolling in on roads that were once too dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I have hope that one day soon this war will end,'' Franco
said. ``You have to have hope. There is nothing else to keep us
going.''
</P>
<P>
   But there have been no clear signs that the two sides will
actually come together.
</P>
<P>
   The war here used to have an ideological base: dos Santos was
backed by Russia and Cuba, Savimbi by the United States. Gradually,
it has turned into more of a battle for Angola's huge spoils _ the
oil controlled by the government, and the diamond mines by Unita.
</P>
<P>
   There is still much finger-pointing on both sides about the
failure of the 1994 peace treaty that gave Angola its longest
cease-fire in 30 years. The fighting resumed in 1998, with Unita
initially making strong gains.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of easing, this civil war has now spread beyond its
borders, spilling into neighboring Namibia, which late last year
allowed the Angolan government to fight from its soil, where the
conflict has already claimed dozens of civilian lives.
</P>
<P>
   And so, the two sides talk peace and wage war, and ordinary
people suffer. Strangely enough, in this still-graceful town of
red-tile roofs and elegant leafy plazas, such contradictions seem
oddly logical.
</P>
<P>
   After all, this is a place where the only hotel has shiny water
faucets, but no running water; light switches, but no electricity
during the day. A graffiti artist has scrawled the word ``paz'' or
``peace'' on a building still riddled with bullet holes.
</P>
<P>
   This is a war that ebbs and flows, where the winners on one day
are often the losers on the next. The government controls most of
the cities and towns, but Unita is still strong in the countryside.
And it is often difficult to tell where and when the fighting ends
and the peace begins.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Doctors Without Borders, which runs a clinic for
refugees here, accepted the official word about peace in the
region, and sent trucks rumbling out into the countryside to screen
poor children for malnutrition. But two weeks ago, they stopped,
frightened by new reports of violence and by the shelling that
jolted their nurses from sleep at night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The local staff didn't want to go anymore,'' said Gunilla
Priebe, a nurse with the organization. ``And we trust their
information more than the official information. It's more
reliable.''
</P>
<P>
   The locals, teen-agers like Chingala, gossip and giggle and lean
against a dilapidated building that has long since lost its glass
windows and wooden doors. The girls laugh when asked whether they
think the war is ending. It is something they cannot imagine. All
they know is war.
</P>
<P>
   Chingala does not laugh. He was walking home from school with
his friends last October when the shell exploded. He survived
unscathed, but when he saw their bloodied bodies, he thought he saw
his own fate.
</P>
<P>
   And so he prays for peace because he wants to grow up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if peace stays, I will have a future,'' he said.
``They say Unita has no longer any possibility to win offensives. I
heard it on the radio. I just hope it's true.''

`PUPS': THEY'VE GOT HOSTAGES, AND THEY WANT THEIR MTV 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review.) 
(ms)  
By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stevie and Rocky are a Bonnie and Clyde for the MTV
generation.
</P>
<P>
   Two 13-year-olds, precariously imbalanced on the edge of a new
millennium, they impulsively digress from their morning walk to
school one day in December 1999 to hold up a bank in ``Pups.''
</P>
<P>
   Armed with a .44 Magnum taken from the closet of Stevie's absent
mother, energized by inchoate anger and disappointment with the
world, fantasizing about running off to the Galapagos Islands for a
better life, they make hostages of employees and customers, shoot a
security guard and find themselves surrounded by the FBI, police
officers, SWAT teams and helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   As the standoff plays out, the hyperkinetic, perceptive though
derivative ``Pups,'' produced, directed and written by a filmmaker
who goes by the single name Ash, takes a knowing look at
adolescents informed but not educated by television and movies in a
less than perfect United States.
</P>
<P>
   With a staginess reminiscent of ``The Petrified Forest'' and
with overt and covert references to films like ``Bonnie and
Clyde,'' ``Dog Day Afternoon,'' ``Of Mice and Men'' and even ``All
Quiet on the Western Front,'' Ash's adrenal little film, like its
adolescent main characters, has been shaped, for better and worse,
by the screen.
</P>
<P>
   With easy access to guns and little access to life except as
depicted on television and in videos and movies, the teen-agers
talk like grown-ups and think and act like confused children unable
to distinguish reality from make-believe.
</P>
<P>
   Obscenities, threats and sexual boasts are part of their
vocabulary. So are solitary games involving video cameras, nooses
and the police; complaints about environmental pollution and
neglectful parents; confessional self-analysis; allegations of
sexual abuse; and a cynical knowledge of how to manipulate
authority figures. Pizza, beer and soda are their treats. A visit
from MTV is among Stevie's demands, as are margarita mix, condoms
and an end to smoking by the FBI commander.
</P>
<P>
   Stevie (Cameron Van Hoy), wearing a T-shirt imprinted with a
yellow smiley face, is thrilled to see himself on the news on the
bank's television. He calls Rocky (Mischa Barton), in her tank top
imprinted with a red heart, to look.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cool,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   When Stevie receives his visit from MTV, Kurt Loder, playing
himself, arrives for the interview and tells the boy: ``We do
Manson. We do Madonna. Now we're doing you.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of Stevie fancies himself a sophisticate. ``We're no
suckers,'' he says to street people who try to sell him and Rocky
3-week-old pit bull pups. Stevie, who resorts frequently to an
inhaler to ease his respiratory problems, tells Rocky that the dogs
were separated too soon from their mother and their immune system
is therefore compromised.
</P>
<P>
   Once the authorities respond to the holdup, Stevie finds himself
negotiating with Daniel Bender, an FBI agent played by Burt
Reynolds with a workmanlike mixture of toughness, irascibility and
mission. Irked by his importunate superior and repeatedly
interrupted by cell-phone calls from his family, Bender is a
patient professional determined to end the matter without further
bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   Stevie, portrayed as a volatile, fast-talking compendium of pop
culture, childish rage, adolescent mischief and adult stupidity and
remorse, is compassionate enough to free the wounded guard and wise
enough in the ways of power politics and televised hostage
situations to give orders to Bender, whose family is watching the
drama on the news.
</P>
<P>
   Rocky, in a layered performance, combines loyal girlfriend and
voice of reason with deep cynicism toward the world she was born
into and now is shaping.
</P>
<P>
   The hostages, some written more fully than others, consist not
only of the manager and a couple of tellers, but also of customers
who include a Persian Gulf war veteran in a wheelchair (Adam
Farrar) and Edwards (Ed Metzger), a World War II veteran with a
cane. The pairing provides Ash with yet another opportunity for a
generational skirmish.
</P>
<P>
   Says the older veteran, ``America used to be a great country.''

 TARGET DATE FOR ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN   AGREEMENT REMAINS ELUSIVE
 (ms)  
By JOEL GREENBERG    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ A target date for a framework agreement on a
permanent peace between Israelis and Palestinians slipped by here
Sunday as contacts between the two sides remained frozen, with no
signs that the impasse might be broken.
</P>
<P>
   At a cabinet meeting largely devoted to the recent flare-up of
violence in Lebanon, Prime Minister Ehud Barak reportedly said that
a few more weeks of discussions on the framework accord were
preferable to moving straight into talks on a full peace treaty, as
suggested by the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Oded Eran, the chief Israeli negotiator, said that if
negotiations resumed, a framework accord could be reached in
another four to six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   However, the talks have ground to a halt. The Palestinians
suspended them last week, a few days after a Feb. 3 meeting between
Barak and Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader. The meeting ended
in disagreement over the area of the next scheduled West Bank land
transfer when the Israelis ruled out a handover of villages around
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The stalemate doomed the Feb. 13 deadline, so when it came and
went Sunday there was no surprise, only a deepening sense that the
momentum of peace efforts generated by Barak in his first months in
office had all but evaporated.
</P>
<P>
   Some Israeli commentators wondered whether Barak's ambitious
deadlines for progress in peace talks would prove nothing more than
hollow boasts. Shimon Peres, the former prime minister who serves
in Barak's cabinet, said Sunday that the target dates were risky
gambles.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the latest Israeli-Palestinian accord, a
permanent peace agreement is supposed to be reached by Sept. 13,
resolving such profoundly divisive issues as the future of
Jerusalem, Palestinian refugees and Jewish settlements, and the
delineation of borders. But after Sunday's missed target date for a
framework accord, the prospects for concluding a comprehensive
treaty in seven months seemed decidedly dimmer.
</P>
<P>
   Yaser Abed Rabbo, the chief Palestinian negotiator, put the
blame squarely on Israel, saying that it had ``violated'' the
deadline while reneging on commitments to hand over more West Bank
land to the Palestinians under the terms of interim peace accords.
</P>
<P>
   Growing Palestinian frustration with Barak was reflected in a
poll published Sunday indicating rising support among Palestinians
for armed attacks against Israel. In the poll, conducted by the
Center for Palestine Research and Study in Nablus, support for
armed attacks had risen to 43 percent among those polled, the
highest since June of last year, when Barak took over from his
right-wing predecessor, Benjamin Netanyahu. The margin of error is
3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli police went on alert Sunday after receiving information
pointing to a planned terrorist attack, setting up checkpoints on
roads leading to and from the West Bank.

DAYS BEFORE ELECTION, LIBERALS RALLY IN IRAN FOR REFORM 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ A singing, chanting, cheering crowd of about
8,000 people filled a cavernous basketball stadium Sunday in
support of the reformers who aim to wrest control of Parliament
from the insular clerical establishment that has ruled and, they
said, repressed Iran for 21 years.
</P>
<P>
   The enthusiastic pep rally was the first organized gathering in
Tehran since the one-week campaign for the Feb. 18 parliamentary
elections opened officially on Friday. The rally featured some of
Iran's most outspoken liberals, who freely borrowed symbols and
songs of the Islamic revolution that overturned the monarchy and
brought the religious hierarchy to power in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Saeed Hajjarian, a newspaper editor who is running in a loose
coalition of liberals, made one of the boldest speeches Sunday. He
alluded to the traditional March holiday of Noruz, when Iranians
usually do a thorough spring cleaning of their homes, in an
indirect attack on the state of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now Noruz is coming, and we have to clean up our house,''
Hajjarian said as the crowd burst into applause and cheers. ``There
are certain things in our house that have gathered dust. We must
clean them off and make them shine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean that some of our Parliament members,'' he continued,
``have become bureaucrats who are building power bases of their
own. Yes, some things in our house are old and decaying, and we
have to throw them in the trash.''
</P>
<P>
   The liberal coalition of parties includes former
revolutionaries, writers, officials and moderate Islamic clergymen
who have tried to capitalize on the robust popularity of Iran's
reformist president, Mohammad Khatami. He has galvanized Iran's
overwhelmingly young population with his calls to create a civil
society.
</P>
<P>
   The pro-Khatami group calls itself the Coalition of May 23, the
date of Khatami's landslide election in 1997, and it has overcome
some of the difficulties arising from the abbreviated campaign and
the restrictions on publicity by including high-profile names.
</P>
<P>
   One candidate is the brother of Abdullah Nouri, a Khatami ally
and former interior minister who was jailed last summer after he
openly called for ending the clergy's domination of public policy.
Another is the president's brother, Mohammad Reza Khatami.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't be afraid of those who use extremism and violence,''
Reza Khatami exhorted the stadium crowd, which responded with
ear-splitting screams of devotion. ``Fill the air with love and
kindness.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been little talk of specific programs or proposals
from any of the parties, on the right or the left, so it is not
clear how united any group of self-proclaimed reformers might be if
they win control of the 290-seat Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   A number of hard-line parties and groups _ including the
traditionally conservative merchant class, right-wing clerics and
others _ are also fielding slates of candidates. But many of the
independent candidates and other parties are thought to contain a
wide range of views, depending on whether the topic is economics or
political liberalization.
</P>
<P>
   Although some Iranian newspapers have reported scattered clashes
around the country between pro-reform campaigners and conservative
vigilante groups like those that turned on student protesters in
Tehran last summer, government officials say no serious violence
has occurred so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been healthy competition around the country,'' said
Abdolvahed Mousavi Lari, the interior minister, who is close to
Khatami. ``Even if there have been some minor cases, they have been
dealt with and campaign violations are at a minimum.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign law itself is inimical to ideas like debates,
rallies or party platforms. A council of clerics announced a final
list of acceptable candidates only the day before the campaign
began. It rejected 777 people for reasons that included their views
on the relationship between religion and government.
</P>
<P>
   Other regulations put in place by the conservative-dominated
Parliament restrict campaigning by candidates and parties to such
activities as passing out leaflets on street corners, attacking one
another in the newspapers and pasting their pictures on walls and
lamp posts. Sunday's rally was permitted because it included a
question-and-answer session and counted as a seminar.
</P>
<P>
   Access to the news media, however, is largely the privilege of
those who are already known political figures. The rest of the
approved 6,083 candidates nationwide, who are running for just 290
seats, must get by with posters, although the biggest allowed by
law is smaller than 6 by 8 inches.
</P>
<P>
   But the reformers had no need to convert the crowd of mostly
young people in the stadium, who chanted slogans calling for the
release of political prisoners, ``freedom of thought'' and _ the
coalition's trademark _ ``Iran for all Iranians.''
</P>
<P>
   They sang the former national anthem, dating from the years
before the 1979 revolution. Like most of the speeches, the song
stands out in modern Iran because it makes no reference to
religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the pro-Khatami faction to help him accomplish his
program in Parliament,'' said Bentolhoda Jamshidi, a 19-year-old
university student who joined in the singing and cheering.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't expect everything to happen right away, since there
are still a lot of pressure groups that won't make it easy for
him,'' she added. ``But the most important change that could happen
is a more open political atmosphere _ something to give us the
space to breathe.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Under the fine lines and smooth washes of The New
Yorker's cartoons, it is stormy weather. The magazine's funnymen
are frowning.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 5 a small gallery in Manhattan, Davis &AMP; Langdale, held a
reception for ``Artists of The New Yorker,'' a show to celebrate
the magazine's 75th anniversary. It was not an official New Yorker
party. It was not even a big party. But it was an event.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran New Yorker artists mixed with newcomers: Robert Weber,
James Stevenson, Al Ross, Frank Modell, Michael Maslin, Lee Lorenz,
Arnie Levin, Edward Koren, Liza Donnelly and Roz Chast rubbed
shoulders with Jules Feiffer, David Levine, Ed Sorel and Danny
Shanahan. Dead artists _ Ludwig Bemelmans, Whitney Darrow Jr.,
Helen Hokinson and Charles Saxon _ watched from their drawings on
the walls.
</P>
<P>
   There were some notable absences, too. The New Yorker's cartoon
editor, Robert Mankoff; its art editor, Francoise Mouly; and her
husband, Art Spiegelman, the most controversial new New Yorker
artist, were not at the party.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition was no insurrection, but protest was in the air.
The cartoonists who looked back at the magazine's history were
hardly misty-eyed. At the reception and in private interviews, they
smoldered and wondered at the changes they had seen.
</P>
<P>
   They talked about all the editors: They talked about Harold Ross
as if he were a god. They talked about William Shawn as if he were
their lost daddy. They talked about Tina Brown as if she were a
cold date. They talked about kitsch. They talked about abandonment.
Some said that the old New Yorker style they had helped to create
lay in ruins. Others said it was about time.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1920s and '30s, when Ross was editor and Rea Irvin was
art editor, The New Yorker helped create the idea of cosmopolitan
Manhattan. In time, as editors got married and moved to the
suburbs, the style became more suburban. The city still appeared in
The New Yorker, but by the 1950s it had become, as Koren put it,
``a memory of urban life.''
</P>
<P>
   For cartoonists, said Lorenz, a former art editor and artist for
the magazine since 1958, ``coming into New York was a social
occasion.'' Most of them lived outside the city. ``You would come
in one day a week, drop off the material. You would start making
rounds.''
</P>
<P>
   The New Yorker was the first stop. The magazine paid per square
inch of published work, and cartoonists often drew big, hoping for
more money. (Now it's a flat payment: $1,200 for a cartoon; $4,000
for the first cover and an additional $500 for each successive one
in the same year.)
</P>
<P>
   After the New Yorker stop, they moved on: Collier's, The
Saturday Evening Post, Esquire, Sports Illustrated, Ladies' Home
Journal, American Legion, True, Cavalier, Playboy. ``At the end of
the day,'' Lorenz said, ``you'd go to `1,000 Jokes,' published by
Dell, and the editor would sop up whatever was left.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a Tuesday trip and a Wednesday trip, said Koren, the
master of fuzzy creatures, who started at The New Yorker in the
mid-1960s. Tuesdays were for the heavy hitters: Charles Addams,
Barney Tobey, George Price, William Steig, Peter Arno. Wednesdays
were for newcomers. ``For lunch we'd go to the Blue Ribbon or the
Lobster,'' Koren said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ross had a great sensibility about what cartoonists could
do,'' said Modell, who started drawing for The New Yorker in 1945.
``Some did horses well, others did automobiles. I did angry men and
sexy women and dogs. George Price drew angry men but not
businessmen. Whitney Darrow did businessmen. Dedini, Darrow and
Arno did sexy women. Hokinson did club ladies. There were only two
types of women in those days, sexy doxies and wives.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the steady artists were fed ideas and captions by
gagmen. And if you wanted to become a New Yorker cartoonist, being
a gagman was a way to get your foot in the door. Stevenson, a
writer and cartoonist known for his loose drawings of the perplexed
middle class, remembers his start. Beginning in 1956 he sold gags
for $75 each.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't supposed to tell anyone what I did. Cartoonists
wanted people to think they were funny,'' he said. ``If someone did
ask what I did for The New Yorker, I'd just say, `I don't know.'''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone wanted to get in, so one of the growth industries at
The New Yorker was bringing bad news. After James Geraghty became
art editor in 1939, he hired Modell as his assistant. ``I was a hit
man,'' Modell said. ``If an idea was OK'd, Geraghty would see the
cartoonist. But if it was a rejection, he would say, `Frank will
see him.' The mortality rate was worse than for babies in 1910
Egypt.''
</P>
<P>
   To avoid awkward encounters with expectant artists and writers,
Ross kept building more walls. George Booth, who started drawing
his mad bull-terriers and psychotic cats for The New Yorker in the
1970s, has done some historical research: ``At one point a mirror
was hung up in the hallway so you could see who was coming in and
not run into him. It was a lovely atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   Modell recalled an encounter with James Thurber: ``I was the new
boy. I heard someone coming down the hall'' toward a steep
stairway. ``He was a tall, lanky, thin guy. He was practically
blind and not opposed to having more drink than he should. He had
his hand over one eye to put all the energy he had for vision into
the one good eye.''
</P>
<P>
   Modell continued: ``I became worried. If I let a million-dollar
talent kill himself falling down the stairway, what would happen to
me?'' He touched Thurber's shoulder and asked, ``Can I help you?''
Thurber bellowed, ``Get out of my way,'' and then, Modell recalled,
``he went down like a stack of dishes.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Modell said, ``it was an absolutely utopian time.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the bomb dropped. The Newhouse family took over the
magazine, fired Shawn and put Robert Gottlieb in his place. ``When
Shawn's time came to an end, we were all shocked and hurt,'' Modell
said. ``We lost Daddy.''
</P>
<P>
   The betrayal was not only personal but aesthetic, or so many of
the old cartoonists think. ``Gottlieb liked wordplay, puns, and
some thought it was horrible,'' said Sorel, who now draws covers
for the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Tina Brown. ``Tina wanted the magazine to be
competitive on the newsstand,'' Lorenz said. ``She began to
encourage material that was right on top of the news. There were
pictures of the Clintons, the Bushes.''
</P>
<P>
   Arnie Levin, the cartoonist of loopy lines, said, ``There would
be 40 artists piling up on the same topic.''
</P>
<P>
   And the effect? The cartoons are ``not quite as philosophically
pointed as they used to be,'' and ``the drawing has diminished,''
Koren said.
</P>
<P>
   Modell said, ``There's no heart there, and you can feel the
effort of the artist, how he has his hand on the pulse of the
world.'' But not everyone agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people look back, they say cartoons aren't as funny
today,'' said Chast, who specializes in drawing homely types with
odd domestic obsessions. ``But if you pick up any issue from any
year, maybe two or three cartoons are complete side splitters, and
two or three completely miss the boat, and the rest will be OK,
funny but not sublime.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Chast was once accused of drawing badly. When she started
appearing in The New Yorker in 1978, ``she caused tremendous
anger,'' Lorenz said. ``She was primitive. She made no attempt to
have correct perspective. And there were letters from people
canceling their subscriptions. Other artists were angry, too.''
</P>
<P>
   But now almost every New Yorker artist reveres her. Chast knows
that there's ``less emphasis on the craft of drawing,'' she said,
but she does not think that means standards have disappeared. ``I
like a drawing not to repel me.''
</P>
<P>
   But now, both inside and outside The New Yorker, many
cartoonists are striving for a certain arty repulsiveness.
``There's a whole generation of younger cartoonists inspired by R.
Crumb, Art Spiegelman, Bill Griffith and Harvey Kurtzman,'' Jules
Feiffer said.
</P>
<P>
   With traces of underground styles reaching The New Yorker, some
of the old cartoonists have found themselves out of work. ``When
Tina came, it was like kissing a beautiful girl and not getting
kissed back,'' Modell said. ``Tina never bought any drawings of
mine. Now I'm like an old mule who still goes to the pump. If I
have an idea, I have to get rid of it, so I'll fax it to The New
Yorker, then Playboy.'' But lately, he said, he has sold nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Booth is more philosophical: ``I haven't done any covers since
the 1980s. But things go in cycles, and you just pull your skivvies
up around your armpits and go on.'' He continued: ``I think The New
Yorker wouldn't be in existence if Tina Brown hadn't come in and
raised hell. She was running into an audience that didn't read.''
</P>
<P>
   Cartoons, Modell noted, are there to defuse readers' anxieties
about encountering ``great slabs of type,'' the way clowns defuse
the intensity of the high-wire act. ``But now,'' he added,
``there's so much cacophony _ photos, ads _ that there's no need
for cartoonists. If I ran the magazine, I wouldn't have them.''
</P>
<P>
   There are some people who don't lament the lost New Yorker. Not
surprisingly, they are the ones who made their reputations
elsewhere. Surprisingly, they are among the few who actually live
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not a reader of The New Yorker, and I didn't have the
ambition to be a New Yorker cartoonist,'' said David Levine, who is
best known for his pen-and-ink caricatures in The New York Review
of Books but now does pencil caricatures for The New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a gag cartoonist. Two years ago Tina Brown called me
to have lunch. She was fighting for a losing magazine. She decided
caricature was the only entertaining way for the public to deal
with the onslaught of interviews and biographies. Her changes were
made to fit the craving of an audience no longer as literate as it
had been.''
</P>
<P>
   Feiffer, who is known for his squiggly, talking-head cartoons in
The Village Voice, has a similar story. ``I grew up reading The New
Yorker, but it was the furthest thing from my ideal. I was too
Bronx for Arno. I grew up loving comic strips.''
</P>
<P>
   And what he calls his ``abrasive social and political
commentary'' was far from The New Yorker's ideal. ``William Shawn
broke out in hives when he saw my stuff, but Tina didn't have that
problem. She wanted me in the first issue.''
</P>
<P>
   So under a host of pressures the old cartoon culture has
crumbled. Few cartoonists go into the city regularly. Many have
families and other jobs _ as animators, artists and authors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized the fax machine worked fine,'' Chast said.
</P>
<P>
   Koren said: ``The collegiality has evaporated.''
</P>
<P>
   Mischa Richter, 90, who started drawing cartoons 45 years ago,
said: ``The New Yorker made celebrities once. Now it wants
celebrities to make The New Yorker.''
</P>
<P>
   Even drawing itself may be in decline. ``Kids don't draw
anymore,'' Sorel said. ``Comic art in America started at the turn
of the century, and it's ending at the turn of another century.
There is no longer a New Yorker style. Anything goes. A New Yorker
cartoon is anything the editor says it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Modell takes a simpler view of the new New Yorker: ``I could be
a great admirer if they would buy my cartoons.''

   PHILADELPHIA _ Jim Seiple, 21, wanted to take his girlfriend,
Stephanie Cahill, 19, someplace special for an early Valentine's
Day celebration. So Seiple, a clerk at Shop Rite, took Cahill, a
hospital dietitian, to Philadelphia's most famous heart _ the
18-foot tall, 4-ton papier-mache and fiberglass model at the
Franklin Institute, the science museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``What better thing to see than the big heart?'' said Seiple,
who was marking the holiday early because he had to work late on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Who needs expensive, candlelit restaurants? One of the most
romantic places in Philadelphia turns out to be a science exhibit
intended to teach schoolchildren about the circulatory system.
</P>
<P>
   Angelo Cataldi, the host of a morning radio show here, was
married in front of the heart on the last day of 1999 by his friend
Edward Rendell, the former mayor. The heart was a fallback
location. Rendell had originally suggested that he marry Cataldi
and his fiancee, Gail Cox, at the convention center that afternoon
_ just the two of them, and 999 other couples who happened to have
registered for the millennium wedding ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   But Cox ``didn't like the idea of the 2,000 people,'' Cataldi
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we said to the mayor, `Is there any chance we could have a
private wedding?' He said, `I'm doing something at the Franklin
Institute at 11. How about the heart?'''
</P>
<P>
   Cataldi agreed, with one stipulation: ``I said, `OK, we'll do it
at the heart, but you have to turn off the thump. The thump grosses
me out.'''
</P>
<P>
   The model, which visitors can climb through, has a soundtrack
that loudly simulates the sound of a heartbeat. The museum turned
it off long enough for the marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Now the museum is considering what it is calling a heart
transplant. The model may be moved to another wing as part of a $50
million renovation designed to bring the 67-year-old building's
low-tech exhibits into the high-tech present. The heart shares
space with the Wright brothers' biplane, the hall of electricity _
with simulated thunder and lightning and a van de Graaf generator
that makes static electricity _ and a planetarium.
</P>
<P>
   The question museum officials are asking is: Can the heart,
which was created as a temporary exhibit, survive the move?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a little bit of papier-mache and fiberglass and
chicken wire with a thump in the background,'' said the institute's
president, Dennis M. Wint. ``The problem is our doorways are
smaller than the heart.'' In order to move it, the model would have
to be dismantled and put together again.
</P>
<P>
   As visitors climb through the pink, red and blue heart, they
follow the path of the red blood cells. Touring it the other day,
Jeff Guaracino, the museum spokesman, said that he, too, has come
under the model's romantic spell. ``I will tell you I had a kiss in
the heart,'' he said, recalling a recent visit with a date. ``It
was at the right ventricle. It was just a spur-of-the-moment kiss
in the heart.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For nearly 50 years the heart has been a popular landmark for
children on school trips. Strolling through the heart, Guaracino
was surrounded by a group of laughing, screaming, shouting boys and
girls from St. Andrew's elementary school in suburban Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Katie Kirk, 10, said she felt inspired. ``I want to be a heart
surgeon,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Kyle Shay, 8, said: ``I like the veins. They're blue. That's my
favorite color.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Ford, 9, took a decidedly unromantic view of the exhibit.
``What I like about the heart is that it looks exactly like the
heart _ not a Valentine's card.''

AMBASSADOR FIGHTS TO RESTORE AUSTRIA'S IMAGE
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite the diplomat's smile, the fatigue showed on
the face of Ambassador Peter Moser, Austria's representative to the
United States, the lack of sleep etched beneath his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   He had been up since  just as he had every morning for
most of the last two weeks, making urgent telephone calls to the
Foreign Ministry in Vienna. He dispatched his wife to her sister's
home in New York, knowing that it would be impossible to find time
for her in the days to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a nightmare,'' he said of what has gone on since Feb.
4, with the swearing-in of a new Austrian government that includes
the far-right, anti-immigration Freedom Party led by Joerg Haider,
who has praised some of Hitler's employment policies. ``You think
of the job of a diplomat as a dream under usual circumstances,''
Moser said. ``Well, what is going on now is the reverse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does not feel real,'' he said. ``It is surreal.''
</P>
<P>
   Every day the embassy's mailbag bulges with scores of letters
from Americans condemning Austria; some are filled with threats and
obscenities. ``There are serious letters, and then others are just
offensive,'' said Moser, a 58-year-old career diplomat. ``Maybe
people get a personal relief if they call us names.''
</P>
<P>
   The creation of a coalition government that includes Haider's
party has turned Austria into a pariah within the 15-nation
European Union, which has severed routine contacts with Vienna. The
Clinton administration has protested by withdrawing the American
ambassador, and National Security Adviser Sandy Berger has been
warning of the possible emergence of ``the extreme hateful right''
in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis has forced Moser to dive into the whirlpool of
Washington's 24-hour news cycle, as he tries to persuade Americans
_ and the large foreign press corps based here _ that Austria is
being unfairly tarred.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 10 days, there have been appearances on CNN and on
PBS' ``NewsHour,'' as well as a news conference on Friday at the
National Press Club, the first solo news conference in Moser's
33-year career in the Austrian diplomatic service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Haider is not Austria, and Austria is not Haider,'' he said at
the press club on Friday in a sometimes awkward effort to distance
the people ria from the government that they have put in
place _ and that he must now represent.
</P>
<P>
   He insisted that while the Freedom Party might be xenophobic, it
was not fascist, and that while Haider might be a hot-headed
opportunist prone to outrageous remarks (such as his praise for
Nazi labor policies and for the veterans of the SS), he is not a
Nazi. ``We from the diplomatic establishment have to walk behind
him, after him, and pick up the pieces,'' Moser said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in his spacious office in the Austrian embassy, Moser
took a seat at a small conference table and slowly sipped from a
glass of water. Behind his desk was a stack of papers, topped by an
English translation of a book by Haider outlining his right-wing
political philosophy. On the cover is a photo of the well-tanned,
carefully coifed, ever-grinning politician, who could easily pass
for an American television anchorman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was given to me,'' the ambassador says. ``I don't think I
will read it.''
</P>
<P>
   He resists offering a personal appraisal of Haider's character.
``My personal feelings, I am not being paid for,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to salvage Austria's reputation was certainly not the
assignment Moser expected when he arrived in Washington last year.
His initial goal, he said, was to expand trade and to encourage
Americans to think of his nation of 8 million people as the
economic hub of central Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``My personal opinion as a professional diplomat is that I'm
very sad and sorry because what we built up over the years is now
being questioned,'' he said of Austria's efforts since World War II
to portray itself as a peace-loving member of the European
community, and to distance itself from its Nazi past, when Austria
embraced German rule under the Austrian-born Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   He said it was unfair to single out Austria for condemnation
when political parties similar to Haider's exist across Europe and
could, like the Freedom Party, enter government someday soon. ``One
day they will wake up and find that they have similar problems,''
he said. ``All of these remarks of Haider, which remember the Nazi
history, are a wonderful instrument to distract attention from this
fact.''
</P>
<P>
   He does not deny, however, that his job is made more difficult
by the perception that Austria is unwilling to confront its
history, a view that grew stronger outside Austria after voters
there elected Kurt Waldheim president in 1986 despite revelations
about his service in Hitler's army. ``Yes, I think there are many
people _ not only in the Freedom Party, but many, particularly
older people _ who have not done this process of atonement,'' Moser
conceded.
</P>
<P>
   The ambassador could be considered another victim of the war. He
never knew his father, an Austrian soldier in the German army, who
was sent off to the front two days after his only child was born in
Vienna in June 1941.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was born on a Saturday and he left on a Monday,'' the
ambassador said. After his father died in German-occupied Lithuania
in 1943, ``my mother brought me up alone,'' he said. `'She couldn't
remarry because there were not many men after the war. She worked
hard at whatever job she could get.''
</P>
<P>
   He did well in school, received a law degree in 1964 and entered
Austria's diplomatic academy the next year. His career as a
diplomat has taken him to posts as diverse as New Delhi, India;
Seoul, South Korea; and Sofia, Bulgaria. His favorite posting was
in Los Angeles, where he was consul general from 1979 to 1985. ``We
lived in a house with a swimming pool in a wonderful neighborhood,
just outside Santa Monica,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the carefree sunshine of southern California is far from his
thoughts these days, as Moser rushes through Washington's winter
chill from one difficult interview to another, trying to limit what
he acknowledges is the ``permanent damage'' to Austria's
reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the worst is over, I think the crisis is over,'' he
said. ``But when the dust settles, it will be a lot of work for us
to get back what we have lost.''

METS' ZEILE WOULD RATHER SWITCH THAN FIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Todd Zeile was asked to switch to first base before, and he was
furious. Zeile was in his first full season with the St. Louis
Cardinals in 1990 and had been assured by his manager _ Joe Torre _
that he would be the everyday catcher, that there were no plans to
shift him to another position to get playing time for Tom Pagnozzi.
</P>
<P>
   When Pedro Guerrero got hurt, however, Torre plugged the hole by
moving Zeile to first and using Pagnozzi as the catcher, and Zeile
was angry. ``I think he looked at it like he had failed,'' Torre
said recently, in a phone interview. ``He was pretty steamed.''
</P>
<P>
   The switch lasted exactly 11 games, and although Torre made
Zeile his permanent third baseman the next year, Zeile has long
since gotten over his reluctance to change positions. He will be
the Mets' first baseman this season, stepping in where John Olerud
served the team so well the past three seasons, after a decade of
playing third base.
</P>
<P>
   His switch from third to first, to a position where he has
played only 77 games in his 11-year career, will be among the most
closely watched issues in the Mets' training camp that opens later
this week. The Mets' everyday infielders _ Olerud, second baseman
Edgardo Alfonzo, shortstop Rey Ordonez and third baseman Robin
Ventura _ combined to make 27 errors last season. Zeile made 25
while playing third base for the Texas Rangers, and now he will
essentially be playing a new position, after signing a three-year
deal with the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at it, analyzed it, talked to our scouts and our
people who had seen him play first base,'' said Steve Phillips, the
Mets' general manager. ``Our view was he'd make a smooth and simple
transition.''
</P>
<P>
   There is work to be done. The Mets have asked Keith Hernandez,
considered the best defensive first baseman of his era, to counsel
Zeile, to coach him on his footwork, on holding runners and
covering the first-base hole and charging bunts and balls hit in
front of him. Because so many players have moved to first base at
the end of their careers _ Ernie Banks, George Brett, Willie
Stargell and Carl Yastrzemski, to name a few _ there could be a
misperception that first is an easy position to play, or that it is
somehow of lesser importance.
</P>
<P>
   When Hernandez played, for example, he was the key to the entire
Mets defense; Olerud, tall and rangy and sure-handed, gave them
stability, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a good first baseman, it takes the pressure off of
the infielders,'' Hernandez said, ``as far as knowing they have to
make a nice throw. It's nice for them to know you can be off-line
with a throw and have a good pair of hands over there.''
</P>
<P>
   Olerud joined the Mets before the 1997 season, as Manager Bobby
Valentine recalled, ``he was a lousy first baseman who had no
mobility.'' In time, he was almost a prototype for the Mets: At 6
feet 5 inches, he could reach the throws of Ordonez, whose range
and necessarily quick release sometimes leads to throws that sail
high or sink low. ``Personally, what I thought John did best was
have that range around the bag,'' Valentine said. ``Not on balls
hit in his area, but on throws to first.''
</P>
<P>
   Olerud, a former standout pitcher, could throw, making him
something of a threat to baserunners. He is left-handed, a distinct
advantage at first base. And after working with the Mets' coaching
staff for a time, he embraced some of the concepts employed by
Valentine, such as holding the runner while in motion, faking back
to the bag. (Not all players readily accept such change. When
Rafael Palmeiro was the first baseman for the Baltimore Orioles,
for instance, he did not like signaling the pitcher to indicate
when the runner's lead had grown substantially.)
</P>
<P>
   Zeile is right-handed, which means that throwing to second or
third will be more difficult for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an easier play for a left-hander,'' Hernandez said. ``You
have left-handed first basemen for the same reason that you have
right-handed third basemen.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a question of angles. Zeile is 6-1, and he will not have
Olerud's range on throws to first.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think height is that important,'' said Hernandez, who
is 6-feet tall. He won't have Olerud's experience.
</P>
<P>
   But according to two who have managed Zeile and managed against
him, he has other assets.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has good hands, good baseball instincts,'' said Torre, who
has high respect for Zeile's professionalism. ``He'll do a good
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Riggleman, Zeile's former manager with the Chicago Cubs,
said: ``I just don't see any problems with him playing first base.
Obviously he's not as tall as Olerud, but he's a hair taller than
Steve Garvey'' _ the former Dodger who was considered a good first
baseman _ ``and he's athletic enough. He'll get a feel for picking
the ball up in the dirt.''
</P>
<P>
   Zeile already has that, having gone through years of training as
a catcher. Torre noted that one of Zeile's habits as a third
baseman _ the instinct to drop to one knee and block the ball, not
always a good trait in a third baseman _ will serve him well as a
first baseman, because he will have more time to make a play. He
can drop to a knee to stop the ball, then throw to the pitcher
covering the bag.
</P>
<P>
   Zeile is considered to have an accurate arm, and the part of his
defense that diminished the most in recent years _ his range, in
reaching balls hit to his left and right _ will not be as big an
issue now that he is playing first.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest adjustment for me is not going to be catching the
ball,'' Zeile said, ``but getting used to the intricacies of the
position. Holding runners, bunt defenses from the other side of the
diamond, getting used to the guys around me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm used to blocking and catching balls, as a catcher; I had
some of that hand action. Hopefully, that will go a long way at
first.''
</P>
<P>
   But what might be of most help for Zeile and the Mets is his
willingness to adapt. Zeile could have signed elsewhere and played
third base, but he chose to play first for the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Todd will buy into whatever they ask him to do,'' Hernandez
said. ``He's very happy to go to New York. He's not a me-me guy.
He's a good guy and he wants to do well. It's going to help him,
having those other infielders. They'll help make him feel
comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Zeile will likely bat sixth, behind the left-handed hitting
Ventura, and it may be that at the end of games, the Mets might use
someone more experienced at first to finish games. Charlie Hayes,
signed as a backup, could be inserted as part of a double-switch;
Valentine will examine his options more closely as the season nears
and he has seen Zeile's daily adjustments at first base.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I gathered from Todd, he's a very willing
participant,'' Valentine said. ``It's going to be challenging, but
I believe its going to be a very successful spring.'' &QL;

`THE DUEL': HEADY DAYS WHEN WORDS LED TO DEATH
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes at end of review.) 
(nk) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of the famous duel between
Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr was that it took place at all.
Monday night's ``American Experience'' notes that challenges in
matters of honor were not unknown among politicians in the
Revolutionary era. (Hamilton was involved in 11 of them.) But by
and large they were settled without bloodshed. The point seems to
have been to advertise one's courage without undue risk.
</P>
<P>
   But the personalities and the politics, the ambitions and the
animosities of these two Revolutionary eminences actually drew them
onto a field of honor on July 11, 1804. ``The Duel'' provides a
quick sketch of the careers of the combative Hamilton, champion of
a strong federal government, and Burr, the war hero and charming
ladies' man whose political accomplishments never matched his
potential.
</P>
<P>
   Their clash, briskly reported Sunday night, began when Burr
defeated Hamilton's father-in-law, Gen. Philip Schuyler, to become
the senator from New York. In much stronger language than one hears
in this year's subdued version of negative advertising, Hamilton
described Burr as ``unprincipled, both as a public and a private
man.''
</P>
<P>
   The language only got hotter in the 1800 election, when, by the
rules of the time, Burr tied Thomas Jefferson for the presidency
and after days of deadlock became vice president. Like many vice
presidents to come, the ambitious Burr found himself without power
and, in 1804, he decided to run for governor of New York as a
Federalist.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton was a leader of the forces against him in what one of
Sunday night's historians calls the country's dirtiest political
campaign. (One newspaper published a list of 20 prostitutes who
named Burr as their favorite customer.)
</P>
<P>
   Burr lost, and the upshot was his challenge to Hamilton for
calling him despicable, among other things. The encounter took
place across the Hudson in New Jersey to evade a New York law that
made dueling illegal.
</P>
<P>
   There remains some disagreement as to who fired first and
whether Hamilton missed on purpose. But Burr's intention was
apparently clear; his bullet struck Hamilton in the stomach, and 36
hours later the man described Sunday night as ``the architect of
the American Constitution and the designer of American capitalism''
died. Burr ended up in exile, his reputation destroyed.

A LIVELY, STAR-FILLED EVENING OF WEILL 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JAMES R. OESTREICH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Brooklyn Academy of Music's monthlong celebration
of the centenary of Kurt Weill's birth builds to serious business
with a film festival beginning on Feb. 17 and a production of ``Der
Weg der Verheissung'' (``The Eternal Road''), an epic musical and
theatrical interpretation of Jewish history, on Feb. 28. But the
opening program, ``Weill Style,'' conceived by Ken Bloom and
presented on the evening of Feb. 10 in the academy's Opera House,
was mostly a delightful lark.
</P>
<P>
   With an array of singers from opera, Broadway, cabaret and pop
spinning out Weill show tunes, the evening belonged largely to
Jerry Orbach, who led with ``Mack the Knife,'' acted as M.C. and
ended with ``September Song.'' But it was a show waiting to be
stolen at any moment, and for this listener it was stopped most
definitively early on when the Broadway star Donna Murphy sang
``Pirate Jenny'' from ``The Threepenny Opera'' with compelling
passion. This despite strong competition later from Patricia
O'Callaghan, a classical and cabaret singer, in ``Sailor's Tango,''
and from Ann Magnuson, a film and television actress, in ``The Saga
of Jenny.''
</P>
<P>
   Magnuson received fine support from Hudson Shad, a strong-voiced
male vocal quintet with a wry tone set by its bass, Wilbur Pauley.
That group performed other numbers as well, but no one worked
harder throughout the evening than Eric Stern, the music director,
who bounced deftly from piano to podium and even took a vocal turn
in ``The Trouble With Women.''
</P>
<P>
   In a program consisting of little but highlights, others were
offered by Samuel E. Wright in ``Lost in the Stars,'' Keith Thomas
and Michelle Robinson in ``Moon-Faced, Starry-Eyed'' and Mark
Linn-Baker in ``Tchaikovsky.'' (But Orbach, who introduced this
tongue-twisting Danny Kaye vehicle as being made up of the names of
Russian composers should expect to hear from Ukrainians, wanting to
separate out their compatriot Bortniansky.)
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Hadley did not entirely shed his operatic gravity in an
odd coupling with O'Callaghan in ``It Never Was You,'' but he fared
better on his own in ``Lonely House.'' Only Duncan Sheik, a rock
singer, failed to hold his own in this company, in ``Alabama
Song,'' or even with Stern in ``The Trouble With Women.''
</P>
<P>
   The evening was enriched by reminiscences. Dick Van Patten
described playing Isaac, at age 8, in the premiere production of
``The Eternal Road'' in 1937 in New York and never being quite
sure, from night to night, that the angels would intervene in time
to stay Abraham's sacrifice. Hesper Anderson, the daughter of the
playwright Maxwell Anderson, a Weill collaborator, spoke feelingly
of the composer and his wife, Lotte Lenya. Nanette Fabray's fragile
rendition of ``Green-Up Time,'' too, was more in the nature of a
reminiscence.
</P>
<P>
   The year's Weill celebrations, at the Brooklyn Academy and
elsewhere, might wish to take their theme from the show title
``Happy End.'' Here, at any rate, was the happiest of beginnings.

OPPOSITION LEADER DETAINED AFTER ZIMBABWE REFERENDUM 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By HENRI E. CAUVIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe _ A leading opposition figure was detained here
Sunday at the end of a two-day referendum on a new constitution
that was marked by charges of sporadic intimidation and voting
irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   Tendai Biti and several other members of the Movement for
Democratic Change and the National Constitutional Assembly were
taken into custody outside a polling place in a township here as
they urged people to vote down the proposed constitution, some of
their colleagues said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just intimidation,'' said Dr. Lovemore Madhuku, vice
chairman of the group, which was formed to fight for a new
constitution but has ended up fighting against the one proposed by
the president's hand-picked commission. ``They just want to show
that you cannot contest this.''
</P>
<P>
   The new constitution, which would strengthen the powers of the
presidency and give the government the right to seize white-owned
land without compensation, is a crucial test for President Robert
Mugabe,
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe is suffering through the most painful economic crisis
since the country won independence from Britain 20 years ago. In
April, Mugabe and his governing Zimbabwe African National
Union-Patriotic Front face parliamentary elections pitting them
against a surging new opposition party.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of the proposed constitution is likely to hint at the
outcome of those elections. As a result, the contest being waged
over it has taken on a far greater importance for both Mugabe and
his supporters and for those who hope to see him unseated.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of all of the attention directed at the contest,
however, turnout was light at many polling places. In a country
where turnout is typically low, opposition groups hoped their
campaign, coupled with the country's continuing economic problems,
would bring out people who traditionally do not bother to vote. But
the absence of long lines in many places suggested otherwise and at
least hinted at a victory for Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Sunday night, the country's chief election
organizer, Tobaiwa Mudede, said he could not estimate the total
turnout, because bad weather had delayed reporting from many rural
polling locations. Counting is expected to begin Monday morning,
with results likely to come by the end of the day, he said.
</P>
<P>
   How the opposition's charges of irregularities and intimidation
will affect the process remains to be seen. With information still
trickling in Saturday night from around the country to the
headquarters of the National Constitutional Assembly, no clear
patterns had emerged. But what they had heard so far was certainly
troubling, leaders of the organization said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the arrests of several campaigners at the
township polling place here, the group said that monitors at one
polling place were ejected by the police several hours before the
polls closed. At another, at a school in Gutu in the south, a
monitor said, the principal threatened him with a gun and told him
to leave.
</P>
<P>
   And in Mutare in the east and Chivi in the south, monitors
observed ballot boxes that apparently had been removed from polling
places before the end of balloting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now these reports are sporadic, but we haven't heard
from a lot of other areas,'' said Isaac Maposa, a member of the
group.``Some people are hundreds of kilometers from phones so we
don't have everything and I am sure we will be hearing worse
stories than this.''
</P>
<P>
   Mariyo Mariyawanda Nzuwah, chairman of the National Election
Directorate, said at the news briefing that no reports of tampering
had been received following the first day of balloting and that he
was confident the vote would be viewed as fair. ``We think we did a
fairly reasonable job,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Tony Hawkins of the University of Zimbabwe said that while
problems were almost inevitable in organizing votes in young,
developing nations such as Zimbabwe, the flaws in the weekend's
balloting were more troubling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the international community is going to
recognize this, because of the low turnout and because of the
absence of observers,'' he said. ``And all these little incidents
do is add to the general perception that the vote has not been well
run.''

`HOMICIDE' FILM OFFERS CLOSURE
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
(UNDATED) - Homicide: Life on the Street was one of those shows
that you could always count on six or seven people get ting
together to watch.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not six or seven in a living room. Six or seven in the whole
country.
</P>
<P>
   OK, that's a bit of an exaggera tion, but Homicide's anemic rat
ings never kept up with its stellar reputation. Perhaps no show in
television history was so praised by so many critics and seen by so
few viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Time for one more chance.
</P>
<P>
   For longtime fans of the show, Homicide: The Movie serves as a
welcome treat, as well as a satis fying conclusion to the late, la
mented series.
</P>
<P>
   For those of us who didn't catch on the first time around, it's
not that simple. Instead, the NBC movie, which reunites all the
major cast members _ yes, the ``dead'' ones, too _ is a two-hour
tease, a reminder of what we should have been watching all those
years and now have to do without.
</P>
<P>
   The series, created by Tom Fontana and Barry Levinson, hung on
by a thread every year, its future clouded in doubt, until the end
of the 1998-99 season, when NBC axed it. Fans were crushed. All
those loose ends, still untied. All those fans, unsa tisfied. There
may not have been many of them, but they were vo cal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The show seems to have a life beyond any of our control,'' Fon
tana told TV critics in California recently.
</P>
<P>
   NBC talked with Fontana about making a movie, but he was in
different to the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was at that point . . . emo tionally trying to let go of the
show,'' Fontana said. ``And I made the what-I-thought impossi ble
statement of, `Well, if you get all of the actors back, I'll do
it.' And little did I know they would actually accomplish that.''
</P>
<P>
   Now all he needed was a dra matic reason to bring them all back.
Thus, Lt. Al Giardello, now a front-running mayoral candi date, is
gunned down at a rally. While Giardello fights for his life in the
hospital, the squad reunites to find the shooter.
</P>
<P>
   As eager as the fictional cops were to work together again, the
actors were, as well, making the reunion sound like a real-life ver
sion of the end of Mr. Holland's Opus.
</P>
<P>
   ``With everybody that was per forming, it was like watching . .
. the Homicide hall of fame,'' said Callie Thorne, who returns as
De tective Laura Ballard.
</P>
<P>
   That's how it plays for viewers as well. This is not always a
good thing. Too often, if you're famil iar with the show, you know
what's coming next.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, when Frank Pem bleton (the always intense Andre
Braugher) returns, you know it's only a matter of minutes till he's
back in the ``box,'' conducting an interrogation the way Leonard
Bernstein conducted an orches tra.
</P>
<P>
   Predictable as it may be, how ever, Braugher still nails his
character. And there are a couple of legitimate surprises. Plus, a
few of those nagging loose ends are finally tied up.
</P>
<P>
   Fontana says this is likely the last we'll see of the Homicide
crew.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has turned out to be . . . a remarkable closure for us, and
a remarkable celebration for us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's swell for them. As for the rest of us? We cannot in good
conscience complain about what might have been. It was. We just
missed it, and have only our selves to blame. &QL;

VIETNAM BAT TLE LINES STILL DRAWN IN AMERICAN MINDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JON KAMMAN 
 AND KATHLEEN INGLEY  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
(PHOENIX) - It was the most patriotic of times or it was the most
seditious of times.
</P>
<P>
   Three decades after the Vietnam War, that battle line still is
etched in the American psyche.
</P>
<P>
   The painful memories are rushing back with the revelation that
Scottsdale activist Gary Tredway actually is Howard Mechanic, a
fugitive from a 1970 conviction for his part in the war-and-peace
tumult.
</P>
<P>
   His crime was to lob a jumbo firecracker by slingshot at police
and firefighters after someone set fire to the ROTC building at
Washington University in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   No one was hurt, but under a new federal get-tough policy, he
was sentenced to five years in prison. He ran away.
</P>
<P>
   Among Phoenix area residents with the Vietnam War era seared
into their memory, sentiments are divided over what should be done
with Mechanic. They range from forgive-and-forget to one Phoenix
veteran's harsh judgment, ``Shoot the SOB.''
</P>
<P>
   A Scottsdale war widow says a five-year term is a cheap price
for Mechanic to pay, compared with the death of her Marine husband.
</P>
<P>
   OPINIONS SHIFT &QL; 
But over time, opinions about what was right and wrong about those
turbulent times have shifted, sometimes 180 degrees. A disabled
veteran takes the surprising view that Mechanic should do mostly
community service. And a peace activist of the time doesn't rule
out prison.
</P>
<P>
   When U.S. Marines first went to Vietnam to fight Communist
forces in 1965, no one imagined that more than 3.4 million U.S.
troops would serve in Southeast Asia over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   As the cost rose in dollars and lives _ in the end, 58,000
Americans had died and 153,000 were seriously wounded _ opponents
of the war took to the streets in protest.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the demonstrations were peaceful, but some turned
violent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never did anything illegal, but I witnessed a lot of mayhem
myself,'' recalled Phoenix resident Bridget Carroll, who lived in
Washington, D.C., at the time. ``A favorite target then was turning
over ice cream trucks. I don't know why.''
</P>
<P>
   She was tear-gassed, ``an extremely unpleasant experience,'' as
police tried to break up a demonstration blocking traffic. FAMILY
BEARS SCARS &QL; 
Carroll, 51, remembers how her opposition to the war was confirmed
when her father, who fought in World War II, told her, ``The war is
wrong. Too many young men your age are dying for no reason, and
this has to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   The family still bears the scars of Vietnam, a cousin so
traumatized by guard duty in Vietnam that he hasn't left the house
since coming home in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll says Mechanic must accept the consequences of his action
now. In her own view, though, he sentenced himself to a 30-year
break in his life, and that's enough.
</P>
<P>
   Mechanic lobbed his firecracker in protests over a tragedy that
shook the country: National Guardsmen had opened fire on unarmed
youths at Kent State University in Ohio, killing four and wounding
nine.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have no idea what a horrible injustice that was,'' said
Renz Jennings, who has been active in Arizona politics for decades
and recently served on the Corporation Commission. ``I was just
outraged.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a time when critics of the war were branded as
unpatriotic and worse.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings, now 58, was the youngest member of the Arizona
Legislature in 1968-69 and the only open opponent of the Vietnam
War. One day, red, white and blue armbands were handed out to
legislators. Jennings wore his, but put a black mark of protest on
it.
</P>
<P>
   A colleague called him a traitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe if you think your country is making a mistake, it's
patriotic to say so,'' Jennings said.
</P>
<P>
   `HYSTERIA' DURING PERIOD &QL; 
As for Mechanic, whom he knows personally from serving together on
the Clean Elections Institute board, Jennings says there have to be
consequences. But he considers the original five-year sentence too
harsh.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a hysteria during that period,'' Jennings said,
``and the establishment was going to make people pay, and pay
dearly.''
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix insurance agent Kevin O'Keeffe, 54, agrees that the
sentence is too tough. At this point, he says, community service
makes more sense.
</P>
<P>
   That's not what he would have said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a firm believer in the government, that we should be
there,'' said O'Keeffe, who graduated from Marquette University in
Milwaukee in 1968. ``To be honest with you, I didn't know that
much.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the war receded into history, his perspective changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost my cousin and a lot of friends,'' he said. ``What a
waste.''
</P>
<P>
   The demonstration that led to the Kent State tragedy was sparked
by President Richard Nixon's ordering a military incursion into
Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters took to the streets, as they had before by the
hundreds of thousands, to attack this escalation of a war that had
raged for five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were very passionate times,'' recalled John Kromko, 60,
a front-line activist in the anti-war movement at the University of
Arizona who later served in the state House of Representatives as a
Democrat from Tucson. ``People on both sides overreacted.''
</P>
<P>
   `THEY HATED US' &QL; 
Kromko said he was nearly shot in a student takeover of UA's
historic Old Main, where the Reserve Officer Training Corps program
had its headquarters. He was jailed briefly for inciting to riot.
</P>
<P>
   ``They hated us,'' he said of the war's supporters, and the
effort to suppress dissent made sentences as harsh as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Kromko said he can't second-guess Mechanic's conviction or
whether he should serve at least some time behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of this probably should just be forgotten about,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot that people can't forget.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam veterans still feel the scalding surprise of coming home
to scorn instead of thanks for their service.
</P>
<P>
   A Mesa woman made the mistake of wearing her Navy uniform when
she returned on leave to southern Illinois. She was pelted with
eggs and tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   HECKLED ON FLIGHT &QL; 
Chandler resident Lou Ortiz, retired after 28 years in the Air
Force, remembers flying home to New York after his 1967-68 tour in
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   He got on the plane in San Francisco, dressed in uniform with
all his ribbons.
</P>
<P>
   His two seatmates starting heckling him with comments about baby
killers. Ortiz replied that he just wanted to sleep and closed his
eyes. Their voices dropped to mumbles, but he couldn't shut out the
sarcasm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in the military,'' said Ortiz, 71, who won a bronze
star, the Army's medal for heroism or meritorious service. ``I was
following my orders, and that was it.''
</P>
<P>
   He takes a straightforward view on Mechanic: Make the fugitive
serve the full sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Like many, then and now, Ortiz thinks citizens and politicians
torpedoed the military strategy for the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why it was lost,'' Ortiz said.
</P>
<P>
   Other veterans have changed their views on the protest era.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of us were torn over that Vietnam crucible,'' said
Patrick Young, who as a Navy corpsman serving with the Marines
nearly lost his legs to a land mine in Vietnam in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Now 52 and retired to a remote area north of Sun City, Young
underwent 18 operations to save his legs and worked 27 years with
the Disabled American Veterans as an advocate helping other
veterans pursue disability claims.
</P>
<P>
   Is he bitter about the protests of the 1960s and '70s?
</P>
<P>
   ``Years ago, I would have been very negative,'' Young said.
``But in maturing over 30 years, I've realized that many of the
veterans who joined in the protests when they came home helped
bring the war to a close.''
</P>
<P>
   Mechanic, he said, ``deserves some punishment.'' But Young would
change the sentence to a minimum of six months in jail and 4{ years
of community service, perhaps helping veterans groups.
</P>
<P>
   In setting punishment, Kromko said, ``the absolutely key thing
is that anti-war protesters were right.''
</P>
<P>
   MANY `MISGUIDED' &QL; 
Not necessarily, said Brian Wardell, who has focused on covert
actions in Vietnam for his master's program in history at Arizona
State University.
</P>
<P>
   ``My personal opinion is that many of the protesters were
misguided,'' he said, although he understands the outpouring of
protest about the Cambodian invasion and Kent State, which occurred
when he was 12.
</P>
<P>
   Lam Bui of Tempe, who was drafted into the Vietnamese army in
1971, views the demonstrations as having prolonged the war.
</P>
<P>
   `If we didn't have those people (demonstrating), the war might
have lasted maybe three years, or maybe 100 days like the Gulf
War,'' he said. ``I'm sure the U.S. soldiers who got hurt were
hurting even more to see people like Jane Fonda in Hanoi.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, in the Mechanic case, ``five years is too long,'' Bui
said. ``My heart is changed now. I've been living here for 25
years, and I don't have any hatred anymore. It's over.'' &QL;

1970 conviction for his part in violent protests. &QL;

(PHOENIX) - For the third consecutive winter, fewer snowbirds are
flocking to the Phoenix area.
<TEXT>
<P>
   East Phoenix businesses that rely on winter visitors are re
porting a 25 percent downturn in sales.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix recreational-vehicle park owners say it's the calm
between two eras.
</P>
<P>
   The World War II generation pushed the retirement industry into
overdrive the past two decades. But illness and death are depleting
their ranks, and the number of occupied spaces in RV resorts is
down.
</P>
<P>
   But next year, the first wave of baby boomers turn 55, which
makes them eligible for age-re stricted retirement parks.
</P>
<P>
   Besides demographic changes, the most commonly cited factors in
the decline are worsening traffic and air, higher prices, the
disappearing desert, lower Canadian exchange rates, Canadian public
health-insurance limits.
</P>
<P>
   Managers of some of the most popular parks in the Phoenix area
say this is the first winter in years that they weren't filled in
January. They also have fewer confirmed reservations for next year.
Record numbers of homes are for sale in some places.

DIGITAL COMMERCE   COLUMN: WHAT IF A WEB NETWORK REFUSED TO PASS
DATA? 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By DENISE CARUSO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week's Web site attacks were a vivid reminder that
technology's sword of individual empowerment has a wicked double
edge. But the term for the attack technique _ denial of service _
has the potential to assume an equally ominous meaning as
telecommunications giants continue to merge their large holdings.
</P>
<P>
   As we know, the Internet is a network of networks. In the
beginning of its commercial ascendancy in 1995, this meant that the
largest of the Internet service companies _ known as backbone
providers _ had to interconnect with their competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Using the network access points, or NAPs, that were formerly
financed by the federal government, they built businesses
delivering data among networks. And in the early days, not much
more than a handshake between backbone engineers was needed to
ensure that these companies would pass along one another's data,
all for the greater good (and growth) of the market.
</P>
<P>
   This ``you scratch mine, I'll scratch yours'' arrangement is
known as peering.
</P>
<P>
   ``The assumption in the old days was always, `I'm going to send
you as much data as you send me,''' says David Farber, one of the
scientists who helped build the original Arpanet _ the Internet
progenitor _ and who is now the chief technologist at the Federal
Communications Commission.
</P>
<P>
   And when the two main NAPs became impossibly clogged with
traffic, the busiest Internet service providers, or ISPs, formed
private peering arrangements to interconnect and exchange data
directly with one another.
</P>
<P>
   The global Internet is still defined by the exchange of data
between networks. But today, in place of back-scratchy handshakes
are book-size contracts drawn up by phalanxes of corporate lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The backbone provider with by far the largest number of physical
connections is UUNET, now owned by MCI Worldcom, which is on its
way to becoming Worldcom Sprint. In rough descending order, UUNET
is followed by Sprint; Cable and Wireless USA, which acquired MCI
Internet as a result of the 1998 MCI-Worldcom merger; GTE
Internetworking (after its acquisition of BBN Planet in 1997); and,
depending on whom you ask, either PSI Net or AT&AMP;T Network Services.
</P>
<P>
   According to prevailing wisdom, a peer is a backbone service
provider that agrees to exchange roughly equivalent amounts of data
with another provider without requiring that money change hands.
</P>
<P>
   But how exactly does one become a peer? Under what circumstances
is a peer a paying customer, and vice versa? Who decides, and how?
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no rules for peering,'' says Fred Goldstein, a
network and information technology consultant with Arthur D. Little
in Cambridge, Mass. ``No one knows what the currency is. It's more
a matter of, `I'll see who blinks first.'''
</P>
<P>
   One might consider this to be an overly loose arrangement upon
which to base the New Global Economy.
</P>
<P>
   In the early days of the Internet, self-interest forced backbone
providers into peering. Back then, as Farber says, ``without the
exchange points, nobody would have any traffic.''
</P>
<P>
   But that is scarcely true today. It may be even less true
tomorrow: upon completion of the Worldcom-Sprint merger, a single
company would control nearly half of the Internet's backbone _
making it, literally and figuratively, without peer.
</P>
<P>
   Given the furious pace and high stakes of the telecommunications
industry today, some fear that it is only a matter of time before
one big backbone provider or another refuses to exchange data
traffic with one of its peers.
</P>
<P>
   What happens then?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, they would have a legitimate excuse,'' says Hal Varian,
dean of the school of information management at the University of
California at Berkeley. ``An ISP could complain, and rightly so,
that another ISP was sending them huge amounts of traffic and
putting a load on their system.''
</P>
<P>
   But then, Varian says, they could also decrease the capacity of
``their side of the network so their own traffic is getting
swamped.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an excuse to say, `We can't handle this guy's packets;
we aren't going to connect with him,''' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, says Varian, is that there is no way to prove who
is zooming whom and no way to resolve such disputes outside the
courtroom. And remarkably, there is no rule that requires peers to
provide this most basic function of the Internet: what he calls
``fair, open and nondiscriminatory'' interconnection.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, says John Nakahata, a partner with the law firm Harris
Wiltshire &AMP; Grannis in Washington, the kinds of tactics Varian
describes are what led to requirements for interconnections and
rate regulations in the telephone world of yore.
</P>
<P>
   Nakahata is the former chief of staff for the FCC chairman,
William E. Kennard, and was the senior legal adviser to Kennard's
predecessor, Reed E. Hundt. Nakahata now represents one of the
smaller backbone providers living in the shadow of the proposed
Worldcom-Sprint merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is growing tremendously quickly, thus competition
is very fragile,'' he says. ``If a company can start diverting
growth through these different tactics, then it becomes a
self-perpetuating cycle.''
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to fear the worst, for example, when one sees from
public filings that Sprint's original merger application to the FCC
did not include a mention of its Internet backbone business.
Because the FCC would not accept the application without that
information, Sprint has since amended and resubmitted it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had already stated to Justice we'd be willing to do a
divestiture if necessary,'' says J. Richard Devlin, Sprint's
general counsel, explaining the omission. The company is now in
premerger discussions with the Justice Department about peering and
other Internet-related issues, ``helping them understand the
market,'' Devlin said.

   Despite the unsettled state of affairs, backbone regulation is
not yet on the table for discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``My general attitude toward regulation is that you let things
go until they require adult supervision,'' says Farber of the FCC.
``In Japanese, the idea translates to `the sacred sword of last
resort.' That's exactly it; that's its proper place.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Farber says, ``If you can't get companies to
behave in their own self-interest _ and it is good self-interest to
have a vibrant, growing Internet; none of these companies would
exist if there wasn't one _ then this sacred sword can be used if
necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Growth in the Internet economy depends on robust competition.
That is a fact that many companies, particularly network companies,
which live and die by scale, conveniently seem to forget after
their urge to merge creates a behemoth or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``The natural structure in this industry is for there to be only
a few backbone providers,'' Varian says. ``The challenge is to see
that there are more than one.''

(PHOENIX) - Howard Mechanic, who helped form a radical anti-war
group at Washington University and picketed the 1968 Democratic
National Convention in Chicago, was a brilliant student with a
scholarship to law school when a single act of violence set him on
a 28-year run from the law.
</P>
<P>
   His conviction for lobbing a giant firecracker at firefighters
in a Vietnam War protest May 5, 1970, a day after the Kent State
killings, caught up with him over five days last week. His
carefully reconstructed life unraveled when anti-growth Scottsdale
City Council candidate Gary Tredway was exposed as Howard Mechanic,
51-year-old fugitive. On Friday, Feb. 11, he began serving his
long-delayed, five-year sentence.
</P>
<P>
   His identical twin brother, Harvey, said he wishes his brother,
younger by eight minutes, would have served his sentence and gone
on with life.
</P>
<P>
   ``He probably would have been out in a year or two,'' said
Harvey Mechanic, now a Los Angeles lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Howard ran.
</P>
<P>
   A rising tide of anti-war sentiment flooded across the nation to
middle American campuses in the late '60s, and the Mechanic twins
were right in the middle of it.
</P>
<P>
   While Harvey joined students occupying the Columbia
administration building in 1968, Howard connected with about 20
radicals to form the Washington University Liberation Front in the
fall of 1969.
</P>
<P>
   WULF's efforts to stop the war were focused on driving the
Reserve Officer Training Corp off campus, said Robert Zeffert, 57,
a St. Louis consultant who joined Mechanic in the anti-war group.
</P>
<P>
   The group met a few times a week, hunkering down in apartments
and campus hangouts to plan anti-ROTC demonstrations and prepare
thousands of mimeographed leaflets for its marches, Zeffert said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was our sole extracurricular activity, and we thought we
were going to change the world,'' he said. &QL; 
TURBULENT TIMES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Described by those who know him as brilliant, committed to his
ideals and a loner, Howard Mechanic's long, strange trip from his
wealthy suburban Cleveland hometown of Shaker Heights, Ohio, to
Scottsdale is a reminder of the turbulent times from which he
emerged.
</P>
<P>
   Shaker Heights, known for cultural and religious diversity, is
roughly akin, physically, to Phoenix's Biltmore neighborhood. It
was in this middle-class setting that Cleveland natives Ralph and
Rose, who died several years ago, raised Harvey and Howard and
their sister, Marilyn.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Mechanic, 81, was too busy raising a family for political
activism, Harvey said. Now living in suburban Beachwood, Ohio, the
World War II veteran was an appliance repairman who fixed stoves by
day and brought TV sets home at night to repair. His father owned
one of the first motorcycle dealerships in Cleveland. Ralph
invested in apartments and became a landlord, an enterprise that
son Howard would later be successful at in Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Mechanic also would later befriend Jack Berger, a
Scottsdale man he knew for 18 years who fixed the TVs at Mechanic's
12-unit apartment complex.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up, the Mechanic twins played touch football and
playground basketball at the school across from their home. Both
were gifted students and National Merit Scholar finalists in 1966,
their senior year at Shaker Heights High School. Howard earned a
scholarship to Washington University in St. Louis. Harvey attended
Columbia University in New York. &QL; 
CLASSMATES WENT TO WAR &QL; 
Some of their classmates were shipped off to Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey Mechanic remembers that he and his brother drew a number
of about 360 in the draft lottery, which was based on birthdates,
so they were unlikely to ever serve in the military.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey doesn't recall strong political disagreements at home, as
there were in many families at the time, but Ralph objected to
Howard's long hair and clothes, his brother said.
</P>
<P>
   The older twin said he and his brother didn't smoke or drink in
high school, but like many of their era, smoked marijuana in
college. Both were politically active on campus.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1968, Howard and Harvey joined thousands of war
protesters at the 1968 Democratic National Convention. Through
clouds of tear gas, as police flailed away with nightsticks,
protesters chanted, ``The whole world is watching! The whole world
is watching!'' in the first riot televised live. &QL; 
HOTBED OF ACTIVITY &QL; 
Washington University, with 8,000 students, became a hotbed of
political activity and legitimate protest turned violent.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters smashed windows at the main library. In February
1970, students burned down the Army ROTC building. A St. Louis
judge ordered Mechanic and other activists to stay away from the
ROTC program.
</P>
<P>
   The night of May 5, 1970, was perhaps the most violent. A day
after four unarmed students were killed by Ohio National Guardsman
at Kent State University, Howard Mechanic and hun dreds of
protesters converged on the Air Force ROTC building, which was set
ablaze.
</P>
<P>
   Mechanic was never accused in the fire, but a witness said he
used a slingshot to lob two cherry bombs, one of which exploded
near an officer standing guard.
</P>
<P>
   He has always denied throwing the firecracker, his brother said.
</P>
<P>
   Mechanic and four others were arrested. He was convicted under a
strict 1968 anti-rioting law that prohibited obstructing
authorities during civil unrest.
</P>
<P>
   Mechanic was convicted Oct. 19, 1970, and sentenced to five
years in prison. On May 22, 1972, that conviction was upheld in a
federal appellate court.
</P>
<P>
   Mechanic disappeared and a warrant was issued.
</P>
<P>
   WULF members thought Mechanic was unfairly punished. However,
``people were sort of irritated that he skipped bail,'' Zeffert
said.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Kogan, who also was convicted, served about 18 months,
according to Zeffert.
</P>
<P>
   Within months after Mechanic fled St. Louis, a man named Gary
Tredway was born in the Valley of the Sun.
</P>
<P>
   He quickly gravitated to the Gentle Strength Cooperative, a
Tempe hangout for hippies, vegetarians and other counterculture
figures. He also founded Pure Planet Products, a mail-order company
that sells health items.
</P>
<P>
   Tredway pursued other business ventures, including a used-auto
dealership in the early 1980s. About 13 years ago, he bought the
Abode Resort Apartment Hotel of Scottsdale, a residential complex
not far from Scottsdale Fashion Square, for $420,000. It became his
home, as well as a source of income.
</P>
<P>
   Tredway married Ingrid Gold, a nurse midwife, in 1980, and they
divorced in 1984, according to her father, Ray Gold.
</P>
<P>
   The couple's son, Ari, a 19-year-old freshman at St. John's
College in Sante Fe, would not say whether he knew of his father's
past.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and acquaintances say Tredway was an introvert. When
girlfriend Janet Grossman was asked to describe Tredway's
personality, she shrugged and said, ``He's not very outgoing.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the way Tredway and Grossman met five years ago reflects
the social shyness. As she puts it: ``I answered his personal ad in
New Times looking for a left-thinking, non-smoking vegetarian.'' &QL; 
DEDICATION TO CAUSES &QL; 
Despite his reclusive nature, however, one thing goaded Tredway
into public exposure: a dedication to social and political causes.
He became an officer at Gentle Strength, a co-founder of the Clean
Elections Institute and a treasurer at Arizona for Clean Elections.
</P>
<P>
   His big blast in local politics was aimed at cleaning up
elections. He also wrote letters to the editor against government
waste, environmental degradation, urban sprawl and the use of taxes
to subsidize private business.
</P>
<P>
   Tredway first appeared as a Maricopa County property owner in
1983, when he and Ingrid Gold bought a house on East Whitton Street
in Phoenix, for $81,500. The following year, Tredway signed his
interest in the property over to Gold.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1984, Tredway opened a business he called Recycled Auto,
in an industrial section of south Phoenix on Buckeye Road. In a
handwritten entry on a Maricopa County business record, he said the
business dealt in ```used cars, parts, wrecker.'' A year later,
Tredway changed the name of the business to Prime Motor Co.
</P>
<P>
   Tredway also began buying and selling real estate. He seemed to
prefer such unglamorous areas as Sunnyslope and south Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, he turned a hefty profit on a Sunnyslope hilltop
property. He bought it in March for $117,000 and sold it in August
for $250,000 cash.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Johnson, an attorney who assisted Tredway with that
transaction, said ``he struck me as a hippie,'' who paid little
attention to his dress or his appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who said he has not seen Mechanic in about 10 years,
remembered Mechanic as a man who kept to himself and kept the
conversation strictly on business.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Mechanic's acquaintances say they knew him by his social
consciousness rather than his personality or history.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Brittle, who shared environmental causes with Tredway for
seven years, said he always wondered why he never smiled. Asked
whether he knows Tredway, Brittle shrugged and said, ``Does
anyone?''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Bolef, 79, a retired Washington University physics
professor, remembered that the young man he knew as Mechanic
vanished after the fire at the ROTC building. But he was stunned to
learn that Mechanic had been convicted in the case, fled
prosecution and created a new life in Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know is that he disappeared,'' Bolef said. ``And now
that he's surfaced again, under circumstances which ruined his
life, all I can do is weep for him.'' &QL;

THE PERSONALITY ISSUES THAT CLOUD THE GRIFFEY TRADE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even at 30 years old, Ken Griffey Jr. still has a smile fit for
a prom king, broad and beaming. He donned the billed crown of the
Cincinnati Reds the other day and grinned, and it was all
feel-good: Hometown kid eschews the biggest dollars to sign with
his hometown team.
</P>
<P>
   It's more complicated than that. Jim Bowden, the Reds general
manager, skillfully negotiated a staggeringly one-sided deal for
one of the greatest players in history, someone with the physical
power to eclipse Henry Aaron's career home run record, someone with
the box office appeal to convert the Cincinnati Reds from a
small-market team to a big-revenue club after they move into their
new ballpark in two years.
</P>
<P>
   But Bowden has adopted a future covered with personality land
mines. It may be that he can muster more savvy and avoid the
problems, and in a decade, Griffey's place in the record books will
be secure and the Reds may be one of the game's best franchises. Or
the potential trouble Bowden has courted may one day erode the
Reds' stability. Griffey is already bigger than the Cincinnati
organization, and there is a price to be paid for that. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As Griffey Jr. beamed, Griffey Sr. stood to the side and teased
him. The widely accepted perception is that sometime soon, Senior
will replace Jack McKeon as the manager _ maybe this season, if the
Reds don't play well, or maybe next season. And the feel-good stuff
will be jeopardized by human nature and disposition.
</P>
<P>
   Cal Ripken Sr. was the manager of the Orioles at the outset of
the 1988 season. His son, Cal Ripken Jr., was the team's best
player, a star who had not missed a game in almost six years.
Another of his boys, Bill Ripken, was the second baseman. But after
Baltimore lost its first six games to start that year _ the start
of a record 21-game losing streak _ Ripken Sr. was fired and
replaced by Frank Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball had always been a strong root in their relationship
with their father, and quite naturally, the Ripken brothers were
furious, feeling as if Cal Senior had been made a scapegoat after
the team had been built with too little talent. Bill Ripken
immediately changed his uniform number to 7, that of his father.
Cal Ripken had little to say publicly at the time, but in a book
published several years ago, he acknowledged in careful Cal-speak
that he was pretty angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know is that I felt deeply for my father,'' Ripken
wrote, in his book ``The Only Way I Know.'' ``I couldn't imagine
how painful this must have been for him, who had been so loyal to
the franchise for 31 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew the organization had been changing subtly, but now all
of a sudden I didn't recognize it at all. That firing _ not the
firing itself, but the way it happened _ made it clear to me that
this organization wasn't the Orioles anymore, not as I'd known
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the subsequent Baltimore managers, coaches baseball
officials have come to believe that the firing of Cal Ripken's
father was a defining moment in the player's relationship with the
Orioles. Since then, he has maintained a distance from the
organization, not overtly fighting the club's decisions but never
truly embracing them, either, and the resulting tension was never
settled.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Ripken's work ethic and dedication to baseball was
unquestioned, his celebrity powerful, particularly in Baltimore.
The Orioles have had a disparate clubhouse for years, and many
smart baseball men who have worked on the Baltimore staff believe
that it stems, in part, from Ripken's own distrust of the
organization.
</P>
<P>
   So Griffey goes to the Reds as the game's biggest star, bigger
than the team, a bigger star now than Ripken was in 1988. Griffey
also is extremely sensitive and record-setting holder of grudges.
</P>
<P>
   He would never play for the Yankees, he once indicated, because
when he was a kid, some of George Steinbrenner's coaches told him
to leave the clubhouse. The Mariners paid him a huge salary, openly
credited him with saving baseball in Seattle, offered him a
contract of nearly $150 million to keep him with the team forever _
and Griffey somehow reached the conclusion the team did not want
him.
</P>
<P>
   Given these dynamics of personality, what happens when the Reds
want to replace McKeon? If Griffey Sr. isn't the leading candidate
to step in, he really has to be now, doesn't he _ lest the Reds
anger Griffey Jr. And assuming that change is made, what will the
other Reds think? Will they believe their center fielder runs the
team? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The consensus is that Griffey Sr. has worked hard to put himself
in position to manage, and he might be terrific. But what if he
isn't? What if he inevitably follows the path of just about every
baseball manager and the Reds decide to fire him? What happens
then?
</P>
<P>
   Suppose they want to make a change in four years, or five, when
Griffey Jr. might draw to within 100 homers of Aaron? Can they risk
alienating a star who will become a national hero? Will Griffey Jr.
react negatively _ as he has repeatedly _ and in a matter involving
his father, wouldn't that be understandable? Would he ask the Reds
to trade him, in the same way he forced his way out of Seattle?
</P>
<P>
   The time for such speculation has passed for the Reds and
Bowden, who have embarked on a path that will require success.
Anything less will be a mess. &QL;

elections. He also wrote letters to the editor against government
waste, environmental degradation, urban sprawl and the use of taxes
to subsidize private business.
</P>
<P>
   Tredway first appeared as a Maricopa County property owner in
1983, when he and Ingrid Gold bought a house on East Whitton Street
in Phoenix, for $81,500. The following year, Tredway signed his
interest in the property over to Gold.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1984, Tredway opened a business he called Recycled Auto,
in an industrial section of south Phoenix on Buckeye Road. In a
handwritten entry on a Maricopa County business record, he said the
business dealt in ```used cars, parts, wrecker.'' A year later,
Tredway changed the name of the business to Prime Motor Co.
</P>
<P>
   Tredway also began buying and selling real estate. He seemed to
prefer such unglamorous areas as Sunnyslope and south Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, he turned a hefty profit on a Sunnyslope hilltop
property. He bought it in March for $117,000 and sold it in August
for $250,000 cash.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Johnson, an attorney who assisted Tredway with that
transaction, said ``he struck me as a hippie,'' who paid little
attention to his dress or his appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who said he has not seen Mechanic in about 10 years,
remembered Mechanic as a man who kept to himself and kept the
conversation strictly on business.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Mechanic's acquaintances say they knew him by his social
consciousness rather than his personality or history.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Brittle, who shared environmental causes with Tredway for
seven years, said he always wondered why he never smiled. Asked
whether he knows Tredway, Brittle shrugged and said, ``Does
anyone?''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Bolef, 79, a retired Washington University physics
professor, remembered that the young man he knew as Mechanic
vanished after the fire at the ROTC building. But he was stunned to
learn that Mechanic had been convicted in the case, fled
prosecution and created a new life in Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know is that he disappeared,'' Bolef said. ``And now
that he's surfaced again, under circumstances which ruined his
life, all I can do is weep for him.'' &QL;

ELECTRIC RAIL: $43 MILLION A MILE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY MARY JO PITZL  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
(PHOENIX) - The electric-rail line that Phoenix proposes to build
would cost nearly $43 million a mile.
</P>
<P>
   That's up 72 percent from a 1997 estimate of $25 million, the
last time Phoenix voters considered a transit tax.
</P>
<P>
   But it's still a bargain compared with the costs of building a
new inner-city highway. If the defunct Paradise Freeway were
resurrected, that central Phoenix span would cost nearly $74
million a mile, according to the Maricopa Association of
Governments.
</P>
<P>
   Backers of the March 14 Phoenix Transit 2000 election say the
high cost of new freeway construction is a key reason that it's
time for the nation's sixth-largest city to get serious about a
transit system.
</P>
<P>
   Yet at $42.9 million a mile, even the pro-transit crowd gulps.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 figure was a ``guesstimate,'' said Wulf Grote, project
manager for Valley Connections, a 3-year-old regional planning
group that supports creation of Valley commuter trains.
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenix segment is a key part of the project. If built, it
would enable other Valley cities to link their own rail lines.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the rail project for the urban area wasn't clearly
defined, so planners used estimates from other cities with rail
systems, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Today's price tag is the result of more-detailed studies, a few
years of inflation and, in some places, a different alignment,
Grote said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in 1997, it was assumed the rail project would use
the right of way of the Union Pacific Railroad between Tempe and
Phoenix. That's not an option now, because the railroad has
withdrawn its offer, Grote said.
</P>
<P>
   So the project would have to take the more expensive route of
running in the street. The double-track rail line would run in its
own lanes, separate from vehicle traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Street operation is pricier for several reasons, planners say.
Those include tying traffic sig nals into the rail operation, so
that trains could extend a green light as they approached an
intersection.
</P>
<P>
   Another expensive upgrade in the plan would involve the use of
low-floor rail vehicles, which make boarding easier for everyone,
including people with handicaps and parents with strollers. Earlier
projections had counted on high-floor trains, such as those used in
San Diego and Salt Lake City, Grote said.
</P>
<P>
   The train's general route has been sketched: From Chris-Town
Mall along Central Avenue to downtown Phoenix and then east past
Sky Harbor International Airport to the Tempe border.
</P>
<P>
   But only the Central Avenue segment, from Camelback Road to
either Jefferson or Washington streets, has been clearly defined.
Rails would run in the middle of Central, taking out two lanes of
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Planners are still toying with whether to run the rail on
Jefferson or Washington, or both. It hasn't been decided whether
the rail would run down the middle or at the side of those streets.
</P>
<P>
   West of Central, it's even less clear. The rail would generally
run along Camelback, from Central west to 19th Avenue, to a
terminal near Chris-Town Mall. But whether the rail would run in
those busy streets, or on another alignment, has not been
determined _ and won't be _ before the March 14 election.
</P>
<P>
   Planners are even talking about some sort of elevated structure
at busy intersections to speed the train and avoid conflicts with
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Although transit backers are quick to compare the costs with
those of freeways, it's not that easy.
</P>
<P>
   For example, 12 percent of the rail budget would be devoted to
the cost of park-and-ride lots, a maintenance yard and the
communications network that would link rail cars. For freeways,
these comparable items come from separate budgets and are not
calculated into the per-mile cost of road.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the freeway network's safety features, such as the
ongoing installation of cable barriers in the freeway medians,
aren't reflected in the Valleywide average cost of $34.6 million a
mile.
</P>
<P>
   Rail also includes some costs that aren't factored in with
freeways, including train cars, stations and the installation of
overhead wires.
</P>
<P>
   Although the current freeway network averages $34.6 million a
mile, it would cost more than that to build a new freeway through
the developed, heavily congested portions of central Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix planners point to the defunct Paradise as an example of
what a new urban freeway would cost.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1995, the Paradise was planned as an east-west freeway
slicing across the Valley near Camelback Road, from Glendale to the
Squaw Peak Freeway. It was dropped from freeway plans after an
unsuccessful election.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the Paradise was estimated to cost $54.3 million a
mile, more than twice the $25.3 million average for the rest of the
freeway network. That's because the freeway would have run through
developed neighborhoods and commercial areas, requiring expensive
land acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Factoring in the 36 percent rise in per-mile freeway costs over
the last five years, the Paradise today would cost $74 million per
mile to build. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
(MESA, Ariz.) - ViewPoint RV and Golf Resort in Mesa, one of the
Phoenix area's largest snowbird retreats, has room to grow by more
than a third _ adding 700 spaces.
</P>
<P>
   That is, if its owners can figure out what the coming wave of
baby-boom retirees want.
</P>
<P>
   Other park owners and real estate developers are wondering, too.
</P>
<P>
   What do retiring boomers want? Condos instead of block-long RVs?
Million-dollar rock-star-style tour buses with big-screen TVs and
megabuck stereo systems? Casitas with adjoining basketball,
volleyball and tennis courts?
</P>
<P>
   ``We are on the cusp of change,'' said Dan Austin of the Arizona
Winter Visitors Association, based in Apache Junction.
</P>
<P>
   If past trends continue, park owners stand to gain in future
decades from an avalanche of new people into their parks. On the
other hand, the boomers may not show up. They may all be flyfishing
in Wyoming or volunteering in South America.
</P>
<P>
   Next year will be the first season for baby-boom snowbirds,
those born between 1946-64. They begin turning 55, which is old
enough to live in the 55-and-over RV parks.
</P>
<P>
   There certainly is room for them. For the past two seasons, the
winter-visitor numbers were down. Visitors are coming later and
staying shorter. Most parks are operating at capacity this month,
but in past years they would have been fully occupied long before
this.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
ADD $1 BILLION TO ECONOMY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 320,000 Snowbirds normally pump $1 billion into
Arizona, according to Arizona State University's Center for
Business Research.
</P>
<P>
   Some migratory elders have switched from urban Arizona to the
rural parts of the state. Cheaper rent, real desert and small-town
life are winning out over the Phoenix area's high-priced traffic
jams and desert-eradication progress. Yuma, Lake Havasu, Casa
Grande are booming, and are cheap: A space that would cost $2,200
in the Phoenix area for the season is $1,700 in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   Many parks are 15 to 25 years old, and their residents have
grown older, too. Motorized chairs and oxygen tanks on wheels can
be found on the asphalt paths where bicycles and tennis shoes still
hold sway.
</P>
<P>
   MORE HOMES FOR SALE &QL; 
Last year, ViewPoint had 29 homes of former residents for sale.
This year they had 74.
</P>
<P>
   ``Illness, death or lack of travel mobility are the most common
reasons people give for selling,'' said Kerin MacWilliams, director
of business operations for ViewPoint.
</P>
<P>
   Mesa Regal RV Resort, the largest park in the Valley, had 94
units for sale this year, up sharply from previous years.
</P>
<P>
   Al Lynch of British Columbia, a winter resident of Mesa Regal RV
Resort, said many Canadians were missing this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm feeling a little lonely around here,'' the 69-year-old
said wryly. Every year, he and his wife, Pat, weigh the costs. This
year, health-insurance costs them $7 a day, and it will become more
expensive as they grow older.
</P>
<P>
   In eight years, the Lynch's annual park rent has increased to
$2,800, from $1,800. One of their neighbors was lured away by a
rural park that paid moving costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are missing,'' said Reta Blanchette of
Waverly, Minn., as she enjoyed an afternoon block party of longtime
friends. ``But the baby boomers are looking.''
</P>
<P>
   MOBILE BABY BOOMERS &QL; 
But just because boomers are reaching early retirement age doesn't
mean they are going to retire like their parents did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baby boomers are going to be mobile for a number of years,''
Austin predicted. ``They may want to come to the Valley for a
month, and then divide their time between such places as Yuma,
California and Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenda Goff, 53, of Marysville, Calif., is spending January and
February in Quarzsite and Yuma, traveling in her 45-foot tour bus.
She traveled in a caravan to Yuma last week with three friends. Her
husband still works, but joins her when he can.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many baby boomers have spent their lives in the cities earning
money, and now they want to get out in the country. But that
doesn't mean they want to rough it,'' Goff said. Her $300,000 tour
bus features leather coaches, real wood, lots of closets and two
televisions. ``It's our home on wheels,'' she said. The booming
stock market, more than Social Security, will pay the gas bills.
</P>
<P>
   CHECKING OUT THE PHOENIX AREA &QL; 
Several new retirees used the Apache Junction KOA camp ground as a
base last week while they checked out the Phoenix area &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fred Cash, 57, a retired fire chief from Elko, Nev., scanned the
newspaper classified ads looking for an apartment. His wife
Phyllis, 52, is a retired nurse. They have a Dalmation and a
turtle, who are also retiring. One of their objectives is to be
near their son who lives in the Phoenix area. And Phyllis' mother,
84, is traveling with them in their RV. Next year they may buy a
place, but still roam around.
</P>
<P>
   Also at the campground, Jean Guy Couture, 57, of Quebec, a
retired principal, and his 56-year-old wife, Tharcyle, were
spending six weeks on the road in a small van. That's all the time
they wanted to take this year because she is a substitute teacher.
Next year, they may extend their stay to three months. The future
is very much on their mind and they are trying to figure out what
to do. They want to ``see the color of the country, and not be tied
to one place,'' Couture said.
</P>
<P>
   They are disappointed by offerings geared to winter visitors
along their way. In Brownsville, Texas, they said everything for
retirees was built around gambling or shopping.
</P>
<P>
   INTERESTS SHIFTING &QL; 
ViewPoint's co-owner Cecil Ash, says the park is receiving more
requests for classes on foreign languages, financial management and
cooking.
</P>
<P>
   The interests of retirees seems to be shifting, he observed,
from pure recreation to productive activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Education in general is becoming a bigger thing that will
figure into these communities,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Physical fitness and sports are increasingly popular, and many
parks are ramping up those features. Golf and tennis continue to be
a major draw.
</P>
<P>
   It's very hard to get enough people for square dancing,
horseshoes and shuffleboard, park recreation managers say.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrity pop or rock stars from the past may fill an
entertainment gap. Last year, Ash brought in '60s singer Brenda
Lee, who was a big hit.
</P>
<P>
   Although more parks say they are planning more extravaganzas and
catered dinners, others says the casual style is not expected to
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Potlucks and paper-plate dinners will be still be around,''
said Bonnie Waite of Orangewood Shadows RV Resort in Mesa. ``People
want to take it easy.''
</P>
<P>
   MORE STAYING AROUND &QL; 
They might want to take it so easy, however, that they don't move
on at the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, more ViewPoint residents than usual _ about 300 of
the 1,700 units _ stayed on through the summer, with residents
asking for summer activities for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Adding new features to attract the younger crowd does not always
sit well with older residents. One community added a bigger gym and
ditched a car wash, which was a sore point with the old regulars.
</P>
<P>
   The newer crowd is different not only by age, but by background.
Traditional snowbirds have been from rural, small-town America.
Newer visitors are from offices in cities, with different
expectations and manners.
</P>
<P>
   Owners and managers will be listening for hints and whispers
about what new retirees will want. Changes in their expectations
could reshape Phoenix's economy. &QL;

RV park owners and managers are wondering how they can meet the
needs an interests of the coming baby boomers who become snowbird
age next year. &QL;

BUSH PLAN: AVOID ISSUE OF MCCAIN'S HOT TEMPER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY JEFF BARKER  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
 B
 Republic Washington Bureau 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
(CHARLESTON, S.C.) _ George W. Bush intends to depict John McCain
as unable to unite warring factions, but the Texas governor and his
advisers have decided to stop short of direct jabs at McCain's
occasionally volatile temper.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's temperament is an issue that Arizona Gov. Jane Hull,
among other Bush supporters, raised last year by telling the
national news media about stormy encounters with the Republican
Arizona senator. Still, Bush campaign aides say they'll shy away
leading up to next Saturday's South Carolina primary and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, according to campaign strategists, Bush plans to come
at the issue in another way, by suggesting that McCain contributes
to Washington's ``poisonous'' atmosphere and is incapable of
building consensus on major issues.
</P>
<P>
   When Karl Rove, a top Bush adviser, was asked by The Arizona
Republic recently whether the campaign planned to spotlight
McCain's temper in its increasingly aggressive ads, there was a
thoughtful pause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, I'm suggesting that this is about the absence of
something,'' Rove said. ``A successful leader is someone who
persuades. Some people who do that have rough edges on them, some
of them don't. I mean, (Texas Sen.) Phil Gramm is not necessarily
the most cuddly person in the world, and yet he was able to get
Gramm-Rudman (spending limits) through when he was in the House
because he had a vision that he articulated.''
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, McCain, chairman of the Senate Commerce
Committee, has failed to bring his colleagues together on major
bills, Rove said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be very careful about this,'' he said. ``Look, he
positions himself as someone who is outside of Washington. He's
been there for 17 years, long enough to become chairman of a
committee that he himself boasts regulates 85 percent of America's
business interests. And yet, if you examine the career, you can't
point to a major achievement, a legislative achievement where he
has been able to rally his colleagues, persuade them of the
correctness of his vision.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's highest-profile bills of the past few years ended in
defeat, and he has pledged to continue the fight in successive
sessions of Congress. Examples include his measures to ban
unregulated contributions to national political parties, or ``soft
money,'' and to boost tobacco prices to help fund anti-smoking
programs for kids.
</P>
<P>
   McCain campaign aides did not return repeated calls seeking
comment.
</P>
<P>
   A review of McCain's record shows that he won battles to
restrict the flight zones of noisy aircraft over the Grand Canyon,
brokered an agreement that led to a ratings system for TV programs,
and sponsored a successful compromise measure protecting businesses
from large liability due to Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   He has supported other causes, from pushing for an option of
ground troops during the Kosovo war, to fighting to end the
``earnings'' test restricting Social Security benefits of senior
citizens who remain in the workforce.
</P>
<P>
   Yet McCain is not popular among colleagues, often joking that he
will never win ``Miss Congeniality'' on Capitol Hill. His
relationship suffered with some senators whom he snubbed after he
believed he was treated unfairly during the ``Keating Five''
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   In the scandal, McCain was rebuked by the Senate Ethics
Committee for bad judgment for intervening with a federal agency in
behalf of Phoenix financier Charles H Keating Jr., a major campaign
donor.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain says his unpopularity stems from his campaign-finance
reform bill, which is opposed by Senate leadership, and his
persistent criticism of his colleagues' pork-barrel spending and
ties to special interests. McCain's presidential campaign is based
partly on lessening the influence of interest groups such as the
oil and gas lobbies.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign intends to make the case that McCain's
difficulties in getting along with fellow senators are a function
of his style of governing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an important question for voters to ask: Who would be
able to stop the partisan bickering in Washington, D.C.?'' Bush
spokeswoman Karen Hughes asked.
</P>
<P>
   Most senators have been avoiding talking publicly about McCain's
legislative style. &QL; 
 &QL; 
CHARLESTON, S.C. _ George W. Bush intends to depict John McCain as
unable to unite warring factions, but the Texas governor and his
advisers have decided to stop short of direct jabs at McCain's
occasionally volatile temper.

MECHANIC-PROFILE _ Howard Mechanic, who helped form a radical
anti-war group at Washington University and picketed the 1968
Democratic National Convention in Chicago, was a brilliant student
with a scholarship to law school when a single act of violence set
him on a 28-year run from the law. His conviction for lobbing a
giant firecracker at firefighters in a Vietnam War protest May 5,
1970, a day after the Kent State killings, caught up with him last
week. His reconstructed life unraveled when anti-growth Scottsdale
City Council candidate Gary Tredway was exposed as Howard Mechanic,
51-year-old fugitive. By PETER CORBETT. Story will move in the
``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MECHANIC-VIETNAM _ It was the most patriotic of times or it was the
most seditious of times. The painful memories are rushing back with
the revelation that Scottsdale activist Gary Tredway actually is
Howard Mechanic, a fugitive from a 1970 conviction. Story will move
in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MCCAIN _ As the Republican presidential primary in South Carolina
intensifies, George W. Bush intends to depict John McCain as unable
to unite warring factions. However, the Texas governor and his
advisers have decided to stop short of direct jabs at McCain's
occasionally volatile temper. By JEFF BARKER. Story will move in
the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
RAIL-PHOENIX _ Backers of the March 14 Phoenix Transit 2000
election say the high cost of new freeway construction is a key
reason that it's time for the nation's sixth-largest city to get
serious about a transit system. At a cost of nearly $43 million a
mile, rail is still a bargain compared with the costs of building a
new inner-city highway. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
SNOWBIRD _ For the third consecutive winter, fewer Snowbirds are
flocking to metro Phoenix. East Valley businesses that rely on
winter visitors are reporting a 25 percent downturn in sales.
Besides demographic changes, the most commonly cited factors in the
decline are worsening Valley traffic and air, higher prices, the
disappearing desert, lower Canadian exchange rates, and Canadian
public health-insurance restrictions. By MAUREEN WEST. Story will
move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
SNOW-MESA _ ViewPoint RV and Golf Resort in Mesa, one of the
Valley's largest snowbird retreats, has room to grow by more than a
third _ adding 700 spaces. That is, if its owners can figure out
what the coming wave of baby-boom retirees want. What do retiring
boomers want? Condos instead of block-long RVs? Casitas with
adjoining basketball, volleyball and tennis courts? Story will move
in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
TV-GOODY-HOMICIDE (Undated) - For longtime fans of the show,
Homicide: The Movie serves as a welcome treat, as well as a
satisfying conclusion to the late, lamented series. For those of us
who didn't catch on the first time around, it's not that simple.
Instead, the NBC movie, which reunites all the major cast members _
yes, the ``dead'' ones, too _ is a two-hour tease, a reminder of
what we should have been watching all those years and now have to
do without. By Bill Goodykoontz. Story will move in the ``E''
category. &QL;

INDIA MOURNS A MASTER PERCUSSIONIST 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By CELIA W. DUGGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOMBAY, India _ The mingled sound of splashes and shouts from
the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Olympic Pool drifted into the cool,
dark room when the park attendant, clad in black lycra bicycle
shorts, opened the padlocked doors, insisting that all who entered
must first take off their sandals as a sign of respect.
</P>
<P>
   Inside was the small, austere space where Alla Rakha Qureshi,
one of India's most venerated classical musicians, had come most
evenings for the last 15 years. Here, he taught his disciples the
mathematically complex rhythms of the tabla, the humble two-piece
drum that he had elevated to an exalted status in more than half a
century of playing the world's grandest concert halls, often with
the renowned sitar player Ravi Shankar.
</P>
<P>
   On this day, the curtains of this room perched on the Arabian
Sea were drawn and the maestro's voice was stilled.
</P>
<P>
   Alla Rakha, who was universally known by that name, usually
preceded by the honorific Ustad, which means teacher or guru, died
of a heart attack at age 80 on Feb. 3, just hours after his
50-year-old daughter, Razia, died suddenly and unexpectedly after
routine cataract surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``He couldn't bear it,'' said his son Fazal Qureshi, 38,
describing his father's reaction to the loss of the daughter who
had lived at home and tended to his needs, giving him medications,
taking his calls and accompanying him to concerts.
</P>
<P>
   Alla Rakha's students, who were at his side when he lapsed into
unconsciousness, immediately put away their instruments to honor
their guru. And his tabla-playing sons _ Fazal and Zakir Hussain,
who is considered one of the world's greatest living tabla players
_ canceled their performances to rush home.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, the front door to the large family apartment here
has been thrown open. Musicians, dancers, singers and painters have
poured in to console the twice bereft family and pay their respects
to the man they so often found lost in thought on his sofa,
counting out his calculations of drum beats.
</P>
<P>
   The mourners clustered cross-legged on the Persian carpets in
the living room and gathered before a garlanded photograph of Alla
Rakha playing his tabla and wearing a sweetly mischievous smile.
Curls of smoke wafted the subtle scent of burning incense through
the apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Sitara Devi, an aging dancer in the Kathak tradition of north
India, creaked as she rose from the floor. She recalled the early
days in the 1940s when Alla Rakha sang catchy tunes while she
danced in Hindi films, and later when he played the tabla as she
entertained rapturous throngs across India.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played very complicated rhythms,'' she said. ``I used to
say, `Sahib, please don't play difficult or I won't be able to
follow you!'''
</P>
<P>
   Alla Rakha's students have come each night, and among them was a
25-year-old tabla player from Minneapolis, Suphala Patnakar, who
talks in a flat Midwestern accent but wears her hair in long dark
ringlets down her back and dresses in an Indian-style white tunic
over matching pants.
</P>
<P>
   For several months each winter since she was 19, she has come to
Bombay to study at the feet of the great Alla Rakha. She described
sitting quietly with him in the mornings, waiting for him to recite
a rhythm for her to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you wanted to learn from Alla Rakha, you were expected to
be around for a while,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   More than any other musician, Alla Rakha brought the tabla to
international prominence during more than 20 years touring abroad
with Shankar, from the late 1950s until the 1970s. Together they
played at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967, the Woodstock festival
in 1969 and the concert for Bangladesh in Madison Square Garden in
1971.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a fabulous drummer,'' Shankar said. ``His speciality
was a very loving personality. He had such happiness in his
playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Alla Rakha was a purist, not a showman, in his performances.
Critics described his presence on stage as luminous, joyous and
revelatory.
</P>
<P>
   The magic in his playing grew out of his fluency in the grammar
of tabla, the verbal corollary of the drummed beats, and his
ability to translate spoken tabla into an improvisational, poetic
music.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a sense of commas, exclamations and full stops,''
said Raghava Menon, author of many books about Indian classical
music. ``He played with punctuation.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in his later years, when he had lost the physical strength
for grueling concert schedules and night after night of intricate,
energetic finger play, Alla Rakha and his sons gave performances at
Carnegie Hall and Symphony Space in New York, among other venues.
</P>
<P>
   His greatest musical contribution was in helping to lift the
tabla _ a centuries-old instrument that dates from the Mogul era _
from its second-class role as an accompanying instrument to that of
solo instrument.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 1950s tabla players were sometimes not even mentioned
on an album,'' said his celebrated 48-year-old son, Zakir Hussain,
who lives in San Francisco. ``The tabla player traveled by train
while other musicians flew. Now the tabla player is loved and
honored. He travels by airplane, business class or first class,
stays in fabulous hotels and is treated as a star.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as remarkable as Alla Rakha's worldly accomplishments was
his mystical commitment to the tabla _ and his success in imbuing a
generation of students with the same love of percussion, say his
students and children.
</P>
<P>
   Alla Rakha himself was the eldest among the seven sons of a
small farmer. He became entranced as a boy by the small drama
troupes that performed stories from the Hindu epics, the Ramayana
and the Mahabharata. He joined in, learning to drum, and when he
was just 14 apprenticed himself to a tabla guru in Lahore, said his
youngest son, Taufiq.
</P>
<P>
   His two daughters and three sons grew up in a home where their
father, absent much of the year on tour, literally spoke tabla at
the dinner table.
</P>
<P>
   The techniques of tabla playing have been handed down orally _
not in written musical notation form _ and the music is largely
improvisational, not composed. Alla Rakha, the guru, recited these
phrases of playing over dinner, and his sons would play after the
dishes were cleared.
</P>
<P>
   The family's life was filled with sound of the tabla.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he was on stage and started playing, for us it was like
God himself,'' said Taufiq, who now plays percussion on instruments
from Africa, Latin America and India. ``His eyes played the tabla.
His body played. Some beautiful expressions of pleasure, ecstasy
and serenity would come when he was playing.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Alla Rakha's elder daughter, Kurshid Aulia, said she had the
rhythm in her but her mother would not allow a daughter, who should
be learning to cook and clean, to become a musician. ``My
misfortune was that I was born of a different sex,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But the father became a guru to each of his sons, though only
after each of them convinced him that he had a sense of rhythm. His
two youngest sons spoke in awe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very difficult proposition, having a father who's
also your guru,'' Fazal said. ``The status of a teacher is higher
than a father. It's a very reverent relationship. You can refuse
your parents' word, but a guru guides you in every turn of your
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Alla Rakha was a demanding guru. His displeasure with faulty
playing was a fearsome thing, and his pleasure in good playing was
spontaneous and childlike.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never raised a hand, but he would show his anger and make
you play it again and again and again,'' said Taufiq, whose father
took him on as a student at age 12. ``His face would become very
strict, as if in disgust, as though he were thinking, `What are you
doing to my tabla, this priceless thing?' as though you had just
broken a crystal glass.''
</P>
<P>
   For Alla Rakha the tabla was like a religion and a mother
tongue. Fazal recalled that when his father would accept an award
or release a cassette, he would first speak a few words of Hindi.
But then he would switch to the language of the tabla, reciting the
phrases that his fleet, strong fingers tattooed on goatskin.

9-YEAR-OLD HOUND RETURNS FOR FINAL CHALLENGE AT WESTMINSTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It worked for Michael Jordan. Why not a triumphant
comeback for Ch. Tryst of Grandeur? The 9-year-old black Afghan
hound, who did not compete in 1997 and 1998, is back with a
vengeance at the 124th Westminster Kennel Dog Show.
</P>
<P>
   During her professional hiatus, Tryst, as the Afghan is known,
lived at the Mill Neck, N.Y., home of her owner, gave birth to two
litters and rested on her estimable reputation as the winningest
hound ever.
</P>
<P>
   But now she is back, a bit gray in the muzzle (and not hiding
it), bent on proving that she can win at Westminster, which runs
Monday and Tuesday at Madison Square Garden. Forty-three years ago,
a distant relative, Ch. Shirkhan of Grandeur, won best-in-show at
the venerable show.
</P>
<P>
   Tryst retired after finishing a disappointing third in the hound
group at the Westminster in 1997. Although praised by the judge as
``dramatic, exquisite and exotic,'' an upstart wire-haired
dachshund upset the field.
</P>
<P>
   Tryst's road from the canine Century Village began with her
entry, sort of a cameo, at last year's Westminster. The hound did
not win her breed, but her showing encouraged her owners, the
Rechler family, and her handler, Michael Canalizo, to mount a final
campaign to win best-in-show at Westminster.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got so much support from people who thought she looked so
good,'' said Canalizo, of Freeport, N.Y. ``We wrestled with the
decision to show her again for two months.'' Then, Tryst delivered,
as if she had never been away.
</P>
<P>
   In barely eight months, she racked up 25 best-in-shows,
defeating 42,866 dogs, including every last hound. She is the
ninth-ranked dog in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for an old girl with a son and daughter about to start
their own show careers. ``She's never shown better,'' Canalizo
said. ``People say she's better the second time around. She's the
Tina Turner of dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens at the show, Tryst, and Canalizo will retire
together.
</P>
<P>
   The Afghan's return is only one of the tales at the show, which
changed its rules to be certain that all 156 breeds recognized by
the American Kennel Club will be represented. Some years, a pawful
of breeds were omitted, leading aggrieved owners to wonder if the
club was finagling with the entries.
</P>
<P>
   So the show invited the top seeds _ the best five dogs in their
breed competitions in 1999 _ and received 603 acceptances. The
final field of 2,500 is led by 43 Golden Retrievers, 42 Rhodesian
Ridgebacks and 39 Poodles.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 92 best-of-breeds from last year's are returning. So are
three group winners: the Saluki Ch. Sundown Alabaster Treasure, the
German Ch. Windwalker's Yes Virginia and the Standard Poodle Ch.
Lakecove That's My Boy.
</P>
<P>
   The 3-and-a-half-year-old poodle, known as Treson, is the
nation's top-ranked dog and has won 169 best-in-shows in her
two-year show career. But being the top dog going is no guarantee
of leaving the Garden with the best-in-show rosette.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not confident at all,'' said his handler, Dennis McCoy,
who will retire, along with Treson and the groomer, Randy Garren,
after the show.
</P>
<P>
   For all anyone knows, a canine equivalent of the St. Louis Rams,
unranked and unheralded, will emerge from the 2,500 entries to
upset the favorites.
</P>
<P>
   Treson's ancestry bespeaks success in the best-in-show ring. His
grandfather, Ch. Whisperwind on Carousel, or Peter, won the 1991
Westminster crown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Treson is very much like Peter, a little more masculine and
stronger,'' McCoy said. ``Some people thought Peter was a bit
unisex, a little effeminate. Treson has a bigger head and a bigger
neck. But he's so much like Peter.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the judge of the non-sporting group chose Treson the
winner, declaring that he exuded ``poodleyness.'' Who could ask for
anything more?
</P>
<P>
   But poodleyness was not enough. A six-pound papillon, Ch. Loteki
Supernatural Being, won best-in-show and leaped into his silver
trophy.
</P>
<P>
   Treson is one of the most extravagantly groomed dogs in dogdom,
a pompadoured, teased and shaved paragon. But don't let Treson's
elegant coif fool you. He's really a regular guy until he's in the
spotlight. ``He's playful and fun, but when he's in a ring, he
says, `Look at me!''' McCoy said.
</P>
<P>
   The Giant Schnauzer Ch. Skansen's Tristan II heads into the show
suffering from morning sickness (she's due in April) and sciatica
that required chiropractic treatment to keep the 4-year-old from
leaning on one leg.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fly a lot and the crate probably got banged around,'' said
Bill McFadden, who handles Tristan for Marilu Hansen of Newton,
N.J., and Arthur T. Brown of Lakesport, Calif. The chiropractor
will be on call at the Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Being the country's second-ranked dog offers McFadden little
comfort that Tristan can beat the other 11 Giant Schnauzers in her
breed, let alone overwhelm the Akitas, Malamutes, Boxers, Great
Danes and other working group dogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two types of Giant Schnauzers: the American, like
Tristan, and the European,'' said McFadden. ``The judge in the
breed has only judged Tristan once, and from my information, he
likes the European type.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe McFadden is putting the judge on notice: Remember why
Tristan was 1999's apotheosis of schnauzerliness. &QL;

KWAN IS BIDING HER TIME ON AND OFF THE ICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Michelle Kwan won her fourth national figure skating
title Saturday night, but her victory carried more of a sense of
farewell than coronation. She gave the impression that she was
holding on, biding time, and time may be running out on her
Olympic-style career.
</P>
<P>
   She pronounced herself satisfied with her long program, but in
truth she had been failed by her jumping, by her listless
enthusiasm and by music and choreography so bleak and dull that it
pushed the audience away instead of drawing it in.
</P>
<P>
   She won only because her challengers are not yet out of braces,
still in the awkward stage where artistry lags behind eagerness.
With 25 seconds remaining in her long program, 15-year-old Sasha
Cohen of Costa Mesa, Calif., seemed ready to topple Kwan with an
elastic, elegant routine, but she fell on a triple toe loop and the
judges marked her harshly. Cohen's scores, as low as 5.4 for
technical merit, seemed artificially low, as if Kwan had to be
propped up for political reasons, like some Third World potentate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I would have won if I had landed the jump,''
Cohen said. ``Michelle is a world and Olympic skater. She is well
known and she has a reputation that I don't have.''
</P>
<P>
   In fairness to Kwan, she possessed a champion's resilience and
determination, improvising with a triple toe loop at the end of her
program, giving her six triple jumps overall. And she has a
dramatic eloquence that none of her young challengers express can
yet express.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of myself,'' the 19-year-old Kwan said. ``I was
strong this week. I didn't give an inch.''
</P>
<P>
   Strong perhaps, but vulnerable, too. She fell both in the short
program and long program. She has not skated cleanly in both
programs since the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan, where
caution cost her a gold medal. That same tentativeness was evident
Saturday night. Skating to the somber soundtrack from the movie,
``The Red Violin,'' Kwan said, ``It suited my mood perfectly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She needs to change her direction and revisit her image and
work on something more dynamic and use music that will bring people
into the performance instead of alienating them,'' said Jirina
Ribbens, a figure skating expert from New York City and a longtime
fan of Kwan's. ``She needs to attack. She's a talented athlete, a
mature, lyrical skater, but these qualities are not being showcased
to the utmost of their possibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Approaching the Nagano Olympics, Kwan faced one younger
challenger in Tara Lipinski. Now she faces at least four _ Cohen;
the 14-year-old Sarah Hughes of Great Neck, N.Y., who finished
third on Saturday while skating a more ambitious program than
Kwan's; 15-year-old Jennifer Kirk of Newton, Mass., who finished
seventh and has a beautiful tightness in her jumping; and
14-year-old Naomi Nari Nam of Irvine, Calif., who finished second a
year ago and eighth this year as she struggled to adjust to her
growing body.
</P>
<P>
   A maximum of three American women will qualify for the 2002
Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. A real possibility exists that
the team will not include Kwan. It is reflective of figure
skating's cruel winnowing that someone 19 years old can be in
decline.
</P>
<P>
   Like Michael Weiss, who defended the men's national title
despite the fact that Timothy Goebel landed three quadruple jumps,
Kwan remains on top with her artistry while she continues to fall
behind the technical advances in jumping. Hughes became the first
American woman to land a triple salchow-triple loop combination on
Saturday while Kwan could not complete the much easier triple
toe-triple toe. And while Kwan hopes to perfect a triple-triple
combination, Hughes is already working on a quadruple jump and a
triple axel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's harder because I know I'm not getting younger and my legs
won't keep up with me,'' Kwan said.
</P>
<P>
   To many at the national championships, she seemed distracted,
unfocused. Kwan is in college now, a freshman at UCLA, and it has
been a struggle to balance the rigors of school and skating. She
admitted that her motivation was sometimes difficult to summon.
``The only time you see a sparkle in her eyes is when she talks
about school,'' said one prominent skating coach.
</P>
<P>
   She was hit with a flurry of questions the past week: Does she
really want to continue in Olympic-style skating? Is she enjoying
herself? Is she continuing out of desperation, unfulfilled after
winning a silver medal at Nagano? Is she cornered by commercial
endorsements tied to her appearance in Salt Lake City?
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people think I'm going to turn pro,'' Kwan said.
``That's not where I want to be right now. I might not be
professional ever. You might see me until 2006. This is what I love
doing. You might not see a smiling, happy face all the time, but
this is where I want to be. Deep down I feel it.''
</P>
<P>
   Privately, some coaches and agents said that there appeared to
be a sort of tug-of-war for control of Kwan's skating between her
coach, Frank Carroll, and her father, Danny Kwan. Said Carroll:
``They are a tight family. He is concerned about her skating. He is
with her all the time, I am not. It's like any coach's relationship
with parents. Usually we get along fine. There are great times and
not so great times, but I'd say our relationship is very good. I
like Danny.''
</P>
<P>
   Between now and the world championships next month in Nice,
France, Carroll said that Kwan must dedicate more time to training,
that he will no longer allow her to run through her free skate if
she misses the triple-triple combination. Already, she has scaled
back school to one class.
</P>
<P>
   ``From now on, she can't have a life,'' Danny Kwan said. Then,
to suggest that he was joking, he said, ``Noooo.''
</P>
<P>
   Still the questions persist. Does she have the determination to
increase the difficulty of her jumps? Or the strength?
</P>
<P>
   ``At my first nationals, people said, `She's the jumping
bean,''' Kwan said. ``Now I'm `artistic, beautiful on the ice.' I
want to be well-rounded. And I want to be the jumping bean again. I
can do it. I have to bring it up.'' &QL;

FAMILIES ON EDGE OF ELIAN'S SPOTLIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lazara Brito and her three children huddled over the kitchen
table in their Havana apartment on a recent day and thumbed through
a pile of letters and drawings. These scraps of paper have been the
only physical link to Brito's husband, Jose Cohen, who left Cuba on
a raft in 1994 and has been waiting in vain for them to join him in
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing in life is not what you know or who you
know,'' Brito read from one letter, ``but who you are.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be the cause of her family's plight, since her husband
used to work for the Ministry of the Interior gathering
intelligence on foreign investors interested in doing business in
Cuba. And so the government considers him a deserter, or worse.
</P>
<P>
   Although Brito and her children have had U.S. visas since 1998,
she said the Cuban government had retaliated against her husband by
not allowing them to emigrate and subjecting them to harassment and
intimidation.
</P>
<P>
   The Cohens are among hundreds of Cuban families stuck in a limbo
of politics and bureaucracy, holding travel documents that remain
useless without exit visas from the government. Many of them had
become even more frustrated over the situation in recent months as
they watched the daily Cuban protests demanding the return of Elian
Gonzalez to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been almost six years since he left,'' Brito said of
her husband. ``Since then, the whole family has felt the full
rancor of the officials. I see all the worry over the child Elian
and I ask, where is the love for my children, because for six years
my children have been paying for the rancor against my husband.''
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials had no exact figures on how many
families were being kept apart, but they said that last year
approximately 1,700 people with valid travel documents for the
United States were unable to leave Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   For some, like the Cohens, the delay is political. Many are held
up by what foreign diplomats said were excessive Cuban fees for
medical exams and administrative costs _ as much as $1,000 a person
in an economy in which the average salary is $10 a month. Other
cases languish because a noncustodial parent refuses to give
permission for his child to leave the country, or because the
would-be immigrant is a professional who must first fulfill a work
commitment in return for education.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a big aspect of this whole Cuban trauma,'' said Max
Castro, a senior research analyst at the University of Miami.
``This is a good moment to reflect on it and for the various
parties to be more consistent. There is no doubt that the Cuban
government in the past has not been as solicitous as it is now on
the issue of family unification.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, who now lives in a suburb north of Miami and runs an
Internet business, said in an interview: ``The regime gives you no
option but to be with them or against them. People ask me, did I
not know what would happen? Yes. But I did not know the regime
would have such a strong reprisal.''
</P>
<P>
   Since her family obtained the U.S. visas, Brito said, she has
written direct appeals to Fidel Castro and other high-ranking
officials, asking that her children not be forced to pay for their
father's actions. All she has had in return, she said, are letters
saying her pleas have been sent to other government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Once, several years ago, security agents roused her from bed,
searched her apartment and, as her children and another relative
watched, whisked her off to jail for two days. One of her daughters
found a note under the front door that said: ``You will never
leave. Forget it.''
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Brito's younger daughter, Yamila, 13, was sent
from her school to take part in one of the large public rallies the
government organized to call for Elian's return. Her older
daughter, Yanelis, who is now 16, was asked to leave school last
year when administrators discovered she had a visa for the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban officials said they had not forced anyone to leave Cuba,
so they could not be accused of splitting up families. Ricardo
Alarcon, the leader of Cuba's National Assembly, said the Cohen
case involved a political defector who knew what he was doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I imagine he left his children here,'' he said. ``Nobody took
them away from him. He left them here.''
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials said the delays were a continuing
topic during the regular migration talks they held with their Cuban
counterparts. They are also raised in individual complaints lodged
by U.S. diplomats in Havana, who seldom receive answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be a long time,'' said one State Department official
familiar with several cases. ``It sort of compounds the tragedy,
too, because when these people go to apply for exit permits, they
lose their jobs, or their kids have problems getting into college
preparatory schools.''
</P>
<P>
   That was what Estella Natal, a language teacher from New York,
discovered while waiting for her Cuban husband, Joel Prince, a
doctor, to join her. She had met Prince on a trip to Cuba in 1996,
and they married two years later. At the time he was working as a
prison doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was fired from that job days after we were married,'' Natal
said. ``Then he got a job doing medical surveys, then at a
neighborhood clinic and then as a paramedic. The thing is, a lot of
places do not want to hire him or he does not get good training
because they know he is going to leave eventually. So he gets the
leftover jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Natal said her husband might have to work for several more years
before he would be allowed to leave. She added that recent
appointments he had been given to process his documents had been
postponed because workers at the immigration office had to attend
the public rallies for Elian.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole custody battle is hampering everything,'' she said.
``It's not just Elian. Elian is a symbol for the rest of us. He is
really a symbol of families being divided, of a lot of politics
coming between families.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   That symbolism was the impetus for a recently formed Miami exile
group, New Generation Cuba, which includes Cohen among its
founders. The group, which portrays itself as a mix of U.S.- and
Cuban-raised exiles, met with State Department officials recently
to press the cases of 14 separated families.
</P>
<P>
   The group's leaders said they knew of about 200 cases but had
yet to document them all. They said some other families were
reluctant to have contact with the group because they feared
reprisals against relatives in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fidel Castro has separated families for 41 years through death
and bureaucracy,'' said Bettina Rodriguez Aguilera, the group's
president, whose father was imprisoned in Cuba for 14 years while
she was growing up in the United States. ``The only person
destroying families in and out of Cuba is Fidel Castro.''
</P>
<P>
   But some political analysts said that while family unification
was an important issue, it was different from the issue in the
Elian Gonzalez case. In the boy's case, they say, the issue is the
rights of a surviving parent rather than the political control of
immigration.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a relation, but they are not identical,'' said Castro
of the University of Miami. ``There is reason to question the Cuban
government on these cases and ask them to reflect and be consistent
on their view of families.''
</P>
<P>
   But he also said that efforts like those of New Generation Cuba
appeared to be hastily organized and that the group risked losing
credibility if it was seen as manipulating Elian's plight for
political purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are taking a real issue and using it in a way that may be
more of a disservice to the cause, because it is taken as something
very opportunistic,'' Castro said. ``It should be a continuing
conversation and a demand, not something that is all of a sudden
deployed.''
</P>
<P>
   But for Cohen's family, there is hope that someone has taken up
their cause. In the family's spartan apartment _ Brito started
giving away their belongings in anticipation of a move _ his
children practice English, just as their father asks them to in his
letters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am far from you now,'' he wrote in English to Yanelis, his
oldest daughter. ``But my soul is with you and you are in my
heart.'' He added in Spanish, ``Learn this.''
</P>
<P>
   Yanelis said, but in Spanish: ``Once we are together, that will
be the greatest. Here we are feeling different from all the others
because we do not have the family that all human beings want. We
ask: When will it reach the hearts of those men who stop us from
being with our father?''

   AT&AMP;T's Consumer Chief Is Expected to Resign
</P>
<P>
   H. Eugene Lockhart, president of the core consumer unit at AT&AMP;T,
intends to step down barely a year after joining the company,
executives close to the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart's future plans are unclear. His departure would
probably not be seen as a significant operational blow to AT&AMP;T. But
it could raise questions about the ability of C. Michael Armstrong,
AT&AMP;T's chairman, to identify and retain key executive talent.

   Beardstown Ladies Go to Court
</P>
<P>
   Courts in New York and California have made diametrically
opposing judgments in lawsuits that challenge dust-jacket claims on
the ``The Beardstown Ladies' Common-Sense Investment Guide.'' The
guide claimed returns from the ladies' investment approach that
were much higher than actual returns. The publisher now faces
several legal challenges stemming from those claims. Those suits,
and others like them, question whether some of the standard puffery
on a book jacket amounts to free speech protected by the First
Amendment.

   World Bank to Form Internet Fund
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank's International Finance Corp. unit will announce
Monday that it has teamed up with Softbank of Japan to create a
$200 million fund that will finance Internet start ups in 100
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   A New Season for Gift Certificates
</P>
<P>
   Companies that sell gift certificates online report that weekly
revenues so far this year are actually increasing, despite the fact
that post-holiday sales to consumers have leveled off. The
companies are apparently benefiting from the nation's labor
shortage: As companies struggle to attract and retain workers, many
are turning to corporate gift programs _ and online gift
certificates, they say, are a cheap and easy way to award perks.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer Internet Backbone Providers
</P>
<P>
   Last week's Web site attacks were a reminder that technology's
sword of individual empowerment has a double edge. But the term for
the attack technique _ denial of service _ has the potential to
assume an equally ominous meaning as telecommunications giants
continue to merge their holdings. For example, upon completion of
the Worldcom-Sprint merger, a single company would control nearly
half of the Internet's backbone.
</P>
<P>
   This Guinness Is for You
</P>
<P>
   The Guinness Bass Import Co., the unit of Diageo that
distributes and markets Guinness stout in the United States, is
overhauling its sales pitch in substantive ways meant to make the
brand seem less intimidating to those Americans, particularly in
their mid-20s, who typically favor imported beers. That demographic
group is often put off by the iconic, even imperial, image of
Guinness.

 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   He became famous for his appearance _ the sideline stoicism, the
courtly attire, a continence in the midst of a brutal sport, and of
course, for his hat.
</P>
<P>
   But to his players, to his colleagues in National Football
League and to the state of Texas, longtime Dallas Cowboys Coach Tom
Landry represented much more. He was a father figure, a football
innovator, even the gentlemanly and noble symbol that helped buoy
Texans at a time when a state's identity seemed all too wrapped in
the stigma of the assassination of President Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Landry was the coach of what came to be known as America's Team,
and if he appeared more professor or bank president than football
coach, then that set a standard, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``He conducted himself with such dignity and poise, it set the
example for how you should live your life,'' Charlie Waters, a
Cowboys safety for 11 seasons said of his former coach, who died of
leukemia Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``People didn't understand the weight of his influence. Because
he wasn't a yeller and screamer, people thought he didn't motivate
or make people better with his approach and his presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he had, for example, a look he gave his players, and we
all hated it when he gave us that look. It was haunting, because
the look said, `Why are you letting yourself down? Why are you
letting me down?' Tell me that didn't motivate. None of us wanted
to disappoint Coach Landry.''
</P>
<P>
   The diverse, lengthy and Football Hall of Fame career of Landry,
who was 75, inspired many _ contemporaries and competitors alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``People search for heroes in this world,'' said Gil Brandt, the
Cowboys longtime front office executive, said in a recent
interview. ``And years ago, some of those people turned on their
television every Sunday and saw a guy who wasn't dissolving into
fits of anger, who wasn't using bad language, who was mannerly and
well-dressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``And yet, he was still driven and competitive and won
championships. Is that not a worthy hero?''
</P>
<P>
   Wellington Mara, the Giants co-owner, knew Landry as a former
Giants assistant coach and later as the head coach of a chief
rival. For 30 years, when the Cowboys came to the New York area to
play the Giants, the two would have dinner on the eve of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess his reputation is someone who's aloof,'' Mara said.
``But there was a lot of fire burning inside him. You might know
part of him by looking at him, but you didn't know it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Landry's impassive demeanor in public indeed was a trademark,
but it concealed, for example, a dynamic football mind. He
single-handedly revived the shotgun formation in the modern era of
football, he devised the 4-3 defense _ pro football's model defense
_ in the 1950s, he was the first to computerize the strategy and
game planning of a NFL team in the 1960s and his flex defense was
revolutionary in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   An engineering major at the University of Texas, Landry could
draw up a football play so precise and interconnected, it looked
like the plans for a high-rise building. And it would stand the
test of time, too.
</P>
<P>
   Respect for Landry in the NFL ran deep. After several years as
the Giants defensive coordinator, he became the first coach of the
Cowboys in 1960, a hapless expansion franchise that won just four
games in its first two seasons. But by 1966, Dallas was in the NFL
championship game. Landry's Cowboys didn't have another losing
season until 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty consecutive winning seasons,'' George Young, the former
Giants general manager and now the league's deputy vice president,
said recently. ``That gets you plenty of respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Young often tells the story of his preparations for Super Bowl
V, when Landry's Cowboys played the Baltimore Colts, for whom Young
was the offensive line coach.
</P>
<P>
   All week the Colts prepared for the Cowboys defense they had
seen on film all season, but Young kept asking: What if they change
it up on us?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told, `They won't do that. This has been Landry's
defense for years and he's not going to change it now, not when
he's playing the biggest game of the year.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, wouldn't you know, that's exactly what he did to us.''
</P>
<P>
   His former players, and his colleagues, acknowledged that much
of Landry's reputation was well-earned. He was extremely private
and not known for grandiose gestures or self-promotion. Some who
knew him for 50 years never knew he was a bomber pilot in World War
II who narrowly avoided death in a harrowing crash landing in the
French countryside.
</P>
<P>
   He liked to read and spent countless hours across four decades
traveling the country in the football off-season to appear at
functions that raised money for the Fellowship of Christian
Athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Landry's reputation for keeping his players at a distance was
legendary and well-deserved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he forced himself to do that because he knew he'd have
to be honest with players he had to release,'' Waters said. ``And
he couldn't be emotional about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, when the former Cowboys fullback Walt Garrison was once
asked if he had ever seen Landry smile, Garrison answered: ``No, I
only played nine years.''
</P>
<P>
   Landry coached five Hall of Fame players in Dallas _ Roger
Staubach, Randy White, Bob Lilly, Mel Renfro and Tony Dorsett _ and
an equal number as an assistant with the Giants. He also helped
develop two of the most prominent coaches of the 1980s and '90s,
Dan Reeves and Mike Ditka, both of whom played for Landry and then
worked as assistants under him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He shaped my philosophy on everything,'' Reeves said. ``I
followed his philosophy on football and how he handled himself on
and off the field. He was a tremendous influence on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Landry won two Super Bowls and his teams appeared in five. While
he was criticized for turning his players into robots, he coached a
number of charismatic, iconoclastic players, including Don
Meredith, Duane Thomas, Thomas (Hollywood) Henderson, Pete Gent and
Lance Rentzel.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he coached a different kind of team, one that relied
on organization and ingenuity, a forward-thinking team that often
seemed in contrast to the dusty, blood-and-guts tradition of
earlier eras in the league. Symbolically, Landry's team played
mostly on artificial turf and usually in the sun, and often, for
television purposes, late on Sunday afternoons, which cultivated
their popularity.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, to some at least, Landry's teams put a new face
on the city of Dallas in the mid-1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of Coach Landry's legacy,'' Waters said. ``Is what he did
for our city and state. For a lot of people in America back then,
all they knew about Dallas was that President Kennedy had been
assassinated there. They associated the place with that great loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stigma was real and it was a burden we all inherited,
including Coach Landry who was raised in Mission, Texas. But Coach
Landry helped us turn the corner on that with the way he handled
himself _ in bad times and good times. He was the conductor for all
that changed.''
</P>
<P>
   He was the man on the sideline in the hat, an image so abiding
that when he was inducted into the Cowboys Ring of Honor at Texas
Stadium, they put a small outline of a fedora next to his name.
</P>
<P>
   ``The image of the Cowboys started with Tom,'' Staubach said.
``The Cowboys will always be more than just another team because of
him.''
</P>
<P>
   And Landry's friends and admirers, Staubach included, insist
that on occasion at least, the stoic coach did smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom wanted to show Roger Staubach how to run a quarterback
bootleg once,'' Brandt said. ``And he got behind the center and ran
the play, except that Tom had an old knee injury and he limped
badly as he ran around that corner with the football.
</P>
<P>
   ``So Tom says: `OK, do it like that.' And Roger took the ball
from center and ran it just like Tom did, hobbling and limping all
the way around the corner. Tom just burst out laughing and so did
everyone else. Guys were falling down they were laughing so
hard.'' &QL;

<P>
   HUAMBO, Angola _ The astonishing news crackled over the radios
in this crumbling town of faded colonial mansions and rolling green
hills. One by one, the radio announcer said, the nearby rebel
strongholds were falling into government hands.
</P>
<P>
   And for three months, hope blossomed here.
</P>
<P>
   The mortars stopped falling. Relief workers made plans to send
thousands of refugees home. And Silvano Chingala Mindo, a
19-year-old student who saw his two friends killed by shrapnel last
October, began to believe he might live long enough to become a
veterinarian.
</P>
<P>
   But these days, the waves of war are once again lapping over
Angola, and over this weary city. The guerrillas are storming
through the countryside, villagers are fleeing to refugee camps and
the fragile hopes that buoyed this bullet-pocked town are waning.
</P>
<P>
   After a series of back-to-back victories late last year, the
government apparently thought it had finally triumphed over the
guerrillas known as Unita _the Portuguese acronym for the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola, which until 1975 was a
Portuguese colony. Now, in the seemingly endless war that has raged
ever since, pitting Unita's leader, Jonas Savimbi, against his
fierce rival, President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, the rebels have
seized the offensive once more.
</P>
<P>
   Unita claims to have killed 882 government soldiers over the
past month. This week, the government, which had repeatedly boasted
that it had destroyed 80 percent of Unita's war machine, publicly
acknowledged that the battle is far from over.
</P>
<P>
   Paulina Wenda discovered the rebels were still a potent force
last week when they opened fire on her village in nearby Mbave. She
grabbed her children and they ran barefoot, leaving their hut,
their pots, their clothes, their land.
</P>
<P>
   She had heard the radio broadcasts and the government officials
who claimed they were finally winning. ``But there's no
difference,'' Wenda, 35, said wearily as she stood in a refugee
camp near here. ``We're still losing everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Military experts say the government underestimated Unita, and
they predict the guerrillas will continue fighting to capitalize on
the rainy season here that has hobbled the government's tanks and
jets in thick mud and dense clouds.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought they had Unita on their knees and it's not so,''
said Johann Smith, a military analyst, who served as the South
African Defense Force's attache to Luanda, the capital here, in
1992 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've absorbed the initial shock of the successes against
them,'' said Smith, who still monitors the conflict and Unita.
``They're up and running. And they're definitely going to use this
window of time to strengthen their position.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all the action has been military, however. After the
government drove the rebels from their traditional strongholds of
Bailundo, Andulo and Jamba between September and December last
year, Unita announced that it wanted to reopen negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech broadcast on government radio last week, dos Santos
said he believed Angola was stable enough to hold national
elections next year and invited Unita's soldiers to lay down their
arms and organize their political party.
</P>
<P>
   That news was enough for Veronica Chilombo, 36, who lost her
left leg in an accident, to leave her village, which had been under
rebel control. For two days, she hobbled on wooden crutches until
she reached a hospital here in government-controlled Huambo, where
she could finally ask for an artificial leg.
</P>
<P>
   Valdemar Franco Secesec, a 25-year-old nurse, said he was
heartened by commercial flights flying into the airport again and
the trucks rolling in on roads that were once too dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I have hope that one day soon this war will end,'' Franco
said. ``You have to have hope. There is nothing else to keep us
going.''
</P>
<P>
   But there have been no clear signs that the two sides will
actually come together.
</P>
<P>
   The war here used to have an ideological base: dos Santos was
backed by Russia and Cuba, Savimbi by the United States. Gradually,
it has turned into more of a battle for Angola's huge spoils _ the
oil controlled by the government, and the diamond mines by Unita.
</P>
<P>
   There is still much finger-pointing on both sides about the
failure of the 1994 peace treaty that gave Angola its longest
cease-fire in 30 years. The fighting resumed in 1998, with Unita
initially making strong gains.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of easing, this civil war has now spread beyond its
borders, spilling into neighboring Namibia, which late last year
allowed the Angolan government to fight from its soil, where the
conflict has already claimed dozens of civilian lives.
</P>
<P>
   And so, the two sides talk peace and wage war, and ordinary
people suffer. Strangely enough, in this still-graceful town of
red-tile roofs and elegant leafy plazas, such contradictions seem
oddly logical.
</P>
<P>
   After all, this is a place where the only hotel has shiny water
faucets, but no running water; light switches, but no electricity
during the day. A graffiti artist has scrawled the word ``paz'' or
``peace'' on a building still riddled with bullet holes.
</P>
<P>
   This is a war that ebbs and flows, where the winners on one day
are often the losers on the next. The government controls most of
the cities and towns, but Unita is still strong in the countryside.
And it is often difficult to tell where and when the fighting ends
and the peace begins.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Doctors Without Borders, which runs a clinic for
refugees here, accepted the official word about peace in the
region, and sent trucks rumbling out into the countryside to screen
poor children for malnutrition. But two weeks ago, they stopped,
frightened by new reports of violence and by the shelling that
jolted their nurses from sleep at night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The local staff didn't want to go anymore,'' said Gunilla
Priebe, a nurse with the organization. ``And we trust their
information more than the official information. It's more
reliable.''
</P>
<P>
   The locals, teen-agers like Chingala, gossip and giggle and lean
against a dilapidated building that has long since lost its glass
windows and wooden doors. The girls laugh when asked whether they
think the war is ending. It is something they cannot imagine. All
they know is war.
</P>
<P>
   Chingala does not laugh. He was walking home from school with
his friends last October when the shell exploded. He survived
unscathed, but when he saw their bloodied bodies, he thought he saw
his own fate.
</P>
<P>
   And so he prays for peace because he wants to grow up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if peace stays, I will have a future,'' he said.
``They say Unita has no longer any possibility to win offensives. I
heard it on the radio. I just hope it's true.''

 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Richard Branson was fiddling with one of his new
Virgin-brand mobile telephones in the living room of his Notting
Hill town house here last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to think how it works,'' he said, staring at a
special button on the phone _ a red button, with the Virgin logo.
The button connects customers by voice to operators who also handle
distribution for the Virgin.com Web site. With such a call,
customers can order plane tickets, CD's and an assortment of other
products that Branson usually hawks by nondigital means. After
trying fitfully to explain the red-button function, he finally
conceded that he wasn't sure how it worked, and gave up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was one of those anti-mobile phone guys before we did Virgin
Mobile,'' he explained, referring to the cellular phone service
that he started in November and that has already signed up 300,000
subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Hands-on technical savvy or not, Branson is diving head first
into the digital economy. Call it the dot-comming of the Virgin
Group PLC.
</P>
<P>
   Branson, the brash, 48-year-old British billionaire who founded
Virgin Atlantic Airways 15 years ago with one jumbo jet plying the
London-New York route, now owns a hodgepodge of more than 200
Virgin-branded businesses. And he intends to turn his
tarmac-and-mortar world into something a bit more virtual.
</P>
<P>
   Having slapped the Virgin logo on planes, trains, soda, vodka,
clothing, movie theaters, music stores, a radio station, a
financial services company and even a wedding coordinator, Branson
means to expand his year-old Virgin.com Web site into a worldwide
e-commerce portal that he hopes will take on some of the qualities
of Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   The skeptics say he is already too late to the Internet market
and will surely stumble. ``A lot of traditional businesses have
made these kinds of plans and they've never worked out,'' said Noah
Yasskin, an analyst at Jupiter Communications in London.
</P>
<P>
   But Branson sees himself as specially suited for an
entrepreneurial leap onto the Web.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, unlike Amazon.com _ which began as a book
distributor and is now a diversified digital middleman _ the Virgin
Group has many of its own products to sell. That doesn't mean,
though, that Branson plans to hold his Web customers hostage to the
Virgin brand.
</P>
<P>
   ``If British Airways is selling better products than Virgin
Atlantic, we'll sell the British Airways product,'' he said. ``If
Fidelity is offering a better financial product than Virgin Direct,
we'll recommend the Fidelity product.''
</P>
<P>
   Branson says he will not get snagged on the sticking point that
has caused other brand-name companies to stumble on their way to
cyberspace _ the fear of cannibalizing the established offline
brands. ``It's a fact of life,'' he said, ``that the Internet will
kill off some of our business and severely damage a lot of
conventional industry.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the matter of management and money, which in
the case of the privately held Virgin Group resides chiefly in one
man: Richard Branson, boss and banker, rolled into one.
</P>
<P>
   Having sold 49 percent of his Virgin Atlantic unit to Singapore
Airlines for $965 million right before Christmas, Branson has cash
to burn. And unlike most dot-com's, he notes, his money is real _
not the paper wealth of newly minted Internet stock.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever the advantages Branson describes, Virgin is
entering the Internet arena too late to claim the ``first mover''
edge that Web executives like to tout.
</P>
<P>
   Yasskin, the Jupiter analyst, says that most of the major
sectors of the Web are already carved up by companies like Yahoo
and Amazon.com. ``At least in the U.S. market, Virgin will have a
very hard time competing,'' he said, adding that outside the United
States ``Virgin still has a little time to grab some market
share.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Branson maintains that the Virgin brand is so
strong internationally _ the company is already Britain's biggest
advertiser _ that his relatively late Internet move will not hurt
his chances. In fact, he said his timing might present an
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not lost hundreds of millions of pounds on the Net in
the few years the Net was developing,'' he said, a not-so-veiled
reference to companies like Amazon.com that have spent and lost
large amounts of money building their clientele. ``Our approach is
to come on the Net when the amount of people who are logging on to
the Net are considerable, and where we can actually see real
profits reasonably quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   His remarks may be self-serving, but for Branson and his
privately held company, it is crucial to quickly turn a profit.
Otherwise, he may find it necessary to relinquish some control over
the Virgin Group by raising money in the public stock market _ in
order to compete for big-time capital with the likes of Amazon.
</P>
<P>
   While he says that an initial public offering is on his mind, he
has no immediate plans for one, predicting that he can break into
the European Internet market without a major cash outlay for a
brand-building campaign. But the U.S. market is another matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``In America we're well ahead in the major cities,'' he said,
speaking of Virgin's brand recognition. ``But out in the sticks,
we've still got some way to go. America will be the toughest nut to
crack. We will have to spend big bucks in America.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many of the Internet pioneers who have paid handsomely to
simply get their name out, Virgin already has dozens of branded
products to help keep its name in the public eye. Branson said, for
example, that he intends to have ``Virgin.com'' painted onto the
sides of his planes in place of the ``No Way BA/AA'' slogan that
has adorned Virgin's fleet since his nemesis, British Airways,
announced an abortive plan for a far-reaching alliance with
American Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Without the dot-com money of a publicly traded company, Branson
seeks attention for himself and his company in ways beyond paid
advertising. Virgin generates press releases on an almost daily
basis, and he is not above publicity stunts like the Virgin Mobile
rollout in November. Creating a stir widely chronicled in the
British tabloids, he held a parade of sorts in the West End of
London, riding a float on which he surrounded himself with nude
models talking on Virgin Mobile phones. The slogan for the new
company: ``What you see is what you get.''
</P>
<P>
   He also primes the publicity pump by making himself freely
available for interviews. ``It's cheaper than buying a full-page ad
in The New York Times,'' he joked.
</P>
<P>
   Still, wielding his brand identity against Internet upstarts is
one thing. Taking on one of Europe's fasting-growing communications
powers is another. And that is precisely the collision course he
has set for himself with Virgin Mobile, a joint venture with the
Deutsche Telekom unit One2One. Despite its 300,000 subscribers in
Britain, Virgin Mobile, will be up against the combined 42 million
European subscribers of Vodafone AirTouch and Mannesmann, which
announced plans for the biggest industrial merger ever the week
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Branson predicts that Virgin Mobile will be able to gain ground
on Vodafone when the licensing begins this spring for Britain's
next generation of wireless telephones _ digital devices that are
to combine voice, Internet access and other digital features.
Toward that end, he has put together a group of investors that
include the Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen and the venture
capitalist George Soros.
</P>
<P>
   But again, Branson may be a bit late, some contend. ``It's going
to take Virgin years to build a network,'' Yasskin said. ``And by
the time they do, they will have missed the huge growth period.
Anyway, the incumbents always have an advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Branson nonetheless says that he will be able to compete with
established players like Vodafone. ``There is no reason we can't
offer anything that Vodafone can,'' he said. ``We will by no means
be as big as them, but we will have a slice of the market.''
</P>
<P>
   All of his businesses that have succeeded so far have done so by
carving out a niche in a mainstream industry by emphasizing service
and style _ whether it be Virgin Atlantic, with its interactive
movie and game system in every seat in economy class, or Virgin
Bride, a one-stop shop for weddings.
</P>
<P>
   Virgin's philosophy, Branson said, is to improve upon
established businesses by adding a Virgin-esque sensibility.
</P>
<P>
   With Virgin Mobile, for example, he is taking the unusual step
of giving away an earpiece with a built-in microphone with each of
the company's mobile phones, so users do not have to hold them to
their heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``A friend of mine got a brain tumor, and before he died we had
dinner and he said his surgeon was convinced that using a mobile
phone may have been a factor,'' Branson said, raising a
product-liability specter that the head of a public company might
be likely to suppress.
</P>
<P>
   And the Virgin Web site will cater to Branson's digital naivete.
``Any jargon that I don't understand'' will be stripped out, he
said. ``I assume that I am representative of the vast majority of
the people out there.''
</P>
<P>
   That thinking may explain why for Branson _ who in the past has
attempted a solo, round-the-world balloon flight and who owns an
island in the Caribbean _ taking his business onto the Internet
does not seem as as much fun as some of his previous endeavors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't excite me in the same way that starting Virgin
Atlantic did,'' he admitted. ``It's because I could deal with
people. And with the Internet, you're one step removed from the
people.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   MENLO PARK, Calif. _ Will the dogs eat the dog food?
</P>
<P>
   It is a way of wondering whether the customers will accept the
product. And among the elite corps of Microsoft programmers who
labor to turn out each new operating system, the dog food aphorism
has become a way of life.
</P>
<P>
   But on the eve of the official release of Windows 2000, the
software giant's first new business-oriented operating system in
four years, PC power users like the venture capitalist Stewart
Alsop must be giving Microsoft Corp. pause.
</P>
<P>
   Last week at his desk on Sand Hill Road above Silicon Valley,
Alsop sat with two portable computers. On one side of his desk was
his old one, still running the crash-prone Windows 95, now a
half-decade old. On the other sat his brand- new Toshiba running
Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   As the rain pelted down on the Valley's green foothills, Alsop
puzzled over why his just-out-of-the-box computer was crashing each
time he attempted to change its screen resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Emphatically, he said he had no desire to try to master yet
another operating system any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not happy,'' Alsop said. ``Computers used to be fun.''
</P>
<P>
   And that, in a nutshell, is the chasm Microsoft must cross as it
endeavors to switch business users, large and small, to a new, more
powerful operating system that it says offers a host of benefits,
ranging from added stability for mission-critical business centers
to better power management for battery-hungry laptops.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a growing rumbling among early users and analysts
suggested that Windows 2000 might not be a runaway success. The
company's stock fell nearly 6 percent on Friday, closing at 99
15/16, after a Gartner Group report indicated that a significant
number of existing programs used by large corporations would not be
compatible with Microsoft's new operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, on Thursday night, during a conference call held by
Dell Computer to discuss earnings with analysts, the company's
founder and chairman, Michael S. Dell, threw more cold water on the
Windows 2000 launch, saying Dell did not expect a big boost in the
near future from sales of the new operating system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't see a massive immediate acceleration due to Windows
2000,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Microsoft has faced a skeptical media and industry
numerous times before, and the company has almost always managed to
outpace expectations.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, at a planned gala in San Francisco, Microsoft will
officially introduce what are in fact four different operating
systems aimed at different markets: desktop office users, Internet
and other network server applications, and, four months hence, a
data center version that for the first time will permit Microsoft
to compete in the very high end of the computer business.
</P>
<P>
   Windows 2000 boasts a huge array of advanced features _ the user
document describing the product is 253 pages _ intended to put
Microsoft on an even footing with the Unix operating systems that
dominate corporate back offices.
</P>
<P>
   That market is one that Microsoft has long coveted. Indeed,
during the past three years, Microsoft's new chief executive,
Steven A. Ballmer, has frequently sketched for reporters the
company's strategy for attacking Sun Microsystems, the leading Unix
computer vendor.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has long believed that by riding on a wave of
``commodity'' computer hardware _ the vast Intel-based PC industry
_ it would be able to push its operating systems both up and down
the computer industry food chain.
</P>
<P>
   To do that, it has continuously developed and expanded its
operating systems, from the original MS-DOS, which was quickly
cobbled together for the first IBM PC in the early 1980s, through
Windows 3.0, 95, 98, NT, CE and, now, 2000. Each version was aimed
at a different market.
</P>
<P>
   But until now, the high-end computer market has eluded the
giant.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Sun Microsystems was quick to discover the Internet and exploit
its market potential for selling servers and server software, and
Solaris, its version of the Unix operating system, now has an
inside position on most of the nation's largest e-commerce servers.
That has been a significant advantage for Sun, the Mountain View,
Calif., computer maker that was founded to manufacture technical
work stations in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, analysts who are optimistic about Microsoft's
chances at the high end of the computer industry believe that the
software publisher will finally make significant inroads against
its Unix rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Windows 2000 acceptance will be very, very large,'' predicted
Mark Anderson, a computer industry analyst and president of
Technology Alliance Partners. ``The replacement rate'' of
Unix-based systems, he said, ``will go to four-to-one or better.''
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring Anderson's optimism is a feature list for Windows
2000 that begins with its ability to handle larger tasks _ in
industry parlance, ``to scale'' _ running on computers based on as
many as 32 processors. Such systems have increasingly replaced
mainframe computers during the past decade and are now used
extensively in corporate computing centers.
</P>
<P>
   However, Microsoft's most pressing problem in the new corporate
computing market is that it must convince corporate computing
managers that Windows is an effective alternative to an
increasingly stable and scalable opponent: Linux, the free version
of Unix that has recently begun to gain adherents in corporate
settings.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft counters the free-Linux argument by saying that the
price of an operating system represents only a tiny portion of the
total cost of ownership for a complete computer system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cost of the software is a rounding error that can't be the
major deciding factor,'' said Jeff Price, group product manager for
Microsoft Windows.
</P>
<P>
   However, some financial analysts say that Linux's inroads will
make it difficult for Microsoft to expand its 38 percent share of
the corporate computer server market as rapidly as it was able to
grow its Windows 95 and Windows 98 consumer markets. And slowing
growth could hurt the larger Microsoft financial machine, which has
operated as a growth engine for two decades.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Sun executives say that despite Microsoft's
aggressive advertising, it has not developed a product that can
find the sweet spot of the growing Internet server market.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're out telling the world they're going to burn our house
down, but they don't realize we've moved,'' said Anil Gadre, vice
president and general manager of Sun's Solaris operating system
division.
</P>
<P>
   Sun executives say that Microsoft's assertion that its
32-processor version will match Sun's performance is premature. Not
only will the data-center version of Windows 2000 not appear until
later this year, but Sun is already far more scalable, delivering
clusters of up to eight 128-processor systems.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome of the battle for the very high end of the
computer industry, Microsoft is planning to spend as much as $200
million to convince corporate America that Windows 2000 is the
right operating system.
</P>
<P>
   But the company does not appear to be playing to a wildly
enthusiastic audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the greatest operating system on a variety of
accounts, but it's good enough,'' said Brian Livingston, co-author
of ``Windows 2000 Secrets'' (IDG Books Worldwide, 2000).
</P>
<P>
   And therein may lie Microsoft's biggest challenge this year:
Convincing computer users like Alsop that ``good enough'' is worth
the time and effort of the upgrade.

ASBESTOS REGULATION FALLING THROUGH THE CRACKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Insidious and deadly, asbestos has worked its way through the
cracks of the consumer protection system for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The result? Today, asbestos is lodged deep in the tissue of
American commerce, and almost no one is paying attention.
</P>
<P>
   Not consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Not consumer watchdogs.
</P>
<P>
   The Consumer Product Safety Commission has not banned most
products containing asbestos, even though health experts expect the
carcinogen to claim another 250,000 lives in the United States over
the next several decades.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer watchdog groups Public Citizen and the Consumer
Federation of America were both involved in early battles to get
asbestos off the market. Now, asbestos is not even on their list of
priorites.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, most people who are charged with protecting consumer
safety say asbestos is ``no longer a problem'' because of the
faulty assumption that the product has long been banned and that
all manufacturers have stopped using it.
</P>
<P>
   But it isn't banned.
</P>
<P>
   The CPSC abandoned its attempts to ban asbestos products in
1979, passing the responsibility to the EPA. In 1989, the EPA
attempted a ban of its own, but in 1991, the U.S. 5th Circuit Court
of Appeals overturned it.
</P>
<P>
   Today, it is legal to sell asbestos products ranging from brake
pads to ceiling tiles in the United States. Imports of
asbestos-containing products are on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   Passing the buck
</P>
<P>
   The story of how asbestos managed to elude consumer regulation
is both a pass-the-buck agency saga and an example of how an
industry puts pressure on government.
</P>
<P>
   When it came to the specter of regulating a large, complicated
area such as asbestos, the CPSC was outmanned. When the EPA said it
would work to ban asbestos, CPSC jumped at the chance to get rid of
the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a big agency. They've got all the lawyers,'' CPSC
spokesman Ken Giles said. ``We're a small agency. It was much
easier for us to say, `You do it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Asbestos first came to the attention of the CPSC in the 1970s
after a growing body of scientific evidence linked the fibers to
fatal diseases, including asbestosis and mesothelioma.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, CPSC banned two consumer products that contained
asbestos -- a patching compound used for spackling wallboard, and
``emberizing'' compound, a type of fake ash that was sprinkled over
artificial logs in gas fireplaces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking back on it, it was not a very rational approach,''
said Charles Jacobson, a retired compliance officer for CPSC who
was involved in the early asbestos battles.
</P>
<P>
   It made sense to ban those products because of the potential for
fibers to become airborne and inhaled, he said. But there were
other asbestos products that weren't banned that posed similar
hazards.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, responding to a consumer outcry, the commission
recalled all hair dryers containing asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took the safe approach,'' said John Bell, who was
communications director for the agency during the hair-dryer
recall. ``We did our own testing and found significant levels of
asbestos coming from the heat shields.''
</P>
<P>
   That year, the agency also proposed a comprehensive ban to
eliminate asbestos from all consumer products, but the effort
stalled.
</P>
<P>
   `We'll fold up our tent'
</P>
<P>
   The EPA had just announced it would regulate asbestos under the
Toxic Substances Control Act, said Jacobson. ``We at CPSC said,
`Good -- we'll fold up our tent.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But they folded too soon.
</P>
<P>
   The advent of the Reagan Administration made taking actions
against consumer products even more difficult, Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the Reagan landslide in 1980, (the government) wanted a
regulatory agency pelt -- as in a dead carcass -- to hang on the
wall,'' Bell said. The CPSC came within a few votes of being
dismantled by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The hair-dryer recall was held up as an example of excessive
regulation, that ``slowed down the competitiveness of hair
dryers.''
</P>
<P>
   The new administration viewed the recall as a waste of taxpayer
money, he said. ``We felt differently. Anytime you can eliminate a
hazard, it's good to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   After 1980, he said, the agency wasn't as aggressive. It focused
on more clearcut problems, such as ridding toys of small parts that
could cause choking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Asbestos was no longer a focus because it wasn't considered a
winner,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is there no ban on most asbestos-containing products,
there is no federal law requiring labeling of products that are
contaminated with asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   Under CPSC's current policy, companies are supposed to put
warning labels on products that contain intentionally added
carcinogenic substances. But it's not known how well companies
comply with the policy. And the rule doesn't cover asbestos that
occurs naturally as a contaminant, instead of being added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tremolite (a contaminant form of asbestos) is dangerous --
there's no question about that,'' said Dr. Sidney Wolfe, head of
the Health Research Group of Public Citizen, a consumer activist
organization that began petitioning CPSC to ban products, such as
children's playsand and gardening products, that contained
tremolite more than 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   CPSC: `Not very strong'
</P>
<P>
   ``But the (Consumer Products Safety) Commission and the laws
it's empowered to enforce are not very strong,'' he said. ``I am
concerned about the extent to which (the CPSC) promptly regulates
things.''
</P>
<P>
   The Commission relies heavily on voluntary actions on the part
of industry, he said. ``But overall, industry isn't capable of
regulating itself.''
</P>
<P>
   The CPSC doesn't police companies to make sure their products
are safe. Instead, it relies on voluntary reports from industry, as
well as consumer complaints, emergency-room reports, death
certificates and some testing to alert it to potentially hazardous
situations.
</P>
<P>
   It uses the same approach to tracking imported products.
</P>
<P>
   ``All imports have to meet the same standards that domestically
manufactured proeucts have to meet so the CPSC labeling requirement
for products would have to apply to imports as well,'' said Giles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We work with the U.S. Customs Service to survey ports of
entry,'' said Giles. ``Customs Service has been informed about our
overall concerns and several product (categories) in particular. As
a matter of practice, I'm unaware of any products containing
asbestos. I don't believe the issue of labeling (on imports) has
ever come up.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Department of Commerce figures, imports of asbestos
products increased 17 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   `An unnecessary risk'
</P>
<P>
   Consumers can't be sure the products they buy do not contain
asbestos. And if products do contain asbestos, they can't be sure
what levels they will be exposed to, or whether those levels would
be considered safe.
</P>
<P>
   A key example is lawn products which contain tremolite, a
natural contaminant of vermiculite.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some vermiculite (products) which are not
contaminated with fibrous materials (tremolite),'' said Stephen
Levin, medical director at Mt. Sinai's Selikoff Center of
Occupational and Environmental Medicine. ``The trouble is that the
consumer is never going to know.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I'm concerned, if you have these kind of materials,
like soil expanders, when used and applied they will generate a
dust. They're handled in a dry state. If some of the materials are
allowed to contain fibrous tremolite, we are placing the public at
an unnecessary risk. I don't think people should be using
vermiculite that is tremolite-contaminated.''
</P>
<P>
   Even consumer watchdogs, who aren't happy about the situation,
aren't doing anything about it.
</P>
<P>
   Public Citizen has not revisited the tremolite issue because of
limited time and resources, Wolfe said. But that doesn't mean the
consumer organization believes the asbestos issue has gone away.
</P>
<P>
   ``These issues come back every once in a while,'' he said. ``It
wouldn't happen if they were banned to begin with.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Many e-commerce rookies approached this post-Christmas season
with a fair measure of apprehension, given the dearth of remaining
advertising money and nagging questions about how many of their
customers would return after all the gifts had been bought.
</P>
<P>
   Few had as much to worry about, however, as those companies
whose core function was selling gift certificates online. With so
much of the business dependent on holiday shoppers, and with so
many companies crowding into this niche, even executives of the
most well-known sites felt uptight about what the new year would
bring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely something we were concerned about,'' said
Robert Levitan, chief executive of Flooz.com, a site that enables
users to buy and send an online scrip _ essentially the equivalent
of gift certificates _ that can be redeemed at various stores on
its site. ``Would we have a big drop? Would our business be too
cyclical?''
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly enough, Flooz and its cadre of competitors _
including GiftCertificates.com, Giftpoint.com and
800GiftCertificate.com, among others _ need not have lost sleep. So
far this year, most of these sites report that weekly revenues are
actually increasing, despite the fact that post-holiday sales to
consumers have leveled off.
</P>
<P>
   Sound like a contradiction? As it turns out, the online
gift-certificate business is benefiting from, of all things, the
nation's labor shortage. As companies struggle to attract and
retain workers, many are turning to corporate gift programs _ and
online gift certificates, they say, are a cheap easy and way to
bestow employee perquisites.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Cohen's Fashion Optical, a regional chain of
eyewear stores, rolled out a program six months ago with
800GiftCertificate.com. When they meet certain sales goals, the
company's 300 employees receive points they can redeem for gift
certificates, according to Robert Cohen, the company's chief
executive. ``Employees use them to buy books, dinners _ they're all
over the place with them,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   For management, one of the primary benefits of such a program is
that workers can log onto a page on the 800GiftCertificate site to
track points earned toward their awards. The service, Cohen said,
saves ``tons of paperwork'' and eliminates a multitude of phone
calls to the human resources manager by employees checking on their
incentive status.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Dermer, chief executive of 800GiftCertificate.com, said
that roughly 70 percent of the company's sales were to
corporations, not consumers. As a result, he said, the site is
buffered from the major seasonal swings that might otherwise beset
the gift business.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the fourth quarter, much of the corporate giving that
happens is about cash bonuses,'' Dermer said. As a result, the
company's corporate sales softened even as the consumer sales
jumped, resulting in less of an overall spike in holiday sales than
other types of e-commerce sites may have experienced.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Nielsen, chief executive of Giftpoint.com, said the whole
point of the company's business-to-business initiative was that it
would provide sales stability. ``We're clearly hoping Christmas
2000 will be gigantic _ and I can't believe I'm talking about
Christmas 2000 _ but the business-to-business program will level
things off'' between now and then, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Giftpoint.com offers buyers the choice of receiving gift
certificates through the mail or e-mail, many companies choose the
e-mail option ``because they want them to be more Internet savvy,''
Nielsen. ``In general, more of the business-to-business market is
moving to the online gift certificates.''
</P>
<P>
   Levitan, whose Flooz.com site has also experienced increasing
revenues in the post-holiday weeks, said corporate sales during
that time had exceeded 50 percent of the total. American Greetings,
he said, purchased 300,000 Flooz certificates for a corporate gift
program, while Starbucks also bought a large block of certificates
for its salespeople.
</P>
<P>
   Flooz.com typically makes a 5 percent commission on every sale
made through the site. Recently, however, Levitan said he had been
able to increase his take by negotiating a ``customer acquisition
fee'' from some retailers in lieu of a commission.
</P>
<P>
   Levitan would not disclose fees paid by specific retailers. But
he offered a hypothetical example. ``Instead of making $2.50 on a
purchase of $50, a store might pay, say, $20 for that customer,''
he said. ``You've got a 40 percent margin all of a sudden.''
</P>
<P>
   The company earns that acquisition fee regardless of how many,
or how few, times the customers return to the retailer through
Flooz. But that may change, Levitan said, as retailers seek to
fine-tune the fee structure.
</P>
<P>
   Levitan says Flooz can extract such fees, in part, because it
offers retailers near exclusivity within a particular category. For
instance, Flooz added Toys ``R'' Us.com, the Internet arm of Toys
``R'' Us Inc., to its store last week, he said, ``but we won't have
EToys.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People might say that with time, customer acquisition costs
will go down, but it's actually getting harder to find customers,''
Levitan said. ``And I don't see that changing anytime soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Such revenue-boosting strategies may become more important in
the coming months, analysts said, as more online gift companies and
gift certificate sites look to the so-called B-to-B _ or,
business-to-business _ sector for sales. If the economy continues
to steam ahead and the labor shortage drags on, a glut of
gift-giving companies is all but a sure thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's approaching the B-to-B market now,'' said Ken
Cassar, an analyst with Jupiter Communications. ``Rather than
spending huge amounts of money on branding efforts to appeal to the
consumer market, they can spend that money on sales forces to court
corporate America. But because everyone's pursuing that strategy,
they're going to find their sales forces tripping over each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   And they will also be tripping on the feet of companies outside
their category. Businesses like 1800Flowers.com and Proflowers.com
are moving more aggressively into the corporate gift market, as are
gift sites like Camdens.com and RedEnvelope.com. These businesses
can provide corporations a range of gifts for their customers to
select online, analysts said, just as the gift certificate
companies do.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the gift certificate companies are not being ignored
by consumers simply because the December holidays have passed.
``There's a lot of background noise gift giving that goes on all
year,'' said Jonas Lee, chief executive of GiftCertificates.com.
``Sales are still pumping. We're seeing a lot of birthdays, thank
you's, that kind of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Those types of gift-giving events are precisely the reason why
the chocolatier Godiva, a unit of the Campbell Soup Co., turned to
online gift certificates, and Flooz in particular, late last year.
Archie van Beuren, Godiva's chief executive, said: ``People tend to
think of Godiva around now, and around the holidays maybe. This
gives us a way to stay top-of-mind for other gift-giving times when
maybe they might not otherwise think of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Godiva had seen an increase in gift certificate
sales for Valentine's Day, van Beuren said ``sales are continuing
to build, but it's hard to tell if it's seasonal.''
</P>
<P>
   Dermer, of 800GiftCertificate.com, played down Valentine's Day
as a big holiday for his industry. There is a decided lack of
romance to receiving online scrip. ``At the end of the day, you're
still giving someone a code,'' he said, although he noted that his
company did offer an electronic gift certificate intended for
Valentines Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might work for moms and sons, maybe women buying for
husbands _ but definitely not for men to give to women,'' Dermer
said. ``I'm sure someone will try it, though, and get themselves in
a lot of trouble.''

EPA FEARS NEW VICTIMS OF ASBESTOS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREW SCHNEIDER and CAROL SMITH  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Environmental Protection Agency investigators are scouring store
shelves to see if consumers are unknowingly buying asbestos, and
the lethal fibers have turned up in some of the products they have
tested.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators caution against overreacting to the
preliminary test results. But some of the findings, involving
commonly used household products, could be a cause for concern.
</P>
<P>
   The asbestos industry stymied the agency almost a decade ago,
winning a suit to overturn the EPA's ban on asbestos. Nevertheless,
agency staffers say, they have a responsibility to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ban or no ban, we still have an obligation to take whatever
actions necessary to protect the public health,'' says John Melone,
director of EPA's National Program Chemical Division. ``There are
too many flags going up about possible problems with asbestos for
us not to pay attention.''
</P>
<P>
   In Dallas, Neil Pflum, EPA's asbestos coordinator for the
southwest states, is examining building products found in
home-improvement stores.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, Keven McDermott of EPA's Pacific Northwest
Investigative Response Team and her partners are testing potting
soil, vermiculite and other lawn products for asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   In Libby, Mont., Paul Peronard is EPA's on-scene coordinator.
His emergency response team has found lingering asbestos from a
vermiculite mine that closed ten years ago. He wants the agency to
consider whether the public is at risk from millions of bags of
home insulation sold across North America by W.R. Grace &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   These environmental investigators have to work with two stinging
realities:
</P>
<P>
   Since the U.S. and Canadian asbestos industries won their suit
to overturn EPA's ban on asbestos in 1991, tools to regulate
consumers' exposure are virtually nonexistent. And asbestos has
been known as a relentless killer for a century.
</P>
<P>
   Deaths from the microscopic fibers came in waves.
</P>
<P>
   Workers in World War II, who manhandled enormous amounts of
heavy asbestos insulation into warships and tanks, died by the
thousands. Most suffered for decades the slow, lingering deaths of
suffocation from asbestosis and the lung cancer it spawned. Others
died just months after being diagnosed with mesothelioma, a
fast-spreading cancer of the lining of the lungs.
</P>
<P>
   Construction workers, spraying asbestos-laden fireproofing onto
the steel skeletons of tens of thousands of new buildings in the
'60s and '70s, were the next wave of deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The body count grows today. The EPA is worried that new victims
could be exposed to the dusty and deadly fibers of deteriorating
asbestos applied to schools, warehouses and buildings a generation
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Add to the eventual death list the hundreds of vermiculite
miners and their families from the Grace mine in Libby, and the
workers throughout the country who processed the ore.
</P>
<P>
   Count in firefighters who wore coats and used hoses woven from
asbestos fabric, race car drivers and test pilots who used thinner
asbestos material to protect themselves from exploding fuel, and
automotive mechanics who changed brake shoes and pads.
</P>
<P>
   The list of victims is long.
</P>
<P>
   Public-health experts say that since the latency period -- the
time from exposure to when the disease surfaces -- can be as long
as 40 years, the body count from asbestos will grow well into this
new century. Doctors estimate that asbestos will kill more than
250,000 Americans over the next 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   What is unknown is the risk to the multitude of people who had
far lower exposure to asbestos than the miner, the builder or the
shipyard worker -- the consumer.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA investigators testing products off store shelves are
concerned about exposure to a new generation.
</P>
<P>
   Asbestos is a generic term used to describe a number of
naturally occurring fibrous minerals including chrysotile, amosite,
crocidolite, anthophyllite, actinolite and tremolite.
</P>
<P>
   All have been proved to kill.
</P>
<P>
   The asbestos fibers found in attic insulation and garden
products is tremolite, a natural contaminant of vermiculite. In
other products, Canadian chrysotile is usually the asbestos added
for fire protection, strength or abrasive qualities.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the asbestos industry, depending on what type of
fiber they're handling, has been quick to point fingers at other
types as being more dangerous. For example, the Canadians insist
their chrysotile is safe, but American tremolite is the killer.
U.S. firms say just the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Asbestos is asbestos,'' says Peronard. ``They all present a
health hazard and that's enough to trigger EPA's concern.''
</P>
<P>
   In Libby, where hundreds of vermiculite miners and their family
members have died or become ill with asbestosis, lung cancer or
mesothelioma, it is microscopic fibers of tremolite asbestos that
are doing the killing.
</P>
<P>
   Tremolite fibers are thin and needle-like and under the
microscope appear like javelins.
</P>
<P>
   ``The health experts that we're working with in Libby are
telling us that the 1 percent asbestos content that allows EPA
action may be higher then the threshold often linked to cancer,
especially when the asbestos is tremolite,'' Peronard says. ``This
is something we want to pin down.''
</P>
<P>
   Peronard and his team arrived in the Northwestern Montana town
in November, three days after the Post-Intelligencer began a series
of articles on the severe health problems of the miners and their
families exposed to asbestos from the now-closed vermiculite mine.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the vermiculite was sold by Grace as attic
insulation and as a soil enhancer for gardens. For the 30 years it
operated the mine, Grace shipped millions of tons of vermiculite
throughout North America.
</P>
<P>
   Peronard and his colleagues from the U.S. Public Health Service
question the whether Grace's attic insulation, called Zonolite,
contains enough asbestos to be dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're testing the insulation in the homes in Libby and will be
asking other regions to check it out,'' Peronard says. ``We're not
saying it's dangerous, but we want to find out what we're dealing
with.''
</P>
<P>
   Grace stopped mining the vermiculite in Libby when it closed the
mine in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   But last week, while two of McDermott's team members, Jed Januch
and Dave Terpening, were gathering bags of vermiculite and lawn
products in the Seattle area, they found 10 bags of Grace's
Zonolite stacked in a garden store in Kent.
</P>
<P>
   EPA tested the contents of the large green and brown bag and
found asbestos contamination. The Post-Intelligencer bought a bag
at the same store, had it tested at a different lab and asbestos
was also detected.
</P>
<P>
   In their preliminary testing, McDermott and her team found
asbestos fibers in two other garden products being sold locally,
but she said ``A lot more testing has to be done before we know
what we really have.''
</P>
<P>
   EPA asbestos experts say that even if a home is insulated with
asbestos-laced vermiculite, the hazards are probably minimal unless
the homeowner disturbs it.
</P>
<P>
   Asbestos specialists in the agency advise homeowners to avoid
contact with the insulation and if the material is not leaking into
the house, the risk should be acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   However, they caution that if the Zonolite is being replaced or
removed in a renovation, the homeowner must use a respirator with
``Hepa'' cartridge. The little blue cloth or paper dust masks won't
keep the asbestos fibers out. Additional precautions can be
obtained from the EPA or local and state environmental offices.
</P>
<P>
   Grace, which sold millions of bags of vermiculite attic
insulation and for decades was the nation's largest producer of
vermiculite for horticultural products, repeatedly said there was
nothing dangerous in its products, a claim the company maintains
today for vermiculite being mined and sold from its mine in Enoree,
S.C.
</P>
<P>
   EPA has long been concerned about the potential health effects
to workers and consumers from asbestos-contaminated vermiculite,
with its first studies going back to the '70s and '80s. Its last
report, in 1991, stated that 188,000 people were exposed to
asbestos-contaminated vermiculite in attic insulation, 32 million
from garden fertilizer and 74 million from other lawn products, but
there was no interpretation of the risks involved. Studies on the
health effects of these exposure to the public were strongly
recommended by the researchers involved, but were never funded.
</P>
<P>
   The Reagan and Bush administrations failed to support EPA's
efforts to ban asbestos. And the Clinton White House, which touts
itself as ``environmentally sensitive,'' has done nothing in the
past seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, EPA has renewed, at least on a small scale, its
efforts to see if the public is at risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years there has been speculation over whether the
manufacturers have actually taken the asbestos out of the end
products or not,'' Melone says. ``There is a long history of
concerns with vermiculite products and what these products may
actually contain. This looks like the time to try and untangle the
maze and pin down the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   EPA's Seattle team has purchased 16 bags of various vermiculite
products.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got lots of calls from citizens who had read the P-I's
stories on the death of the miners in Libby from the contaminated
vermiculite and they wanted to know whether it was safe to use
these products,'' McDermott says. ``We just didn't have the
information on whether there was asbestos in these products or not,
so we decided to test them.'' She added, ``The public has a right
to know whether common household products are safe, or contain
cancer-causing ingredients such as asbestos.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the asbestos industry and some physicians insist that if
anyone is at risk from asbestos it is only workers who are exposed
to huge doses over a period of years, not consumers.
</P>
<P>
   But researchers at the National Institute for Occupational
Safety and Health disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ``The effect after several decades of a one-time acute dose (of
asbestos) of limited duration . . . may be as harmful as the
cumulative effect of lower daily doses of exposure over many years
of work,'' the agency's doctors reported in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   ``We work under the assumption that there is no safe level of
asbestos exposure. Asbestos is like a time bomb. Once you've been
exposed you don't know how your body will respond over time. Our
goal is to determine whether there is asbestos in these products
and then minimize the exposure,'' McDermott says.
</P>
<P>
   With most toxic materials it may take multiple exposures before
a dangerous level of exposure is reached. But asbestos has the
capability to cause irreversible harm with just a single exposure.
</P>
<P>
   The NIOSH doctors agree, saying a single fiber deeply embedding
itself in the right place in the lung could be all it takes to
develop Mesothelioma.
</P>
<P>
   In EPA's laboratory in Manchester, Washington, across Puget
Sound from Seattle, Januch and other team members have installed
air monitoring equipment in a 3-x4-foot sealed enclosure.
</P>
<P>
   Monday they will begin working with the vermiculite products to
see if asbestos is released in normal use of the material.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take a lot of work, but we're hoping to
accurately duplicate what the consumer does to determine whether
they are potentially exposed to when they use these products,''
Januch says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our toxicologists will evaluate the results to determine
whether there is a health risk or not.''
</P>
<P>
   In Dallas, Pflum says with over 3,000 products on the market
with asbestos in them, the research that's being done on consumer
products is vital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely. It's very important,'' the asbestos coordinator
says. ``People just don't know that the ban was overturned.''
</P>
<P>
   Other EPA regions and headquarters helped Pflum determine which
building products commonly used in the construction of schools,
homes and public buildings should be tested.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole idea was to go out and see if we could find asbestos
and if we found any, see if the manufacturer warned the consumer
that the product contained asbestos,'' Pflum says.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA ordered the testing of 20 different categories of
products, a total of 50 individual samples.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three categories of products came back hot, containing over
one percent asbestos,'' Pflum says. ``Four others came back with
traces of asbestos.''
</P>
<P>
   Research done by scientists in preparation for EPA's 1989
attempt at banning asbestos showed that while the fibers were
encapsulated within the tiles, surfacing, pipe and other products,
they were released into the air, sometimes in heavy concentrations,
while the material was being cut, molded sanded, buffed or
otherwise worked with.
</P>
<P>
   Pflum and McDermott declined ito identify the specific products
they were examining until additional confirmation testing was
completed.
</P>
<P>
   But Pflum did say that of the hot samples, those at or above
EPA's action level, two were fairly uncommon products, but one
contaminated category is something that could be found in many
homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have a significant number of products that come back at
over one percent asbestos, which is our definition of
asbestos-containing material, then we will urge headquarters to
consider developing a labeling rule,'' Pflum says.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, back in EPA headquarters, Melone says he's waiting
for the reports from the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they find will guide what the agency does next,'' says
Melone.

REGULATION BATTLE CENTERS ON PROFITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREW SCHNEIDER and CAROL SMITH  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The asbestos industry's zeal in fighting government regulation
centers on protecting its bottom line. Just the fear of applying
hazard warning labels generated concerns for profits.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate memos from W.R. Grace &AMP; Co. offer a flavor of the
internal debate:
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that a decision to affix asbestos warning labels to
our products would result in substantial sales losses.'' Grace
executive vice president E.S. Wood wrote on May 24, 1977.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``The risk of liability to customers is heightened by
the decision not to label our products.''
</P>
<P>
   The memo concluded, ``While we have no evidence of any adverse
effects of our products on consumers, neither can we offer
convincing evidence that they are absolutely safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Grace was also concerned about losing several of its major
consumer product lines.
</P>
<P>
   Wood said Grace presumed that ``the present controversy over
regulation of materials containing asbestos will be resolved by the
Consumer Product Safety Commission in favor of a complete ban on
consumer products containing asbestos fibers unless they can be
shown to be `bound.'' But added he expected ``an eventual ban on
unbound asbestos-containing consumer products.''
</P>
<P>
   He predicted ``a high risk that our products will be banned in
several signficant uses,'' and cited the Zonolite attic insulation
and horticultural vermiculite.
</P>
<P>
   But three years later, in an April 1980 letter to CPSC, Wood
stated:
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that consumer products containing vermiculite and
sold by Grace do not generate unreasonable risks for users.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter cited tests that simulated consumer use of Grace
insulation and gardening products.
</P>
<P>
   Grace made the decision not to label products, taking the
position that tremolite fibers which contaminated the vermiculite
could go unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   Only through the use of ``elaborate techniques not commonly
recognized or employed in the scientific community for detection of
asbestos'' in their potting soils and fire proofing could the
tremolite asbestos fibers be detected,'' a 1977 memo reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``For this reason, we are taking the position with all but
authorized government authorities that our mixed products are
`non-asbestos' products.''
</P>
<P>
   Grace's memos indicated that it would handle requests for
information on asbestos differently for the government and
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``... customers will be answered by indicating that we have
small amounts of tremolite present in the product and by referring
them to the OSHA regulations covering asbestos-containing products.
Obviously, in responding to government inquiries we intend to
provide specific data that identifies trace levels of tremolite
even in mixed products.''
</P>
<P>
   Wood also pointed out in the letter to CPSC that it would cost
the company too much money to try to reduce the level of
contamination any further.
</P>
<P>
   Today, according to Grace Vice President of Public and
Regulatory Affairs William Corcoran, the company still stands by
its testing procedures and its position on the safety of its
consumer products.

NEW UNIT'S DRESS REHEARSAL FOR DISASTER
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., N.J., Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands)   (rk) 
 By C.J. CHIVERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LATHAM, N.Y. _ The unmarked convoy arrived in the gray-blue
light of dusk, seven dark trucks winding through Albany's suburbs
and stopping upwind of a gymnasium here. Soon groups of soldiers in
gas masks and chemical-protection suits began trudging through the
snow. They were in for a long night.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers were part of a simulated gas attack on an upstate
arena, and had been told only that a small bomb had been detonated
at a basketball game, spreading vapors that sickened a dozen
spectators. As local firefighters kept their distance, the soldiers
were assigned to enter the contaminated area to find out what
happened. Was it anthrax? A blister agent? Nerve gas? A noxious
prank?
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's go,'' said the team's commander, Lt. Col. Robert L.
Domenici, as his soldiers tugged their equipment from the trucks.
</P>
<P>
   The 22-member team is part of a newly formed cadre of full-time
specialists created to help local police departments and
firefighters after a chemical, biological or radioactive attack.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon is forming 27 of these groups, called Weapons of
Mass Destruction Civilian Support Teams, which fall under the
command of the state National Guards and are assigned to zones
established by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Their
missions are to assess the scope and severity of a terrorist attack
by sampling suspected germs, chemicals or radioactive material, and
then to advise civilian agencies on how to deal with it.
</P>
<P>
   The team training in Latham, stationed at Stratton Air National
Guard Base in Scotia, N.Y., and assigned to cover New York, New
Jersey, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, begins its final
Department of Defense evaluation exercises Tuesday at Fort Drum. It
is expected to be on call by April, along with nine of the other
teams around the nation. The remaining teams are scheduled to be on
duty by spring of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The team includes former Marines, Army rangers, a Green Beret
and an airman once assigned to a Titan 2 nuclear missile silo in
Arkansas. Once these service members were trained to kill, whether
by bayonet, smart bomb or nuclear strike. Now they form a
protection team, more likely to be deployed in Buffalo than Beirut.
Their only weapons are pistols.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've thought about it a lot, about how I went from being a
killer to turning around and being a defender,'' said Tech. Sgt.
Robert J. Fruggiero, 36, of Saratoga, N.Y., who spent much of the
1980s maintaining a nuclear weapon he described as ``basically
designed to blow a hole in the ground, a half a mile in diameter,
800 feet deep.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big shift,'' he said. ``And I tell you, I feel a lot
better about this, compared to what I used to be doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Another team member, Spc. Brian A. Gordon, 24, of Coxsackie,
N.Y., and a former marine infantryman, said in characteristic
Marine Corps fashion that the change in his work was
``mind-boggling, sir.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that I knew that I was going to go in and kill
somebody with a weapon,'' he said. ``Now it's, `Here's your gas
mask, let's go in there, get the victims out and figure out what
happened.'''
</P>
<P>
   The roots of the civilian support teams reach to events of the
mid-1990s. In a 27-month period from 1993 to 1995, the World Trade
Center was bombed, killing six and injuring more than 1,000; a
religious sect released sarin nerve gas in the Tokyo subway system,
killing 12 and injuring 5,500; and Timothy McVeigh leveled the
federal building in Oklahoma City with a truck bomb, killing 168
and injuring hundreds more.
</P>
<P>
   ``These events changed the psyche of how we are going to defend
the United States,'' Domenici said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Congress passed the Defense Against Weapons of Mass
Destruction Act, which mandated increased domestic preparedness
against terrorist attacks, especially those involving chemical,
biological or nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, the Pentagon decided to integrate the National
Guard into the effort, knowing that Guard units were already placed
in the most vulnerable areas, and that giving state control to the
teams would offset some concerns about the military performing
police duties, which would violate federal law.
</P>
<P>
   The result was the creation of the Civilian Support Teams, which
in 1998 began an 18-month training period to prepare for this new
mission.
</P>
<P>
   Jerome M. Hauer, who recently left his job as director New York
City's Office of Emergency Management, where he supervised the
city's anti-terrorism efforts, said the National Guard teams would
provide an invaluable capability to cities too small to support
specialists of their own. For example, he noted that the teams
would be staged with gear loaded onto trucks, near aircraft, ready
to drive or fly to places throughout their coverage area within
four hours.
</P>
<P>
   Hauer also said he expected the teams to see action. ``It is my
belief that, at least in the near term, the biggest terrorist
threat is from guns and conventional bombs,'' he said. ``But the
dynamic is changing, and I think that over the next 10 years a
chemical or biological weapon will be used in the United States.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Brig. Gen. William C. Martin, deputy commander of New York's
National Guard, watched the group's final exercise in Latham. He
said the team, with its full-time soldiers and $7.8 million in
equipment and recent training, is a departure from the recent past,
when the Guard trained mainly to reinforce active-duty forces in
missions overseas, and almost all its soldiers worked part-time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were so focused on a Cold War mentality that we weren't
relevant anymore'' to national defense, he said. ``Once we had the
luxury of fighting our nation's wars on someone else's soil. That
doesn't exist the same way today.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside, between snow banks, Tech. Sgt. Jeffrey Quinn, 37, a
former Green Beret medic, watched over Sgt. Peter C. Nestor and
Gordon as they prepared their gear for a survey of the contaminated
area. Quinn said he had a personal motivation behind his new work.
His aunt, uncle and two cousins were badly injured in the bombing
of a hotel in Kenya on New Year's Eve, 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been touched by terrorism,'' he said. ``And when I heard
they were putting together something like this, to help with
civilian casualties, and to safeguard home soil, I saw the ability
to bring some peace of mind to people. So here I am.''
</P>
<P>
   The two soldiers donned their blue suits, gloves, boots, heavy
air packs and masks. They left Quinn behind and walked slowly
toward the gymnasium, dragging a cart full of detection equipment.
In this exercise, civilian casualties had been evacuated before the
team arrived, and local hospitals needed to know what chemicals had
been dispersed that made them sick.
</P>
<P>
   Inside a small exercise room, the soldiers found the simulated
remains of a bomb, and began testing the residue. Their work was a
mix of brute strength and finesse, alternately requiring moving
debris and manipulating small detection kits, which involved
breaking open jelly-bean-sized ampuls or mixing fluids and
collecting residue with cotton swabs.
</P>
<P>
   For men wearing four pairs of gloves, weighted by equipment, and
peering through face masks and plastic hoods, the work was tedious.
Their masks steamed up in minutes.
</P>
<P>
   While waiting for the results of the nerve gas detection kit,
the pair slowly searched the rest of the gymnasium for other
threats. They found grainy powder on the floor, and suspected a
biological agent. Minutes later, after testing the powder, they got
a simulated reading. ``Positive hit, anthrax,'' Gordon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Positive hit on anthrax,'' Nestor said by radio to the
commanders outside.
</P>
<P>
   Then the operation shifted. Bernard Kirk, an evaluator from the
New York's Department of State, decided to apply stress. He
designated Gordon a casualty, and ordered him to slump over,
paralyzed as if the nerve gas in the other room had penetrated his
protective suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brian, talk to me, talk to me,'' Nestor said, pressing his
mask close to Gordon's face. A muffled voice replied, ``I can't
walk.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to drag you out of here,'' Nestor said, and lugged
him toward the door. The specialist's suit hissed as his limp body
slid along the waxed floor.
</P>
<P>
   Back outside, Quinn and his medics and decontamination crews
were scrambling. A group of soldiers ran to the door and loaded
Gordon onto a stretcher. They began washing him at a mobile
decontamination site they had built, and soon were pulling him out
of his protective suit.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Paul A. Fanning, a National Guard member who wandered
through the exercise taking pictures, watched as the specialist
emerged from the suit, steam rising from his tattooed arms. His
peers rushed him into the medical tent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope we never have to do this for real,'' the colonel said.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the unit, thoughts ran a wide range. Domenici, the
commander, said he was not satisfied. It was nearing midnight. The
evaluation exercise was only days away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll eat dinner,'' he said. ``And then let's do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   The exercise ended at 7 a.m.

TERM LIMITS DISRUPT POLITICAL LIFE IN STATE LEGISLATURES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, Fla., Calif.)  (mk) 
 By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ As term limits gradually take effect in 18
state legislatures across the country, the time strictures so
popular with voters are turning seasoned leaders from office,
nipping political careers and prompting unusual party maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
   A new sort of fast-forward politicking spawned by term limits is
exemplified here in Ohio, where the majority Republican leadership
is trying to name three different Statehouse speakers over the next
three years in advance of term limits that start with this
November's elections.
</P>
<P>
   Such fleeting leadership is a far cry from fabled legislative
bosses like the late Speaker Vern Riffe, who fiercely wielded the
Ohio gavel for two decades. But it is one of the new laws of
compressed politicking being forged under term limits, in which
affected states initially see a third or more of all incumbents
forced to depart.
</P>
<P>
   Similar wholesale disruptions of political life, with local and
county politicians moving more quickly into the statehouse, have
been taking place in the six states that have instituted term
limits since 1996. Five more, led by Ohio and Florida, are about to
introduce limits, while another seven are to have them in effect by
2007.
</P>
<P>
   California, a pioneer in term limits, saw its Statehouse
leadership initially decimated. But proponents emphasize that a
younger and more diverse crop of lawmakers took office. One out of
four legislators in Sacramento is now a woman, up from 17 percent a
decade ago, and Latinos hold 19 percent of the seats, up from 6
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Comparable changes in representation are hoped for by proponents
of term limits here and in Florida, where substantial legislative
turnover is also approaching. The first year of term limits in
Florida will find 55 of the 120 members of the lower house and 11
of 40 state senators displaced in the November elections. ``It's
going to bring about better government,'' Gov. Jeb Bush predicts.
</P>
<P>
   The intricate musical-chair leadership deal being attempted in
Ohio is denounced as back-room desperation by the Democratic
minority. But it is defended by Republicans as the only recourse
for heading off a state of constant caucus infighting because of
the large-scale turnover dictated by the eight-year limit that is
about to begin. The Republicans are trying to project future
speakers even though they cannot now be sure future voters will
retain the Republican majority needed to guarantee the tricky deal.
</P>
<P>
   In the first year, the new limits mean that 43 members of the
99-member Ohio House elected in 1998, plus six of the 33 sitting
senators, cannot run again. The wrenching effect, similar to that
experienced in other statehouses with term limits, begins with the
traditional leadership posts where seniority has long been a
dominant factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm onto my third finance committee chairman in the last
year,'' said Speaker Jo Ann Davidson, amazed at how fast this
traditionally powerful plum of a job has been turning over as
qualified lawmakers, doomed for their long experience, resigned
early in the past year to find fresh career opportunities. As a
practical matter, the eight-year maximum is already amounting to
something less than seven years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not good. This is not continuity,'' said Davidson, who
helped to build the three-speaker deal as a transition while she is
forced out under term limits after 20 years of service. ``I
calculate that term limits is costing the Legislature 694 years of
collective experience,'' she ruefully added. ``Now the
institutional memory will be in the hands of the lobbyists and the
legislative staff, when it should rest with the elected
policy-makers.''
</P>
<P>
   Just a few years ago, term limits proved popular with the
public, getting better than 70 percent approval in some states
where they were enacted through referendums. But now, with the
public push for limits appearing to wane, there is evidence that
threatened legislators are having second thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   Bills to repeal or liberalize term limits were submitted last
year in seven of the 18 states that have adopted them, according to
Jennie Drage of the National Conference of State Legislatures. None
has thus far passed, and statehouse leaders are trying to adapt to
the new climate by assigning newcomers to intensive training in
mock debates and committee apprenticeships.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of the rapidly altered politics of term limits abounds,
whatever the ultimate judgment proves to be about the quality of
lawmaking in the term-limited states.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, four members of the Jacksonville City Council
quickly announced for open Statehouse seats, exemplifying the
greatly accelerated career paths of politics in states with term
limits. In Ohio's Hamilton County, four Statehouse seats rated
safely Republican instantly drew 50 candidates. The opportunity for
newcomers presented by term limits has made the primary slate here
next month the most crowded in 20 years, with 56 House and 16
Senate nominations still to be settled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something of a Big Bang,'' Richard Vedder, a political
analyst at Ohio University in Athens, said of the transition to
term limits. ``People have underestimated the political impact this
is going to have as newcomers try to move through uncharted
territory.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Visiting lawmakers from Michigan, where term limits went into
effect last year, cautioned Ohio colleagues that the altered
politics feature such phenomena as a much more highly compressed
style of ambition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freshmen must literally make their move for the speakership by
the end of their first term,'' said the Ohio House minority leader,
Jack Ford, a Democrat. Ford warned that well-heeled lobbyists
sensing the accelerated pace were already more involved in the
grass-roots nominating process, hoping to build relationships
sooner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decry the speakers deal,'' Ford said, contending that
lobbyists played a hand in concocting it. ``It goes against
representative democracy as the epitome of back-room arrogance.
Imagine trying to decide the leadership before the lawmakers who
have that responsibility have even been elected by the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford is seconded by the Republican dean of the Legislature, Rep.
Robert E. Netzley, who says he has never seen such a ``ridiculous''
deal in his 40 years as a legislator. ``It's just plain stupid to
try and determine leaders that far down the line,'' he added, half
hoping the incoming crop will include enough rebels to topple the
arrangement. But Speaker Davidson said the deal, uncertain as it
may be, is the best way to salvage some needed continuity and avoid
perennial caucus battles. Her designated successors agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Term limits presented Ohio with a struggle between the past
and the fast-approaching future,'' said Rep. Larry Householder, the
assistant majority leader who is slated to be the big winner in the
announced tandem speakership. A freshman lawmaker only two years
ago, Householder began an early and energetic campaign for the
leadership. He sensed the term-limit train coming down the line and
traveled the state with campaign signs as he went door to door to
enlist statehouse Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I campaigned for it,'' said Householder, a 40-year-old
insurance dealer who is supposed to share the gavel next year and
hold it outright thereafter for the final three years of his
legislative career, assuming he is re-elected across that time. His
partner in the unusual arrangement will be Rep. Bill Harris, a
65-year-old automobile dealer who is term-limited in 2002 and so,
in the new ways of fast-forward politics, wants to resign a year
early to try for the state Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see the turmoil,'' said Harris, who favored term
limits as a private citizen in 1992, when voters approved the idea
and the focus was on limiting the terms of members of Congress.
Since then, the U.S.Supreme Court has struck down limits in
Congress but not in statehouses.
</P>
<P>
   As a legislator, Harris has come to oppose limits as the need
for critical experience in the Legislature became clearer to him.
</P>
<P>
   His designated successor, Householder, is more optimistic that,
for all the speed, term limits can be made to work. ``I'm all for
it right now,'' he says. ``But I think in '04 when I'm term-limited
I'll probably be scraping my nails across the desk as they drag me
out.''

 &HT;    Chilly Atlanta gives McCain warm welcome
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ More than 1,000 people greeted Sen. John McCain on
Sunday on his first visit to Atlanta in two months for a book
signing-turned-campaign rally that offered new evidence of the
Republican's appeal to Democrats and independents.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's bus caravan pulled into the Peachtree Battle Shopping
Center and a raucous reception on a cold, wet afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Such a crowd at a book signing in Atlanta ranks with those of
hugely successful writers such as Anne Rice and J.K. Rowling.
</P>
<P>
   The outpouring of support surprised and delighted McCain and his
aides as they looked out from the bus window.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to beat Al Gore like a drum,'' McCain said in brief
remarks before entering the Chapter 11 bookstore for a marathon
signing session of his best-selling memoir, ``Faith of My
Fathers.''
</P>
<P>
   The store sold close to 1,000 copies of the book Sunday, said
Dale Glenn, a co-owner.
</P>
<P>
   There were self-described Reagan Democrats, Roosevelt Democrats,
lifelong Democrats, independents and even some Republicans in the
line that stretched from one end of the shopping center to the
other.
</P>
<P>
   Some wore caps and jackets advertising a connection to the
military. One woman, Jean Marshall, polished the POW bracelet she
had worn in the late '60s and early '70s in honor of Air Force Lt.
Michael T. Burns, who was shot down over Vietnam on July 5, 1968.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's 5 1/2 years in a North Vietnamese prison is the main
topic of the book.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt certain he would know Michael, and he said he did,''
Marshall said. She said she was still undecided between McCain and
Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Some people had waited since early morning for a chance to shake
McCain's hand and get his autograph.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also attended a fund-raising reception at the Grand Hyatt
Hotel that was hosted by Lewis Jordan, a co-founder of ValuJet
Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   The $250-a-head event was closed to the media, but John Sours,
the campaign's Georgia chairman, said he was expecting at least 150
people.
</P>
<P>
   It was a dramatically different scene when McCain came to town
in early December. Then, he traveled in a single van, accompanied
by one reporter.
</P>
<P>
   That visit was cut short when he had to fly back to Washington
to vote in the Senate. Among the events canceled that day was the
book signing.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain campaign has made no decision about how much time and
money to spend in Georgia. Its primary is the same day, March 7, as
much bigger prizes in California and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has an overwhelming organizational advantage in the state,
with Sen. Paul Coverdell (R-Ga.) at the top of his campaign effort
here.
</P>
<P>
   But one attraction of Georgia to the McCain campaign is that
there is no voter registration by political party, meaning that all
registered voters can participate in the Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
   There were many Democratic and independent voters in the lines
that stretched the length of the shopping center.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Coggin clutched McCain's book in one hand and a $10
check in the other. ``I wish it could be more,'' Coggin said as she
handed the check to a McCain campaign official.
</P>
<P>
   Coggin, 40, has worked in the campaigns of former Democratic
state Sen. Julian Bond and Reform Party candidate H. Ross Perot.
She echoed many people in the line when she said, ``His character
is what attracted me. There is no way that won't transfer over to
his presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   Marc Glenn, a son of the store's owner, was, at 18, the youngest
delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1992. He was
pledged to Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years later, Glenn said, ``I am still a big Bill Clinton
fan.''
</P>
<P>
   But the 25-year-old, a new lawyer, said he will cast his ballot
this year for McCain.

<P>
   MITROVICA, Kosovo _ French troops killed an Albanian gunman
during fierce fighting in the streets of this bitterly divided town
Sunday in the most sustained clashes involving peacekeeping troops
since they arrived in Kosovo eight months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Over a dozen people were wounded, including two French soldiers,
and 17 people were arrested by early Sunday evening after French
troops _ recently accused of not cracking down hard enough on
violence here _ moved aggressively to pin down the gunmen.
</P>
<P>
   Both Serbs and Albanians regard Mitrovica as the last
battlefield of the war for Kosovo and as such unfinished business.
Sunday, the international troops seemed to have been caught in the
middle of that battle.
</P>
<P>
   Gunfire and explosions sounded over the northern part of the
town _ home to some 9,000 Serbs, but also to 1,500 Albanians _ for
some five hours, and smoke billowed from two burning houses.
French, Italian and British troops came under fire on different
occasions. British troops, deployed last week on the central bridge
that divides the town into north and south, exchanged fire with
snipers on the north side several times. By late Sunday afternoon,
the shooting had ceased and French troops had surrounded a house
and begun to negotiate for the men inside to surrender.
</P>
<P>
   A former commander of the Kosovo Liberation Army, who said in an
interview by telephone that he had been involved in the fighting,
said Serbs had attempted to attack an area of Albanians and that
fighters of the now-outlawed Albanian guerrilla force had fought
back to defend the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nine Albanians were injured today, including one of our
soldiers,'' the former commander said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Serbs have made the north of the city a bastion of Serb control
and refuge for thousands of people displaced from elsewhere in
Kosovo. Albanians, thousands of whom have still not been able to
return to their homes in the north, consider it the last place
still to be liberated from Serb persecution.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides assert that the other wants to control Mitrovica
because Kosovo's most valuable natural assets _ iron ore and
precious metal mines _ are scattered in and around the town.
</P>
<P>
   A Serb community leader, Oliver Ivanovic, threw the blame for
the fighting on the Albanians. ``They are not satisfied. They're
looking for big trouble,'' he said. He expected further violence
through the night, despite a 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew, he said.
``They will not stop. They will do something more.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently with the agreement of the French, he was posting men
on the tops of buildings throughout the Serb area to keep watch
overnight despite the curfew. They would be wearing yellow
reflecting armbands to show KFOR that they were unarmed, he said.
Dozens of tough-looking young men moved in and out of his office
shortly before the curfew began to collect the yellow armbands.
</P>
<P>
   Mitrovica has been rocked by violence for the last 10 days and
several hundred British, Belgian, Danish and German troops have
been sent as reinforcements to the French who are in command of the
area. The violence, both grenade attacks and shootings, has
centered on the northern side of the city.
</P>
<P>
   There have been injuries among both ethnic communities and
nearly 1,000 Albanians have been forced to flee their homes on the
north side to the Albanian-populated south. Then, on Saturday
evening, French troops surrounded and searched the Dolce Vita cafe,
the main hangout for hardline Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   The heaviest fighting Sunday occurred in the so-called Bosnian
quarter, a dense warren of alley ways close to the river Ibar,
which is mostly populated by Albanians, but where some Serbs also
live. It is an area that Albanians have vowed to defend from what
they say are Serb efforts to purge it of Albanians, and which Serbs
say is a center of terrorists who attack Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's violence began with a grenade explosion near an
Albanian bakery around 7 a.m. in the Bosnian quarter on the north
side of the river. Five Albanians were wounded in the grenade
attack and brought to the Moroccan military hospital, said Col. Dr.
Ahmed Muden, chief of the hospital. Two of the wounded were treated
and allowed home, the other three were hospitalized. One, he said,
was in a serious condition. The wounded were all men, from ages 22
to 35, he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was three hours later that shooting broke out across town.
Pistol shots were suddenly answered by automatic gunfire. Two
French soldiers were wounded, one in the stomach, and one in the
arm when a gunman opened fire on their position in the Bosnian
quarter. U.N. police described it as an unprovoked attack on the
soldiers, who were part of a static guard deployed to protect
Albanians in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Italian troops on a bridge nearby opened fire. French troops
immediately moved some 30 to 40 armored vehicles into the northern
part of Mitrovica across the bridges. The shooting escalated, and
British troops came under sniper fire from across the river at
their positions on the central bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Three Serbs were wounded during the day, including one who was
with French troops when they came under fire, and another, a
civilian, who was injured in his foot outside his apartment
building, Ivanovic said.
</P>
<P>
   An Albanian man was found in the street in a pool of blood in
the middle of the day. The man was in a coma when he was brought to
the Moroccan hospital and died shortly afterward, doctors said. A
statement from the NATO-led Kosovo peacekeeping force later said
the Albanian was a gunman who had been shot dead by French soldiers
who had come under fire.
</P>
<P>
   Three men were injured in exchanges of fire with peacekeeping
troops, one of them the dead Albanian, British Warrant Officer Mark
Cox, a spokesman for the peacekeepers, said Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Some 17 people had been arrested during the day, Cox said,
including the men surrounded in the house.  &QL;

</P>
<P>
   As French troops pursued the gunmen who had apparently fired on
them, automatic gunfire and grenade explosions rang out over the
Bosnian quarter. French snipers appeared on the roof of a tall
apartment building overlooking the area and an observer helicopter
hovered at a distance. Nearby, the smoke of a burning house still
rose from the charred rafters.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-afternoon, the shooting ceased and negotiations began.
``They are Albanians inside. It is not clear who they are or why
they are doing this,'' said French public affairs officer, Lt.
Charles-Philippe d'Orleans, watching the proceedings. French troops
with armored vehicles had cordoned off the street. ``We gave them a
sharp riposte with the gun mounted on the top,'' d'Orleans said.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of Serbs watching nearby were in no doubt. ``They are
terrorists. They are attacking us all the time. We cannot go on
living like this,'' said Branko Barovic, a man on crutches and a
known hardliner in the town.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, the exodus of Albanians from the north side
continued, a human outpouring that started when four Albanians were
killed and several Serbs were injured in a night of violence Feb.
3. Sunday, one family escaped their house as it was set alight,
U.N. police said. Flora Zabrgja, 22, and her mother Kimete
Zabrigja, 57, were among those to flee under sniper fire after four
days hold up in their apartment, terrified their Serb neighbors
would attack them.
</P>
<P>
   ``After they searched the Dolce Vita, the Serbs went crazy,''
Zabrgja said. Then, she said, French troops came and told them to
go. As they headed for the bridge, shots rang out. They took cover
in a troop carrier on the bridge for two hours, and then ran the
length of the bridge with British soldiers carrying their bags for
them.

 &HT;    EDs: Includes info on death of Charles Schulz in 3rd graf.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Peanuts appreciation: Being Charlie Brown
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's enough to make you lie on a doghouse roof and moan, ``Why?
... Why?'' It's enough to make you sit on a curb and say, ``Rats!''
It's enough to make you stand all day on a pitcher's mound in the
rain after everyone has gone home.
</P>
<P>
   It's enough to make you run for therapy, but you can't _ the
crabby girl psychiatrist is ``Out,'' and never coming back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peanuts'' is ambling off into the sunset, taking along its
humble creator. Charles M. Schulz, 77, died in his sleep Saturday
night at his home in Santa Rosa, Calif. His wife, Jeannie, was with
him.
</P>
<P>
   For a half-century that feels about, oh, six weeks (50 years fly
when you're having fun!), ``Peanuts'' has been a boon to the
nation's mental health, providing not only laughter but also a kind
of four-panel analyst's couch. For the price of a newspaper we
could watch someone else (usually Charlie Brown) endure rejection,
mockery, bewilderment and existential angst, sometimes venting it
with an ``AUGHHHHHHH!'' but more often with a gentle ``Sigh.''
</P>
<P>
   What other comic strip would have the vision, the simplicity,
the sheer chutzpah to use ``Sigh'' as a punchline _ in the '50s,
yet? At a time when other strips used slapstick sight gags and
heroes with strong jaws and thick blue-black hair, Charlie Brown
was way ahead of his time. With no jaw at all, and little hair, he
was a postmodern abstraction of Everyboy. He was as alienated as a
James Dean character but without a speck of the charisma. He was
radically blah. He was so unassertive and round of skull that his
friends once used the back of his head to draw a map of the world.
He was the chalkboard upon which we projected our disappointments
and our fat-chance! dreams of being a baseball hero or being adored
by the little red-haired girl.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this pieface martyr had to find strength within himself, for
when he sought help with ``psychiatrist'' Lucy, she said, ``Get
over it. Five cents, please.''
</P>
<P>
   Schulz was angry when one commentator called Charlie Brown a
loser, because, he said, ``How can you say that when he never stops
trying?''
</P>
<P>
   Snoopy as swami
</P>
<P>
   It was just as therapeutic to see Snoopy breeze through life. He
was ying to Charlie Brown's yang, as liberated from cares as his
owner was lumbered by them. Snoopy didn't sit around moaning about
fantasies _ he lived them, as hipster, novelist, Legionnaire,
surfer, golfer, vulture, World War I Flying Ace. Talk about
evolution: an ordinary beagle during the 1950s, Snoopy in 1960
stood upright and became a biped. He stopped sleeping indoors and
instead, like a swami on his bed of nails, took to balancing
trancelike on the peak of the doghouse roof. So free was Snoopy
that, when the spirit of the Flying Ace was in him, his doghouse
lifted off the ground and streaked over the skies of ``Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Pretty mind-bending stuff for a sweet little family comic strip.
</P>
<P>
   Like St. Francis of Assisi, Snoopy was joyful enough to talk to
the birds. One of them _ that bohemian-looking, fluffy-top
Woodstock _ told Snoopy that his philosophy was ``Small is
beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, ``Peanuts'' was square _ proudly square _ but in its own,
slightly offbeat, Zen-like way.
</P>
<P>
   Look at any other strip running when ``Peanuts'' started in
1950, and it looks like a dinosaur, frozen in time. Cartoonist Al
Capp took pot shots at ``Peanuts'' for its neuroses in his ``Lil'
Abner'' strip, but Schulz _ as ``Abner'' fades in collective
consciousness _ has the last laugh. ``Peanuts,'' with its spare,
shapely design, still fits on a Third Millennium funnies page,
displaying the classic, timeless line of a Coke bottle or a 1965
Mustang. In the words of Patrick McDonnell, Schulz's friend and
fellow cartoonist (``Mutts''), `` `Peanuts' is so well drawn that
you always know what those kids are thinking behind those little
ink-dot eyes. `Peanuts' was always on top of it.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time when Little Orphan Annie had zeroes for eyes, Lucy had
worry lines around hers. There was something almost Samuel
Beckett-ish in the absurdist mini-plays involving Spike, Snoopy's
lonely brother in the desert; the Great Pumpkin, like Godot, never
comes. The ``Peanuts'' kids may live in a generic, All-American
suburb, like Dennis the Menace, but its undercurrents of
philosophical questioning and atomic-age anxiety came straight from
the Left Bank.
</P>
<P>
   A force for education
</P>
<P>
   ``Peanuts'' had no adults and didn't need them because the kids'
speech was so grown-up. Schulz made literacy cool and so was a
force for education. The Minnesota native's drawings were so
charming that he made kids want to read better, to understand the
jokes about Tolstoy and the Book of Job and ``Citizen Kane.''
(Remember how Lucy spoiled the movie for Linus, telling him,
``Rosebud's the sled'' and causing him to scream ``AUGHHHHHHHH!''
in anguish?)
</P>
<P>
   Steve Jones of Sylvania, Ala., wrote in an e-mail to The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, ``Charlie Brown, when I was a little boy, you
alone drew me into the world of books. Thanks for helping raise us
all.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just the adult in the kid that made ``Peanuts'' a
lifelong habit for many of us, it was the kid that never left the
adult. Schulz embraced his inner child long before it became a buzz
phrase. There is a lot of Charlie Brown in Charlie Schulz _
beginning with the fact that they both had salt-of-the-earth,
barber dads. Journal-Constitution columnist Rheta Grimsley Johnson
wrote in her 1989 biography, ``Good Grief : The Story of Charles M.
Schulz,'' that the cartoonist's loneliness dates back to his
mother's untimely death _ a ``grief that he kept fingering like a
rosary.''
</P>
<P>
   In Schulz's life there really was a crabby little girl _ his
first daughter, Meredith, the model for Lucy, and it was she who
banged on the toy piano that turned up under Schroeder's precocious
hands. There really was a weird year of Schulz's boyhood in
Needles, Calif., the same barren setting for Spike and the talking
cacti. There really was a little red-haired girl (now a
white-haired Minnesota housewife) who broke Schulz's heart and got
engaged to another guy just when 20-year-old Sparky was about to
pop the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sparky feels those defeats as if they happened yesterday,''
Johnson said recently, ``examines them as if they were day-old
wounds.''
</P>
<P>
   There were fewer surprises, no major new characters, as the
strip headed into its final 25 years; younger generations seem not
to have embraced it like us baby boomers. Yet the wit never lost
its edge. Johnson declares: ``The strip never grew stale or fell
out of style because it was never `stylish' to begin with.''
</P>
<P>
   Many faces of the dreamer
</P>
<P>
   There's a theory that in dreams, all characters are aspects of
the dreamer. Schulz has confessed how each ``Peanuts'' character is
a thread of himself _ including Lucy, when he's in one of his
bitter moods. Perhaps that's where the strip gets its dreamlike
quality, the sense that we're seeing the many layers of one lively
psyche being revealed, within an ironically ordinary, ``normal''
suburban setting.
</P>
<P>
   One senses, too, special closeness between Linus and his
creator. Perhaps it's because of the lovable absurdity of a
pint-sized scholar who can quote Scripture (Schulz was a devout
member of the Church of God as a young man) yet drags a ratty
blanket around all day. Hence the term security blanket, invented
by Schulz. The cartoonist knows well that under our grown-up
costumes, no matter how big our job titles or mutual funds may be,
there will always beat the heart of a needy tyke.
</P>
<P>
   Schulz writes in ``Peanuts: A Golden Celebration'' that in first
grade, everyone was assigned to make a valentine for another
student; not wanting to hurt anybody's feelings, he made one for
everyone. Then he got so self-conscious about stuffing them all
into a box in front of the class that he failed to deliver any.
</P>
<P>
   Now consider the strip in which Charlie Brown tries to steal
home and slides! ... but comes to rest in a cloud of dust only
halfway down the base line, blowing the game. Night falls. We see
Charlie Brown, still lying on his back, crying, ``Why? ... Why?''
</P>
<P>
   Linus is sent out in his pajamas to ask him to lower his voice
so everyone can sleep. The last panel is Charlie Brown saying in a
tiny voice, ``Why?''
</P>
<P>
   Below the black comedy of that scene, there is unspoken
tenderness, a sense that, although no one ever bothered to tell him
directly, Charlie Brown had a secure place in his world. He was
loved.
</P>
<P>
   And so were the ``Peanuts'' readers. It seems that Charlie
Schulz _ in his shy, Charlie Brownish way _ delivered those
valentines after all. Every day, for 50 years.

 &HT;    Peanuts appreciation: Being Charlie Brown
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's enough to make you lie on a doghouse roof and moan, ``Why?
... Why?'' It's enough to make you sit on a curb and say, ``Rats!''
It's enough to make you stand all day on a pitcher's mound in the
rain after everyone has gone home.
</P>
<P>
   It's enough to make you run for therapy, but you can't _ the
crabby girl psychiatrist is ``Out,'' and never coming back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peanuts'' is ambling off into the sunset, taking along its
humble creator. Charles M. Schulz, 77, died in his sleep Saturday
night at his home in Santa Rosa, Calif. His wife, Jeannie, was with
him.
</P>
<P>
   For a half-century that feels about, oh, six weeks (50 years fly
when you're having fun!), ``Peanuts'' has been a boon to the
nation's mental health, providing not only laughter but also a kind
of four-panel analyst's couch. For the price of a newspaper we
could watch someone else (usually Charlie Brown) endure rejection,
mockery, bewilderment and existential angst, sometimes venting it
with an ``AUGHHHHHHH!'' but more often with a gentle ``Sigh.''
</P>
<P>
   What other comic strip would have the vision, the simplicity,
the sheer chutzpah to use ``Sigh'' as a punchline _ in the '50s,
yet? At a time when other strips used slapstick sight gags and
heroes with strong jaws and thick blue-black hair, Charlie Brown
was way ahead of his time. With no jaw at all, and little hair, he
was a postmodern abstraction of Everyboy. He was as alienated as a
James Dean character but without a speck of the charisma. He was
radically blah. He was so unassertive and round of skull that his
friends once used the back of his head to draw a map of the world.
He was the chalkboard upon which we projected our disappointments
and our fat-chance! dreams of being a baseball hero or being adored
by the little red-haired girl.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this pieface martyr had to find strength within himself, for
when he sought help with ``psychiatrist'' Lucy, she said, ``Get
over it. Five cents, please.''
</P>
<P>
   Schulz was angry when one commentator called Charlie Brown a
loser, because, he said, ``How can you say that when he never stops
trying?''
</P>
<P>
   Snoopy as swami
</P>
<P>
   It was just as therapeutic to see Snoopy breeze through life. He
was ying to Charlie Brown's yang, as liberated from cares as his
owner was lumbered by them. Snoopy didn't sit around moaning about
fantasies _ he lived them, as hipster, novelist, Legionnaire,
surfer, golfer, vulture, World War I Flying Ace. Talk about
evolution: an ordinary beagle during the 1950s, Snoopy in 1960
stood upright and became a biped. He stopped sleeping indoors and
instead, like a swami on his bed of nails, took to balancing
trancelike on the peak of the doghouse roof. So free was Snoopy
that, when the spirit of the Flying Ace was in him, his doghouse
lifted off the ground and streaked over the skies of ``Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Pretty mind-bending stuff for a sweet little family comic strip.
</P>
<P>
   Like St. Francis of Assisi, Snoopy was joyful enough to talk to
the birds. One of them _ that bohemian-looking, fluffy-top
Woodstock _ told Snoopy that his philosophy was ``Small is
beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, ``Peanuts'' was square _ proudly square _ but in its own,
slightly offbeat, Zen-like way.
</P>
<P>
   Look at any other strip running when ``Peanuts'' started in
1950, and it looks like a dinosaur, frozen in time. Cartoonist Al
Capp took pot shots at ``Peanuts'' for its neuroses in his ``Lil'
Abner'' strip, but Schulz _ as ``Abner'' fades in collective
consciousness _ has the last laugh. ``Peanuts,'' with its spare,
shapely design, still fits on a Third Millennium funnies page,
displaying the classic, timeless line of a Coke bottle or a 1965
Mustang. In the words of Patrick McDonnell, Schulz's friend and
fellow cartoonist (``Mutts''), `` `Peanuts' is so well drawn that
you always know what those kids are thinking behind those little
ink-dot eyes. `Peanuts' was always on top of it.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time when Little Orphan Annie had zeroes for eyes, Lucy had
worry lines around hers. There was something almost Samuel
Beckett-ish in the absurdist mini-plays involving Spike, Snoopy's
lonely brother in the desert; the Great Pumpkin, like Godot, never
comes. The ``Peanuts'' kids may live in a generic, All-American
suburb, like Dennis the Menace, but its undercurrents of
philosophical questioning and atomic-age anxiety came straight from
the Left Bank.
</P>
<P>
   A force for education
</P>
<P>
   ``Peanuts'' had no adults and didn't need them because the kids'
speech was so grown-up. Schulz made literacy cool and so was a
force for education. The Minnesota native's drawings were so
charming that he made kids want to read better, to understand the
jokes about Tolstoy and the Book of Job and ``Citizen Kane.''
(Remember how Lucy spoiled the movie for Linus, telling him,
``Rosebud's the sled'' and causing him to scream ``AUGHHHHHHHH!''
in anguish?)
</P>
<P>
   Steve Jones of Sylvania, Ala., wrote in an e-mail to The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, ``Charlie Brown, when I was a little boy, you
alone drew me into the world of books. Thanks for helping raise us
all.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just the adult in the kid that made ``Peanuts'' a
lifelong habit for many of us, it was the kid that never left the
adult. Schulz embraced his inner child long before it became a buzz
phrase. There is a lot of Charlie Brown in Charlie Schulz _
beginning with the fact that they both had salt-of-the-earth,
barber dads. Journal-Constitution columnist Rheta Grimsley Johnson
wrote in her 1989 biography, ``Good Grief : The Story of Charles M.
Schulz,'' that the cartoonist's loneliness dates back to his
mother's untimely death _ a ``grief that he kept fingering like a
rosary.''
</P>
<P>
   In Schulz's life there really was a crabby little girl _ his
first daughter, Meredith, the model for Lucy, and it was she who
banged on the toy piano that turned up under Schroeder's precocious
hands. There really was a weird year of Schulz's boyhood in
Needles, Calif., the same barren setting for Spike and the talking
cacti. There really was a little red-haired girl (now a
white-haired Minnesota housewife) who broke Schulz's heart and got
engaged to another guy just when 20-year-old Sparky was about to
pop the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sparky feels those defeats as if they happened yesterday,''
Johnson said recently, ``examines them as if they were day-old
wounds.''
</P>
<P>
   There were fewer surprises, no major new characters, as the
strip headed into its final 25 years; younger generations seem not
to have embraced it like us baby boomers. Yet the wit never lost
its edge. Johnson declares: ``The strip never grew stale or fell
out of style because it was never `stylish' to begin with.''
</P>
<P>
   Many faces of the dreamer
</P>
<P>
   There's a theory that in dreams, all characters are aspects of
the dreamer. Schulz has confessed how each ``Peanuts'' character is
a thread of himself _ including Lucy, when he's in one of his
bitter moods. Perhaps that's where the strip gets its dreamlike
quality, the sense that we're seeing the many layers of one lively
psyche being revealed, within an ironically ordinary, ``normal''
suburban setting.
</P>
<P>
   One senses, too, special closeness between Linus and his
creator. Perhaps it's because of the lovable absurdity of a
pint-sized scholar who can quote Scripture (Schulz was a devout
member of the Church of God as a young man) yet drags a ratty
blanket around all day. Hence the term security blanket, invented
by Schulz. The cartoonist knows well that under our grown-up
costumes, no matter how big our job titles or mutual funds may be,
there will always beat the heart of a needy tyke.
</P>
<P>
   Schulz writes in ``Peanuts: A Golden Celebration'' that in first
grade, everyone was assigned to make a valentine for another
student; not wanting to hurt anybody's feelings, he made one for
everyone. Then he got so self-conscious about stuffing them all
into a box in front of the class that he failed to deliver any.
</P>
<P>
   Now consider the strip in which Charlie Brown tries to steal
home and slides! ... but comes to rest in a cloud of dust only
halfway down the base line, blowing the game. Night falls. We see
Charlie Brown, still lying on his back, crying, ``Why? ... Why?''
</P>
<P>
   Linus is sent out in his pajamas to ask him to lower his voice
so everyone can sleep. The last panel is Charlie Brown saying in a
tiny voice, ``Why?''
</P>
<P>
   Below the black comedy of that scene, there is unspoken
tenderness, a sense that, although no one ever bothered to tell him
directly, Charlie Brown had a secure place in his world. He was
loved.
</P>
<P>
   And so were the ``Peanuts'' readers. It seems that Charlie
Schulz _ in his shy, Charlie Brownish way _ delivered those
valentines after all. Every day, for 50 years.

   BEIRUT, Lebanon _ After a three-week offensive against Israeli
forces in southern Lebanon, the militant Islamic group Hezbollah,
the Party of God, says it has no plans to halt the attacks so
Israel can fulfill its promise to withdraw from the area by early
July without further losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as there are Israeli forces in southern Lebanon, our
resistance will continue,'' said Houssein al-Khalil, a key aide to
Hassan Nasrallah, the elusive Shiite Muslim cleric who leads the
group. ``Our main aim is that Lebanon will be free of occupation.
We will conquer the Israelis, and they will be seen to be the big
losers in this war.''
</P>
<P>
   Al-Khalil, at a meeting with Western reporters Saturday evening,
said Hezbollah had no reason to trust Israel's withdrawal pledge,
since, he said, Israel had frequently broken promises during its
peace negotiations with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, he implied, Hezbollah wished to sustain its recent
military successes. Since the last week of January, seven Israeli
soldiers have been killed, which is among the heaviest tolls
Hezbollah has inflicted on Israeli troops in any similar period
during a 15-year confrontation in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has responded to the attacks by bombing three Lebanese
power plants, cutting the country's electricity supply by 50
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah's attacks on Israeli troops have posed new obstacles
to efforts to restart the suspended peace talks between Israel and
Syria, which collapsed last month over Syria's demand for the
return of the Golan Heights, Syrian territory that Israel occupied
in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
</P>
<P>
   Syria, with Iran, is a major backer of Hezbollah, and has been
asked by the United States, in telephone calls between Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright and the Syrian foreign minister, Farouk
al-Sharaa, to intervene with Hezbollah to get the attacks halted.
</P>
<P>
   Syria's response has been that it does not control Hezbollah.
But Western diplomats in Beirut say the Damascus government
undoubtedly sees diplomatic gains in increasing military pressure
on what is Israel's last ``active'' military front.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah, in any case, appears to be in a mood that might make
it resistant to any appeals from Syria. Although Hezbollah's
arms-supply line runs through Syria, which controls much of Lebanon
with a Syrian military force of 40,000 troops, Hezbollah officials
have asserted that they could use Lebanon's coast, though it is
heavily patrolled by Israel, to smuggle weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fight the Israelis because they are occupiers, without
taking into account the Syrians' opinions, whether they accept it
or not,'' said al-Khalil, 45, who made it clear that he was
speaking on the authority of Nasrallah, the Hezbollah leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't take any direction from the Syrians,'' he said.
``Sometimes we agree, sometimes we don't agree. Whether we attack
or don't attack, the Syrians don't have anything to say about it.
In any case, we don't accept any connection between the
Israeli-Syrian peace talks and what we do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hezbollah official made his remarks at a meeting arranged in
the clandestine fashion long associated with the group, which is
ultimately guided by political and religious patrons in the Islamic
hierarchy that rules Iran.
</P>
<P>
   From a Hezbollah press office in Haret Hreik, a Beirut suburb,
the reporters were loaded into vehicles with darkened windows, and
then taken down narrow alleyways, across rubble-strewn lots into a
darkened basement garage and up an unlighted stairwell into a dingy
apartment block.
</P>
<P>
   On an upper floor, armed aides ushered the reporters into a
lighted suite that appeared to be a cross between a political
headquarters and a library, with bookshelves stacked with Islamic
texts and prayer rugs. The entrance hall alone displayed 10
portraits of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, leader of Iran's Islamic
revolution.
</P>
<P>
   The precautions reflected Hezbollah's fears of an attack by
Israeli forces, which have assassinated Nasrallah's two
predecessors as the party's leader, as well as numerous other
Hezbollah officials.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago a Hezbollah military commander in southern Lebanon
narrowly escaped death, Hezbollah officials say, when a missile
fired by an Israeli helicopter hit a building behind a Hezbollah
car.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel made a major election plank
last year of withdrawing troops from the nine-mile deep ``security
zone'' that Israel has occupied in southern Lebanon since 1985. He
has pledged to complete the pullback by July 7 regardless of
whether the Israel-Syria peace talks resume and regardless, too, of
the military situation in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   But Hezbollah officials appear to regard their attacks as a
prologue to claiming, after the Israeli pullout, that it was
Hezbollah's military pressure, and not the broader changes in the
security climate surrounding Israel in recent years, that drove
Israeli troops out.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years the Islamic group has grafted a new image as an
above-ground political force onto its 1980s past, when Hezbollah,
or groups to which it was closely linked, were notorious for brutal
terrorist operations, including destroying the U.S. embassy in 1983
and killing 241 Americans at a Marine compound later the same year.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah's strategy now, Lebanese political analysts say, is to
use the offensive in southern Lebanon to broaden its political
support inside Lebanon, where it has established itself as a
significant parliamentary force.
</P>
<P>
   Conversations in Beirut and elsewhere in Lebanon in recent days,
however, suggest that many Lebanese, while respecting Hezbollah for
taking on the Israeli forces, seem less than convinced that the
price was worth it, considering Israel's pledge to withdraw anyway.
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Lebanese officials say that the Israeli attacks on the power
plants could take six months and $50 million to repair.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, diplomats and Lebanese analysts say, Hezbollah faces
uncertain times after the Israelis withdraw, since it will have to
choose between attempting a continuing war with Israel, with
suicide bomb attacks and rocket strikes across the Israeli border,
and abandoning the military struggle for a role as a political
force in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Many Lebanese say the war option may be closed, since Syria,
assuming it has reached its own peace with Israel, might be
disinclined to support it, and the 60,000-man Lebanese army,
itching to move into southern Lebanon after the Israeli withdrawal,
would be likely to go to war with Hezbollah to prevent Lebanon
being drawn into further conflict with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Many Lebanese recall bitterly how the country's descent into
chaos began when Palestinian groups used Lebanon in the late 1970s
to attack Israel, touching off the Israeli invasion in 1978 that
led, in 1985, to Israel's declaration of the southern security
zone.
</P>
<P>
   In Hezbollah's secretive inner councils, the implications of the
Israeli withdrawal are almost certainly being intensively debated,
since the option of abandoning military action for life as a
political party also has its drawbacks in a country where Shiite
Muslims, though they are Lebanon's largest single religious sect,
are probably not more than 1.2 million in a total population of 3.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   The quandary appeared to be reflected in al-Khalil's response
when he was asked if Hezbollah intended to fight on after the
Israeli pullback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until now, we have been using our force in the territory of
Lebanon,'' he said. After the Israelis withdraw, he said, ``we will
sit together among ourselves and discuss the question.''

CONFUSION FOLLOWS THE JONESES TO THE METS' TRAINING CAMP 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. _ Same time, same joke, new spin.
</P>
<P>
   Last February, when the Mets right-hander Bobby Jones arrived at
Thomas J. White Stadium for spring training, his equipment was
thousands of miles away in Tucson, Ariz. The Louisville Slugger
manufacturer, whose gloves Jones uses, had sent his stuff to the
Colorado Rockies' training camp, where it waited in the locker of
the other Bobby Jones, a left-hander.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the two Joneses are teammates on the Mets. Pitchers and
catchers don't officially report until Tuesday, but the first
confusion of the season has already taken place. When Bobby J.
Jones _ the seven-year Met _ showed up over the weekend, he found
gloves belonging to Bobby M. Jones in his locker.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was just a messup from the staff here,'' the right-hander
said Sunday, laughing. ``They should know I'm not left-handed by
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Only John Franco has been with the club longer than Jones, who
debuted for the Mets in 1993, when they lost 103 games. When they
finally reached the playoffs last season, Jones couldn't
contribute. After the Mets beat Cincinnati in the one-game playoff
to win the National League wild card, General Manager Steve
Phillips told Jones he would not be on the postseason roster.
</P>
<P>
   Jones was disappointed; he had relieved three times in September
after missing nearly four months with shoulder trouble, and he felt
he could have helped. But Phillips had also assured Jones that the
bullpen assignment was only temporary, and now Jones is back in the
rotation on a team that shed four starters over the winter.
</P>
<P>
   There will be competition for the fifth spot _ Bobby M. Jones,
Bill Pulsipher, Glendon Rusch, Dennis Springer and Paul Wagner are
the candidates _ but Jones will be in the fourth, supporting Mike
Hampton, Al Leiter and Rick Reed. He has not started since last May
22, however, and believes nothing is a given.
</P>
<P>
   ``You come into spring thinking that you have to compete and you
have to win your job,'' said Jones, an All-Star in 1997, who will
make $5.25 million this year. ``There are some guys who are
penciled in right now. If I'm one of them, I don't know. I've been
told by Steve that they are looking for good things from me, and
that basically tells me I'm going to be in the starting rotation. I
go about it where I'm going to go out and prove myself this
spring.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones left spring training last year feeling as strong as he
ever had, and he was 3-0 with a 3.09 earned run average in April.
But in May, something changed. His pitches had no life, and thus
had no movement. Every pitch had to be in thrown in the perfect
location. His fastball had dropped from 87 miles an hour to 80-82
mph, and he was experiencing shoulder tendinitis that he first
attributed to a simple dead-arm phase.
</P>
<P>
   But rest never improved the condition, and a magnetic resonance
imaging test revealed a small tendon tear. Jones spent the winter
getting therapy to strengthen his rotator cuff, and threw now and
then. After playing long toss Sunday with Bobby M. Jones, he said
he th's back to where he was before the injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any pain when I throw, which I did before,''
Jones said. ``Every once in a while you may have a little ache, but
I think that's just part of the healing process. But no pain during
throwing, so that's a good sign.''
</P>
<P>
   The signs will stay positive, as long as Jones can help it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they wanted to look at it and make sure it's healed, I
don't know if I would want to do that,'' he said. ``If I see it's
not completely healed, then there will be that doubt. Maybe if I
feel something later down the road, then I'll have it looked at.
But until I'm feeling discomfort or pain, I would just assume it's
healed and go as normal.''
</P>
<P>
   As normal as life can be, anyway, when your namesake plays the
same position for the same team. Jones _ whose nickname is
``Jonesey'' _ was hopeful Sunday morning that different nicknames
would help distinguish the pitchers. After throwing together, the
two Joneses went for a run around the complex. Bobby J. planned to
ask Bobby M. if he had a nickname.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby M. Jones does.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Jonesey,'' he said. ``I think that's what they call
everybody whose last name is Jones.'' &QL;

WORLD BANK UNIT TO JOIN IN INTERNET START-UP FINANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Internet, with English as its dominant language and the
United States its dominant backer and beneficiary, has created a
digital divide, with some poor nations watching from afar as the
World Wide Web transforms commerce and creates vast new sources of
wealth in the developed countries.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first major efforts to bridge the gap is to be
announced Monday in Tokyo. The World Bank's International Finance
Corp. unit has teamed up with Softbank of Japan to create a $200
million fund that will finance Internet start-ups in 100 developing
countries. The International Finance Corp. will also join
Softbank's existing plan to invest $300 million in Internet
companies in China and Latin America, bringing the total amount
they are devoting to third world Internet development to $500
million.
</P>
<P>
   The new venture, named Softbank Emerging Markets, will provide
seed capital to entrepreneurs building Internet businesses in poor
countries. It will also seek to transfer successful e-commerce
business models and train managers to apply them, World Bank
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The digital divide is one of the greatest impediments to
development, and it is growing exponentially,'' the World Bank's
president, James D. Wolfensohn, said in a statement. ``We are
taking a lead in the effort to close the gap. This investment will
accelerate the inclusion of the developing countries in the
information revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Softbank is one of the most successful backers of Internet
businesses in the United States. It has provided seed capital for
Yahoo, ETrade and Buy.com, among others. The International Finance
Corp. is the for-profit investment banking arm of the World Bank,
the Washington-based institution that aims to promote economic
development in poor countries.
</P>
<P>
   Softbank Emerging Markets, based in Silicon Valley, plans to
make its first investments this spring. In addition to providing
capital, the fund will become a joint venture partner with
companies it finances. Some back-office and strategic planning
services will be centralized in Silicon Valley, according to a
description of the business plan provided by the World Bank and
Softbank.

<P>
   Barely a year after joining AT&AMP;T, H. Eugene Lockhart, president
of the company's core consumer unit, intends to step down,
executives close to the company said Sunday. An announcement of
Lockhart's departure is expected Monday, the executives said.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart's future plans were unclear Sunday, but one executive
close to AT&AMP;T said Lockhart intended to join a start-up operation
that would give him a significant equity stake in his new company.
</P>
<P>
   Word of Lockhart's departure was first reported Sunday by the
trade magazine Advertising Age. An AT&AMP;T spokeswoman declined to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart's departure would probably not be seen as a significant
operational blow to AT&AMP;T, because he has been at the company only
since January 1999. But his leaving could nonetheless raise
troubling questions about the ability of C. Michael Armstrong,
AT&AMP;T's chairman, to identify and retain key executive talent.
</P>
<P>
   Before the hiring of Charles H. Noski, a former colleague of
Armstrong's from Hughes Electronics, as AT&AMP;T's chief financial
officer in December, Lockhart had been perhaps Armstrong's most
senior hire.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong had recruited Lockhart, a former chief executive of
Mastercard, to assume the new position of chief marketing officer
at AT&AMP;T. AT&AMP;T has long been seen as an also-ran to MCI Worldcom in
the raging communications marketing wars.
</P>
<P>
   When Daniel H. Schulman, the previous head of AT&AMP;T's consumer
unit, left last June to become president of Priceline.com, the
Internet shopping service, Lockhart was promoted to president of
the division. In 1998, Gail McGovern, a 24-year AT&AMP;T veteran, had
left the same job to join Fidelity Investments.
</P>
<P>
   It may not be difficult to understand why the job at the head of
AT&AMP;T's consumer business has become a revolving door: few
executives like to run shrinking businesses.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, revenue for AT&AMP;T's consumer unit has declined
about 4 percent, to approximately $22 billion. Profit margins have
increased even as revenue has shrunk, however, partly because the
unit has cut back its marketing spending relative to its levels of
just a few years ago.

AS THE PARIAH OF EUROPE, AUSTRIA SEEMS UNBOWED 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria _ As a political entity turned pack of would-be
toughs, Europe is proving unimpressive; it is slapping Austria
around a bit, but is unable to bring it to its diplomatic knees.
</P>
<P>
   France, Belgium and tiny Andorra boycotted a speech here last
Thursday by the new Austrian foreign minister. But they stayed to
take part in the meeting of the Organization for Cooperation and
Security in Europe that she was presiding over.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Austria's new social affairs minister was allowed
to attend a meeting in Lisbon on unemployment. But only the host
would shake her hand, and the others refused to pose for the usual
ministerial family photo.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the German minister seemed to regret his rudeness; the
Belgian and French ministers, who also walked out during her
speech, reveled in theirs.
</P>
<P>
   The conservative caucus in the European Parliament heard a
motion to kick out Austria's People's Party for inviting Joerg
Haider's Freedom Party into government with it. But members said
the motion would not be voted on until April and had no chance of
passing anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Charles postponed a planned summer visit, and the actress
Claudia Cardinale said she would not attend the Opera Ball, the
height of the Vienna social season. But Queen Beatrix of the
Netherlands took her annual Austrian skiing vacation as she has for
the last 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Belgium theatrically canceled an order for seven Austrian
armored cars. But Sweden said it still hoped to sell Austria a
squadron of fighter-bombers.
</P>
<P>
   And the French finance minister, a socialist, may have split the
diplomatic hair of the week when he discovered that his Austrian
counterpart is from Haider's party. ``I'm not sure I'll be talking
much with him,'' the minister told journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Europe is in a quandary. Fourteen of the Continent's foreign
ministers threatened to isolate Austria if it let Haider's
xenophobic party into government. Austria promptly called its
bluff. Now Europe is divided and confused and falling back largely
on bad manners.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an unprecedented situation, and there is no uniform
front,'' said Hans Rauscher, a columnist for Der Standard here.
``It's not a massive, concerted action, but it's pretty strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Europe is not alone in having divided reactions. Israel's
ambassador, the first to leave, is still gone. The U.S. ambassador
returned this past weekend after the State Department tentatively
accepted assurances that Austria would hew to the democratic path.
</P>
<P>
   But the Argentine ambassador was just recalled to Buenos Aires
for consultations after a letter he wrote last October describing
Haider as neither ``an extremist nor a neo-Nazi'' but rather ``a
democrat'' was leaked to an Argentine paper.
</P>
<P>
   Haider has predicted that any censure effort would quickly
crumble. He may be proved right. It isn't just smaller European
countries like Greece and Denmark that are already skeptical. Even
the big powers are subdividing: in Germany, Bavaria broke with
Berlin over isolating its Alpine neighbor, and Italy's provinces
around Trieste, abutting Austria, criticized Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the union has discovered that it needs stability more than
it needs to punish. After the euro slipped last week on rumors that
Austria might be forced out of the monetary union, the European
Union issued a hasty denial that it would impose such a harsh
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   And the fight has strengthened anti-Europe forces. Isolationist
groups in Switzerland and Denmark have gained ground in opinion
polls, citing anger at the drubbing of Austria. Britain's anti-euro
conservatives are crowing their we-told-you-sos.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard to see how the EU can now get out of the hole that
its leaders have dug,'' Peter Ludlow, the director of the Center
for European Policy Studies in Brussels, Belgium, wrote in a
scathing essay in Britain's Financial Times last week.
</P>
<P>
   By aggressive posturing, the other European countries ``exposed
themselves to the risk of a series of humiliating and very public
compromises.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the predicament is systemic: The union is bound by
treaties, not a constitution, and its important decisions, like
those on a common currency or admitting new members, are made by
consensus. It is not a congress, and cannot freeze out or vote down
members. Ministers meet in order to talk.
</P>
<P>
   The other problem is haste. Austria called Europe's bluff so
fast that there was no time to plan a response. With careful
timing, European ministers might have embarrassed Haider over
weaknesses newly revealed: One of his new Cabinet ministers is
accused of bankrolling a right-wing paper that denied the
Holocaust; another once supposedly said that any businesses that
hire more than 10 percent foreigners should not get government
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Europeans ended up snubbing Elisabeth Sickl, the
new social affairs minister, a friendly middle-aged former school
principal who says her values are ``humanist.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the foreign media, which for weeks whipped up images
of Nazism in Austria, are beginning to turn around and suggest that
someone was indulging in hyperbole. For example, the same BBC radio
anchorman who on Feb. 1 asked an Austrian theater director if he
planned to flee the country (the answer was a puzzled ``no'') by
Feb. 10 was asking a European Union spokesman if his organization
had been in the grip of anti-Nazi hysteria (the answer was a
defensive ``no'').
</P>
<P>
   Within Austria itself, protests against the new government,
which were buoyed by the European Union response, continue,
although with less vigor than in the first days. About 15,000
demonstrators shouting ``Resist racism and fascism!'' marched in
Vienna on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The violence that ended one march stopped; the biggest complaint
from police officers is too much overtime. A march that may be
swelled by the trade union allies of the Social Democratic Party,
which was forced into opposition by the new ruling coalition, is
planned for Feb. 18.
</P>
<P>
   It will be interesting to see what happens when Haider defies
the advice of his party and goes to Brussels on Feb. 17. As
governor of Carinthia province, he is on the European Union
committee on regional government.
</P>
<P>
   His advisers urged him to miss the meeting. But Haider answered
them last week with his characteristic mix of cheek and love of the
limelight: ``I'm not going to cancel my trip just because someone
wants to hit me with a tomato.''

CHARLES M. SCHULZ, CREATOR OF BELOVED `PEANUTS,' DIES AT 77 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: An abridged version, OBIT-SCHULZ-ABRIDGED, is also moving.)  
(nk) 
 By SARAH BOXER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Charles Schulz, the creator of ``Peanuts,'' the tender and sage
comic strip starring Charlie Brown and Snoopy that was read by 355
million people around the world, died in his sleep on Saturday
night at his home in Santa Rosa, Calif., just hours before his last
cartoon ran in the Sunday newspapers. He was 77.
</P>
<P>
   Schulz drew ``Peanuts'' for nearly half a century. He swore that
no one else would ever draw the comic strip and he kept his word.
For years he drew ``Peanuts'' with a hand tremor. He finally put
down his pen when he received a diagnosis of colon cancer after
abdominal surgery in November.
</P>
<P>
   His last daily strip ran on Jan. 3. His last Sunday strip
carried a signed farewell in which he said, ``Charlie Brown,
Snoopy, Linus, Lucy ... how can I ever forget them. ...''
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Jeannie, said, ``He had done everything he wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Johnston, a friend of Schulz and the creator of the comic
strip ``For Better or for Worse,'' told The Associated Press,
``It's amazing that he dies just before his last strip is
published.'' Such an ending, she said, was ``as if he had written
it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The lives of ``Peanuts'' and of Charles Schulz were completely
intertwined. ``The strip and he were one,'' said Patrick McDonnell,
who draws the cartoon ``Mutts.'' ``He put his heart and soul into
that strip.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Peanuts,'' which reached readers in 75 countries, 2,600 papers
and 21 languages every day, made Schulz very rich. The ``Peanuts''
strips, merchandise and product endorsements brought in $1.1
billion a year. And Schulz was said to have earned about $30
million to $40 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   His saga of Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Lucy and Linus ``is arguably
the longest story ever told by one human being,'' longer than any
epic poem, any Tolstoy novel, any Wagner opera, observed Robert
Thompson, a professor of popular culture at Syracuse University, on
the PBS ``NewsHour'' with Jim Lehrer. In all Schulz drew more than
18,250 strips.
</P>
<P>
   Jules Feiffer, the cartoonist and playwright, said that the
``Peanuts'' characters endure because they were the first real
children in the comics pages, ones with doubts and anxieties. And
there were a lot of them. ``Linus, Lucy, Charlie Brown _ these
interesting little people formed a repertory company,'' Feiffer
said.
</P>
<P>
   The cast of ``Peanuts'' changed remarkably little. It included
Charlie Brown, a wishy-washy boy with a tree-loving kite and a
losing baseball team; Snoopy, an unflappable beagle with a fancy
inner life; Lucy, a fussbudget with a football and a curbside
psychiatric clinic; Linus, a philosophical blanket-carrier; Sally,
Charlie Brown's romantic little sister; Schroeder, a virtuoso on
the toy piano and a Beethoven devotee; Peppermint Patty, a
narcoleptic D-minus student; and, in later years, Woodstock, a
small, expressive but speechless bird.
</P>
<P>
   Schulz remembered waking up in the night many years ago and
thinking, ``Good grief, who are all these little people? Must I
live with them for the rest of my life?'' The answer was yes.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Monroe Schulz, the son of a barber, like Charlie Brown's
father, was born in Minnesota on Nov. 26, 1922. Young Charles was
nicknamed Sparky after the horse Spark Plug in the comic strip
``Barney Google.'' He had a black-and-white dog named Spike
(memorialized in the character of Snoopy's skinny Western brother).
</P>
<P>
   He wanted to be a cartoonist as a child and practiced by drawing
Popeye. ``Someday, Charles, you're going to be an artist,'' a
kindergarten teacher told him after looking at his drawing of a man
shoveling snow. His ambition was to do a comic strip as good as
George Herriman's ``Krazy Kat,'' but Schulz also admired Picasso,
Andrew Wyeth and Edward Hopper. Snoopy kept a van Gogh and a Wyeth
in his doghouse.
</P>
<P>
   The hurts of Schulz's early years provided a lifetime of
material. At Central High School in St. Paul's, Minn., he flunked
Latin, English, algebra and physics. ``Ripley's Believe It or
Not!'' accepted one of his drawings when he was 15 _ a picture of
Spike illustrating ``a hunting dog that eats pins, tacks and razor
blades'' _ but the cartoons he drew for his high school yearbook
were rejected. Schulz remembered his failures more vividly than his
successes.
</P>
<P>
   After graduation he took a correspondence course from Art
Instruction Inc., but before he could start a career he was drafted
into the Army. He left for boot camp only days after his mother
died of cancer. (Schulz later suggested that this coincidence might
have been the reason for his lifelong hatred of travel.) During
World War II, from 1943 to 1945, Schulz served in France and
Germany and became a staff sergeant in the 20th Armored Division.
He once refused to toss a grenade into an artillery emplacement
because he saw a little dog wander into it.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, he tried various odd jobs: lettering the comics
at a Catholic magazine called Timeless Topix; drawing a weekly
cartoon called ``Li'l Folks,'' the precursor to ``Peanuts,'' for
the St. Paul Pioneer Press; and selling occasional spot cartoons to
The Saturday Evening Post.
</P>
<P>
   He also taught at his alma mater, Art Instruction Inc. There he
fell in love with a redhead, Donna Johnson, and proposed marriage.
She turned him down and married a fireman instead. He never forgot.
Johnson became the Little Red-Haired Girl, Charlie Brown's
unrequited love, who was often talked about but never seen in the
strip. Schulz married Joyce Halverson in 1949; the marriage ended
in divorce.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't create humor out of happiness,'' Schulz said is his
1980 book, ``Charlie Brown, Snoopy and Me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm astonished at the number of people who write to me saying,
`Why can't you create happy stories for us? Why does Charlie Brown
always have to lose? Why can't you let him kick the football?'
Well, there is nothing funny about the person who gets to kick the
football.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The strip's start was bittersweet. In 1949 Schulz submitted some
of his ``Li'l Folks'' comic strips to United Feature Syndicate. The
syndicate liked the strip but insisted on calling it ``Peanuts.''
``I was very upset with the title,'' Schulz once said, ``and still
am.''
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 2, 1950, the first ``Peanuts'' strip was published. It
depicted Shermy and Patty sitting on the sidewalk discussing
Charlie Brown: ``Well, here comes ol' Charlie Brown!'' ... ``Good
ol' Charlie Brown'' ... ``Yes, sir! Good ol' Charlie Brown.'' And
then, as Charlie Brown passes them, ``How I hate him!''
</P>
<P>
   That year, seven newspapers bought ``Peanuts,'' and Schulz
earned $90 a week in royalties. But by 1953, the cartoon was a hit
and he was earning $30,000 per year. In 1955 (and again in 1964)
the National Cartoonists Society awarded Schulz the Reuben for
being the outstanding cartoonist of the year. He received the Yale
Humor Award in 1956 and the School Bell Award from the National
Education Association in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peanuts'' was based on repetition and predictability. As
Schulz put it: ``All the loves in the strip are unrequited; all the
baseball games are lost; all the test scores are D-minuses; the
Great Pumpkin never comes and the football is always pulled away.''
One of the few innovations Schulz introduced was allowing Snoopy
(after eight years) to stand on two feet and to have his thoughts
written out in balloons.
</P>
<P>
   Snoopy could always be counted on to nap, fantasize, and wonder
when his next meal would arrive. Charlie Brown, the round-headed
blockhead (named after one of Schulz's childhood friends, not after
the cartoonist himself), could always be counted on to persevere
despite constant failure. He once held onto the string of a kite
that was stuck in a tree for eight days running, until the rain
made him stop. At the time, it was the longest run of immobility
for any cartoon character. His first home run came after nearly 43
years of strike-outs, on March 30, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   No adult ever appeared in ``Peanuts,'' though in television
specials there were occasional wah-wah sounds denoting the voices
of teachers and parents. As Schulz once put it, ``Well, there just
isn't room for them.'' Curses never got worse than ``Aaugh!''
``Good grief,'' ``Rats!'' ``Curse you, Red Baron!'' or a knot of
lines scrunched up in frustration.
</P>
<P>
   The strips were just the beginning. In 1952, Schulz started
turning out ``Peanuts'' books: ``Peanuts,'' ``More Peanuts,''
``Good Grief, More Peanuts!'' ``Good Ol' Charlie Brown,''
``Happiness Is a Warm Puppy'' and dozens more. New compilations
rolled off the presses every year for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually ``Peanuts'' was translated into Serbo-Croatian,
Malay, Chinese, Tlingit, Catalan and 15 other languages. Books came
out with titles like, ``Het Grote Snoopy Winterspelletjes-Boek''
and ``Du Bist Sub, Charlie Braun.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1960s brought animated ``Peanuts'' television specials. The
first was ``A Charlie Brown Christmas,'' which Schulz wrote in one
weekend with Lee Mendelson. Accompanied by Vince Guaraldi's jazz
piano, animated by Bill Melendez and unassisted by any laugh track,
``A Charlie Brown Christmas'' was shown on CBS in 1965 (and still
runs every winter). It won an Emmy and a Peabody. Many more
television specials followed, including ``It's the Great Pumpkin,
Charlie Brown.'' Five of the specials won Emmys. There were also
``Peanuts'' feature films, including ``A Boy Named Charlie Brown.''
</P>
<P>
   The takeoffs came rolling in. In 1966, the Royal Guardsmen wrote
a rock song, ``Snoopy and the Red Baron.'' In 1967, a musical,
``You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown,'' was produced Off-Broadway. (A
1999 revival on Broadway won two Tony Awards.) ``Peanuts Gallery,''
a concerto, was composed by Ellen Taaffe Zwilich and had its
premiere at Carnegie Hall in 1997. Schulz received the Ordre des
Arts et des Lettres from the French Ministry of Culture. In 1990,
his work was shown at the Louvre; the gala had Snoopys in couture.
</P>
<P>
   Many pundits tried to put their finger on the ``Peanuts'' spell
and they generally rambled on in a vaguely philosophical vein.
Umberto Eco, who wrote the introduction to the first Italian
``Peanuts'' book, referred to Freud, Beckett, Adler, and Thomas
Mann, saying: ``These children affect us because in a certain sense
they are monsters; they are the monstrous infantile reductions of
all the neuroses of a modern citizen of the industrial
civilization.''
</P>
<P>
   In an essay called ``Peanuts: The Americanization of
Augustine,'' Arthur Asa Berger, a scholar of popular culture,
observed that Schulz was ``a mirthful moralist'' and a master of
Freudian humor _ humor that ``serves to mask aggression.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger called Snoopy ``an existential hero in every sense of the
term,'' a dog who ``strives, with dogged persistence and unyielding
courage, to overcome what seems to be his fate _ that he is a
dog.'' He is ``a bon vivant, he participates in history, he has an
incredible imagination, he is witty, he expresses himself with
virtuosity in any number of ways (eye movements, ear movements,
tail movements, wisecracks, facial expressions) and he is a superb
mimic and dancer.''
</P>
<P>
   The most concerted attempt to bring ``Peanuts'' to heel
philosophically came in the 1960s when Robert L. Short, a minister,
wrote two books on Peanuts theology, ``The Gospel According to
Peanuts,'' (1964) and ``The Parables of Peanuts''(1969). Short saw
signs of Original Sin in the ``Peanuts'' children, who were unable
``to produce any radical change for the better in themselves _ or
in each other.'' He saw ``the hazard of worshiping deities''
demonstrated in Linus' belief in the ``Great Pumpkin.'' And he
called Snoopy ``a typical Christian,'' a character with faults who
is nonetheless good: ``He is lazy, he is a `chow hound' without
parallel, he is bitingly sarcastic, he is frequently a coward,''
Short wrote. But he is ``a hound of heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   If the ``Peanuts'' characters left themselves open to the
meanderings of philosophers, ministers and analysts, they were even
more vulnerable to toy, card, book, and clothing manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   The licensing madness began in 1958, when the first plastic
Snoopy and Charlie Brown came out. In 1960, Hallmark began printing
``Peanuts'' cards and party goods. Then came sweat shirts and
pajamas, thermoses and lunchboxes. Plush Snoopy came in 1965.
Woodstock bedroom slippers, Lucy picture frames, Charlie Brown
music boxes followed. Schulz vetted all products for
``appropriateness'' and turned some down: baby wipes (for
``aesthetic reasons''), ashtrays, vitamins, sugary breakfast
cereals, ice-skates and tennis rackets.
</P>
<P>
   There were commercials too. In 1957 the ``Peanuts'' characters
started selling Ford Falcons. For 15 years they worked for the
Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. Snoopy was the official mascot of
National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and in 1969 NASA's
Lunar Excursion Module on the Apollo 11 mission was called Snoopy.
The Command Module was Charlie Brown.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   By 1999, there were 20,000 different new products each year
adorned by ``Peanuts'' characters. In 1994, Schulz was inducted
into the Licensing Industry Merchandisers' Association Hall of
Fame. Jim Davis, the creator of the cartoon ``Garfield,'' who is no
stranger to commercialization, said, ``Schulz created the industry
as far as cartooning and licensing go.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether he minded his characters selling stuff,
Schulz said, ``I don't think there's such a thing as going
commercial with a comic strip, because a comic strip is a
commercial form right from the beginning.'' It is there to sell
newspapers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Forbes listed the cartoonist among the 10 wealthiest
entertainers, earning $32 million per year.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless his lifestyle remained simple. Schulz, who hated to
travel, said he would have been happy living his whole life in
Minneapolis. But ``had a restless first wife,'' so they moved to
Sebastopol, Calif., and he set up his studio in Santa Rosa. In
1969, after the local ice rink closed, he and his wife built a new
one, the Redwood Empire Ice Skating Arena. ``Because of Snoopy's
hockey playing,'' Schulz explained, ``I have to keep in the game.
So I bought an arena.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles and Joyce Schulz had five children. But the marriage
ended in divorce in 1972. He said, ``I don't think she liked me
anymore, and I just got up and left one day.''
</P>
<P>
   A year later, he met Jeannie Clyde at the ice rink and married
her. Schulz's workday typically began with a trip in his Mercedes
(license plate WDSTK1, after Woodstock) down from the hills near
where he lived, breakfast at the ice rink's Warm Puppy Snack Bar, a
trip to his stone-and-redwood studio at One Snoopy Place to draw
his strip, lunch at the ice rink, more work in the afternoon in his
studio and dinner at a restaurant with his wife.
</P>
<P>
   While his small staff dealt with the commercial end of the
business, he attended only to drawing. He used a yellow legal pad
for sketching and drew with an Esterbrook Radial pen. He would
start doodling until something funny happened. He never took
suggestions from anyone (though he did draw on conversations,
newspapers, Bartlett's Familiar Quotations, and his children's
antics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drawing a daily comic strip is not unlike having an English
theme hanging over your head every day for the rest of your life,''
he once said. He could do a strip an hour and six strips a day, but
preferred not to. He generally kept three months ahead of
publication and never took more than 10 days off at a time _ and
then only reluctantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peanuts'' continued to appear when Schulz had quadruple bypass
heart surgery in 1981. And it was only under orders from United
Feature that he took off for five weeks in 1997, for his 75th
birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Jeannie Schulz once said that all the characters in ``Peanuts''
are parts of her husband. ``He's crabby like Lucy, diffident like
Charlie Brown. There's a lot of Linus _ he's philosophical and
wondering about life.'' Like Schroeder, he loved classical music
(though he always liked Brahms better than Beethoven). And like
Snoopy, he was a war buff. Snoopy had all of World War I covered.
But Schulz knew all the World War II battlegrounds and was the head
of a capital fund-raising campaign for the National D-Day Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the Fundamentalist Church of God, a church that
tithes, Schulz was a religious man. He was a Sunday-school teacher
and administrator and would occasionally deliver the Sunday sermon.
He didn't drink or smoke. People described him as looking like a
druggist. He found Garry Trudeau's ``Doonesbury'' and Walt Kelly's
``Pogo'' too political. But he admired the work of Cathy Guisewite,
the cartoonist who draws ``Cathy,'' and Johnston, the creator of
``For Better or For Worse.'' His favorite ice cream flavor was
vanilla.
</P>
<P>
   Schulz is survived by his wife, Jeannie, a philanthropist, and
his children: Meredith Hodges, who raises mules in Loveland, Colo.;
Charles, Jr. (called Monte), a novelist in Nevada City, Calif.;
Craig, a private pilot in Santa Rosa, Calif.; Amy Johnson, who has
nine children and lives in Alpine, Utah; and Jill Schulz Transki,
who runs an inline-skating business with her husband in Santa
Barbara, Calif. He is also survived by two stepchildren, Brooke
Clyde, an lawyer in Santa Rosa, Calif., and Lisa Brockway, of
Ashland, Ore., and 18 grandchildren.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Despite his large family and large success he was a melancholy
man who worried and was often lonely, depressed and plagued by
panic attacks, features that Rheta Grimsley Johnson brought out in
her 1989 biography ``Good Grief: The Story of Charles M. Schulz.''
Sally, Charlie Brown's sister, put it well in a school report on
night and day: ``Daytime is so you can see where you're going.
Nighttime is so you can lie in bed worrying.''
</P>
<P>
   Schulz had a white terrier named Andy, played golf (12
handicap), tennis (regularly with Billie Jean King) and bridge. But
he was most devoted to hockey and ice-skating. He was a
right-handed shot.
</P>
<P>
   He hated cats, coconut and sleeping away from home. And he never
forgot a slight. Johnston once said, ``He's bitter about the little
red-haired girl who didn't marry him. He's bitter about his
divorce. He's bitter about getting old.'' And he was bitter about
the lack of recognition cartoonists get. This is what he said about
cartooning: ``It will destroy you. It will break your heart.''
</P>
<P>
   The creator of one of the least troubled dogs of all time,
Schulz compared his own panic to that of a dog ``running
frantically down the road pursuing the family car.'' The dog ``is
not really being left behind,'' he said, ``but for that moment in
his limited understanding, he is being left alone forever.''
</P>
<P>
   As Schulz got older, he began to think about the end of his
strip. He knew that he didn't want anyone else to draw it.
``Everything has to end,'' he once said. ``This is my excuse for
existence. No one else will touch it.''
</P>
<P>
   In November, he was hospitalized for colon cancer and started
chemotherapy. Shortly thereafter, on Dec. 14, he announced that his
last daily strip would run on Jan. 4.
</P>
<P>
   But thoughts of death had long since crept into his strip.
``After you've died, do you get to come back?'' Linus once asked
Charlie Brown. He replied, ``If they stamp your hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Schulz always felt for the little man and the little animal. He
once said that his personal philosophy of life could be found in
the Gospel of St. Luke: ``It were better for him that a millstone
were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he
should offend one of these little ones.''

SEEKING THE SPIRITUAL CORE OF TWO SCORES 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms)  
By ALLAN KOZINN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Philadelphia Orchestra, just past the midway
point in its season-long survey of the 20th-century orchestral
literature, brought Bartok's Third Piano Concerto and Henryk
Gorecki's Third Symphony to Carnegie Hall on the evening of Feb. 8
in a concert conducted by Wolfgang Sawallisch.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface the two scores would seem to be at odds in every
way: the Bartok, composed in 1945, draws much of its energy from
the complex and carefully balanced relationships between the
strands of its musical fabric and from the drive and determination
inherent in the composer's style. The Gorecki, a series of mournful
Lento movements (its subtitle is ``Symphony of Sorrowful Songs'')
from 1976, draws on the consonance and repetition of Minimalism and
creates the impression of a river moving slowly to the sea.
</P>
<P>
   What they have in common is a spiritual core, touched on
differently by each composer. Bartok was dying when he wrote his
Piano Concerto, and in its central movement, marked Adagio
religioso, there is choralelike writing that has a serenity
uncommon for Bartok and a section that evokes bird calls and that
edges toward the style of another of contemporary music's mystics,
Olivier Messiaen. The Gorecki work began as an Auschwitz memorial,
but in the nine years between his first ideas for the work and its
completion, its scope was expanded and it became a hypnotic
meditation on suffering of all kinds. Its texts, sung by a soprano,
are drawn from a 15th-century lamentation, a prayer inscribed on
the wall of a Nazi cell and a folk song about the death of a son.
</P>
<P>
   Yefim Bronfman, the soloist in the Bartok, found a workable
balance between the work's beauty and the occasional acidity that
gives it its spice. Hard driven though his account of the opening
Allegretto was, it stopped short of aggressiveness. Bronfman's
gentle rendering of the slow movement let its alternately elegant
and painterly forms of prayer come through with touching beauty,
and his nimble account of the finale suggested Bartok's attention
returning to the here and now.
</P>
<P>
   The Gorecki had a freakish success eight years ago, when David
Zinman's recording on Nonesuch sold 1.5 million copies. There is a
tendency in classical music circles to denigrate such success, but
in fairness, it is not as though Gorecki wrote it to pander to
popular tastes. By the time the Nonesuch recording was released, 16
years after the work was completed, there had already been at least
two previous recordings, and sections of the piece were used in a
French film, ``Police,'' all without a great deal of attention.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps what this symphony's success shows is that there is an
audience for works _ even rather dour ones _ that are both deeply
felt and easily assimilated. This one works better on disc than in
the concert hall, where its repetitions can be wearing. That said,
the subtle changes in dynamics and coloration and the glacial
interplay of weighty string lines often seemed to set up the
moments when Gorecki added a sudden dissonance.
</P>
<P>
   Elzbieta Szmytka brought a beautiful, focused and powerful tone
to the vocal sections. In both works Sawallisch and his players
produced a big, solid, polished sound, if one that was blander than
what the Philadelphia can produce at its best.

INDIA MOURNS A MASTER PERCUSSIONIST 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CELIA W. DUGGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOMBAY, India _ The mingled sound of splashes and shouts from
the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Olympic Pool drifted into the cool,
dark room when the park attendant, clad in black Lycra bicycle
shorts, opened the padlocked doors, insisting that all who entered
must first take off their sandals as a sign of respect.
</P>
<P>
   Inside was the small, austere space where Alla Rakha Qureshi,
one of India's most venerated classical musicians, had come most
evenings for the last 15 years. Here, he taught his disciples the
mathematically complex rhythms of the tabla, the humble two-piece
drum that he had elevated to an exalted status in more than half a
century of playing the world's grandest concert halls, often with
the renowned sitar player Ravi Shankar.
</P>
<P>
   On this day, the curtains of this room perched on the Arabian
Sea were drawn and the maestro's voice was stilled.
</P>
<P>
   Alla Rakha, who was universally known by that name, usually
preceded by the honorific Ustad, which means teacher or guru, died
of a heart attack at age 80 on Feb. 3, just hours after his
50-year-old daughter, Razia, died suddenly and unexpectedly after
routine cataract surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``He couldn't bear it,'' said his son Fazal Qureshi, 38,
describing his father's reaction to the loss of the daughter who
had lived at home and tended to his needs, giving him medications,
taking his calls and accompanying him to concerts.
</P>
<P>
   Alla Rakha's students, who were at his side when he lapsed into
unconsciousness, immediately put away their instruments to honor
their guru. And his tabla-playing sons _ Fazal and Zakir Hussain,
who is considered one of the world's greatest living tabla players
_ canceled their performances to rush home.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, the front door to the large family apartment here
has been thrown open. Musicians, dancers, singers and painters have
poured in to console the twice-bereft family and pay their respects
to the man they so often found lost in thought on his sofa,
counting out his calculations of drum beats.
</P>
<P>
   More than any other musician, Alla Rakha brought the tabla to
international prominence during more than 20 years of touring
abroad with Shankar, from the late 1950s until the 1970s. Together
they played at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967, the Woodstock
festival in 1969 and the concert for Bangladesh in Madison Square
Garden in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a fabulous drummer,'' Shankar said. ``His speciality
was a very loving personality. He had such happiness in his
playing.''

 &HT;    Lewis' friend to surrender
 &HT;    By Paul Donsky and Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Joseph Sweeting, one of two suspects still at large in
stabbing deaths of two men in Atlanta, will turn himself in to law
enforcement officials today, his lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   The other man, Reginald ``A.J.'' Oakley of Baltimore, had been
expected to surrender to authorities over the weekend, but as of
Sunday night had not done so.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeting, Oakley and Baltimore Ravens All-Pro linebacker Ray
Lewis, 24, are charged in the Jan. 31 slayings of Richard Lollar,
24, and Jacinth Baker, 21, both of Decatur, Ga. Lollar and Baker
were stabbed to death in a fight at an intersection in Buckhead,
Atlanta's entertainment district. The stabbings occured in the
early morning hours after the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeting, 35, of Miami, will plead not guilty to the charges,
according to his lawyers, John Bergendahl of Miami and Steve Sadow
of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeting and Oakley are being sought by local police in Florida
and Maryland, as well as by the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Police say Sweeting and Oakley were partying with Lewis
and several other people after the Super Bowl at Cobalt, a Buckhead
night club. The group left the club around 3:30 a.m. and soon
afterward, according to police, a fight broke out that involved
Lewis' group and Lollar and Baker.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, through his lawyer, Ed Garland of Atlanta, has maintained
his innocence.
</P>
<P>
   However, police say Lewis deliberately misled them, withheld
information and removed evidence, hindering their investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Under Georgia law, someone can be charged with murder even if
they do not actually kill a person if they are involved in the
commission of a felony that results in a death or cover up evidence
of a slaying.
</P>
<P>
   As Lewis sat in an 8-by-12 foot cell isolated from other
prisoners in the Fulton County Jail, Lewis' grandparents, Gillis
McKinney, his aunt, Gwen Miller and an uncle, the Rev. Clinton
Stancil, prayed for his release in the jail lobby. The vigil was
organized by the Rev. J. Richard Harris of West Palm Beach, Fla.,
who said he has known Lewis since he was in high school.
</P>
<P>
   Several professional athletes had been expected at the vigil,
including Tampa Bay Buccaneers defensive lineman Warren Sapp and
Dallas Cowboys cornerback Deion Sanders, but bad weather delayed
their flights, Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' supporters said police have the wrong man behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ray Lewis is not a murderer,'' Harris said. ``Ray Lewis is not
a villain, he's a victim.''
</P>
<P>
   Family members maintain Lewis tried to break up the fight
outside Cobalt and did not kill anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We truly believe he is innocent,'' said Stancil, who lives in
Kansas City, Mo. ``It's frightening to us that in America ...
people still go to jail for trying to do the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   A bond hearing for Lewis was scheduled for today. Among the
witnesses expected to appear on Lewis' behalf are Ravens owner Art
Modell and Ravens' defensive back Rod Woodson.
</P>
<P>
   The theme of the hearing will be two-fold: Lewis is a good guy,
and he didn't kill anyone, said Don Samuels, one of Lewis' Atlanta
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't do it,'' Samuels said. ``That's one of the factors a
judge is supposed to consider.''
</P>
<P>
   Samuels said the defense will ask that Lewis get a reasonable
bail and be allowed to train with the Ravens while he awaits trial.
</P>
<P>
   Other people to testify on Lewis' behalf include Lewis' high
school coach, his mother, grandmother and other relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Lollar's grandmother, Joyce Lollar, said she has sent a
statement asking that Lewis not get bond.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever killed my grandson should not have any freedom,'' she
said Sunday at her home in Akron, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Journal-Constitution staff writers Joshua B. Good,
Alfred Charles, Janet Frankston, Doug Payne, Rick Badie, John
McCosh, Rhonda Cook, Andrea Jones and Don Fernandez contributed to
this report.

SHORTAGE IN CLERGY LEAVES MORE U.S. PULPITS UNFILLED
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Miss., Ohio., Mich.)   (rk) 
 By NADINE BROZAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Congregation B'nai Israel in Hattiesburg, Miss., has been
without a rabbi for more than three years. Every other week, a
student rabbi flies in from Cincinnati. At other times, congregants
lead Sabbath services, run the Sunday school and even conduct
funerals.
</P>
<P>
   It is not for lack of effort that the 110-year-old synagogue has
failed to attract a rabbi. It has listed its opening with the
placement office of Hebrew Union College, the Reform movement
seminary, ever since its rabbi left, and it usually sends a
representative to Cincinnati in the spring for on-campus
recruitment at the college.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go to interview even when no one signs up,'' said Steve
Doblin, president of B'nai Israel and dean of science and
technology at the University of Southern Mississippi. ``We have
always felt it is critical to our health and vitality, maybe even
to our existence, to have a full-time rabbi.''
</P>
<P>
   The temple's plight is not unusual. Not only are synagogues
across the spectrum of Judaism finding it increasingly difficult to
hire clergy, so too are Roman Catholic and Protestant churches. In
the Roman Catholic Church, according to the National Pastoral Life
Center, an independent organization in New York that assists local
parishes, the number of parish priests declined by 12 percent
between 1992 and 1997, and churches are increasingly relying on lay
people for ministries once largely done by priests and nuns.
</P>
<P>
   In the Episcopal Church, ``the situation is grave,'' said the
Rev. Hugh Magers, a member of the congregational ministries cluster
at the denomination's national headquarters in Manhattan. ``As best
as I can tell, we have under 300 members of the clergy out of
15,000 who were born after 1964,'' he said. ``Members of the
council on ministry development, deans of seminaries and a lot of
bishops are beginning to talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   In Reform Judaism, about 200 out of 893 congregations around the
country lack a full-time rabbi. Many others need assistant rabbis.
</P>
<P>
   The modern Orthodox wing of Judaism has the same problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``There simply aren't enough rabbis,'' said Rabbi Steven
Dworken, executive vice president of the Rabbinical Council of
America. ``There are more jobs open now, due to the growth, thank
God, of the Orthodox community, and filling positions in smaller
communities can be extremely difficult. We see some shuls going
into their second or third year with no rabbi.''
</P>
<P>
   The decline in the ranks of Jewish clergy began about five years
ago. Before then, there were more rabbis in the job market than
pulpits to fill. ``The issue of the glut was raised with the
college in 1993,'' said Rabbi Sheldon Zimmerman, president of
Hebrew Union College. ``As a result, recruitment was not emphasized
and was not considered an imperative.''
</P>
<P>
   Though enrollment at the college has remained stable, the number
of congregations has grown. Fifteen years ago there were 764
synagogues belonging to the Union of American Hebrew Congregations;
today there are 895. So not only are there new pulpits to fill,
but, Zimmerman said, ``large congregations need more rabbis.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are now at least 60 congregations with more than 1,000
members,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, rural areas have always had difficulty attracting
clergy, no matter the denomination. Now, urban congregations are
feeling the pinch and are learning that openings do not necessarily
draw the wide choice of candidates of the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in major metropolitan areas, we are starting to hear from
bishops and diocesan deployment officers that they are having
difficulty,'' the Rev. James G. Wilson, executive director of the
church deployment office at the Episcopal Church Center, said.
``What used to be a problem for Wyoming and Montana is now a
problem for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Arnold I. Sher, director of placement for Hebrew Union
College and the Central Conference of American Rabbis, said: ``The
shortage is affecting the large congregations that get people's
attention. Where they used to get 30 applications, now they get
maybe nine or 10.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Matza, chairman of the search committee at Temple Emanuel
in Grand Rapids, Mich., which is seeking a replacement for its
retiring rabbi, was involved in a search in Chicago 10 years ago
and one in Dallas 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compared to the searches I was involved with in Chicago and
Dallas, this is very frustrating,'' he said. ``We are encountering
a lack of viable candidates from whom to select. We have had one or
two people who have expressed an interest and are coming for an
interview, but we are also considering alternatives like rabbis
with less experience than we might want or going for some period
without a rabbi.''
</P>
<P>
   In part, the robust economy is being blamed, with many young
people who in the past might have been drawn to the ministry
attracted to more lucrative fields.
</P>
<P>
   When a consulting firm ``comes knocking on the door offering
$60,000 to someone right out of college, they say, `Do I really
want to go to five years of graduate school?''' said Rabbi Aaron
Panken, dean of the New York campus of Hebrew Union College. ``When
the economy goes down, people tend to focus more on spiritual
concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Dworken of the Rabbinical Council of America, and former
director of rabbinic services at Yeshivha University, said: ``We
have done too good a job educating our children and giving them
banking, legal, business and medical opportunities. Years ago, many
fellows became rabbis because they had no other choices.''
</P>
<P>
   As a professor of religion at Columbia University for 21 years,
Peter Awn said that he had seen only four religion majors at
Columbia pursue careers in the clergy. In his view, the declining
appeal of a life in ministry is more a result of rejection of
authoritarianism than of the lure of more lucrative jobs elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``People who might once have gone into the clergy as an avenue
toward social change now see it as confining rather than
liberating,'' Awn, a former Jesuit priest, said. ``A profound
suspicion of political and religious institutions has taken hold.''
</P>
<P>
   But among those who do seek jobs in the clergy, quality of life
plays an increasingly decisive role as they question the long hours
and unrelenting demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one time, 95 percent of Hebrew Union College graduates went
directly to congregations; today that is down to 75 percent,'' Sher
said. ``Now jobs in academia, federations, Jewish centers, day
schools and hospitals are becoming more challenging and
prestigious, and their schedules are more controllable. Today
rabbis are looking for things they never sought in the past like a
strong Jewish community, a place with Jewish day schools for the
children. That never crossed my mind when I was raising my four
children.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to the shortage of rabbis, leaders of major Reform
Jewish organizations have formed a task force to produce new
approaches to attracting rabbis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to devise creative new ways to communicate what a
wonderful life is out there for people in the rabbinate,'' said
Panken of Hebrew Union College. Among the things being studied are
ways to reduce the time demands on rabbis and increase the
responsibilities of the members of the congregation.
</P>
<P>
   Though some experts think the decline in clergy is cyclical,
others think that failure to stem the tide would have serious
implications.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless we somehow increase the number of those choosing
religious professional life, ultimately this will be a disaster for
organized religious life,'' Zimmerman said. ``The pivotal people
who touch and embrace human beings at the most significant and
challenging moments of life will be lost.''

BUSH CAMPAIGN'S POLLING BECOMES ISSUE IN PRIMARY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Nearly 1,000 miles from South Carolina and the bitter
political war between George W. Bush and John McCain, one flank of
the war is being fought from a four-story office building in the
northern suburbs of this city.
</P>
<P>
   Up on the top floor, inside the offices of a company called
Voter Consumer Research, a few dozen people, from college students
to grandmothers, spent two days last week calling prospective
voters in South Carolina to ask them carefully scripted questions.
They began innocuously enough: Will you participate in the
Republican primary? How much attention have you paid to the GOP
race? Are things better or worse in the country?
</P>
<P>
   But the questions quickly shifted to McCain, and the tone became
less innocuous: In the guise of introducing questions, the callers
stated that McCain's tax plan does not cut rates for most people,
that he had been reprimanded by the Senate Ethics Committee and
that his campaign finance proposals would give labor unions and the
media more influence in deciding elections.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of poll is this? One written by the Bush campaign. The
people conducting it were not starry-eyed campaign volunteers but
were paid by the hour, not much more than minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   In an increasingly nasty primary in which each candidate has
blamed the other for the nastiness, the usually obscure role of
telephone canvassing and polling has unexpectedly become a central
issue as hundreds of thousands of calls pour down on voters in
South Carolina. McCain has complained that Bush and his supporters
are conducting a thinly disguised telephone smear campaign, a
charge the Texas governor vehemently denies.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has accused the Bush polling operation of spreading
negative information about McCain, rather than truly trying to
survey South Carolina voters. Such polling _ in which pollsters
give the impression that they are conducting a real poll, when they
are actually posing questions that spread doubts about the opponent
_ is known as ``push polling.''
</P>
<P>
   The allegation has put Bush on the defensive. ``It is just
ridiculous, it is unbelievable, this whole kind of thing about, you
know, Bush is push-polling, and we're not,'' Bush told host Tim
Russert on Sunday on `Meet the Press.' ``We're the one campaign,
Tim, that has said, `You're welcome to look at any phone script
that we pay for.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ari Fleischer, a Bush spokesman, said McCain and others had
mistakenly confused the Bush campaign's use of ``advocacy calling''
_ designed to drum up support _ with its polling. Fleischer said
the campaign had made 200,000 advocacy calls into South Carolina,
in which callers read a script essentially blaming the negative
tenor of the race on McCain, and then ask if the respondent would
vote for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the McCain questioning in South Carolina, conducted
by a firm called Public Opinion Strategies, appears designed to
gauge support for the Republican contenders, and to determine which
issues resonate with voters, and whether they regard themselves as
conservative or liberal.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, several people at McCain rallies have told
stories of telephone calls that they said distorted McCain's record
and his personal history.
</P>
<P>
   The issue became public last week when a woman at a McCain rally
said her teen-age son answered the phone and heard McCain called a
liar, a cheat and a fraud. Then Marsha White, the wife of the mayor
of Greenville, a McCain supporter, said she had received a similar
call.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten a couple of hundred calls in our office for
people who say they've gotten these calls,'' said McCain's
spokesman, Howard Opinsky.
</P>
<P>
   But Fleischer said no such calls had been made by the Bush
campaign. To prove his point, on Sunday he released the script from
the poll conducted by Voter Consumer Research, the group that is
working from the Houston office building.
</P>
<P>
   Fleischer emphasized that this script was different from the
massive advocacy calls. He conceded that the wording seemed loaded
in several questions, but he said the scope of the survey was
limited to 300 respondents.
</P>
<P>
   Fleischer said that unlike push polling, which targets thousands
of people, the Voter Consumer Research survey was specifically
designed to determine which issues were resonating with voters in
South Carolina. He said the campaign might use its findings to
create television commercials. These, presumably, would be aimed at
whatever those surveyed mentioned as McCain's weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surveys gather research,'' Fleischer said, noting that the
small size of the survey would preclude it from influencing many
voters. ``Surveys are meant to figure out what people are
thinking.'' He added, ``Push polls are taken with hundreds of
thousands of people, or tens of thousands of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Frankovic, the director of surveys for CBS News,
reviewed the questions from the Bush campaign survey over the
telephone, and though she did not know if the assertions made about
McCain were true, she described the survey as ``fairly common'' and
``not unusual.'' She said political campaigns use partisan polling
to test attack lines much the same way that marketers poll people
to try out new slogans for products.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast to the long, detailed questions, she said push polls
are usually short and punchy in order to reach as many people as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Michael W. Traugott, president of the American Association for
Public Opinion Research, an organization of commercial, political
and academic pollsters, said that push polling is designed to
accomplish one of two things: to either convince people to change
from one candidate to another, or suppress an opponent's vote by
tarnishing his reputation in the eyes of his supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are deleterious and invidious effects to this,'' said
Traugott, who also teaches at the University of Michigan. ``This is
an unpleasant experience for most citizens, and we think it
increases their cynicism about politics and politicians.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As for the type of calls made by the Bush campaign, Traugott
said, ``There's a very thin line between advocacy calling, where
you have people calling around to promote your candidacy, as
opposed to negative-persuasion telephoning, which is designed to
move you away from another candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   One unknown quantity in evaluating the use of polls is that a
number of calls are being made on behalf of candidates by
organizations other than the two campaigns. Published reports have
suggested that groups such as the National Right to Life, as well
as pro-tobacco organizations, are planning to make calls in South
Carolina on behalf of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said he does not know what other organizations are
doing, and he has promised to fire anyone from his campaign if they
are involved in push polling.
</P>
<P>
   In Houston it is almost impossible to detect that the bland
brick building not far from a shopping center is actually a nerve
center in the presidential race. Bush first hired Voter Consumer
Research during his gubernatorial race, and the company now
operates phone banks north of the city. Some of its customers are
companies interested in testing opinions.
</P>
<P>
   But one employee said that political races are dominating
business now, particularly the South Carolina primary. Inside,
employees sit in front of computer screens, earning an hourly rate
to ask the same questions over and over again. One woman said the
average rate is $6 an hour. According to employees, every
conversation is monitored electronically to ensure that callers do
not stray from the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, according to one employee, supervisors warned the
staff against speaking to reporters. One woman said that McCain is
not the only object of polling. She said she had spent time asking
questions of voters around the nation about Vice President Al Gore.
One of the questions, she said, was about opinions on Gore's now
retracted claim that he invented the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The woman laughed and described the process as ``mudslinging.''

TRUMP QUITS BID FOR REFORM PARTY NOMINATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Donald Trump has decided to end his brief and flamboyant
exploration into running for president, concluding that the Reform
Party, whose support he had sought, was so beset by internal
fighting that he would have no chance of winning the White House as
its nominee, the developer's associates said Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Trump will officially announce his decision in a television
interview Monday morning, according to someone close to him.
However, in the formal statement that will be released Monday, the
developer bitterly denounced the divisions that have publicly beset
the Reform Party in recent months, which he described as ``general
fratricide.''
</P>
<P>
   Trump's decision came one day after a Reform Party faction
backed by Ross Perot, which strongly opposed the prospect of Trump
as the party's presidential candidate, ousted a faction aligned
with Gov. Jesse Ventura of Minnesota, who was close to Trump.
Ventura quit the party on Friday, calling it ``dysfunctional.''
</P>
<P>
   Although it is risky to offer any predictions concerning the
Reform Party, the latest round of maneuvering seemed all but fatal
to any hope Trump had of filling the position that Perot had held
in the 1992 and 1996 presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   Trump asserted in his statement that he believed he could win
the party's nomination if he chose to pursue it. However, he said,
``the prospect of divisive lawsuits, continued fighting over the
national convention site and general fratricide'' had convinced him
that the Reform Party nominee, whoever it may be, would have no
chance of victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have consistently stated that I would spend my time, energy
and money on a campaign, not just to get a large number of votes,
but to win,'' Trump said in the statement. ``There would be no
other purpose, other than winning, for me to run. I have therefore
decided not to seek the presidential nomination of the Reform
Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Trump's imminent departure would appear to leave Pat Buchanan,
the conservative commentator, as the leading prospect to win the
Reform Party's backing _ provided that Perot does not decide to
make a third go at it.
</P>
<P>
   Trump's decision, which was described by his friend as final and
unequivocal, ends what had been one of the stranger episodes of the
2000 presidential race. Before six months ago, Trump had never
shown any interest in electoral politics, instead building a large
reputation as a developer, casino operator and, by his own boast,
skilled publicity seeker and accomplished womanizer.
</P>
<P>
   The new interim head of the Reform Party, Pat Choate, described
Trump as a ``hustler'' Sunday night, and said he had never believed
that Trump had any interest beyond promoting himself and a new book
that happened to be published at exactly the time he started his
light schedule of campaign travel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Donald Trump came in, promoted his hotels, he promoted his
book, he promoted himself at our expense, and I think he
understands very fully that we've ended the possibilities for such
abuse of our party in Nashville,'' Choate said. ``We're taking our
party back to our very principles, and exploiters such as Donald
Trump will not be able to exploit us again _ and he realizes it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw no evidence that he was a serious candidate at all,''
Choate said. ``All this was, was a serious hustle of the media, and
I think the media should send him a massive bill on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Trump apparently anticipated such speculation _ which, in fact,
is fairly common in political circles _ and in his statement went
out of his way to say that this was more than a frolic. ``For those
who suggest that this has just been a promotion, I want to strongly
deny that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that although his book and his businesses had probably
benefited from the exposure his campaign generated, ``I did not
launch my exploratory campaign for that reason.''
</P>
<P>
   The developer, in his statements, painted a fairly dark picture
of the Reform Party, making references to Buchanan; David Duke, a
former leader of the Ku Klux Klan, and Lenora Fulani, the former
standard-bearer of the New Alliance Party and an advocate of
Marxist-Leninist politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Reform Party now includes a Klansman, Mr. Duke, a
neo-Nazi, Mr. Buchanan, and a communist, Ms. Fulani,'' he said in
his statement. ``This is not company I wish to keep.''
</P>
<P>
   Trump reached his final decision after meeting with advisers at
his estate in West Palm Beach, Fla., before flying back to New York
Sunday evening. Although Ventura said he was forming his own new
Independence Party, Trump said he would not seek its nomination for
president.
</P>
<P>
   Not that this is necessarily the end of Trump's flirtation with
American politics. ``I cannot rule out,'' he says in his statement,
``a possible candidacy in 2004.'

 &HT;    Kors' line evokes images of speakeasys,
 &HT;    art deco scenes and `Casablanca'
 &HT;    By Robert Janjigian
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Michael Kors likes a Gershwin tune _ how
about you?
</P>
<P>
   To the strains of ``Rhapsody in Blue,'' a melody evocative of
Manhattan glamour _ thanks primarily to Woody Allen _ a
well-groomed cast of male and female models at Kors' fall 2000
collection show strolled down the runway sporting the snazziest,
jazziest and dressiest clothes of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the mall as inspiration. Fall looks from Kors are more
evocative of a moll.
</P>
<P>
   This designer's rap isn't ``gangsta'' or ``Penthouse'' pet.
Kors' looks summoned up pinstripe-suited, fedora-wearing gangsters
from the 1930s, Ingrid Bergman in ``Casablanca,'' Ivy Leaguers on a
crisp Saturday afternoon at the game, and lithe and sexy beauties
sipping gin at a speakeasy or in an art deco apartment on the 90th
floor.
</P>
<P>
   Themes aside, Kors' collection was a ``Blass from the past.''
Like the now-retired Bill Blass, who was always a pal to his gals,
this at-his-peak designer is offering women the elements to create
a put-together look that has an unabashed upper-class demeanor.
</P>
<P>
   Classic and fancy tailored tweed or pin-striped flannel suits,
trimmed with feathers or fur, offered something fresh and new
consideringKors is best known for working in a luxuriously rendered
dressed-down context. Though simple in form, pieces clad in
geometric beading patterned after the facade and other
architectural details of the 1929 Chrysler Building lent some
fabulous flash to the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   His evening wear, which hasn't been a strong part of his
collections in the past, was slinkily successful for the upcoming
fall. The silhouettes are still lean, but distinctly softer.
</P>
<P>
   With his men's collection, Kors has definitely moved forward and
back at the same time. Instead of offering simple luxed-up-casual
jeans and sweaters, the designer has moved into amore bespoke and
dandified mode, with gentlemanly garb that served as the perfect
escort to his ladylike styles for women.

POLICY ON GAYS IS TOPIC OF TRAINING COURSE AT ARMY BASE

 By ELIZABETH BECKER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT CAMPBELL, Ky. _ Midway through his training course on the
military's ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy toward gays in uniform,
Maj. James Garrett bluntly told his audience of 48 commissioned and
noncommissioned officers to use a little common sense.
</P>
<P>
   This Army base, where a gay soldier was beaten to death last
Fourth of July by a fellow soldier after a beer-soaked barracks
party, has become a particular proving ground, almost obsessive
about whether the six-year-old policy can be enforced properly
without undermining the rights of gay service members.
</P>
<P>
   So for more than an hour, Garrett mixed homilies about
respecting others with graphic definitions of sexual acts in a
comprehensive briefing that was part of the military's effort to
help its leaders come to grips with the policy.
</P>
<P>
   A major, dressed in battle fatigues like the others, asked:
``What if a gay soldier hits on you? Like, hey, do you want to go
to a gay bar with me? Isn't this an act, asking you on a date?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, it's just associational behavior,'' Garrett answered.
``Going to a gay bar, having a gay roommate off base, marching in a
gay parade, that's associational behavior. That is not against the
policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Garrett, an Army lawyer, then brought his discussion back to
what he called ``the policy in a nutshell: conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The conduct piece is the key to understanding,'' he said.
``Homosexual conduct is grounds for separation from the armed
forces _ not sexual orientation. This is the law, the policy
Congress told us to follow.''
</P>
<P>
   But sitting ramrod straight in long rows of classroom tables,
the largely male audience took notes and sometimes seemed to be
having trouble following their instructor's rapid presentation.
Afterward, Capt. Patrick McCabe said he found it ``disturbing that
the Army has to teach people to respect each other.''
</P>
<P>
   To test their understanding of the lecture, Garrett offered a
few hypothetical situations. ``Let's go back to that soldier in an
off-base apartment with a gay roommate,'' he said. ``Say another
soldier goes to visit and says he witnesses french-kissing,
grabbing of the genitalia, whatever. Is this an act, is this
conduct?''
</P>
<P>
   The group answers ``yes,'' which prompts the next question: Is
it a credible report and should it be investigated? Silence in the
audience.
</P>
<P>
   The major's answer was no, commanders should not investigate
anything without first talking to the base's military legal
counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're your legal counsel, you're not out there alone,'' he
said. `` We're your best friend when it comes to this _ call us
first. Whether you get a report of sodomy or if you get that report
of a french kiss, call us.''
</P>
<P>
   After the murder of the gay soldier, Pfc. Barry Winchell, Maj.
Gen. Robert T. Clark, the commander of the post and of the 101st
Airborne Division, ordered that all soldiers on the post, beginning
with him, receive training about the policy on gays. A few months
later, the Pentagon ordered everyone in the military _ from
four-star generals to privates _ to undergo similar training.
</P>
<P>
   No one is more aware that his outfit has become a microcosm for
the national debate on the policy than Clark.
</P>
<P>
   ``The paramount fact is, harassment continues even after
Winchell's murder and after Clark knew there was a problem,'' said
Michelle Benecke, co-director of the Servicemembers Legal Defense
Network, which is leading the campaign calling for Clark's removal.
</P>
<P>
   The number of soldiers at Fort Campbell who have asked to leave
the military because they are gay or lesbian has skyrocketed since
the murder. Before the base averaged seven cases of gays leaving
the service each year. Since July that number has tripled to more
than 20 people who have asked for voluntary separation, according
to a senior military official who said most requests are
automatically granted under the Pentagon policy.
</P>
<P>
   While Clark says that he ``takes full responsibility'' for
everything that takes place at Fort Campbell, he is adamant that
``this is not a homophobic base.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first interview about the Winchell case, Clark said: ``I
don't believe any of my commanders would walk by an example of
abuse and not do something about it. The Winchell murder was an
absolute tragedy and we are learning all we can and we are doing
our level best to make sure this never happens again.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are still signs of the tension from the murder that
has roiled the base, which sprawls across the border of Kentucky
and Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Even after Winchell's death, soldiers wonder what constitutes
harassment.
</P>
<P>
   E-mails have been exchanged between soldiers wondering whether
the daily banter and jokes they take for granted actually
constitute harassment. In an e-mail he wrote after Pvt. Calvin
Glover's conviction for the murder, Cadet Lt. Gordon Cooke, who was
the commander of Winchell's platoon the month before Winchell's
death and is now a senior at West Point, said he had never heard
anyone joke about Winchell being gay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to wonder `Why didn't the leaders do something?'''
he wrote. ``But there is no apparent difference in the joviality
and banter that are signs of good morale and a tight unit and the
harassment and hatred that allegedly (mixed with alcohol) caused
Glover to take a baseball bat and beat his roommate.''
</P>
<P>
   Garrett's training session is meant to dispel such confusion
between barracks talk and intolerance, especially toward gay and
lesbian soldiers for whom jokes could escalate to dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   Clark said the significant increase in gays asking for discharge
at the base includes gay soldiers who were genuinely afraid after
the murder of Winchell as well as others ``who have been seeking an
easy way out of the Army with an honorable discharge.''
</P>
<P>
   At Clark's request, the Army's inspector general will come to
the post this month and conduct an overall assessment of the
command climate there at the time of Winchell's death.
</P>
<P>
   When testimony at the trial described unsupervised nightly binge
drinking by underaged soldiers, Clark ordered a study of barrack's
policy and has reversed the Army's liberal policy toward drinking
in the barracks.
</P>
<P>
   He has added hundreds of thousands of security improvements to
the barracks and put off-limits the gay bar frequented by Winchell
because Nashville police records revealed numerous drug busts and
fights. He has reprimanded a sergeant involved in another case of
anti-gay harassment and removed him from his position.
</P>
<P>
   Most important to him, Clark says he has tried to talk directly
with soldiers and all commanders about respect for others,
beginning with a morning jog with Private Winchell's brigade
shortly after the murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ran with the brigade and afterward I took Private Winchell's
company aside and I talked to them and their leaders about what a
tough time it was for them, how I knew this was a difficult
thing,'' he said. ``I asked them to focus on the future and the
importance of taking care of each other.''

CHARLES M. SCHULZ, CREATOR OF BELOVED `PEANUTS,' DIES AT 77

<P>
   Charles Schulz, the creator of ``Peanuts,'' the tender and sage
comic strip starring Charlie Brown and Snoopy that was read by 355
million people around the world, died in his sleep on Saturday
night at his home in Santa Rosa, Calif., just hours before his last
cartoon ran in the Sunday newspapers. He was 77.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was colon cancer, said Paige Braddock,
creative director of Charles M. Schulz Creative Associates.
</P>
<P>
   Schulz drew ``Peanuts'' for nearly half a century. He swore that
no one else would ever draw the comic strip and he kept his word.
He finally put down his pen when he received a diagnosis of colon
cancer after abdominal surgery in November.
</P>
<P>
   His last daily strip ran on Jan. 3. His last Sunday strip
carried a signed farewell in which he said, ``Charlie Brown,
Snoopy, Linus, Lucy ... how can I ever forget them. ...''
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Jeannie, said, ``He had done everything he wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Peanuts,'' which reached readers in 75 countries, 2,600 papers
and 21 languages every day, made Schulz very rich. The ``Peanuts''
strips, merchandise and product endorsements brought in $1.1
billion a year. And Schulz was said to have earned about $30
million to $40 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   Jules Feiffer, the cartoonist and playwright, said that the
``Peanuts'' characters endure because they were the first real
children in the comics pages, ones with doubts and anxieties. And
there were a lot of them. ``Linus, Lucy, Charlie Brown _ these
interesting little people formed a repertory company,'' Feiffer
said.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Monroe Schulz, the son of a barber, like Charlie Brown's
father, was born in Minnesota on Nov. 26, 1922. He wanted to be a
cartoonist as a child and practiced by drawing Popeye. ``Someday,
Charles, you're going to be an artist,'' a kindergarten teacher
told him after looking at his drawing of a man shoveling snow.
</P>
<P>
   The hurts of Schulz's early years provided a lifetime of
material. At Central High School in St. Paul's, Minn., he flunked
Latin, English, algebra and physics. ``Ripley's Believe It or
Not!'' accepted one of his drawings when he was 15 but the cartoons
he drew for his high school yearbook were rejected.
</P>
<P>
   After graduation he took a correspondence course from Art
Instruction Inc., but before he could start a career he was drafted
into the Army. He left for boot camp only days after his mother
died of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   After serving in France and Germany during World War II, Schulz
tried various odd jobs: lettering the comics at a Catholic magazine
called Timeless Topix; drawing a weekly cartoon called ``Li'l
Folks,'' the precursor to ``Peanuts,'' for the St. Paul Pioneer
Press; and selling occasional spot cartoons to The Saturday Evening
Post.
</P>
<P>
   In 1949, Schulz married Joyce Halverson; the couple had five
children. The marriage ended in divorce in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Also in 1949, Schulz submitted some of his ``Li'l Folks'' comic
strips to United Feature Syndicate. The syndicate liked the strip
but insisted on calling it ``Peanuts,'' because ``Li'l Folks'' was
too similar to another strip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very upset with the title,'' Schulz once said, ``and
still am.''
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 2, 1950, the first ``Peanuts'' strip was published.
Seven newspapers bought ``Peanuts'' that year, and Schulz earned
$90 a week in royalties. But by 1953, the cartoon was a hit and he
was earning $30,000 per year. In 1955 (and again in 1964) the
National Cartoonists Society awarded Schulz the Reuben for being
the outstanding cartoonist of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The strips were just the beginning. In 1952, Schulz started
turning out ``Peanuts'' books, and new compilations rolled off the
presses every year for decades. Eventually ``Peanuts'' was
translated into Serbo-Croatian, Malay, Chinese, Tlingit, Catalan
and 15 other languages.
</P>
<P>
   The 1960s brought animated ``Peanuts'' television specials. The
first was ``A Charlie Brown Christmas,'' which shown on CBS in 1965
and won an Emmy and a Peabody. Many more television specials
followed, five of which won Emmys, and there were also ``Peanuts''
feature films, including ``A Boy Named Charlie Brown.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The takeoffs came rolling in. In 1966, the Royal Guardsmen wrote
a rock song, ``Snoopy and the Red Baron.'' In 1967, a musical,
``You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown,'' was produced Off-Broadway. (A
1999 revival on Broadway won two Tony Awards.) ``Peanuts Gallery,''
a concerto, was composed by Ellen Taaffe Zwilich and had its
premiere at Carnegie Hall in 1997. Schulz received the Ordre des
Arts et des Lettres from the French Ministry of Culture. In 1990,
his work was shown at the Louvre; the gala had Snoopys in couture.
</P>
<P>
   Many pundits tried to put their finger on the ``Peanuts'' spell
and they generally rambled on in a vaguely philosophical vein.
</P>
<P>
   Robert L. Short, a minister, wrote two books on Peanuts
theology, ``The Gospel According to Peanuts,'' (1964) and ``The
Parables of Peanuts''(1969). He saw signs of original sin in the
``Peanuts'' children, who were unable ``to produce any radical
change for the better in themselves _ or in each other.''
</P>
<P>
   The licensing madness began in 1958, when the first plastic
Snoopy and Charlie Brown came out. In 1960, Hallmark began printing
``Peanuts'' cards and party goods. Then came sweat shirts and
pajamas, thermoses and lunchboxes. Plush Snoopy came in 1965.
Woodstock slippers, Lucy picture frames, Charlie Brown music boxes
followed.
</P>
<P>
   Schulz vetted all products for appropriateness and turned some
down; baby wipes (for aesthetic reasons), ashtrays, vitamins,
sugary breakfast cereals, ice-skates and tennis rackets.
</P>
<P>
   There were commercials too. In 1957 the ``Peanuts'' characters
started selling Ford Falcons. For 15 years they worked for the
Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. Snoopy was the official NASA
mascot, and in 1969 NASA's lunar excursion module on the Apollo 11
mission was called Snoopy. The command module was Charlie Brown.
</P>
<P>
   By 1999, there were 20,000 different new products each year
adorned by ``Peanuts'' characters. In 1994, Schulz was inducted
into the Licensing Industry Merchandisers' Association Hall of
Fame.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether he minded his characters selling stuff,
Schulz said, ``I don't think there's such a thing as going
commercial with a comic strip, because a comic strip is a
commercial right from the beginning.'' It is there to sell
newspapers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Forbes listed the cartoonist among the 10 wealthiest
entertainers, earning $32 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless his lifestyle remained simple. Schulz, who hated to
travel, said he would have been happy living his whole life in
Minneapolis. But ``had a restless first wife,'' so they moved to
Sebastopol, Calif., and he set up his studio in Santa Rosa.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, a year after his divorce, Schulz met Jeannie Clyde and
married her.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the Church of God, a church that tithes, Schulz was
a religious man. He was a Sunday-school teacher and administrator
and would occasionally deliver the Sunday sermon. He did not drink
or smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his large family and success, Schulz was a melancholy
man who worried and was often lonely, depressed and plagued by
panic attacks, features that Rheta Grimsley Johnson brought out in
her 1989 biography ``Good Grief: The Story of Charles M. Schulz.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't create humor out of happiness,'' Schulz said is his
1980 book, ``Charlie Brown, Snoopy and Me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm astonished at the number of people who write to me saying,
`Why can't you create happy stories for us? Why does Charlie Brown
always have to lose? Why can't you let him kick the football?'
Well, there is nothing funny about the person who gets to kick the
football.''
</P>
<P>
   Schulz is survived by his wife, Jeannie, a philanthropist, and
his children: Meredith Hodges, of Loveland, Colo.; Charles, Jr.
(called Monte), of Nevada City, Calif.; Craig, of Santa Rosa,
Calif.; Amy Johnson, of Alpine, Utah; and Jill Schulz Transki, of
Santa Barbara, Calif.; two stepchildren, Brooke Clyde, of Santa
Rosa; and Lisa Brockway, of Ashland, Ore.; and 18 grandchildren.

WOODS' COMEBACK FALLS SHORT ON LAST FIVE HOLES 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LA JOLLA, Calif. _ The task was finally too much, the magic
never materialized, the streak finally ended.
</P>
<P>
   After overcoming a seven-stroke deficit to tie Phil Mickelson
with five holes to play, Tiger Woods simply did not have enough
tools Sunday to deliver a knockout. His swing fell apart early, and
he never figured out how to glue it back together. He made crucial
bogeys on two of his final five holes. Every hole was a chore, as
Woods struggled to hit fairways and greens, putting more and more
pressure on his short game until it finally let him down, too.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Mickelson summoned the will to turn a potentially
devastating loss into a memorable triumph. After Woods pulled even,
Mickelson pulled himself together, closing with birdies on four of
his last six holes to defeat the world's No. 1 player, and to
derail his run at history.
</P>
<P>
   Ending Woods' winning streak at six consecutive tour starts,
Mickelson won the Buick Invitational at Torrey Pines by four
strokes over Woods and Shigeki Maruyama of Japan, who tied for
second place at 14 under. Mickelson finished at 18 under par for
the tournament (66-67-67-70), holding off Woods, who struggled to a
two-under 70, and Maruyama, who shot a &UR;  &LR; 72.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome ended Woods' pursuit of the all-time winning streak
held by Byron Nelson, who won 11 consecutive tournaments in 1945, a
record that will continue to be one of the most difficult to reach
in sports. Woods will share the second-longest winning streak with
the late Ben Hogan, who won six consecutive tournaments in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   Woods went down the hard way, battling on every shot, scrambling
his way around the golf course and keeping the suspense alive while
the huge gallery yelled with each swing in momentum. But as Woods
reached the 18th green, trailing by four shots, he knew his run had
ended. As the crowd around No. 18 gave Woods a standing ovation, he
took off his golf cap and acknowledged the cheers, knowing deep
down that his game Sunday was not solid enough to beat Mickelson.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be under par as I was hitting it today was kind of a
miracle,'' said Woods, who won $264,000 and became the tour's
all-time leading money winner despite the loss. He has made more
than $12.82 million in less than four years on the tour. ``I wasn't
hitting it good enough to give myself a viable chance down the
stretch, and it finally caught up with me.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get up and down as many times as I did, you've got to be
proud of yourself. I didn't back off. I didn't dog it. For some
reason, I just didn't hit the ball as crisp today as I needed to.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods insisted he was not relieved the streak was over. And when
asked what the end of the streak meant, Woods showed both his humor
and his drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means I came in second,'' Woods said. ``Second all-time.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods had downplayed the streak's significance all along, partly
because he lost two non-PGA Tour events during the course of the
streak, the Johnnie Walker Classic, and the Williams World
Challenge. But with each victory, the attention on him became
greater, and this week's tournament drew a record-setting crowd
estimated at about 165,000 for the week. But Woods thrived on
pressure during a run that was marked by dramatic comebacks,
extraordinary play and the dominating will of a great player who
never settles for second place.
</P>
<P>
   Woods would not concede that this streak would be the longest of
his career. After all, he is only 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it can be done again,'' said Woods, who won last
year's Buick Invitational, but who has never won the same
tournament in back-to-back years. ``It all depends if someone gets
hot like I did. But I think it can be done again.''
</P>
<P>
   For Mickelson, it was the 14th tour victory of an outstanding
career, and it came at the right time, at the right place and
against the right opponent. Mickelson, who also won the Buick
Invitational in 1993, is a San Diego native who played high school
matches at Torrey Pines. He remembers watching the Buick
Invitational as a teen-ager, standing in the gallery, witnessing
past back-nine battles.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday was a moment for Mickelson to prove himself inside the
ropes, and the victory was one of the most significant of his
career. He had not won since 1998 at Pebble Beach, and 1999 was his
first year without a victory on tour since 1992. Mickelson entered
the final round carrying a recent history of struggling on Sundays,
most recently at last month's Phoenix Open, when he led with nine
holes to play, only to lose while shooting 40 on the back nine.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday, Mickelson made pressure shots on the finishing holes
and closed out Woods, something that many others have failed to do.
Mickelson, who is still looking for his first career major victory,
believes 2000 could be a big year for him. And this victory may
have been the first step.
</P>
<P>
   ``To go against the best player in the world and to come out on
top means a lot to me,'' said Mickelson, who earned $540,000 with
the victory. ``The two things I'm going to get from today are No.
1, the confidence that I can play against the best and win, and No.
2, the next time I get a six or seven shot lead, I need to get
tougher.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was important for me to win again. It was important to go
head to head against the best player in the world, and know I could
beat him. And it was important to see some results from the time,
effort, and practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting the day two shots ahead of Maruyama and six shots ahead
of Woods, Mickelson cruised early, making three consecutive birdies
at No. 4, No. 5, and No. 6 to reach 19-under, and to take a
seven-shot lead over Woods. But then Mickelson went into free fall.
He made a double-bogey at the par 4 No. 7, hitting his approach
shot left and short of the green, followed by a poor chip that
stopped short of the green, another chip that went eight feet past
the hole, and a missed putt. Then Mickelson made another
double-bogey at the par 3 No. 11 after hitting his tee shot short
and right. He flubbed another chip, then hit another chip five feet
past the hole, then missed the comeback putt.
</P>
<P>
   That dropped Mickelson to 15-under, and you could almost hear
Woods saying, ``Here I come.'' Playing one threesome ahead of
Mickelson, Woods birdied No. 12 to close within one shot, after
hitting an excellent 8-iron approach shot to six feet, then making
the putt. Then Woods tied Mickelson with a birdie at the par 5, No.
13, chipping his third shot to eight feet, then making the putts.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of folding, as others have done against Woods
recently, Mickelson responded with a momentum-changing birdie at
No. 13 to take the lead for good. After a poor tee shot into the
left rough, Mickelson hit a recovery shot into the fairway, then
hit a gorgeous 9-iron from 115 yards that landed three feet from
the cup. Mickelson made the putt for birdie, and then it was Woods
who made costly mistakes, with a bogey at No. 14, when he pulled a
five-foot putt left of the hole, and a bogey and No. 16, when he
failed to get up and down from a bunker for par. Then Mickelson
closed in style with birdies at No. 17 and No. 18, and it was
finally safe for him to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't trying to be the bad guy,'' Mickelson said of ending
the streak. ``What Tiger has done has been great for the game of
golf, and I've been amazed at his performance. I wasn't trying to
end his streak as much as I was trying to win the tournament.''

 &HT;    Woods erases big deficit, but Mickelson ends his streak
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LA JOLLA, Calif. _ The Streak is over. Tiger Woods lost a golf
tournament. Byron Nelson's 11 in a row remain the standard.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Woods' six straight, having been assembled since
August 1999, become just slightly better than, well, a half-Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   Woods' streak ended Sunday at Torrey Pines Golf Course in the
Buick Invitational when San Diego native Phil Mickelson righted
himself after an early period of self-destruction that bordered on
the unfathomable. After squandering a seven-shot lead with 12 holes
to play, Mickelson rallied on the back nine for a 2-under-par 70
and finished at 18-under 270 to win by four shots.
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, Woods was right there until the last hour of the
tournament _ amazing because his swing had pretty much deserted him
and he was struggling just to hit fairways. Relying almost totally
on his short game for survival, Woods still shot a 68 and tied for
second at 274, along with Japan's Shigeki Maruyama.
</P>
<P>
   Sea Island's Davis Love III eagled the 72nd hole for a 70 to
finish fourth, five shots behind Mickelson.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest with you, to even be under par as (bad) as I was
hitting it, was kind of a miracle,'' Woods said. ``I just wasn't
hitting it good enough to give myself a viable chance down the
stretch, and it finally caught up with me.''
</P>
<P>
   After Mickelson double-bogeyed the 7th and 11th and Woods
birdied the par-5 13th, the two were tied at 15-under. But
Mickelson, who had not won since the rain-delayed Pebble Beach
tournament in August 1998 and has been battling the Sunday swoons,
finally got his act together with birdies at 13 and 14.
</P>
<P>
   The ``big turnaround'' for Mickelson was a laid-off 9-iron from
116 yards at the 13th to two feet, which he eased in for a birdie,
returning to 16-under.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly was not going to just hand it to him,'' said
Mickelson, ``even though it looked like I was.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods carried a sheepish look through his media center
interview, knowing he had been faking it at crunch time with his
swing out of sync.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just to kind of hang in there and hang in there, chip and putt
and just grind away at it and just give myself a chance _ I was
very proud of myself for that,'' said Woods, who still managed to
go 45 straight holes without a bogey until one Sunday at the 14th.
``But to win a tournament hitting it like that is not an easy thing
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   What did the end of the streak mean to Woods?
</P>
<P>
   ``It means I came in second,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What did winning six in a row mean?
</P>
<P>
   ``Second all-time.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Woods said it was not the case, he seemed almost
relieved that the streak had ended, guaranteeing that his
appearance this week at the Nissan Open in Los Angeles will become
less of a media circus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very draining,'' he said. ``Having to do a lot of press
conferences every day, and then the fans, the constant bombardment.
It takes its toll on you.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods deemed it possible that someone else could manage a
similar streak. Heck, for all the golf world knows, Woods himself
could win this week at Riviera and start another one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just all depends if someone gets hot like I did,'' Tiger
said. ``If someone plays well and gives themselves enough
opportunities. Either you're going to win them outright yourself or
you might need a little help, but I think it can be done again.''
</P>
<P>
   For Woods, the frustrations with his swing, which had not been
sharp all week, were typified during conversations toward the end
of the round with caddie and former high school teammate, Bryon
Bell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was more funny than anything else,'' Woods said.
``He said, `Would you just hit a fairway?'. . I said, `I'm
trying.'''

FOR BRADLEY CAMPAIGN, CONTEST IS THREE-WAY RACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ In a speech to California Democrats on
Saturday, former Sen. Bill Bradley had just reached the part where
he usually contrasts himself with Vice President Al Gore, when he
swerved into new territory and began drawing distinctions between
himself and a Republican, Sen. John McCain of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``John McCain, he's moving in the polls, even getting some
Democratic support,'' Bradley said. ``Why do you think that is?''
And then he proceeded to tick off the reasons good Democrats should
not like McCain, from his opposition to abortion and gun control to
his support for school vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's quick pivot from Gore to McCain showed that he is
suddenly fighting a two-front war: against Gore for core Democratic
voters and against McCain for the hearts and minds of independents
who are important in states like California and Washington that
vote on March 7.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the campaign, polls have shown that Bradley and
McCain perform well among independent voters, who seem attracted to
their insurgent messages. Both claim to be outsiders fighting the
establishment, both staunchly advocate getting big money out of
politics, and both cast themselves as plain-spoken alternatives to
slick, poll-driven front-runners.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the campaign, Bradley's aides argued that there were
enough independent voters for both candidates. No longer. Since
McCain scored a 19-point victory over Gov. George W. Bush in New
Hampshire, largely on the strength of independent voters, Bradley's
advisers have conceded that McCain's rising popularity could draw
crucial independent votes away from Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   That will particularly be a problem in Washington state, where
Bradley has established a grass-roots organization and won the
support of many local officials, including Mayor Paul Schell of
Seattle. The state is one of several that Bradley's aides say they
can, and perhaps need to, win on March 7, when 30 percent of the
party's presidential delegates will be selected.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has a unique voting system, known as a blanket
primary, where Democrats, Republicans and independents will be
allowed to vote for candidates from any party on Feb. 29.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates will actually be selected in closed party caucuses on
March 7, where Gore will be favored because of his broad support
among unions and party activists. But Washington Democrats say
results from the blanket primary will strongly influence public
perception of the race, and therefore affect the caucus votes.
</P>
<P>
   As a consequence, some of Bradley's top supporters in Washington
have begun using their public appearances to urge independents to
stand by Bradley and not join the McCain bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   ``In New Hampshire, a lot of people were saying they couldn't
decide between McCain and Bradley,'' said Rep. Jim McDermott,
D-Seattle, who has endorsed Bradley. ``But they are not the same,
and in fact on most issues you couldn't have two people who are
further apart.''
</P>
<P>
   McDermott and other supporters of Bradley said they are also
concerned that their candidate is not doing enough to show the
differences between himself and McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of us have told him, `You've got to differentiate
yourself from him,''' McDermott said. ``John McCain is like a
vacuum cleaner. His surge shows there is a powerful desire under
the surface for change. Bradley's got to show himself as offering a
kind of change that is different from John McCain's kind of
change.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric Hauser, Bradley's press secretary, argued that there is no
clear evidence that McCain will hurt Bradley among unaffiliated
voters or independent-minded Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   But he acknowledged that McCain could pose a problem in states
with open primaries and said the Bradley campaign would
increasingly try to show differences between the two insurgents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voters who care about reform need to understand that reform
with John McCain means a pro-gun, pro-life, anti-environmental
agenda,'' Hauser said. ``Reform with Bill Bradley means the
opposite.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In most states independent voters will not be a factor, because
only registered Democrats will be allowed to vote in the Democratic
primary.
</P>
<P>
   But California, like Washington, has an open primary where
Democrats, Republicans and unaffiliated voters can vote for any
candidate. And while delegates will be allocated based solely on
votes from registered Democrats, the overall popular vote will be
viewed as an important indicator of Bradley's strength among the
general electorate.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys of voters in New Hampshire, where independents were
allowed to vote in either the Republican or the Democratic primary,
showed that McCain won the most independent votes. But Bradley did
better among independents than Gore, whose base of support is among
core Democratic voters, including union members and blacks.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has also posed a public relations problem for Bradley.
With his sudden surge, McCain has drawn media attention away from
Bradley, who has been sinking in opinion polls as steadily as
McCain has been rising.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley's advisers say that voters in California, Washington
and other states that vote on March 7 have not begun to focus on
the race yet, and that McCain's domination of the news will become
a problem only if he wins the South Carolina primary on Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've still got three weeks, and that's an eternity in
politics,'' Hauser said.

<P>
   Charles Schulz, the creator of ``Peanuts,'' the tender and sage
comic strip starring Charlie Brown and Snoopy that was read by 355
million people around the world, died in his sleep on Saturday
night at his home in Santa Rosa, Calif., just hours before his last
cartoon ran in the Sunday newspapers. He was 77.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was colon can- cer, said Paige Braddock,
creative director of Charles M. Schulz Cre- ative Associates.
</P>
<P>
   Schulz drew ``Peanuts'' for nearly half a century. He swore that
no one else would ever draw the comic strip and he kept his word.
For years he drew ``Peanuts'' with a hand tremor. He finally put
down his pen when he received a diagnosis of colon cancer after
abdominal surgery in November.
</P>
<P>
   His last daily strip ran on Jan. 3. His last Sunday strip
carried a signed farewell in which he said, ``Charlie Brown,
Snoopy, Linus, Lucy ... how can I ever forget them. ...''
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Jeannie, said, ``He had done everything he wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Johnston, a friend of Schulz and the creator of the comic
strip ``For Better or for Worse,'' told The Associated Press,
``It's amazing that he dies just before his last strip is
published.'' Such an ending, she said, was ``as if he had written
it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The lives of ``Peanuts'' and of Charles Schulz were completely
intertwined. ``The strip and he were one,'' said Patrick McDonnell,
who draws the cartoon ``Mutts.'' ``He put his heart and soul into
that strip.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Peanuts,'' which reached readers in 75 countries, 2,600 papers
and 21 languages every day, made Schulz very rich. The ``Peanuts''
strips, merchandise and product endorsements brought in $1.1
billion a year. And Schulz was said to have earned about $30
million to $40 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   His saga of Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Lucy and Linus ``is arguably
the longest story ever told by one human being,'' longer than any
epic poem, any Tolstoy novel, any Wagner opera, observed Robert
Thompson, a professor of popular culture at Syracuse University, on
the PBS ``NewsHour'' with Jim Lehrer. In all Schulz drew more than
18,250 strips &UR;  &LR; in nearly 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Jules Feiffer, the cartoonist and playwright, said that the
``Peanuts'' characters endure because they were the first real
children in the comics pages, ones with doubts and anxieties. And
there were a lot of them. ``Linus, Lucy, Charlie Brown _ these
interesting little people formed a repertory company,'' Feiffer
said.
</P>
<P>
   The cast of ``Peanuts'' changed remarkably little. It included
Charlie Brown, a wishy-washy boy with a tree-loving kite and a
losing baseball team; Snoopy, an unflappable beagle with a fancy
inner life; Lucy, a fussbudget with a football and a curbside
psychiatric clinic; Linus, a philosophical blanket-carrier; Sally,
Charlie Brown's romantic little sister; Schroeder, a virtuoso on
the toy piano and a Beethoven devotee; Peppermint Patty, a
narcoleptic D-minus student; and, in later years, Woodstock, a
small, expressive but speechless bird.
</P>
<P>
   Schulz remembered waking up in the night many years ago and
thinking, ``Good grief, who are all these little people? Must I
live with them for the rest of my life?'' The answer was yes.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Monroe Schulz, the son of Carl Schulz, a barber, like
Charlie Brown's father, and the former Dena Halverson, was born in
Minneapolis on Nov. 26, 1922. Young Charles was nicknamed Sparky
after the horse Spark Plug in the comic strip ``Barney Google.'' He
had a black-and-white dog named Spike (memorialized in the
character of Snoopy's skinny Western brother).
</P>
<P>
   He wanted to be a cartoonist as a child and practiced by drawing
Popeye. ``Someday, Charles, you're going to be an artist,'' a
kindergarten teacher told him after looking at his drawing of a man
shoveling snow. His ambition was to do a comic strip as good as
George Herriman's ``Krazy Kat,'' but Schulz also admired Picasso,
Andrew Wyeth and Edward Hopper. Snoopy kept a van Gogh and a Wyeth
in his doghouse.
</P>
<P>
   The hurts of Schulz's early years provided a lifetime of
material. At Central High School in St. Paul's, Minn., he flunked
Latin, English, algebra and physics. ``Ripley's Believe It or
Not!'' accepted one of his drawings when he was 15 _ a picture of
Spike illustrating ``a hunting dog that eats pins, tacks and razor
blades'' _ but the cartoons he drew for his high school yearbook
were rejected. Schulz remembered his failures more vividly than his
successes.
</P>
<P>
   After graduation he took a correspondence course from Art
Instruction Inc., but before he could start a career he was drafted
into the Army. He left for boot camp only days after his mother
died of cancer. (Schulz later suggested that this coincidence might
have been the reason for his lifelong hatred of travel.) During
World War II, from 1943 to 1945, Schulz served in France and
Germany and became a staff sergeant in the 20th Armored Division.
He once refused to toss a grenade into an artillery emplacement
because he saw a little dog wander into it.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, he tried various odd jobs: lettering the comics
at a Catholic magazine called Timeless Topix; drawing a weekly
cartoon called ``Li'l Folks,'' the precursor to ``Peanuts,'' for
the St. Paul Pioneer Press; and selling occasional spot cartoons to
The Saturday Evening Post.
</P>
<P>
   He also taught at his alma mater, Art Instruction Inc. There he
fell in love with a redhead, Donna Johnson, and proposed marriage.
She turned him down and married a fireman instead. He never forgot.
Johnson became the Little Red-Haired Girl, Charlie Brown's
unrequited love, who was often talked about but never seen in the
strip. Schulz married Joyce Halverson in 1949; the marriage ended
in divorce.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't create humor out of happiness,'' Schulz said is his
1980 book, ``Charlie Brown, Snoopy and Me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm astonished at the number of people who write to me saying,
`Why can't you create happy stories for us? Why does Charlie Brown
always have to lose? Why can't you let him kick the football?'
Well, there is nothing funny about the person who gets to kick the
football.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The strip's start was bittersweet. In 1949 Schulz submitted some
of his ``Li'l Folks'' comic strips to United Feature Syndicate. The
syndicate liked the strip but insisted on calling it ``Peanuts,''
because ``Li'l Folks'' was too similar to the name of another strip
``I was very upset with the title,'' Schulz once said, ``and still
am.''
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 2, 1950, the first ``Peanuts'' strip was published. It
depicted Shermy and Patty sitting on the sidewalk discussing
Charlie Brown: ``Well, here comes ol' Charlie Brown!'' ... ``Good
ol' Charlie Brown'' ... ``Yes, sir! Good ol' Charlie Brown.'' And
then, as Charlie Brown passes them, ``How I hate him!''
</P>
<P>
   That year, seven newspapers bought ``Peanuts,'' and Schulz
earned $90 a week in royalties. But by 1953, the cartoon was a hit
and he was earning $30,000 per year. In 1955 (and again in 1964)
the National Cartoonists Society awarded Schulz the Reuben for
being the outstanding cartoonist of the year. He received the Yale
Humor Award in 1956 and the School Bell Award from the National
Education Association in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peanuts'' was based on repetition and predictability. As
Schulz put it: ``All the loves in the strip are unrequited; all the
baseball games are lost; all the test scores are D-minuses; the
Great Pumpkin never comes and the football is always pulled away.''
One of the few innovations Schulz introduced was allowing Snoopy
(after eight years) to stand on two feet and to have his thoughts
written out in balloons.
</P>
<P>
   Snoopy could always be counted on to nap, fantasize, and wonder
when his next meal would arrive. Charlie Brown, the round-headed
blockhead (named after one of Schulz's childhood friends, not after
the cartoonist himself), could always be counted on to persevere
despite constant failure. He once held onto the string of a kite
that was stuck in a tree for eight days running, until the rain
made him stop. At the time, it was the longest run of immobility
for any cartoon character. His first home run came after nearly 43
years of strike-outs, on March 30, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   No adult ever appeared in ``Peanuts,'' though in television
specials there were occasional wah-wah sounds denoting the voices
of teachers and parents. As Schulz once put it, ``Well, there just
isn't room for them.'' Curses never got worse than ``Aaugh!''
``Good grief,'' ``Rats!'' ``Curse you, Red Baron!'' or a knot of
lines scrunched up in frustration.
</P>
<P>
   The strips were just the beginning. In 1952, Schulz started
turning out ``Peanuts'' books: ``Peanuts,'' ``More Peanuts,''
``Good Grief, More Peanuts!'' ``Good Ol' Charlie Brown,''
``Happiness Is a Warm Puppy'' and dozens more. New compilations
rolled off the presses every year for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually ``Peanuts'' was translated into Serbo-Croatian,
Malay, Chinese, Tlingit, Catalan and 15 other languages. Books came
out with titles like, ``Het Grote Snoopy Winterspelletjes-Boek''
and ``Du Bist Sub, Charlie Braun.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1960s brought animated ``Peanuts'' television specials. The
first was ``A Charlie Brown Christmas,'' which Schulz wrote in one
weekend with Lee Mendelson. Accompanied by Vince Guaraldi's jazz
piano, animated by Bill Melendez and unassisted by any laugh track,
``A Charlie Brown Christmas'' was shown on CBS in 1965 (and still
runs every winter). It won an Emmy and a Peabody. Many more
television specials followed, including ``It's the Great Pumpkin,
Charlie Brown.'' Five of the specials won Emmys. There were also
``Peanuts'' feature films, including ``A Boy Named Charlie Brown.''
</P>
<P>
   The takeoffs came rolling in. In 1966, the Royal Guardsmen wrote
a rock song, ``Snoopy and the Red Baron.'' In 1967, a musical,
``You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown,'' was produced Off-Broadway. (A
1999 revival on Broadway won two Tony Awards.) ``Peanuts Gallery,''
a concerto, was composed by Ellen Taaffe Zwilich and had its
premiere at Carnegie Hall in 1997. Schulz received the Ordre des
Arts et des Lettres from the French Ministry of Culture. In 1990,
his work was shown at the Louvre; the gala had Snoopys in couture.
</P>
<P>
   Many pundits tried to put their finger on the ``Peanuts'' spell
and they generally rambled on in a vaguely philosophical vein.
Umberto Eco, who wrote the introduction to the first Italian
``Peanuts'' book, referred to Schulz's work as ``poesie
interrompue,'' or interrupted poetry, and using Freud, Beckett,
Adler, and Thomas Mann, said: ``These children affect us because in
a certain sense they are monsters; they are the monstrous infantile
reductions of all the neuroses of a modern citizen of the
industrial civilization.''
</P>
<P>
   In an essay called ``Peanuts: The Americanization of
Augustine,'' Arthur Asa Berger, a scholar of popular culture,
observed that Schulz was ``a mirthful moralist'' and a master of
Freudian humor _ humor that ``serves to mask aggression.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger called Snoopy ``an existential hero in every sense of the
term,'' a dog who ``strives, with dogged persistence and unyielding
courage, to overcome what seems to be his fate _ that he is a
dog.'' He is ``a bon vivant, he participates in history, he has an
incredible imagination, he is witty, he expresses himself with
virtuosity in any number of ways (eye movements, ear movements,
tail movements, wisecracks, facial expressions) and he is superb as
mimic and dancer.''
</P>
<P>
   The most concerted attempt to bring ``Peanuts'' to heel
philosophically came in the 1960s when Robert L. Short, a minister,
wrote two books on Peanuts theology, ``The Gospel According to
Peanuts,'' (1964) and ``The Parables of Peanuts''(1969). Short saw
signs of Original Sin in the ``Peanuts'' children, who were unable
``to produce any radical change for the better in themselves _ or
in each other.'' He saw ``the hazard of worshiping deities''
demonstrated in Linus' belief in the ``Great Pumpkin.'' And he
called Snoopy ``a typical Christian,'' a character with faults who
is nonetheless good: ``He is lazy, he is a `chow hound' without
parallel, he is bitingly sarcastic, he is frequently a coward,''
Short wrote. But he is ``a hound of heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   If the ``Peanuts'' characters left themselves open to the
meanderings of philosophers, ministers and analysts, they were even
more vulnerable to toy, card, book, and clothing manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   The licensing madness began in 1958, when the first plastic
Snoopy and Charlie Brown came out. In 1960, Hallmark began printing
``Peanuts'' cards and party goods. Then came sweat shirts and
pajamas, thermoses and lunchboxes. Plush Snoopy came in 1965.
Woodstock slippers, Lucy picture frames, Charlie Brown music boxes
followed. Schulz vetted all products for appropriateness and
rejected some: baby wipes for aesthetic reasons, ashtrays,
vitamins, sugary breakfast cereals, ice skates and tennis rackets.
</P>
<P>
   There were commercials too. In 1957 the ``Peanuts'' characters
started selling Ford Falcons. For 15 years they worked for the
Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. Snoopy was the official mascot of
NASA, and in 1969 NASA's lunar excursion module on the Apollo 11
mission was called Snoopy. The command module was Charlie Brown.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   By 1999, there were 20,000 different new products each year
adorned by ``Peanuts'' characters. In 1994, Schulz was inducted
into the Licensing Industry Merchandisers' Association Hall of
Fame. Jim Davis, the creator of the cartoon ``Garfield,'' who is no
stranger to commercialization, said, ``Schulz created the industry
as far as cartooning and licensing go.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether he minded his characters selling stuff,
Schulz said, ``I don't think there's such a thing as going
commercial with a comic strip, because a comic strip is a
commercial right from the beginning.'' It is there to sell
newspapers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Forbes listed the cartoonist among the 10 wealthiest
entertainers, earning $32 million per year.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless his lifestyle remained simple. Schulz, who hated to
travel, said he would have been happy living his whole life in
Minneapolis. But ``had a restless first wife,'' so they moved to
Sebastopol, Calif., and he set up his studio in Santa Rosa. In
1969, after the local ice rink closed, he and his wife, Joyce,
built a new one, the Redwood Empire Ice Skating Arena. ``Because of
Snoopy's hockey playing,'' Schulz explained, ``I have to keep in
the game. So I bought an arena.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles and Joyce Schulz had five children. But the marriage
ended in divorce in 1972. He said, ``I don't think she liked me
anymore, and I just got up and left one day.''
</P>
<P>
   A year later, he met Jeannie Clyde at the ice rink and married
her. Schulz's workday typically began with a trip in his Mercedes
(license plate WDSTK1, after Woodstock) down from the hills near
where he lived, breakfast at the ice rink's Warm Puppy Snack Bar, a
trip to his stone-and-redwood studio at One Snoopy Place to draw
his strip, lunch at the ice rink, more work in the afternoon in his
studio and dinner at a restaurant with his wife.
</P>
<P>
   While his small staff dealt with the commercial end of the
business, he attended only to drawing. He used a yellow legal pad
for sketching and drew with an Esterbrook Radial pen. He would
start doodling until something funny happened. He never took
suggestions from anyone (though he did draw on conversations,
newspapers, Bartlett's Familiar Quotations, and his children's
antics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drawing a daily comic strip is not unlike having an English
theme hanging over your head every day for the rest of your life,''
he once said. He could do a strip an hour and six strips a day, but
preferred not to. He generally kept three months ahead of
publication and never took more than 10 days off at a time _ and
then only reluctantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peanuts'' continued to appear when Schulz had quadruple bypass
heart surgery in 1981. And it was only under orders from United
Feature that he took off for five weeks in 1997, for his 75th
birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Jeannie Schulz once said that all the characters in ``Peanuts''
are parts of her husband. ``He's crabby like Lucy, diffident like
Charlie Brown. There's a lot of Linus _ he's philosophical and
wondering about life.'' Like Schroeder, he loved classical music
(though he always liked Brahms better than Beethoven). And like
Snoopy, he was a war buff. Snoopy had all of World War I covered.
But Schulz knew all the World War II battlegrounds and was the head
of a capital fund-raising campaign for the National D-Day Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the Church of God, where he a Sunday-school teacher
and administrator and would occasionally deliver the sermon. He
didn't drink or smoke. People described him as looking like a
druggist. He found Garry Trudeau's ``Doonesbury'' and Walt Kelly's
``Pogo'' too political. But he admired the work of Cathy Guisewite,
the cartoonist who draws ``Cathy,'' and Johnston, the creator of
``For Better or For Worse.'' His favorite ice cream flavor was
vanilla.
</P>
<P>
   Schulz is survived by his wife, Jeannie, a philanthropist, and
his children: Meredith Hodges, who raises mules in Loveland, Colo.;
Charles, Jr. (called Monte), a novelist in Nevada City, Calif.;
Craig, a private pilot in Santa Rosa, Calif.; Amy Johnson, who has
nine children and lives in Alpine, Utah; and Jill Schulz Transki,
who runs an inline-skating business with her husband in Santa
Barbara, Calif. He is also survived by two stepchildren, Brooke
Clyde, an lawyer in Santa Rosa, Calif., and Lisa Brockway, of
Ashland, Ore., and 18 grandchildren.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Despite his large family and large success he was a melancholy
man who worried and was often lonely, depressed and plagued by
panic attacks, features that Rheta Grimsley Johnson brought out in
her 1989 biography ``Good Grief: The Story of Charles M. Schulz.''
Sally, Charlie Brown's sister, put it well in a school report on
night and day: ``Daytime is so you can see where you're going.
Nighttime is so you can lie in bed worrying.''
</P>
<P>
   Schulz had a white terrier named Andy, played golf (12
handicap), tennis (for a while with Billie Jean King) and bridge.
But he was most devoted to hockey and ice-skating. He was a
right-handed shot.
</P>
<P>
   He hated cats, coconut and sleeping away from home. And he never
forgot a slight. Johnston once said, ``He's bitter about the little
red-haired girl who didn't marry him. He's bitter about his
divorce. He's bitter about getting old.'' And he was bitter about
the lack of recognition cartoonists get. This is what he said about
cartooning: ``It will destroy you. It will break your heart.''
</P>
<P>
   The creator of one of the least troubled dogs of all time,
Schulz compared his own panic to that of a dog ``running
frantically down the road pursuing the family car.'' The dog ``is
not really being left behind,'' he said, ``but for that moment in
his limited understanding, he is being left alone forever.''
</P>
<P>
   As Schulz got older, he began to think about the end of his
strip. He knew that he didn't want anyone else to draw it.
``Everything has to end,'' he once said. ``This is my excuse for
existence. No one else will touch it.''
</P>
<P>
   In November, he was hospitalized for colon cancer and started
chemotherapy. On Dec. 14, he announced that his strip would end.
</P>
<P>
   But thoughts of death had long since crept into his strip.
``After you've died, do you get to come back?'' Linus once asked
Charlie Brown. He replied, ``If they stamp your hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Schulz always felt for the little man and the little animal. He
once said that his philosophy of life could be found in the Gospel
of St. Luke: ``It were better for him that a millstone were hanged
about his neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should
offend one of these little ones.''

INDONESIA'S PRESIDENT SUSPENDS ACCUSED GENERAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Updates with complete writethru.)

<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ President Abdurrahman Wahid on Sunday
backed away from his demand for the resignation of his defiant
security minister, General Wiranto, then turned around hours later
and suspended him.
</P>
<P>
   The confusing flip-flop came on the day the president returned
from a two-week foreign trip during which he had repeatedly urged
the general to step down but constantly changed the details and
emphasis of his statements.
</P>
<P>
   The president's unusual long-distance confrontation had created
uncertainty in Jakarta and in foreign financial markets. It had
raised questions over whether he was cleverly pressuring the
general and smoking out enemies or whether he was not in full
control of his own impulsive statements.
</P>
<P>
   The confrontation with the country's most prominent military
figure also turned the president's policy of assertion of civilian
control into a dangerous crisis. It raised fears of a military
coup, fueled in part by Wahid's warnings. And it left in question
both Wahid's personnel policies and the steadiness of his
stewardship as president.
</P>
<P>
   His demands for resignation had followed a report by a local
investigating commission that said the general _ Indonesia's most
prominent military man _ should face trial for his part in
atrocities committed in East Timor last year in which hundreds of
people died.
</P>
<P>
   The president's unusual behavior went so far as ordering Defense
Minister Juwono Sudarsono _ technically Wiranto's subordinate _ to
tell the general to resign. But the president chose not to issue a
direct order to the general.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to this verbal onslaught, Wiranto refused to resign
until he could speak directly with the president.
</P>
<P>
   That moment came hours after Wahid returned early Sunday to
Jakarta, in a meeting that also included Vice President Megawati
Sukarnoputri and the attorney general, who is charged with
investigating the general.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid then met with reporters and said, ``I asked him to resign
but he said he preferred to be investigated by a legal process and
I said, `OK' We have to give him a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I have the prerogative to replace my ministers. But
we abide by the law. If the results of the report implicate him,
then he must resign.''
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to an expected report by the attorney general,
Marzuki Darusman, on whether Wiranto should be put on trial for the
violence and destruhat followed East Timor's vote last
August for independence from Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Then, late at night, the president again met with Wiranto,
emerging at midnight to tell a small group of reporters that he had
suspended the general pending the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Many Indonesians remained confused Monday by their garrulous
president, and some analysts said he may have devalued the power of
his word by constantly changing it and by failing to demand
obedience.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, some analysts said, it was notable that
during two weeks of sparring, Wiranto failed to garner strong
support from within the military, with several prominent commanders
asserting their allegiance to civilian control.
</P>
<P>
   While the president may have appeared weak or vacillating in
terms of his personal command, he did emphasize the supremacy of
law in the first of his statements Sunday, placing the general's
fate in the hands of the attorney general, placing the issue in the
hands of the attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the right to change my ministers,'' the president said.
``But we have to abide by the law. If the results of the report
implicate him, then he must resign, as I have already said
before.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, what he has said is that he wanted the general to
resign immediately, even before any results or preliminary findings
are made. But he has declined to exercise his right to fire his
ministers.
</P>
<P>
   Those who see cunning in Wahid's seemingly off-the-cuff style
say it seems to have the effect of pummeling his targets in his
chosen direction with a mixture of verbal rabbit punches, jokes and
expressions of personal regard. He is a difficult man to understand
or to grapple with.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no problem,'' Wahid said at his first news conference
Sunday. ``Wiranto and I are good friends. It is the media that
perceives us to be enemies.''
</P>
<P>
   But the president must be held responsible for the perceptions
of the media, said Dewi Fortuna Anwar, a political analyst who was
a top aide to former president B.J. Habibie.
</P>
<P>
   The past two weeks had created unnecessarily a sense of
nervousness and uncertainty, including a surge of coup rumors to
which Wahid had himself contributed directly, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both are the losers here,'' she said of the president and the
general. ``And it was quite unnecessary. And it could all have been
done in a more dignified way.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the president had stated that one reason he
wanted the general to resign was to strengthen confidence among
foreign investors and financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   But the effect, in the short term at least, may have been the
opposite. Jakarta's stock exchange and the value of its currency
have slipped during the past two weeks and some analysts said they
expected further slippage in the coming week following the seeming
retreat by the president.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his seemingly impulsive verbal fits and starts, however,
there is a consistent direction to the president's policies, toward
democracy, openness, tolerance and the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   By refusing to rule by fiat, Wahid is revolutionizing leadership
in Indonesia after 32 years of autocratic rule by former president
Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   By delegating the outcome of his standoff with Wiranto to his
highly respected attorney general, the president seemed to be
subordinating both the executive and the military to the rule of
law.
</P>
<P>
   But then on Sunday, in a style that continues to keep
Indonesians off balance, he seemed to have a late-night change of
mind.

COMMENTARY: CRIMINAL JUSTICE BREAKDOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BOB HERBERT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The gruesome problems in the criminal justice system that have
been overlooked for so many years are starting to burst into public
view, and the system is breaking down in some parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles an enormous scandal is unfolding. Dozens of
people are known to have been framed by the police and some
innocent people reportedly were shot. A criminal probe of the
department has uncovered a wide range of offenses committed by
police officers, including drug dealing, tampering with evidence,
witness intimidation, perjury and assault.
</P>
<P>
   The police misconduct has resulted in the reversal of more than
30 criminal convictions. It is believed that hundreds of other
cases have been tainted. The estimated potential loss from lawsuits
against the department and the city has soared beyond $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   In Illinois, Gov. George Ryan has ordered a temporary halt to
executions, because so many innocent people were landing on death
row.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan is a moderate Republican and a supporter of the death
penalty. But the criminal justice system in his state has proved to
be both tragic and farcical. Real killers roamed free while the
wrongfully convicted were handed tickets to eternity. In some cases
ignorance and incompetence were the culprits. In other, more
chilling instances, the innocent were deliberately betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois has exonerated 13 men who had been condemned to death.
Across the country scores of people have had their convictions
overturned after being sentenced to die.
</P>
<P>
   Said Ryan: ``I cannot support a system which, in its
administration, has proven so fraught with error, and has come so
close to the ultimate nightmare, the state's taking of an innocent
life.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Tribune, in an investigative series on the death
penalty in Illinois, concluded: ``Capital punishment in Illinois is
so riddled with faulty evidence, unscrupulous trial tactics and
legal incompetence that justice has been forsaken.''
</P>
<P>
   From coast to coast the criminal justice system is riddled with
the horrors of incompetence and worse. Wrongful executions, trust
me, have already occurred. I wrote a series of columns about David
Wayne Spence, who was executed in Texas in 1997. Spence was almost
certainly innocent. The detective who investigated the triple
murder for which he was executed told me, ``Nothing from the
investigation ever led us to any evidence that he was involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Spence's execution apparently escaped the notice of Gov. George
W. Bush, who was quick to assert on ``Meet the Press'' on Sunday
that he was ``confident that every person that has been put to
death in Texas under my watch has been guilty of the crime
charged.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., who is sponsoring legislation that
would offer some additional protection against wrongful convictions
in death penalty cases, spoke last week about the case of Anthony
Porter, who spent 16 years on death row in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was he cleared by the state?'' asked Leahy. ``No. He was
cleared by a class of undergraduate journalism students at
Northwestern University, who took on his case as a class project.
That got him out.''
</P>
<P>
   If the criminal justice system has such a poor track record when
it comes to capital cases, imagine what the situation is like in
the cases with much less at stake. How many thousands of people
have been wrongfully convicted? In how many instances have the real
criminals been ignored by the authorities, and thus allowed to
remain free and prey on others?
</P>
<P>
   How many innocent people have been maimed or killed in the name
of the law? Consider the District of Columbia's Metropolitan Police
Department, which killed more per capita in the 1990s than
any other big-city force. The Washington Post, after an eight-month
investigation, said ``internal police files and court records
reveal a pattern of reckless and indiscriminate gunplay by officers
sent into the streets with inadequate training and little
oversight.''
</P>
<P>
   There is an epidemic of police and prosecutorial misconduct and
incompetence in this country. The scandals in Los Angeles and
Illinois are festering sores, symptoms of a complex disease that
both threatens and _ to the extent that we ignore it _ shames us
all.

COMMENTARY: NEW `VAST CONSPIRACY' 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The religio-politician Pat Robertson, host of TV's
Hour of Smarm, took to the airwaves Sunday to peddle a new
vast-conspiracy theory.
</P>
<P>
   As he explained it on ``Face the Nation,'' ``people allied with
Gore'' were encouraging Democrats and independents to vote for John
McCain in the South Carolina primary next week. Why? Because ``they
consider him a weaker candidate than Governor Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Never mind polls showing that Vice President Al Gore now defeats
George W. Bush. Never mind how John McCain now trounces Democrat
Gore in the same polls. Just as candidate Hillary (Fry the
killers!) No-Last-Name demonstrates, vast-conspiracy theorists need
not be encumbered by facts.
</P>
<P>
   But the Lord works in mysterious ways. In cooking up its
cockamamie explanation for McCain's attractiveness to voters across
the political spectrum, religio-pols expose the fear of Republican
elders: that the dread ``they'' _ all those starry-eyed amateurs
and reformist outsiders _ may take over ``our thing.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, conservatives have to confront the group with the
old ``GOP Death Wish.'' That clubby set of single-issue power
brokers prefers to float out to sea in a Viking's funeral than to
present a candidate who can appeal across party lines and energize
swing voters.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike these old-line pressure groupies to whom campaign finance
reform is anathema, the Republican rank and file _ not to mention
GOP House members _ seeks a likely winner to bear the party
standard.
</P>
<P>
   That seeming electability is what made Bush so attractive at
first. But without that assurance of victory, his supporters are
defecting. They are not afflicted with the GOP death wish that
would make them masters of a wasteland. These Republicans are not
satisfied with a winner in July's convention; they want a winner in
November's election.
</P>
<P>
   To them, McCain now holds out the exciting prospect that Bush
once offered. That's why so much frantic bet-hedging is going on
behind the scenes. And that's why the panicked power brokers of
yesteryear are preparing this vast-conspiracy excuse for strong
showings by McCain in South Carolina and Michigan: It's the devil
(in the form of those tricky Democrats and independents) who's
doing it.
</P>
<P>
   In his devilish way, goes this weird construct, Beelzebub is
manipulating the GOP to pick the nominee easiest for Gore to beat.
Thus, all polls formerly believed in so devoutly are now to be
despised. Moreover _ here comes the need for an even longer leap of
nonfaith _ Gore is eager to debate the pushover McCain and trembles
at the thought of debating the slashing Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Hence, loathed talk-show-spinning! Nothing so corrupts a
campaign's credibility as insistence on the opposite of what
everyone knows to be true.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that McCain is now much more likely than Bush to
defeat Democrat Gore. The question is whether Bush can change that
growing perception in the next few weeks _ not by tearing down
McCain, which would ultimately be self-defeating, but by building
up himself.
</P>
<P>
   The paradox is that Bush has been becoming a better candidate
even as his campaign has been getting worse. It's a pleasure to see
him grow before our eyes: no more cocky smirks, no fear of being
blindsided, no dismaying hesitancy on foreign-policy answers. He
needed not just preparation but the shock of personal adversity.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, his strategists have evidently decided to win
the nomination at the cost of the election. Not only is their heavy
tax-cutting a year out of joint, but putting his previously touted
compassion in the freezer in favor of pandering to the likes of the
Robertson power brokers is foolish.
</P>
<P>
   In the post-Clinton era, authenticity is in; you can no longer
stick your thumb in the moderate eye to capture the so-called
``core'' and then hope to lunge back to win the middle.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, before an audience of presumably well-behaved
executives at Seawell's Restaurant in Columbia, S.C., McCain and
Bush will debate. Larry King of CNN will moderate, which means the
show will be freewheeling.
</P>
<P>
   Who will best put himself and his ideas forward? Who will most
effectively make the case against more Clinton-Gore? Contrariwise,
who will snipe and pander?
</P>
<P>
   Let's watch and see. This is getting good.

 VETERANS APPEAR TO HAVE BOND WITH McCAIN  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON HARBOR, S.C. _ Jim Flatley's most harrowing Vietnam
memory is looking down from the cockpit of his F-4 Phantom jet and
counting 23 surface-to-air missiles trained on him. Miraculously,
bravely, the naval aviator maneuvered the enemy's barrage and
returned safely to his carrier base.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you go through that kind of thing, you grow up a little
bit and get a little common sense, if you didn't have it before,''
says Flatley, who flew 344 combat missions over Vietnam and retired
from the Navy as a rear admiral in 1987. ``John McCain's got all of
that inside him.''
</P>
<P>
   Flatley was McCain's classmate at the Naval Academy, served with
him on carriers in the Mediterranean, and shared with him the
blessing and burden of being the son of a World War II hero. Today,
from his office here aboard the USS Yorktown, which is now a naval
aviation museum, Flatley is working hard to elect McCain as
commander in chief.
</P>
<P>
   With its Republican primary on Saturday, South Carolina is the
next big battleground in the GOP presidential contest. Both McCain,
the Arizona senator, and Texas Governor George W. Bush are making
strong appeals to the state's 375,000 veterans and dueling over
endorsements from local war heroes. Sunday, on ``Meet the Press,''
Bush predicted, ``I may carry the veterans' vote in South
Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim Flatley is a dear friend of mine and the first naval
aviator to land a C-130 on an aircraft carrier,'' McCain told a
North Charleston audience of veterans who seemed to appreciate the
feat. ``That clearly indicates he has more guts than brains.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is impressed by whether a candidate, including
McCain, served in the military. They say that in a peaceful world,
it is not an important qualification for a president.
</P>
<P>
   Many older veterans, however, say that America needs to ensure
that someone with military experience is on deck if the nation ever
needs to win another big war. For those who served in Vietnam,
there seems to be something even stronger: an emotional bond with
McCain, who, in the cruel test of more than five years in a Hanoi
prisoner-of-war camp, says he learned the lessons of duty, honor,
and country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can give you all the words in the world, but only someone
who was there would truly understand the sacrifice and have an
inkling of what McCain went through,'' Tom O'Halloran said as he
and his wife, Donna, visited the Yorktown. A Christmas tree farmer
in Viewtown, Va., O'Halloran was in the Air Force in Vietnam and
said he is supporting McCain because he is a military man with
proven character.
</P>
<P>
   Leroy Ganaway, a disabled Vietnam veteran and a Democrat, said
he feels ``spiritually bound'' to McCain and believes it is ``very
important'' to elect the first Vietnam veteran to the White House
as a way to heal some old wounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We Vietnam veterans have contained our bitterness as society
hands out millions upon millions of dollars to men who can throw a
ball into a basket or sink a ball in a hole,'' said Ganaway, who
lives in North Charleston and attended a McCain town meeting.
``Then we watch as military men, who put their life on the line,
come back to issues of food and housing and medical care.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who sometimes salutes fellow veterans and often asks
them to stand and be recognized at his rallies, said emphatically
that he will correct what ails the US military: bloated procurement
budgets, low pay, soldiers on food stamps, inadequate health
benefits for veterans, and too-frequent deployments that sour
families on military careers and dampen recruitment.
</P>
<P>
   He does not mention Bush, who joined the Texas Air National
Guard during Vietnam, but he does belittle President Clinton, with
no military record, as ``a commander in chief our men and women in
uniform don't have confidence in.''
</P>
<P>
   Many younger people challenge the view that military service is
mandatory or even an important qualification for a president. As
his 6-year-old son played with the Yorktown's wheel, Bruce
Burtless, 42, said the next president does not need such on-the-job
training. Burtless, who is not a veteran, said he intends to vote
for Bush because he has ``the best chance'' of winning the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cold War is essentially over, and we are less reliant on
the military than we used to be,'' said Burtless, who repairs wells
and pumps in Adrian, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   That is what concerns James Knight, who pilots DC-10s for
Federal Express in Nashville, about McCain. Through his work he
knows many pilots, quite a few of them Vietnam combat veterans, and
the ones who flew single-seat aircraft frequently do not adapt well
to a crew or team environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fighter pilots are a breed of people all of their own,'' said
Knight, who was in the Air Force from 1967 to 1973 and inspected
the Vietnam-era aircraft on the Yorktown's flight deck. ``The
skills it takes to fly an airplane don't always translate into the
world of diplomacy, and personal heroism can be, in later life, as
much a hindrance as a benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   Knight quipped that he thinks both McCain and Bush are
``arrested adolescent fighter pilots.'' Still, he and his wife,
Judy, like Bush better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no doubt about McCain's physical courage, and we do
need leaders who will look you in the eye and tell the truth,''
Knight said. ``But there are plenty of combat pilots I wouldn't buy
a used car from.''

VICE PRESIDENT QUIETLY MEETS WITH REV. SHARPTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In an apparent effort to win more of the black vote
here, Vice President Al Gore met secretly Sunday with the Rev. Al
Sharpton, the controversial preacher. Emerging from the building
where Gore's daughter, Karenna Gore Schiff, lives, Sharpton refused
to discuss the meeting, saying only, ``It was a good meeting, I'm
not going to say anything more.''
</P>
<P>
   The late-afternoon meeting seemed to come as a surprise to
several senior members of the Gore campaign staff. Reporters caught
Sharpton leaving the Upper East Side building.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton arrived at about 4 p.m. and stayed for just under an
hour. Donna Brazile, Gore's campaign manager, Erik Eve, the state
director for the Gore campaign, and Bronx borough president Roberto
Ramierez also attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``They talked about issues important to the community, including
the Community Reinvestment Act, minority opportunity and the media,
and economic development,'' said Gore spokesman Chris Lehane.
Sharpton also expressed interest in a debate on minority issues.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Sharpton has threatened to picket Gore events if
such a debate was not held in New York. Gore's staff pointed out
that such a debate is already scheduled for Feb. 21 at the Apollo
Theater in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   Lehane said that the vice president did not ask for an
endorsement, nor was one discussed. When asked why Gore and
Sharpton met after Gore had repeatedly declined to do so, Lehane
said that the Gore campaign wants ``the support of every single
Democrat in New York State.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president spent the day wooing voters at two
African-American churches, picking up the unofficial endorsement of
one of the city's most influential preachers.
</P>
<P>
   To those who believe America is now color-blind and
discrimination-free, ``what country are they looking at, when they
make that judgment?'' Gore asked the congregation at Allen African
Methodist Episcopal Church Sunday in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Floyd Flake, a former Democratic congressman from
Queens, told his congregation that he could not officially endorse
a candidate for president from the pulpit, since it might violate
the separation of church and state. But he surprised Gore by
proclaiming, ``I will say it now, and you read it well: This should
be the next president of the United States,'' drawing a loud roar
from the enthusiastic crowd.
</P>
<P>
   At the Allen A.M.E. and the Calvary Baptist Church in Queens,
Gore quoted from Scripture and hymns and recited rapidly all the
top Clinton-Gore administration appointments that went to blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Former senator Bill Bradley visited the Allen A.M.E. on Feb. 6,
but at the time Flake said, ``There won't be any endorsements
today. I just want (Bradley) to see what we do here. This is an
open pulpit.''

SOFT MONEY SETS OFF RIVALS' HARD WORDS
</HEADLINE>
 (Originally skedded BUSH) 
 (nk) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ After a tense stretch of harsh attacks and
paradoxical resolutions to run their campaigns on positive tracks,
Gov. George W. Bush and Sen. John McCain used their appearances on
television news programs Sunday to take renewed aim at each other.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, in an interview on CBS's ``Face the Nation,'' assailed
Bush for opposing his proposed legislation to ban the largely
unregulated donations to political parties known as soft money.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thinks it should remain legal, I guess, for a
Chinese-army-owned corporation to give unlimited amounts of money
to an American political campaign,'' McCain said, referring to one
of the scandals of the 1996 presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign quickly issued a news release noting that such
contributions were already illegal and that Bush supported bans on
soft money from corporations and labor unions but deemed other
aspects of McCain's plan flawed.
</P>
<P>
   Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Bush, also questioned how
McCain's salvo squared with his vow late last week to stop running
negative commercials and keep his campaign on a higher plane.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, in an interview on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' dismissed
McCain's vow as a transparent ploy that did not excuse the Arizona
senator for running two television commercials that likened Bush's
trustworthiness to President Clinton's.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's about as low as you can get,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   And so the final week leading to South Carolina's Republican
primary on Feb. 19 began with echoes of the recriminations and
grievances that preceded it, a signal of how much is at stake for
each candidate and how tight the contest seems.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said his renunciation of negative advertising covered the
rest of the primaries, not just the South Carolina race. His
comments about Bush and soft money came after he was asked why,
despite his stated opposition to public financing of campaigns, he
had voted for it ``four or five times in the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I voted against it on 10 or 11 times,'' McCain responded, then
alluded to his campaign's contention that the conflicting examples
involved procedural votes that he cast to keep an otherwise
desirable piece of legislation alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to allow the perfect to be the enemy of the
good,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   But Fleischer, in the news release and in a telephone interview,
said the votes illustrated a pattern of McCain's actions falling
short of his words.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's recent visit to Bob Jones University in Greenville, S.C.,
a conservative Christian institution that bans interracial dating,
came up in both interviews.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said that he had no plans to make such an appearance, and
that if he did, ``I would condemn openly the policies of Bob
Jones.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush had expressed his disapproval of the dating policy at a
news conference at a nearby hotel after his appearance at the
university but had not addressed the topic in his remarks to about
6,000 students and faculty members there.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Bush said he had no second thoughts about going there,
even though Bob Jones III, who sat beside Bush at the university,
once branded Bush's father a ``devil'' for proposing that the
school lose its tax-exempt status because of its discriminatory
policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not agree with this notion that somehow, if I go to try
to attract votes and to lead people toward a better tomorrow,
somehow I get subscribed to _ some doctrine gets subscribed to
me,'' the Texas governor said.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Robertson, a Bush supporter, also addressed the subject on
``Face the Nation,'' saying, ``I think George Bush wants to reach
out and touch every segment of the population.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He basically needs these people to win,'' Robertson added.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said his support for the death penalty had not been shaken
by the fact that Gov. George Ryan of Illinois, a Republican ally,
had placed a moratorium on executions because more than a dozen
people sent to death row since 1977 had been exonerated.
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead to the South Carolina primary, Bush expressed
concern that Democrats in the state, who are allowed to vote in the
contest, were mobilizing to support McCain, because they felt he
would be easier for the Democratic nominee to defeat in the general
election.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush remained in Texas on Sunday, McCain campaigned in
South Carolina and Georgia. At a book store in Atlanta, more than
1,000 people waited in line so he could sign copies of his
autobiography, ``Faith of My Fathers.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of them also swarmed onto McCain's bus so they could take
pictures of the spot where he typically sat.

ONE FUN SHOW, STARRING O'NEAL AND DUNCAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ They trotted out a younger generation Sunday,
an athletically incomparable cast of skittering point guards from
Philadelphia and floating small forwards from Toronto. Midair
improvisation and savvy scorers were no longer at a premium, but
the norm. It made you wonder: Where have all the great big men
gone?
</P>
<P>
   West, definitely the West.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal and Tim Duncan proved that reports of the
center position's demise in the NBA are greatly exaggerated. They
did their own Twin Towers thing at the New Arena here, leading the
Western Conference to a 137-126 victory over the Eastern Conference
in the 49th All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal was awesome, parlaying monster blocked shots and powerful
dunks into a 22-point, nine-rebound day. His front-line companion,
Duncan, ended with 24 points and 14 rebounds as the West simply
swatted away those pesky fleas from the East like Allen Iverson and
Vince Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Always perceived as too young, too overhyped and too consumed
with his entertainment pursuits to realize his potential, O'Neal
proved his merits as the biggest player in the league's midseason
extravaganza. Duncan merely added to his growing list of
achievements, which included an NBA championship ring last season.
</P>
<P>
   Asked who would take home the most valuable player trophy after
the two held the award up high at center court, O'Neal smiled and
said: ``He's got on one of those rings. I'm taking this.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Garnett was in the running, too, finishing with 24 points,
10 rebounds and five assists on a frontline the East could simply
not match. Iverson was up to the challenge, scoring 26 points on
10-of-18 shooting. Carter finished with 12 points and excited the
crowd with his acrobatic behavior.
</P>
<P>
   But the West finally took control of a close game in the fourth
quarter and put it away with about three minutes left, outscoring
the East by 39-28 in the final quarter. The combined 39 turnovers
did not make for great viewing. And neither the local flavor point
guard tandem of Gary Payton and Jason Kidd emerged enough to
capture the sellout crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the big fellas, the 7-foot-1-inch O'Neal and 7-foot Duncan,
tried as best they could to make up for the lack of genuine drama.
O'Neal finished with three blocked shots, while Duncan changed the
trajectory of about 10. The dunks were expected. But using jump
hooks and medium-range jump shots to make most of their points
offensively, they were too much for Alonzo Mourning or even Dikembe
Mutombo to handle.
</P>
<P>
   When O'Neal was not wowing the crowd with his power, he had fun
with the fans. Going coast-to-coast with the basketball at one
juncture in the first half, he softly put up a finger roll instead
of trying to take down the backboard support with a thunderous
slam.
</P>
<P>
   Honors for the most scintillating play went to Iverson and
Carter, who teamed up for a pretty sequence in the first quarter.
Carter was standing on the left baseline, double-teamed, when he
spotted Iverson on the right side. Carter whipped a no-look,
behind-the-back pass, and Duncan left him and went to stop Iverson,
a summit meeting of the game's most exciting diminutive player and
its most accomplished big man. Iverson hung in the air, drew the
foul and hit a sweet over-the-shoulder layup with his back to the
basket, bringing the crowd to its feet. Beating Duncan twice on the
same play was quite an accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   Iverson and Carter had combined on another play moments earlier,
when Iverson lofted an alley-oop pass along the right baseline that
Carter caught _ after he beat his defender back-door _ and
deposited for a dunk.
</P>
<P>
   At one point in the first half, Carter, the new slam-dunk
champion whom one league official said ``saved'' a monotonous
All-Star Saturday with his feats above the rim, took off from the
left baseline and slithered alongside the rim until releasing a
reverse layup on the right hand side.
</P>
<P>
   For all the talk about dynamic duos and NBC promos _ Kobe and
Shaq, Allan Houston and Latrell Sprewell, Jason Williams and Chris
Webber _ nothing looked more potent this weekend than Iverson and
Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, Bryant was spectacular. He always is. With three minutes
left in the game, he literally caught an Iverson layup attempt in
midair. On the other end moments later, Jason Kidd, the homegrown
star from Oakland Hills, lofted a ridiculously high alley-oop pass
that no human had any business laying a finger on, much less
catching. At its apex, Bryant somehow caught that basketball with
his right arm cocked back as far as it would go. He then slammed
the ball hard, a continuous ``ooooohhhhh!'' ushering it through the
rim. Youth had been served again.
</P>
<P>
   All-Star Weekend was about the future more than the past. The
game was telecast to more than 240 countries in 44 different
languages. For the first time, several players and both coaches
wore microphones, their comments edited for public consumption
during the telecast. For the first time, NBC used a separate set of
announcers for a high-definition television transmission.
</P>
<P>
   The average age of the 2000 class of All-Stars is 28.3. Standbys
like Karl Malone and John Stockton played only three minutes apiece
in the first half, and David Robinson played only seven. But there
was a poignant tribute to the past.
</P>
<P>
   With 6 minutes 50 seconds left in the game, the owner of the
Golden State Warriors, Chris Cohan, handed over the All-Star mantle
to next year's host, Washington.
</P>
<P>
   A video montage of Michael Jordan's career played out on the
Jumbotron above the arena, as the applause grew louder and more
intense with each highlight from Jordan's career. Jordan, now the
Wizards' head of basketball operations, received a standing ovation
as he walked to center court.
</P>
<P>
   Except for his hiatus as a minor-league baseball player, it was
the first All-Star Game Jordan had not played since 1985, the year
a precocious youngster from North Carolina was frozen out by his
elders. In many ways, with all the errant alley-oop passes off the
backboard and the lack of genuine theater throughout, it was like
inserting a saucy scene in a lackluster movie.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for that one moment, the game was in Michael's hands again.
And neither poor TV ratings nor empty seats could take away the
feeling that somehow, some way, everything was going to be all
right.

BUSH AND McCAIN: MIRROR IMAGES OF EACH OTHER 
 (With REPUBS) 
(nk) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ For weeks, Gov. George W. Bush's aides mocked
Sen. John McCain's campaign bus, ``The Straight Talk Express,''
deriding it as ``The Double-Talk Express.''
</P>
<P>
   But now, the Bush campaign has christened its own bus that roams
through this state ``The Victory Express.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the look-alike vehicles, it is increasingly tough to tell
the two Republican presidential candidates apart in this last,
frantic stretch before the South Carolina primary on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   As Bush and McCain find themselves in an unexpectedly
competitive duel to distinguish themselves, the more their battle
escalates and the more the two are looking and behaving alike on
everything from their campaign trappings to the heart of their
oratory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next, he'll be standing in the desert next to a cactus wearing
a T-shirt saying, `I'm from Arizona!''' said Mike Murphy, a senior
strategist for McCain. ``People want the real McCain, not a guy
wearing a McCain costume that doesn't fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Ari Fleischer, a Bush spokesman, scoffed at the remark, saying,
``It's hard to copy someone who doesn't stay in one place long
enough to be copied.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, one senior Bush adviser said that after the governor's
defeat in New Hampshire, there were discussions about making Bush
``a pure carbon copy'' of McCain as a way to win over the
independent voters that have flooded to the Arizona senator.
</P>
<P>
   While the campaign did not go that far, there has been something
of a role reversal in how the two candidates and their advisers
present themselves.
</P>
<P>
   It is reminiscent of Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill
Bradley last year. After polls showed Bradley surging in New
Hampshire, Gore adopted the posture of the underdog. As his
campaign aides traded recriminations, the vice president shed his
tie and jacket and left no doubt that he would do whatever it took
to win.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, Bradley behaved like the confident,
above-the-fray incumbent. And the Bradley camp was credited for its
political nimbleness. (That, of course, now seems like ancient
history.)
</P>
<P>
   Now, it is McCain strategists who are being called geniuses. And
the recriminations are among Bush loyalists who insist that they
had pressed long and hard to remedy the campaign's ills _ but no
one ever listened.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're seeing now is the real George Bush coming out, the
man that was so popular and is so popular as a governor,'' said
Rep. Marge Roukema, R-N.J. ``I've been saying that for weeks to the
campaign: They weren't projecting the real George Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps since he is still drowning in resources and
endorsements, Bush has not felt compelled to go as far as Gore and
declare himself the underdog.
</P>
<P>
   But at a town meeting on Friday at the College of Charleston
here, Bush sounded humbled. ``I'm here at this great institution to
ask for your vote,'' he said. ``I thank you for coming, and I'm
asking for your vote.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, it was McCain, at a packed town meeting a few
nights earlier outside the Stratford High School in Goose Creek, on
the outskirts of Charleston, who sounded newly confident,
declaring, ``My dear friends, tonight, with this kind of reception,
this kind of turnout, I am for the first time convinced that I will
win this primary in South Carolina!''
</P>
<P>
   As happened with Bradley's advisers last year, McCain is
behaving a little more like a front-runner. He and his aides have
shown flashes of a fresh confidence, bordering on arrogance, that
was once the province of the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Before New Hampshire, McCain liked to offer himself as ``the
overwhelming underdog'' who faced stiff odds getting the
nomination. McCain has scrapped that line from his standard speech.
</P>
<P>
   McCain displayed another sign of confidence during one of his
marathon chat sessions with reporters aboard his campaign bus this
week. He did not shy away from talking about possible members of a
McCain cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Of the two candidates, the more obvious transformation has been
in Bush, who has refashioned himself in the McCain mold (albeit
without the cactus). He appropriated McCain's anti-establishment
mantle. He put himself forward as a ``reformer with results'' and
began emphasizing the need to save Social Security and to pay down
the debt. He loosened his stump style, began fielding more
questions from voters (his clipped, five-word answers have been
replaced by sometimes long monologues) and shed the battery of
elected officials that would flank him at public appearances.
</P>
<P>
   This evolution was on display at the two events here this week,
where the candidates seemed like they had graduated from the same
political finishing school.
</P>
<P>
   Each bounced about the stage with a microphone, eagerly fielding
questions from a jammed-to-the-rafters crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Each pronounced himself the genuine reformer in the race and an
early advocate of overhauling the campaign finance system. Each
stood for so many questions that some people grew impatient and
left. And each eagerly ventured into the audience, shaking hands
and scribbling autographs.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Bush's remake, he and his advisers still seem confident
that they will win the nomination. They are just less obvious.
</P>
<P>
   A day or two before the New Hampshire primary, Karl Rove, Bush's
chief strategist, happily told reporters that the governor had
turned things around and would emerge victorious.
</P>
<P>
   Rove has learned his lesson. Asked about prospects in South
Carolina, he said Saturday: ``My job is to remain scared. And we're
going to run hard, hard, hard through the balance of the week.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, at least, it is the McCain camp's turn to gloat. Asked
whether the Bush bus was a rip-off of the McCain concept, Dan
Schnur, McCain's communications director, said, `` `Straight Talk
Two' might have been a little too obvious.''

BUSH CAMPAIGN'S POLLING BECOMES ISSUE IN PRIMARY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Inserts new graf beginning ``A copy ...'' Inserts 2 new grafs
beginning ``Opinsky described ...'') 
(lb) 
 By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Nearly 1,000 miles from South Carolina and the bitter
political war between George W. Bush and John McCain, one flank of
the war is being fought from a four-story office building in the
northern suburbs of this city.
</P>
<P>
   Up on the top floor, inside the offices of a company called
Voter Consumer Research, a few dozen people, from college students
to grandmothers, spent two days last week calling prospective
voters in South Carolina to ask them carefully scripted questions.
They began innocuously enough: Will you participate in the
Republican primary? How much attention have you paid to the GOP
race? Are things better or worse in the country?
</P>
<P>
   But the questions quickly shifted to McCain, and the tone became
less innocuous: In the guise of introducing questions, the callers
stated that McCain's tax plan does not cut rates for most people,
that he had been reprimanded by the Senate Ethics Committee and
that his campaign finance proposals would give labor unions and the
media more influence in deciding elections.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of poll is this? One written by the Bush campaign. The
people conducting it were not starry-eyed campaign volunteers but
were paid by the hour, not much more than minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   In an increasingly nasty primary in which each candidate has
blamed the other for the nastiness, the usually obscure role of
telephone canvassing and polling has unexpectedly become a central
issue as hundreds of thousands of calls pour down on voters in
South Carolina. McCain has complained that Bush and his supporters
are conducting a thinly disguised telephone smear campaign, a
charge the Texas governor vehemently denies.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has accused the Bush polling operation of spreading
negative information about McCain, rather than truly trying to
survey South Carolina voters. Such polling _ in which pollsters
give the impression that they are conducting a real poll, when they
are actually posing questions that spread doubts about the opponent
_ is known as ``push polling.''
</P>
<P>
   The allegation has put Bush on the defensive. ``It is just
ridiculous, it is unbelievable, this whole kind of thing about, you
know, Bush is push-polling, and we're not,'' Bush told host Tim
Russert on Sunday on `Meet the Press.' ``We're the one campaign,
Tim, that has said, `You're welcome to look at any phone script
that we pay for.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ari Fleischer, a Bush spokesman, said McCain and others had
mistakenly confused the Bush campaign's use of ``advocacy calling''
_ designed to drum up support _ with its polling. Fleischer said
the campaign had made 200,000 advocacy calls into South Carolina,
in which callers read a script essentially blaming the negative
tenor of the race on McCain, and then ask if the respondent would
vote for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the McCain questioning in South Carolina, conducted
by a firm called Public Opinion Strategies, appears designed to
gauge support for the Republican contenders, and to determine which
issues resonate with voters, and whether they regard themselves as
conservative or liberal.
</P>
<P>
   A copy of the questionnaire was provided by the McCain
organization and it does not include any questions or comments that
attack Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, several people at McCain rallies have told
stories of telephone calls that they said distorted McCain's record
and his personal history.
</P>
<P>
   The issue became public last week when a woman at a McCain rally
said her teen-age son answered the phone and heard McCain called a
liar, a cheat and a fraud. Then Marsha White, the wife of the mayor
of Greenville, a McCain supporter, said she had received a similar
call.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten a couple of hundred calls in our office for
people who say they've gotten these calls,'' said McCain's
spokesman, Howard Opinsky.
</P>
<P>
   But Fleischer said no such calls had been made by the Bush
campaign. To prove his point, on Sunday he released the script from
the poll conducted by Voter Consumer Research, the group that is
working from the Houston office building.
</P>
<P>
   Fleischer emphasized that this script was different from the
massive advocacy calls. He conceded that the wording seemed loaded
in several questions, but he said the scope of the survey was
limited to 300 respondents.
</P>
<P>
   Fleischer said that unlike push polling, which targets thousands
of people, the Voter Consumer Research survey was specifically
designed to determine which issues were resonating with voters in
South Carolina. He said the campaign might use its findings to
create television commercials. These, presumably, would be aimed at
whatever those surveyed mentioned as McCain's weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surveys gather research,'' Fleischer said, noting that the
small size of the survey would preclude it from influencing many
voters. ``Surveys are meant to figure out what people are
thinking.'' He added, ``Push polls are taken with hundreds of
thousands of people, or tens of thousands of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Frankovic, the director of surveys for CBS News,
reviewed the questions from the Bush campaign survey over the
telephone, and though she did not know if the assertions made about
McCain were true, she described the survey as ``fairly common'' and
``not unusual.'' She said political campaigns use partisan polling
to test attack lines much the same way that marketers poll people
to try out new slogans for products.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast to the long, detailed questions, she said push polls
are usually short and punchy in order to reach as many people as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Opinsky described the wording of several questions in the Bush
survey as inaccurate. He said McCain's tax plan provides cuts for
people in every income bracket, and he said the senator was never
reprimanded by the Senate Ethics Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Fleischer said the questions are accurate. He also said some
Bush supporters have received push-poll phone calls about the Texas
governor.
</P>
<P>
   Michael W. Traugott, president of the American Association for
Public Opinion Research, an organization of commercial, political
and academic pollsters, said that push polling is designed to
accomplish one of two things: to either convince people to change
from one candidate to another, or suppress an opponent's vote by
tarnishing his reputation in the eyes of his supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are deleterious and invidious effects to this,'' said
Traugott, who also teaches at the University of Michigan. ``This is
an unpleasant experience for most citizens, and we think it
increases their cynicism about politics and politicians.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As for the type of calls made by the Bush campaign, Traugott
said, ``There's a very thin line between advocacy calling, where
you have people calling around to promote your candidacy, as
opposed to negative-persuasion telephoning, which is designed to
move you away from another candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   One unknown quantity in evaluating the use of polls is that a
number of calls are being made on behalf of candidates by
organizations other than the two campaigns. Published reports have
suggested that groups such as the National Right to Life, as well
as pro-tobacco organizations, are planning to make calls in South
Carolina on behalf of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said he does not know what other organizations are
doing, and he has promised to fire anyone from his campaign if they
are involved in push polling.
</P>
<P>
   In Houston it is almost impossible to detect that the bland
brick building not far from a shopping center is actually a nerve
center in the presidential race. Bush first hired Voter Consumer
Research during his gubernatorial race, and the company now
operates phone banks north of the city. Some of its customers are
companies interested in testing opinions.
</P>
<P>
   But one employee said that political races are dominating
business now, particularly the South Carolina primary. Inside,
employees sit in front of computer screens, earning an hourly rate
to ask the same questions over and over again. One woman said the
average rate is $6 an hour. According to employees, every
conversation is monitored electronically to ensure that callers do
not stray from the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, according to one employee, supervisors warned the
staff against speaking to reporters. One woman said that McCain is
not the only object of polling. She said she had spent time asking
questions of voters around the nation about Vice President Al Gore.
One of the questions, she said, was about opinions on Gore's now
retracted claim that he invented the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The woman laughed and described the process as ``mudslinging.''

   Following are some of the questions that Voter/Consumer
Research, a company hired by the Bush campaign, is posing to voters
in South Carolina. The information was provided by the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Here are three points people have made about John McCain's
position on taxes. Please tell me for each of these whether you
strongly approve, somewhat approve, somewhat disapprove or strongly
disapprove.
</P>
<P>
   a) John McCain's plan does not cut tax rates for 71 percent of
all taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   b) John McCain's plan will increase taxes on charitable
contributions to churches, colleges and charities by $20 billion.
</P>
<P>
   c) John McCain says he never voted for a tax increase, but he
wrote legislation that proposed the largest tax increase in United
States history.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Here are some points regarding John McCain's record on
campaign finance reform. Again please tell me whether you strongly
approve, somewhat approve, somewhat disapprove or strongly
disapprove.
</P>
<P>
   a) He has written legislation that would use taxpayer dollars to
pay for political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   b) He was reprimanded by the Senate Ethics Committee for
intervening with the federal regulators who were investigating
Charles Keating, one of his campaign contributors who went to jail
for bank fraud in the Savings and Loan scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Q: John McCain calls the campaign finance system corrupt, but as
chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, he raises money and
travels on the private jets of corporations with legislative
proposals before his committee. In view of this are you much more
likely to vote for him, somewhat more likely to vote for him,
somewhat more likely to vote against him or much more likely to
vote against him?
</P>
<P>
   Q: John McCain's campaign finance proposals would give labor
unions and the media a bigger influence on the outcome of
elections. Again, in view of this are you much more likely to vote
for him, somewhat more likely to vote for him, somewhat more likely
to vote against him or much more likely to vote against him?

GORE TRIES TO SOOTHE CONCERNS OF SHARPTON
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE and JONATHAN P. HICKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Seeking to solidify his support among black New
Yorkers, Vice President Al Gore met Sunday for the first time with
the Rev. Al Sharpton and received the endorsement of the Rev. Floyd
Flake, a former congressman and now the pastor of a prominent black
church in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   The two sessions began a week-long drive by the vice president
to highlight his support among blacks, which is derived in large
part from his association with President Clinton. And they are
signs of an accelerated strategy from a campaign increasingly
confident that the Democratic presidential nomination is within
Gore's grasp.
</P>
<P>
   But the two sessions differed markedly in style, reflecting
caution on Gore's part after his buzz-saw encounter with New York's
ethnic politics in his failed 1988 presidential bid. He was open
and voluble with Flake, but met with Sharpton in private.
</P>
<P>
   A buoyant Gore, with microphone in hand and a choir behind him,
addressed hundreds of congregants at Flake's church, the Allen AME
church. He referred to the Scripture and raced up and down the
aisles asking congregants how many years they had been married and
how many grandchildren they had.
</P>
<P>
   Then he heard these surprising words from the pastor himself:
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't do endorsements from across the pulpit because I never
know who's out there watching the types of laws that govern
separation of church and state,'' Flake said, draped in a flowing,
gold-embroidered white robe and standing next to the blue-suited
Gore. ``But I will say to you this morning, and you read it well:
This should be the next president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Just a week before, Flake had been host to Gore's sole rival,
former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, and given him a warm
welcome but no endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   Flake's embrace of Gore was significant because of the influence
of Flake and his church within the black middle class. Flake joins
many of New York's other black leaders, including Rep. Charles
Rangel, D-N.Y., and state comptroller Carl McCall, in backing Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But not on that list of endorsees, at least so far, is Sharpton.
Some of Gore's top staff were not even aware of the meeting, while
others, including Donna Brazile, Gore's campaign manager, were
arranging it and then attended the session, which lasted about an
hour and took place at the East Side apartment of Karenna Gore
Schiff, Gore's oldest daughter.
</P>
<P>
   The press corps that normally follows Gore were told by aides
that the meeting with Sharpton was not happening and that his visit
to his daughter's apartment was strictly personal.
</P>
<P>
   While Sharpton said in an interview afterward that he had not
yet decided whom he might endorse, he said the discussion with the
vice president had been ``extremely positive'' and that the meeting
``included a frank and honest discussion of the concerns of the
people in the areas that we come from.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Although we don't agree on everything, he showed a willingness
to talk and a willingness to listen,'' Sharpton said. ``I was
impressed with a lot of what he had to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton has been urged by supporters of both candidates to make
an endorsement. He initially considered supporting Bradley, but
came under pressure from political leaders like the Rev. Jesse
Jackson, who urged him to endorse the vice president (although
Jackson has yet to make an endorsement).
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's meeting followed some tension between Sharpton and the
Gore campaign. A week ago, Sharpton complained that he had
perceived indifference from the vice president's campaign on racial
issues. And he said Gore needed to make amends with blacks in New
York over his 1988 presidential campaign. That year, Gore was
competing against Jackson, among others, and during the New York
primary Gore's ally, Mayor Ed Koch, was engaged in an ugly public
feud with Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Gore advisers said that the campaign wanted to acknowledge
Sharpton's influence as a political leader but hesitated to fully
legitimize him. Gore fears getting entangled in New York's local
political cross-currents, and did not ask Sharpton for his
endorsement. Nor did Sharpton offer it.
</P>
<P>
   But the two discussed several matters concerning economic
development in heavily black areas, including access to media
ownership, according to Gore aides.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton did ask Gore to hold a debate with Bradley on minority
issues, Sharpton and Gore aides said. A week earlier, Sharpton had
hinted that he would encourage black voters to support Bradley
unless such a debate took place. Gore noted that the campaigns had
already agreed to a debate at the Apollo Theater in Harlem on Feb.
21.

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Gore's events in New York on Sunday marked the beginning of a
week aimed squarely at black voters, who make up one of the party's
most reliable core constituencies. Gore's campaign has always
perceived the black vote as its insurance policy or ``fire wall''
if Gore stumbled in the early primaries.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the Gore campaign is making a major pitch to black
voters now, before the collection of primaries on March 7, is a
clear sign of the Gore camp's growing confidence.
</P>
<P>
   The schedule tells much of the story. The vice president is
planning a string of events in heavily black areas of the country.
</P>
<P>
   He is to speak about education at Medgar Evars College in
Brooklyn on Monday. On Tuesday in Baltimore, he plans to address
the economic plight of blacks in the information age. That night he
begins a southern swing through North Carolina, Macon, Ga., New
Orleans, Jackson, Miss., St. Louis, Cleveland and Springfield,
Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., is to travel with Gore in the
state on Monday and endorse him.

   LATHAM, N.Y. _ The unmarked convoy arrived in the gray-blue
light of dusk, seven dark trucks winding through Albany's suburbs
and stopping upwind of a gymnasium here. Soon groups of soldiers in
gas masks and chemical-protection suits began trudging through the
snow. They were in for a long night.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers were part of a simulated gas attack on an upstate
arena, and had been told only that a small bomb had been detonated
at a basketball game, spreading vapors that sickened a dozen
spectators. As local firefighters kept their distance, the soldiers
were assigned to enter the contaminated area to find out what
happened. Was it anthrax? A blister agent? Nerve gas? A noxious
prank?
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's go,'' said the team's commander, Lt. Col. Robert L.
Domenici, as his soldiers tugged their equipment from the trucks.
</P>
<P>
   The 22-member team is part of a newly formed cadre of full-time
specialists created to help local police departments and
firefighters after a chemical, biological or radioactive attack.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon is forming 27 of these groups, called Weapons of
Mass Destruction Civilian Support Teams, which fall under the
command of the state National Guards and are assigned to zones
established by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Their
missions are to assess the scope and severity of a terrorist attack
by sampling suspected germs, chemicals or radioactive material, and
then to advise civilian agencies on how to deal with it.
</P>
<P>
   The team training in Latham, stationed at Stratton Air National
Guard Base in Scotia, N.Y., and assigned to cover New York, New
Jersey, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, begins its final
Department of Defense evaluation exercises Tuesday at Fort Drum. It
is expected to be on call by April, along with nine of the other
teams around the nation. The remaining teams are scheduled to be on
duty by spring of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The team includes former Marines, Army rangers, a Green Beret
and an airman once assigned to a Titan 2 nuclear missile silo in
Arkansas. Once these service members were trained to kill, whether
by bayonet, smart bomb or nuclear strike. Now they form a
protection team, more likely to be deployed in Buffalo than Beirut.
Their only weapons are pistols.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've thought about it a lot, about how I went from being a
killer to turning around and being a defender,'' said Tech. Sgt.
Robert J. Fruggiero, 36, of Saratoga, N.Y., who spent much of the
1980s maintaining a nuclear weapon he described as ``basically
designed to blow a hole in the ground, a half a mile in diameter,
800 feet deep.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big shift,'' he said. ``And I tell you, I feel a lot
better about this, compared to what I used to be doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Another team member, Spc. Brian A. Gordon, 24, of Coxsackie,
N.Y., and a former marine infantryman, said in characteristic
Marine Corps fashion that the change in his work was
``mind-boggling, sir.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that I knew that I was going to go in and kill
somebody with a weapon,'' he said. ``Now it's, `Here's your gas
mask, let's go in there, get the victims out and figure out what
happened.'''
</P>
<P>
   The roots of the civilian support teams reach to events of the
mid-1990s. In a 27-month period from 1993 to 1995, the World Trade
Center was bombed, killing six and injuring more than 1,000; a
religious sect released sarin nerve gas in the Tokyo subway system,
killing 12 and injuring 5,500; and Timothy McVeigh leveled the
federal building in Oklahoma City with a truck bomb, killing 168
and injuring hundreds more.
</P>
<P>
   ``These events changed the psyche of how we are going to defend
the United States,'' Domenici said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Congress passed the Defense Against Weapons of Mass
Destruction Act, which mandated increased domestic preparedness
against terrorist attacks, especially those involving chemical,
biological or nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, the Pentagon decided to integrate the National
Guard into the effort, knowing that Guard units were already placed
in the most vulnerable areas, and that giving state control to the
teams would offset some concerns about the military performing
police duties, which would violate federal law.
</P>
<P>
   The result was the creation of the Civilian Support Teams, which
in 1998 began an 18-month training period to prepare for this new
mission.
</P>
<P>
   Jerome M. Hauer, who recently left his job as director New York
City's Office of Emergency Management, where he supervised the
city's anti-terrorism efforts, said the National Guard teams would
provide an invaluable capability to cities too small to support
specialists of their own. For example, he noted that the teams
would be staged with gear loaded onto trucks, near aircraft, ready
to drive or fly to places throughout their coverage area within
four hours.
</P>
<P>
   Hauer also said he expected the teams to see action. ``It is my
belief that, at least in the near term, the biggest terrorist
threat is from guns and conventional bombs,'' he said. ``But the
dynamic is changing, and I think that over the next 10 years a
chemical or biological weapon will be used in the United States.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Brig. Gen. William C. Martin, deputy commander of New York's
National Guard, watched the group's final exercise in Latham. He
said the team, with its full-time soldiers and $7.8 million in
equipment and recent training, is a departure from the recent past,
when the Guard trained mainly to reinforce active-duty forces in
missions overseas, and almost all its soldiers worked part-time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were so focused on a Cold War mentality that we weren't
relevant anymore'' to national defense, he said. ``Once we had the
luxury of fighting our nation's wars on someone else's soil. That
doesn't exist the same way today.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside, between snow banks, Tech. Sgt. Jeffrey Quinn, 37, a
former Green Beret medic, watched over Sgt. Peter C. Nestor and
Gordon as they prepared their gear for a survey of the contaminated
area. Quinn said he had a personal motivation behind his new work.
His aunt, uncle and two cousins were badly injured in the bombing
of a hotel in Kenya on New Year's Eve, 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been touched by terrorism,'' he said. ``And when I heard
they were putting together something like this, to help with
civilian casualties, and to safeguard home soil, I saw the ability
to bring some peace of mind to people. So here I am.''
</P>
<P>
   The two soldiers donned their blue suits, gloves, boots, heavy
air packs and masks. They left Quinn behind and walked slowly
toward the gymnasium, dragging a cart full of detection equipment.
In this exercise, civilian casualties had been evacuated before the
team arrived, and local hospitals needed to know what chemicals had
been dispersed that made them sick.
</P>
<P>
   Inside a small exercise room, the soldiers found the simulated
remains of a bomb, and began testing the residue. Their work was a
mix of brute strength and finesse, alternately requiring moving
debris and manipulating small detection kits, which involved
breaking open jelly-bean-sized ampuls or mixing fluids and
collecting residue with cotton swabs.
</P>
<P>
   For men wearing four pairs of gloves, weighted by equipment, and
peering through face masks and plastic hoods, the work was tedious.
Their masks steamed up in minutes.
</P>
<P>
   While waiting for the results of the nerve gas detection kit,
the pair slowly searched the rest of the gymnasium for other
threats. They found grainy powder on the floor, and suspected a
biological agent. Minutes later, after testing the powder, they got
a simulated reading. ``Positive hit, anthrax,'' Gordon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Positive hit on anthrax,'' Nestor said by radio to the
commanders outside.
</P>
<P>
   Then the operation shifted. Bernard Kirk, an evaluator from the
New York's Department of State, decided to apply stress. He
designated Gordon a casualty, and ordered him to slump over,
paralyzed as if the nerve gas in the other room had penetrated his
protective suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brian, talk to me, talk to me,'' Nestor said, pressing his
mask close to Gordon's face. A muffled voice replied, ``I can't
walk.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to drag you out of here,'' Nestor said, and lugged
him toward the door. The specialist's suit hissed as his limp body
slid along the waxed floor.
</P>
<P>
   Back outside, Quinn and his medics and decontamination crews
were scrambling. A group of soldiers ran to the door and loaded
Gordon onto a stretcher. They began washing him at a mobile
decontamination site they had built, and soon were pulling him out
of his protective suit.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Paul A. Fanning, a National Guard member who wandered
through the exercise taking pictures, watched as the specialist
emerged from the suit, steam rising from his tattooed arms. His
peers rushed him into the medical tent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope we never have to do this for real,'' the colonel said.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the unit, thoughts ran a wide range. Domenici, the
commander, said he was not satisfied. It was nearing midnight. The
evaluation exercise was only days away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll eat dinner,'' he said. ``And then let's do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   The exercise ended at 7 a.m.

<P>
   VIENNA, Austria _ As a political entity turned pack of would-be
toughs, Europe is proving unimpressive; it is slapping Austria
around a bit, but is unable to bring it to its diplomatic knees.
</P>
<P>
   France, Belgium and tiny Andorra boycotted a speech here last
Thursday by the new Austrian foreign minister. But they stayed to
take part in the meeting of the Organization for Cooperation and
Security in Europe that she was presiding over.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Austria's new social affairs minister was allowed
to attend a meeting in Lisbon on unemployment. But only the host
would shake her hand, and the others refused to pose for the usual
ministerial family photo.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the German minister seemed to regret his rudeness; the
Belgian and French ministers, who also walked out during her
speech, reveled in theirs.
</P>
<P>
   The conservative caucus in the European Parliament heard a
motion to kick out Austria's People's Party for inviting Joerg
Haider's Freedom Party into government with it. But members said
the motion would not be voted on until April and had no chance of
passing anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Charles postponed a planned summer visit, and the actress
Claudia Cardinale said she would not attend the Opera Ball, the
height of the Vienna social season. But Queen Beatrix of the
Netherlands took her annual Austrian skiing vacation as she has for
the last 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Belgium theatrically canceled an order for seven Austrian
armored cars. But Sweden said it still hoped to sell Austria a
squadron of fighter-bombers.
</P>
<P>
   And the French finance minister, a socialist, may have split the
diplomatic hair of the week when he discovered that his Austrian
counterpart is from Haider's party. ``I'm not sure I'll be talking
much with him,'' the minister told journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Europe is in a quandary. Fourteen of the Continent's foreign
ministers threatened to isolate Austria if it let Haider's
xenophobic party into government. Austria promptly called its
bluff. Now Europe is divided and confused and falling back largely
on bad manners.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an unprecedented situation, and there is no uniform
front,'' said Hans Rauscher, a columnist for Der Standard here.
``It's not a massive, concerted action, but it's pretty strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Europe is not alone in having divided reactions. Israel's
ambassador, the first to leave, is still gone. The U.S. ambassador
returned this past weekend after the State Department tentatively
accepted assurances that Austria would hew to the democratic path.
</P>
<P>
   But the Argentine ambassador was just recalled to Buenos Aires
for consultations after a letter he wrote last October describing
Haider as neither ``an extremist nor a neo-Nazi'' but rather ``a
democrat'' was leaked to an Argentine paper.
</P>
<P>
   Haider has predicted that any censure effort would quickly
crumble. He may be proved right. It isn't just smaller European
countries like Greece and Denmark that are already skeptical. Even
the big powers are subdividing: in Germany, Bavaria broke with
Berlin over isolating its Alpine neighbor, and Italy's provinces
around Trieste, abutting Austria, criticized Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the union has discovered that it needs stability more than
it needs to punish. After the euro slipped last week on rumors that
Austria might be forced out of the monetary union, the European
Union issued a hasty denial that it would impose such a harsh
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   And the fight has strengthened anti-Europe forces. Isolationist
groups in Switzerland and Denmark have gained ground in opinion
polls, citing anger at the drubbing of Austria. Britain's anti-euro
conservatives are crowing their we-told-you-sos.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard to see how the EU can now get out of the hole that
its leaders have dug,'' Peter Ludlow, the director of the Center
for European Policy Studies in Brussels, Belgium, wrote in a
scathing essay in Britain's Financial Times last week.
</P>
<P>
   By aggressive posturing, the other European countries ``exposed
themselves to the risk of a series of humiliating and very public
compromises.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the predicament is systemic: The union is bound by
treaties, not a constitution, and its important decisions, like
those on a common currency or admitting new members, are made by
consensus. It is not a congress, and cannot freeze out or vote down
members. Ministers meet in order to talk.
</P>
<P>
   The other problem is haste. Austria called Europe's bluff so
fast that there was no time to plan a response. With careful
timing, European ministers might have embarrassed Haider over
weaknesses newly revealed: One of his new Cabinet ministers is
accused of bankrolling a right-wing paper that denied the
Holocaust; another once supposedly said that any businesses that
hire more than 10 percent foreigners should not get government
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Europeans ended up snubbing Elisabeth Sickl, the
new social affairs minister, a friendly middle-aged former school
principal who says her values are ``humanist.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the foreign media, which for weeks whipped up images
of Nazism in Austria, are beginning to turn around and suggest that
someone was indulging in hyperbole. For example, the same BBC radio
anchorman who on Feb. 1 asked an Austrian theater director if he
planned to flee the country (the answer was a puzzled ``no'') by
Feb. 10 was asking a European Union spokesman if his organization
had been in the grip of anti-Nazi hysteria (the answer was a
defensive ``no'').
</P>
<P>
   Within Austria itself, protests against the new government,
which were buoyed by the European Union response, continue,
although with less vigor than in the first days. About 15,000
demonstrators shouting ``Resist racism and fascism!'' marched in
Vienna on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller demonstrations were held in cities throughout the
country. On Sunday a discussion at Vienna's main theater about
artistic freedom under the new government was packed an hour before
it even started.
</P>
<P>
   A march that may be swelled by the trade union allies of the
Social Democratic Party, which was forced into opposition by the
new ruling coalition, is planned for Feb. 18.
</P>
<P>
   It will be interesting to see what happens when Haider defies
the advice of his party and goes to Brussels on Feb. 17. As
governor of Carinthia province, he is on the European Union
committee on regional government.
</P>
<P>
   His advisers urged him to miss the meeting. But Haider answered
them last week with his characteristic mix of cheek and love of the
limelight: ``I'm not going to cancel my trip just because someone
wants to hit me with a tomato.''

TERM LIMITS DISRUPT POLITICAL LIFE IN STATE LEGISLATURES

<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ As term limits gradually take effect in 18
state legislatures across the country, the time strictures so
popular with voters are turning seasoned leaders from office,
nipping political careers and prompting unusual party maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
   A new sort of fast-forward politicking spawned by term limits is
exemplified here in Ohio, where the majority Republican leadership
is trying to name three different Statehouse speakers over the next
three years in advance of term limits that start with this
November's elections.
</P>
<P>
   Such fleeting leadership is a far cry from fabled legislative
bosses like the late Speaker Vern Riffe, who fiercely wielded the
Ohio gavel for two decades. But it is one of the new laws of
compressed politicking being forged under term limits, in which
affected states initially see a third or more of all incumbents
forced to depart.
</P>
<P>
   Similar wholesale disruptions of political life, with local and
county politicians moving more quickly into the statehouse, have
been taking place in the six states that have instituted term
limits since 1996. Five more, led by Ohio and Florida, are about to
introduce limits, while another seven are to have them in effect by
2007.
</P>
<P>
   California, a pioneer in term limits, saw its Statehouse
leadership initially decimated. But proponents emphasize that a
younger and more diverse crop of lawmakers took office. One out of
four legislators in Sacramento is now a woman, up from 17 percent a
decade ago, and Latinos hold 19 percent of the seats, up from 6
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Comparable changes in representation are hoped for by proponents
of term limits here and in Florida, where substantial legislative
turnover is also approaching. The first year of term limits in
Florida will find 55 of the 120 members of the lower house and 11
of 40 state senators displaced in the November elections. ``It's
going to bring about better government,'' Gov. Jeb Bush predicts.
</P>
<P>
   The intricate musical-chair leadership deal being attempted in
Ohio is denounced as back-room desperation by the Democratic
minority. But it is defended by Republicans as the only recourse
for heading off a state of constant caucus infighting because of
the large-scale turnover dictated by the eight-year limit (four
two-year terms in the House, two four-year terms in the Senate)
that is about to begin. The Republicans are trying to project
future speakers even though they cannot now be sure future voters
will retain the Republican majority needed to guarantee the tricky
deal.
</P>
<P>
   In the first year, the new limits mean that 43 members of the
99-member Ohio House elected in 1998, plus six of the 33 sitting
senators, cannot run again. The wrenching effect, similar to that
experienced in other statehouses with term limits, begins with the
traditional leadership posts where seniority has long been a
dominant factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm onto my third finance committee chairman in the last
year,'' said Speaker Jo Ann Davidson, amazed at how fast this
traditionally powerful plum of a job has been turning over as
qualified lawmakers, doomed for their long experience, resigned
early in the past year to find fresh career opportunities. As a
practical matter, the eight-year maximum is already amounting to
something less than seven years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not good. This is not continuity,'' said Davidson, who
helped to build the three-speaker deal as a transition while she is
forced out under term limits after 20 years of service. ``I
calculate that term limits is costing the Legislature 694 years of
collective experience,'' she ruefully added. ``Now the
institutional memory will be in the hands of the lobbyists and the
legislative staff, when it should rest with the elected
policy-makers.''
</P>
<P>
   Just a few years ago, term limits proved popular with the
public, getting better than 70 percent approval in some states
where they were enacted through referendums. But now, with the
public push for limits appearing to wane, there is evidence that
threatened legislators are having second thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   Bills to repeal or liberalize term limits were submitted last
year in seven of the 18 states that have adopted them, according to
Jennie Drage of the National Conference of State Legislatures. None
has thus far passed, and statehouse leaders are trying to adapt to
the new climate by assigning newcomers to intensive training in
mock debates and committee apprenticeships.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of the rapidly altered politics of term limits abounds,
whatever the ultimate judgment proves to be about the quality of
lawmaking in the term-limited states.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, four members of the Jacksonville City Council
quickly announced for open Statehouse seats, exemplifying the
greatly accelerated career paths of politics in states with term
limits. In Ohio's Hamilton County, four Statehouse seats rated
safely Republican instantly drew 50 candidates. The opportunity for
newcomers presented by term limits has made the primary slate here
next month the most crowded in 20 years, with 56 House and 16
Senate nominations still to be settled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something of a Big Bang,'' Richard Vedder, a political
analyst at Ohio University in Athens, said of the transition to
term limits. ``People have underestimated the political impact this
is going to have as newcomers try to move through uncharted
territory.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Visiting lawmakers from Michigan, where term limits went into
effect last year, cautioned Ohio colleagues that the altered
politics feature such phenomena as a much more highly compressed
style of ambition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freshmen must literally make their move for the speakership by
the end of their first term,'' said the Ohio House minority leader,
Jack Ford, a Democrat. Ford warned that well-heeled lobbyists
sensing the accelerated pace were already more involved in the
grass-roots nominating process, hoping to build relationships
sooner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decry the speakers deal,'' Ford said, contending that
lobbyists played a hand in concocting it. ``It goes against
representative democracy as the epitome of back-room arrogance.
Imagine trying to decide the leadership before the lawmakers who
have that responsibility have even been elected by the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford is seconded by the Republican dean of the Legislature, Rep.
Robert E. Netzley, who says he has never seen such a ``ridiculous''
deal in his 40 years as a legislator. ``It's just plain stupid to
try and determine leaders that far down the line,'' he added, half
hoping the incoming crop will include enough rebels to topple the
arrangement. But Speaker Davidson said the deal, uncertain as it
may be, is the best way to salvage some needed continuity and avoid
perennial caucus battles. Her designated successors agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Term limits presented Ohio with a struggle between the past
and the fast-approaching future,'' said Rep. Larry Householder, the
assistant majority leader who is slated to be the big winner in the
announced tandem speakership. A freshman lawmaker only two years
ago, Householder began an early and energetic campaign for the
leadership. He sensed the term-limit train coming down the line and
traveled the state with campaign signs as he went door to door to
enlist statehouse Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I campaigned for it,'' said Householder, a 40-year-old
insurance dealer who is supposed to share the gavel next year and
hold it outright thereafter for the final three years of his
legislative career, assuming he is re-elected across that time. His
partner in the unusual arrangement will be Rep. Bill Harris, a
65-year-old automobile dealer who is term-limited in 2002 and so,
in the new ways of fast-forward politics, wants to resign a year
early to try for the state Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see the turmoil,'' said Harris, who favored term
limits as a private citizen in 1992, when voters approved the idea
and the focus was on limiting the terms of members of Congress.
Since then, the U.S.Supreme Court has struck down limits in
Congress but not in statehouses.
</P>
<P>
   As a legislator, Harris has come to oppose limits as the need
for critical experience in the Legislature became clearer to him.
</P>
<P>
   His designated successor, Householder, is more optimistic that,
for all the speed, term limits can be made to work. ``I'm all for
it right now,'' he says. ``But I think in '04 when I'm term-limited
I'll probably be scraping my nails across the desk as they drag me
out.''

SPORTS COLUMN: AN NBA ROOKIE TRIES TO REMAKE HIS IMAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Steve Francis stood in one of the busiest
corridors of the All-Star Game weekend on Saturday afternoon. This
was the lobby of The Arena in Oakland, a control center where all
the stars and entourages entered.
</P>
<P>
   Francis' day had begun at 6 a.m., when he left his hotel to
attend an event for the NBA's Team-Up, a community involvement
program. Francis, the Houston Rockets point guard who was not even
on an All-Star team, taped a cable-television program and talked to
children. Afterward he signed autographs and spoke with members of
the audience. Then he went over to the arena to get ready for
Saturday afternoon's rookie challenge featuring the top NBA rookies
against the best second-year players.
</P>
<P>
   Francis was exhausted by halftime of that game. He wound up
playing 28 minutes, scoring 13 points and handing out 11 assists in
a 92-83 overtime victory for the 2000 rookies.
</P>
<P>
   There was more. After a national-television interview, Francis
participated in the 2Ball competition, in which he and Cynthia
Cooper of the WNBA's Houston Comets lost in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Why is he doing this? Marketing. ``I just want to set my own
type of trend,'' Francis said. ``I want to take the game and also
marketing to another level. That's my goal. That's one of my
goals.''
</P>
<P>
   What's the plan? ``It's baby steps first,'' he said. ``You got
to crawl before you walk, so I'm doing all the rookie stuff I
possibly can do so next year I can get more consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a touch of atonement in Francis' method.
</P>
<P>
   Francis committed his first turnover before he played an NBA
game. On draft day last June, while everyone else was celebrating
the dream of the draft, Francis was visibly disappointed over being
selected by Vancouver with the No. 2 pick after his junior season
at Maryland. The Grizzlies had drafted Mike Bibby, another point
guard, a year earlier. Francis forced a trade to Houston and
quickly became cast as part of the spoiled player syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a clear explanation,'' Francis said. ``I had no way to
excel at point guard at Vancouver with Mike Bibby there. There's no
way. He's the same age as me; he's talented, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Fast-forward to Saturday night and the slam-dunk contest.
Francis flung off the fatigue. Like an exhausted fighter still
confident he could end the fight with one punch, the 6-foot-3-inch
Francis issued a promise. ``I'm going to win that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not this night. Vince Carter, last year's rookie phenomenon, won
the contest with a pair of riveting dunks that brought down the
house. Francis said that he thought he had won _ he finished second
_ but that the contest didn't tarnish his season.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning of the year nobody would have ever thought
that I would average as many points and assists as I do,'' said
Francis, who is averaging 17.8 points and 7.0 assists. ``They
thought that I'd be a crybaby because of the Vancouver thing. But I
think I've done a great job of overcoming that and striving forward
and trying to be an All-Star next year.''
</P>
<P>
   This was billed as the first All-Star Game of the millennium,
and the theme has been the new replacing the old. But Nate
Thurmond, the former Warriors center and an assistant coach for
Francis' winning rookie team on Saturday, said the young players
were being misread and miscast. ``This new group is beautiful,'' he
said. ``You hear so much about, `This guy doesn't want to do that,
this guy does want to do that.' I didn't see that, I saw guys who
came in and wanted to have fun,'' and did what the coaches asked
and won.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were very nice at practice, very grounded,'' Thurmond
said. ``All the media attention, all of the people trying to get to
them, you can understand that it's a big world for them.
</P>
<P>
   I wondered what pressure Thurmond faced when he was drafted in
1963. ``There was no pressure,'' he said. ``I was making $16,000;
my brother was a schoolteacher. He was making $8,000. I called him
up and I said, `Brother, I make twice as much as you.' So what? My
brother retired at $65,000 _ do you think I was making $130,000 a
year when I retired? I was making twice as much as a schoolteacher,
and I was the third guy drafted in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were not making money. They're making money now. Today, my
brother would be making $65,000 and I'd be making $10 million. Has
it changed, or has it changed?''
</P>
<P>
   Francis said yes and no. For all the talk about technology this
All-Star Game weekend, all the talk about the race to become the
face of the NBA, Francis said the building blocks for success were
timeless.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to perform; everything starts on the court,'' he
said. ``The marketing will come from that. Maybe it'll come, maybe
it won't, but I have to perform.''
</P>
<P>
   Francis will turn 23 next week. He has his career in front of
him. For now, he said all he wanted to do was get back home. And
rest.

SAFETY BOARD SAYS ALASKA AIR PUT OFF FIXING WORN PART 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The National Transportation Safety Board said
Sunday night that a part of the tail assembly on the Alaska
Airlines jet that crashed last month had been found to be worn and
in need of replacement in September 1997, but that the airline
later decided it was good enough to keep in use.
</P>
<P>
   The assembly in question is a jack screw, a rotating screw that
looks like the ones used to move a garage door up and down, and a
nut that connects to the screw. When the screw turns, the nut rides
up and down, moving the horizontal stabilizer, which makes the nose
of the plane point up or down.
</P>
<P>
   Before the crash, which killed all 88 people aboard, the cockpit
crew radioed to mechanics on the ground that they were having
problems with the stabilizer. And when the Navy recovered the jack
screw and nut from the waters off Los Angeles, the screw was partly
stripped.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have not said whether they think this was a cause
or a result of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   During major maintenance checks, mechanics hold the nut still
and push the screw up and down to check for ``end play,'' a measure
of wear.
</P>
<P>
   The safety board chairman, James Hall, said in a statement
Sunday evening that when the plane had its last major maintenance
check, at a hangar in Oakland, Calif., mechanics initially noted
that the assembly had reached the allowable limit of its end play.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said, ``the initial planned action was to replace the nut''
during the inspection. But according to the maintenance records, he
said, the next day ``this initial planned action was re-evaluated
and the assembly was re-inspected.''
</P>
<P>
   The second inspection found that the part was within normal
tolerances, he said; according to the records the assembly ``was
re-checked five times with the same result.'' So the plane, an
MD-82, went back out with the same jack screw assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said the board would study the maintenance of the rest of
the plane as well as of the stabilizer system from the time the
plane was manufactured, in 1992, until the crash.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration, which last week ordered
emergency inspections of all MD-80's and similar airplanes, said
that 15 planes, including four at Alaska Airlines, may show signs
of problems. Of the others, four were at Delta, two at Airtran (the
airline formerly known as ValuJet), and one each at American,
Continental, TWA, Northwest and Hawaiian Air.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines have until midday Monday to finish inspections, and
until Wednesday to report, although many have already finished. The
FAA is also anticipating hearing later this week from foreign
airlines, which are not bound by its rules but will probably
perform the inspections.

UCLA BLOWS CHANCE FOR UPSET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. _ They came all this way to come so close. In the
end, that's what hurt the most.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it was fourth-ranked Syracuse. Yes, it was in the Carrier
Dome, in front of the largest on-campus crowd in the nation this
season.
</P>
<P>
   But make no mistake: Playing their fourth game in nine days, the
Orangemen were there for the peeling. This was a game the UCLA
Bruins could have won, and that would have made their cross-country
trek much more fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game was there for us to take and we didn't take it,''
Bruins guard Ryan Bailey said after a 71-67 loss Sunday afternoon
before a crowd of 29,731 in the Carrier Dome. ``That's the toughest
kind to deal with. Sometimes, you have an off night and you lose by
18. Those things happen. But the games you know you should win are
the toughest.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins played passive but effective defense. They were
organized on offense. Their shot selection was solid. They
outrebounded Syracuse 42-32. They moved the ball well (21 assists
on 28 baskets) and they quieted the massive crowd.
</P>
<P>
   For 35 minutes, in fact, the Bruins played one of their best
games of the season. The problem was the last five minutes, when
the Bruins wasted several chances to steal a victory that would
have done wonders for their NCAA Tournament chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurts so bad because they're the No. 4 team in the country
and we were better than them for 35 minutes,'' Bruins forward Rico
Hines said. ``They beat us in the last five minutes and we beat
ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Shown to 75 percent of the nation, the game was more audition
than competition for UCLA (13-9). No doubt, NCAA tournament
selection committee members were watching on couches from coast to
coast. A win might have helped the Bruins snatch an at-large bid if
they finish with 17 victories or a sub-.500 conference record.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they lost the game and they lost their slack. The
remaining task is simple but difficult: Win five of eight games to
finish 18-12 and they're in. Anything less and it's probably NIT
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we have to perform well in the conference to make a
statement to the (selection committee),'' said Bruins coach Steve
Lavin.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's locker room was quiet but not demoralized. The players
refused to claim a moral victory _ ``It's W's and L's and no
in-between,''guard Earl Watson said _ but they couldn't ignore
several important developments.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey's second consecutive start added rhythm and flow to the
offense. He finished with seven rebounds, seven assists and one
turnover. His precision passes against Syracuse's soft zone helped
the Bruins shoot 51.8 percent from the field.
</P>
<P>
   Hines and Ray Young combined to make 7 of 8 shots, score 14
points and give UCLA its best bench play of the month. Hines was
his usual savvy self. Young, slowing emerging after a four-game
skid, showed betterjudgment than he has in weeks.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, slumping center Dan Gadzuric played his most
effective game of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Gadzuric overcame tender thumbs and knees to score 18 points,
grab 12 rebounds, avoid foul trouble and outplay Syracuse's All-Big
East center, Etan Thomas (nine points and seven rebounds). If
Gadzuric repeats his performance Thursday at Arizona State, the
Bruins just might get the road victory they need to return to an
18-win pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm posting up harder and playing harder,'' Gadzuric said.
``Every day, I'm getting a little more confident, since I'm still
raw.''
</P>
<P>
   All the Bruins needed was an average game from forward Jerome
Moiso and they'd have departed with smiles, not snarls. But Moiso
played as poorly as Gadzuric played well. He committed four
turnovers, made 3 of 9 shots and failed to attack the basket. He
made bad passes, lost the ball in traffic and settled for fadeaways
when he should have powered for dunks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had some turnovers in the first half and I got down on
myself,'' Moiso said quietly in the far corner of the locker room.
``I felt like I was losing the ball every time I touched it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fault was not Moiso's alone. Far from it. The Bruins had two
chances to take the lead midway through the second half; each time,
reserve guard Billy Knight took (and missed) bad shots.
</P>
<P>
   And in the final 6:44 _ when the Bruins failed to score on seven
of 10 possessions _ there were breakdowns everywhere. Jason Kapono
missed a wild shot in the lane. Moiso committed a turnover.
Gadzuric missed two free throws. Yet Syracuse could not pull away.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins trailed 67-65 with two minutes left when Kapono
botched an alley-oop pass to Moiso. On UCLA's next possession,
Thomas blocked Moiso's weak jumper.
</P>
<P>
   More breakdowns followed. Syracuse led 70-67 with 9.7 seconds
left when Ryan Blackwell missed a free throw, but Thomas outhustled
Gadzuric and Young to the rebound. After another Syracuse free
throw, Watson lost the ball as he began a desperate dash downcourt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It came down to us not getting rebounds, or turning the ball
over or forcing shots,'' Watson said. ``We were patient until we
had a chance to break through, then we rushed things. We had our
chances. We didn't capitalize on them.''

alumni donations to the athletics department would help with many
of its budget problems.
</P>
<P>
   That includes the impending reduction in football scholarships
and a proposed on-campus football stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we fund 40 (scholarships) and if the remaining 15 or 20
come from private funding, from the point of view of a
student-athlete, it makes no difference,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   Football coach Jeff Kearin said Kennedy has stayed firm in her
commitment to fund-raising for football and Northridge's other
sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been given every indication we're going to be allowed
to somehow develop funds, through money games and through
fund-raising, to keep our scholarship level competitive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Athletic director Dick Dull is close to hiring a new development
and marketing coordinator. Kennedy said that person will work
directly with the central development office in the second phase of
the ``CSUN Rising'' project, which Kennedy said will be devoted to
a football stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The university recently received its largest donation
</P>
<P>
   $1.5 million from the Ridgestone Foundation that will fund the
construction of a center for aquatic therapy for the physically
disabled. Getting money for a $6-7 million football stadium doesn't
seem far-fetched, Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we've stabilized the athletics program, which we think
this move (to the Big West) has done,''' she said, ``I think we
will be able to raise the money with sufficient support.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Those other projects: The football stadium is a hypothetical.
A more immediate concern for the athletics department is upgrading
existing facilities, specifically the baseball and softball fields.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN hasn't raised the money to break ground on the new softball
stadium. The ``Field of Dreams'' project is being headed by
Matadors head coach Janet Sherman and Los Angeles mayoral candidate
Steven Soboroff.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy has gotten involved, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't talked to Steve Soboroff in a month,'' she said,
``(but) the last time I spoke with him, he was still working with
our architect people and trying to raise the money.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Future opponents: Dull said CSUN's jump to the Big West, and
into Division I-AA independent status in football, won't
significantly affect football scheduling.
</P>
<P>
   Northridge will try to continue playing Big Sky teams like
Sacramento State and Northern Arizona, which are the Matadors' best
conference draws.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's safe to assume we look forward to continue playing Sac
State,'' Dull said. ``(Cal Poly) San Luis Obispo is somebody we
would hope to have on our schedule on a yearly basis.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Nuts and bolts: Two Big West-related items that came out of
last week's press conference:
</P>
<P>
   __ The conference is dropping its Eastern-Western divisional
format when CSUN and UC Riverside start competition in the fall of
2001. Of the 10 competing schools, only Utah State and Boise State
are out of state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We eliminate the divisional concept,'' Big West Commissioner
Dennis Farrell said, ``(but) we're going to be examining whether we
want to bring back some of the championship (tournaments) we've had
in the past, such as baseball, volleyball and softball.''
</P>
<P>
   __ CSUN will be eligible to compete in the men's and women's
basketball tournaments in its first year of play. The tournaments
will be held at the same venue the Anaheim Convention Center for
three years, starting in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   __ Nice compliment: Long Beach State President Robert Maxson
gushed when he visited Northridge to invite Northridge into the Big
West last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like this university,'' Maxson said. ``I admire the strong
sports program on this campus. If people don't realize how good the
sports programs (are) here, they ought to play the teams.''

ESPYS IN VEGAS _ PERFECT FIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ The videoscreens outside the MGM Grand are selling
tonight's ESPY Awards as ``the greatest night in sports.'' For
sure, it's an event that attracts the greatest gathering of
superstar athletes in one place.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   Mike Piazza, in town anyway to show off in a home-run-hitting
contest with McGwire, Canseco, Palmiero, ARod and Dodgers newcomer
Shawn Green, didn't need any coaxing to stay an extra night to
attend the ESPYs, where he'll be hanging out with new Mets teammate
Todd Zeile.
</P>
<P>
   ``All they had to tell me was be in Vegas,'' said Piazza. ``I
said I'd do it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not for the ``boy-lesque'' shows.
</P>
<P>
   At least Piazza says what the others probably don't want to _
that the city is the real star attraction. And when you've got
Monopoly money coming out of your billfold, any excuse to come to
the Nevada desert is valid.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why the MLBPA, not Major League Baseball, sponsored the
home run event (to be aired next month on ESPN2). MLB can't gamble
on its reputation.
</P>
<P>
   And it's why ESPN, which held the first seven of these behind
the barbed wire of New York, has moved it right across the street
from the New York, New York Hotel &AMP; Casino on da Strip. . . .
</P>
<P>
   __ For those who can't stomach another ego-gratifyin',
tux-rentin' statue-cradlin' awards presentation, you'll miss such
cut-up skits as Dickie V opening the show as an Elvis impersonator
and Kurt Bevacqua being honored by Dan Patrick as the century's
29,104th-greatest athlete, with testimonials from George Will, Bob
Costas and Joe Garagiola. . . .
</P>
<P>
   __ ESPY celeb host Jimmy Smits won't be killed off, a la Bobby
Simone, during the course of the telecast. He may only wish. . . .
</P>
<P>
   __ Smits plays the role of a trainer in ``Price of Glory,'' the
next boxing movie to elbow for attention this spring. Carlos
Palomino is the flick's technical advisor and Smits did research on
his character by attending Silver Gloves bouts around L.A. . . .
</P>
<P>
   __ Smits says he recently received his Lakers season tickets,
which will ``finally legitimize me as a Los Angeles resident.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't go celeb scoping for him in Nicholson's neighborhood. ``My
seats are in the citizens' section,'' he said. . . .
</P>
<P>
   __ Couldn't help but notice under those blazin' Staple Center
heat lamps that Coo-coo Jack was back to being slurped like a
courtside snowcone by Lara F. Boyle during the two Lakers games
last week. The tabs had reported a recent messy breakup _ Nicholson
supposedly went gonzo upon finding out the fledgling actress
returned all his Christmas gifts for cash. . . .
</P>
<P>
   __ Billy Crystal wants to direct a movie called ``Home Run Race
'61,'' an HBO project about the friendship between Roger Maris and
Mickey Mantle during the 1961 season, reports Daily Variety. . . .
</P>
<P>
   __ Pretend pro beach volleyball star Gabby Reece has committed
to remodeling _ she will train for a year to see if she can become
a pro golfer. . . .
</P>
<P>
   __ Latest MGM odds on the Cincinnati Reds winning the 2000 World
Series just dropped from 20 to 1 to a Griffey-inspired 12 to 1. The
Dodgers, who opened at 30 to 1 in October, are now 18 to 1. . . .
</P>
<P>
   __ And happy V-Day bliss to Frank and Kathie Lee, on whose
marriage the National Enquirer proclaims, ``It's Over!,'' in the
latest edition. Seems three years after the fact, she won't let up
on the tarnished Trojan's illegal forward pass to the former flight
attentant.

<P>
   MALIBU, Calif. _ The Missouri baseball team was in the outfield
warming up minutes before the scheduled noon start of Sunday's game
at Pepperdine.
</P>
<P>
   Practice is all the Tigers got to do, though. The game was
cancelled because of rain.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the tarp was never removed from the infield, and one
of the Missouri coaches said he wasn't sure where Pepperdine's team
was, the Tigers wanted to get in a workout before they left.
</P>
<P>
   The players began to pack their bags as the rain intensified an
hour later. Even if the rain let up, the Tigers said there would
not be enough time to get in a game before their scheduled flight
home.
</P>
<P>
   If or when the game will be made up was not certain since
Pepperdine and Missouri are not scheduled to meet again this
season.
</P>
<P>
   The Waves (3-5) beat Missouri (0-2) in the first two games of
the series.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine's next game is Tuesday at Cal Poly. The Waves return
home for a three-game series against California starting Friday.

COMMENTARY: NEW `VAST CONSPIRACY' 
</HEADLINE>
   (CLARIFIES lede) 
 (lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service     
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The religio-politician Pat Robertson, host of TV's
Hour of Smarm, took to the airwaves Sunday to peddle the Bush
campaign's vast-conspiracy theory.
</P>
<P>
   As he explained it on ``Face the Nation,'' ``people allied with
Gore'' were encouraging Democrats and independents to vote for John
McCain in the South Carolina primary next week. Why? Because ``they
consider him a weaker candidate than Governor Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Never mind polls showing that Vice President Al Gore now defeats
George W. Bush. Never mind how John McCain now trounces Democrat
Gore in the same polls. Just as candidate Hillary (Fry the
killers!) No-Last-Name demonstrates, vast-conspiracy theorists need
not be encumbered by facts.
</P>
<P>
   But the Lord works in mysterious ways. In cooking up its
cockamamie explanation for McCain's attractiveness to voters across
the political spectrum, religio-pols expose the fear of Republican
elders: that the dread ``they'' _ all those starry-eyed amateurs
and reformist outsiders _ may take over ``our thing.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, conservatives have to confront the group with the
old ``GOP Death Wish.'' That clubby set of single-issue power
brokers prefers to float out to sea in a Viking's funeral than to
present a candidate who can appeal across party lines and energize
swing voters.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike these old-line pressure groupies to whom campaign finance
reform is anathema, the Republican rank and file _ not to mention
GOP House members _ seeks a likely winner to bear the party
standard.
</P>
<P>
   That seeming electability is what made Bush so attractive at
first. But without that assurance of victory, his supporters are
defecting. They are not afflicted with the GOP death wish that
would make them masters of a wasteland. These Republicans are not
satisfied with a winner in July's convention; they want a winner in
November's election.
</P>
<P>
   To them, McCain now holds out the exciting prospect that Bush
once offered. That's why so much frantic bet-hedging is going on
behind the scenes. And that's why the panicked power brokers of
yesteryear are preparing this vast-conspiracy excuse for strong
showings by McCain in South Carolina and Michigan: It's the devil
(in the form of those tricky Democrats and independents) who's
doing it.
</P>
<P>
   In his devilish way, goes this weird construct, Beelzebub is
manipulating the GOP to pick the nominee easiest for Gore to beat.
Thus, all polls formerly believed in so devoutly are now to be
despised. Moreover _ here comes the need for an even longer leap of
nonfaith _ Gore is eager to debate the pushover McCain and trembles
at the thought of debating the slashing Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Hence, loathed talk-show-spinning! Nothing so corrupts a
campaign's credibility as insistence on the opposite of what
everyone knows to be true.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that McCain is now much more likely than Bush to
defeat Democrat Gore. The question is whether Bush can change that
growing perception in the next few weeks _ not by tearing down
McCain, which would ultimately be self-defeating, but by building
up himself.
</P>
<P>
   The paradox is that Bush has been becoming a better candidate
even as his campaign has been getting worse. It's a pleasure to see
him grow before our eyes: no more cocky smirks, no fear of being
blindsided, no dismaying hesitancy on foreign-policy answers. He
needed not just preparation but the shock of personal adversity.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, his strategists have evidently decided to win
the nomination at the cost of the election. Not only is their heavy
tax-cutting a year out of joint, but putting his previously touted
compassion in the freezer in favor of pandering to the likes of the
Robertson power brokers is foolish.
</P>
<P>
   In the post-Clinton era, authenticity is in; you can no longer
stick your thumb in the moderate eye to capture the so-called
``core'' and then hope to lunge back to win the middle.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, before an audience of presumably well-behaved
executives at Seawell's Restaurant in Columbia, S.C., McCain and
Bush will debate. Larry King of CNN will moderate, which means the
show will be freewheeling.
</P>
<P>
   Who will best put himself and his ideas forward? Who will most
effectively make the case against more Clinton-Gore? Contrariwise,
who will snipe and pander?
</P>
<P>
   Let's watch and see. This is getting good.

TELIGENT IS SAID TO FORGE LINK TO MANNESMANN
</HEADLINE>

 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Expanding its presence in the fast-changing European
communications market, the American company Teligent Inc., a leader
in providing high-capacity communications links using wireless
technology, intends to announce Monday that it has formed a
partnership with a unit of Mannesmann of Germany, executives close
to the deal said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   For Mannesmann, the deal with Teligent follows the agreement
reached earlier this month in which Mannesmann would be acquired
for $183 billion by Vodafone AirTouch PLC of Britain, the world's
largest wireless telephone carrier. The executives said the
Teligent partnership would be inherited by Vodafone AirTouch if the
merger is completed.
</P>
<P>
   Teligent, which is led by Alex J. Mandl, a former president of
AT&AMP;T, is one of the leaders in the United States in delivering
telephone, video and high-speed Internet services using advanced
wireless technology between buildings and other fixed points. The
largest shareholder in Teligent is the Liberty Media Group, the
television programming operation controlled by John C. Malone, the
cable television executive. Teligent's stock is up some 30 percent
so far this year, though it dipped during the technology-stock
sell-off late last week, closing at $80.50 on Friday, down $2.50.
</P>
<P>
   In competition with Winstar Communications Inc., Teligent is
trying to deploy its wireless systems on thousands of office
buildings in the United States. Now, European nations are
auctioning big swaths of wireless spectrum, opening a similar new
market.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Teligent won 36 spectrum licenses in Germany. In the
deal to be announced Monday, Teligent will combine those licenses
with those of Mannesmann Arcor, a Mannesmann subsidiary. The
companies intend to form a joint venture to exploit their combined
licenses and also to bid for additional spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   Among Teligent's competitors in Europe is a start-up company
based in New York City called Firstmark Communications
International. Firstmark recently announced the formation of a
joint venture in France with Suez-Lyonnaise des Eaux, Groupe
Arnault, Rallye Casino, BNP Paribas and the Francarep unit of the
Rothschild Group.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Teligent declined to comment.

ZAGAT SURVEY GETS INVESTMENT FOR EXPANSION
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since Tim and Nina Zagat began publishing their eponymous
restaurant guides in 1979, the couple's company, Zagat Survey, has
refused all outside investors.
</P>
<P>
   That is set to change Monday. Tapping additional capital in a
bid to expand into cyberspace and the wireless ether, Zagat intends
to announce that it has sold a $31 million equity stake to a group
that includes some of the digital economy's most prominent
individuals and institutional investors, Zagat said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Zagat now sells millions of restaurant and hotel guides covering
about 45 cities. The guides' trademark is a reliance on the
opinions of everyday people who volunteer contributions, rather
than on professional reviewers. The company now is moving onto the
Web and into the wireless arena not only to canvass contributors
but also to distribute its information.
</P>
<P>
   Citing a wireless system now in place in Japan that he hopes
will move to the United States, Zagat said Sunday: ``You push a
button on the phone and it shows the five restaurants closest to
you, with our ratings. Then you push the button and you see our
review. You push again and its tells you how to get there with our
map. Then you click on the phone number and it connects you on the
phone.''
</P>
<P>
   Financial details were unclear Sunday, but people close to the
deal said the agreement valued Zagat at more than $100 million,
meaning that at least two-thirds of the company would remain in the
couple's control.
</P>
<P>
   The investment group is led by General Atlantic Partners, a
private investment firm based in Greenwich, Conn. William Ford, a
General Atlantic partner, will join Zagat's board.
</P>
<P>
   The other institutional investors are Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield
&AMP; Byers, one of Silicon Valley's best-known venture capital
operations, and Allen &AMP; Co., the media investor and adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Nathan Myhrvold, a founder of Microsoft and enthusiastic
gastronome, will also invest, as will Nicholas Negroponte, director
of the media laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, and Nancy Peretsman, an investment banker.

TRUMP QUITS BID FOR REFORM PARTY NOMINATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to add 1 graf at end. Deletes reference to Nashville in 10th
graf.)  
(mk) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Donald Trump has decided to end his brief and flamboyant
exploration into running for president, concluding that the Reform
Party, whose support he had sought, was so beset by internal
fighting that he would have no chance of winning the White House as
its nominee, the developer's associates said Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Trump will officially announce his decision in a television
interview Monday morning, according to someone close to him.
However, in the formal statement that will be released Monday, the
developer bitterly denounced the divisions that have publicly beset
the Reform Party in recent months, which he described as ``general
fratricide.''
</P>
<P>
   Trump's decision came one day after a Reform Party faction
backed by Ross Perot, which strongly opposed the prospect of Trump
as the party's presidential candidate, ousted a faction aligned
with Gov. Jesse Ventura of Minnesota, who was close to Trump.
Ventura quit the party on Friday, calling it ``dysfunctional.''
</P>
<P>
   Although it is risky to offer any predictions concerning the
Reform Party, the latest round of maneuvering seemed all but fatal
to any hope Trump had of filling the position that Perot had held
in the 1992 and 1996 presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   Trump asserted in his statement that he believed he could win
the party's nomination if he chose to pursue it. However, he said,
``the prospect of divisive lawsuits, continued fighting over the
national convention site and general fratricide'' had convinced him
that the Reform Party nominee, whoever it may be, would have no
chance of victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have consistently stated that I would spend my time, energy
and money on a campaign, not just to get a large number of votes,
but to win,'' Trump said in the statement. ``There would be no
other purpose, other than winning, for me to run. I have therefore
decided not to seek the presidential nomination of the Reform
Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Trump's imminent departure would appear to leave Pat Buchanan,
the conservative commentator, as the leading prospect to win the
Reform Party's backing _ provided that Perot does not decide to
make a third go at it.
</P>
<P>
   Trump's decision, which was described by his friend as final and
unequivocal, ends what had been one of the stranger episodes of the
2000 presidential race. Before six months ago, Trump had never
shown any interest in electoral politics, instead building a large
reputation as a developer, casino operator and, by his own boast,
skilled publicity seeker and accomplished womanizer.
</P>
<P>
   The new interim head of the Reform Party, Pat Choate, described
Trump as a ``hustler'' Sunday night, and said he had never believed
that Trump had any interest beyond promoting himself and a new book
that happened to be published at exactly the time he started his
light schedule of campaign travel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Donald Trump came in, promoted his hotels, he promoted his
book, he promoted himself at our expense, and I think he
understands very fully that we've ended the possibilities for such
abuse of our party,'' Choate said. ``We're taking our party back to
our very principles, and exploiters such as Donald Trump will notbe able to exploit us again _ and he realizes it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw no evidence that he was a serious candidate at all,''
Choate said. ``All this was, was a serious hustle of the media, and
I think the media should send him a massive bill on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Trump apparently anticipated such speculation _ which, in fact,
is fairly common in political circles _ and in his statement went
out of his way to say that this was more than a frolic. ``For those
who suggest that this has just been a promotion, I want to strongly
deny that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that although his book and his businesses had probably
benefited from the exposure his campaign generated, ``I did not
launch my exploratory campaign for that reason.''
</P>
<P>
   The developer, in his statements, painted a fairly dark picture
of the Reform Party, making references to Buchanan; David Duke, a
former leader of the Ku Klux Klan, and Lenora Fulani, the former
standard-bearer of the New Alliance Party and an advocate of
Marxist-Leninist politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Reform Party now includes a Klansman, Mr. Duke, a
neo-Nazi, Mr. Buchanan, and a communist, Ms. Fulani,'' he said in
his statement. ``This is not company I wish to keep.''
</P>
<P>
   Trump reached his final decision after meeting with advisers at
his estate in West Palm Beach, Fla., before flying back to New York
Sunday evening. Although Ventura said he was forming his own new
Independence Party, Trump said he would not seek its nomination for
president.
</P>
<P>
   Not that this is necessarily the end of Trump's flirtation with
American politics. ``I cannot rule out,'' he says in his statement,
``a possible candidacy in 2004.'
</P>
<P>
   At La Guardia Airport Sunday night, Trump told reporters that he
had discussed his decision with Ventura. He also said he might make

   SIMI VALLEY _ While her colleagues were trying to avoid sinking
in the still-flooded fairways, Carin Koch was drying off in the
Wood Ranch Golf Club clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Victory was still a realistic possibility for Koch, winless in
five previous years on the LPGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think about (winning) because anything can happen,''
Koch said.
</P>
<P>
   Anything didn't happen to Laura Davies, who survived another day
of miserable weather to win the Los Angeles Women's Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Koch, who started her round almost an hour ahead of Davies'
group, shot a 2-under 70 and stood at 2-under for the tournament.
About that same time, Davies was barely maintaining her lead by a
stroke over, among others, Koch.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got finished, I saw that Laura had made bogey (on 14)
and gone down to 3 (under), so I didn't know what was going to
happen,'' said Koch, whose effort bettered the final rounds of
Davies (73), Michele Redman (72) and Janice Moodie (72). The latter
two shared second place with Koch.
</P>
<P>
   An already drenched course that caused severe trauma to much of
the field gave Koch hope she was low enough to get into a playoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always think someone will come through,'' Davies said.
``The most worrisome thing was Carin coming in at 2-under. Once
someone posts, you begin to worry.''
</P>
<P>
   Davies eliminated any drama with birdies on 16 and 17.
</P>
<P>
   __ Wet under the collar: Davies braved the steady drizzle
throughout the day without using an umbrella.
</P>
<P>
   The 36-year-old native of Coventry, England, doesn't believe in
protecting herself from the elements.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather be a wet rat than a cold-handed rat who stays
dry,'' Davies said. ``I'd rather my hands be warm.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Ace in the hole: For all of the problems the leaders
encountered Sunday, Sherri Turner conquered the par-3 seventh hole.
The 43-year-old hit her 7-iron 143 yards for a hole-in-one.
</P>
<P>
   Turner shot a 73 and finshed at 223 for the tournament, 13 shots
behind Davies.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth ace of her career came on the wrong hole, however. Had
she accomplished the feat on 13, she would have won a new car.
</P>
<P>
   __ Local results: Studio City's Emilee Klein shot a 1-over 73
and finished in a four-way tie for 20th at 219.
</P>
<P>
   Klein, who finished eighth at her previous tounament in Naples,
Fla., is 20th on the LPGA money list, earning $29,608 for three
tournaments. The Notre Dame High of Sherman Oaks graduate finished
1999 in the 23rd spot.
</P>
<P>
   Kristal Parker (UCLA) was tied for 14th at 218; Jenny Rosales
(USC) shared 43rd with a 223; Debbi Koyama (UCLA) was 58th at 223.
