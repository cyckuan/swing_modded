<HEADLINE> Premiere of "Opium War" Held in South China Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HUMEN, GUANGDONG, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The premiere of "The
Opium War," an epic Chinese film depicting Britain's
opium-peddling in China and the ceding of Hong Kong, was held
tonight in Humen Town of Dongguan City, in south China's Guangdong
Province.
</P>
<P>
Set in June of 1839, the film tells the story of the Chinese
Emperor's Special Envoy Lin Zexu, who confiscated and burned over
20,000 cases of opium from British traders. The Opium War which
resulted from this incident was fought in Humen.
</P>
<P>
The film's director, Xie Jin, attended the premiere in Humen,
together with a crowd of more than 2,000.
</P>
<P>
Zhong Ganquan, head of the town, said tonight that the filming
of the movie began in Humen on June 14, 1996, and it is even more
significant to hold the premiere there with Hong Kong's return
approaching.
</P>
<P>
The film recounts the unyielding and heroic spirit of the
Chinese people in fighting against foreign invasion, Zhong said.
</P>
<P>
Bao Guo'an, who plays "Lin Zexu" in the film, praised the Humen
people's courage against foreign invaders during the war and
thanked them for their support for filming the movie over the past
year.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Defense Secretary Visits Saudi Arabia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen arrived in Saudi Arabia today to start a Gulf tour, the
first in his current capacity.
</P>
<P>
According to the Kuwait News Agency (Kuna), Cohen is expected
to hold talks with the Gulf leaders on the latest developments in
the region and deliver a message of the U.S. determination to
maintain security of its Arab allies in the region.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival in the Saudi red-sea coast city of Jeddah,
Cohen was greeted by Saudi Second Deputy Prime Minister and
Minister of Defense, Prince Sultan Bin Abdel Aziz, and other
senior officials.
</P>
<P>
He will meet with Saudi King Fahd Bin Abdul Aziz and hold his
second meeting since last February's meet in Washington with his
Saudi counterpart Prince Sultan on issues of security in the Gulf
and the U.S. commitment to it, especially concerning the
U.S. policy of "dual containment," as well as bilateral military
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
They would also discuss the developments in the Middle East
peace process and the efforts to revive it, the Turkish incursion
in northern Iraq and joint defense programs.
</P>
<P>
Kuna said quoting informed sources that Prince Sultan would
convey to Cohen his government's concern about the current
deadlock in the peace process and the recent U.S. congress
decision to move the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Cohen and Prince Sultan will also discuss the progress in
measures to protect the 4,000 U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia from
terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed several months ago to redeploy these
troops outside cities following two explosions in Riyadh and
Khobar in November 1995 and June 1996 respectively that claimed
the lives of 24 U.S. servicemen.
</P>
<P>
Cohen will also head to Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates
before returning to Washington, official sources said, adding that
his initial schedule also include Bahrain and Oman but later
canceled because of other engagements.
</P>
<P>
This is his first visit as defense secretary to the
strategically important and oil-rich Gulf where the U.S. maintains
a major naval presence as well as warplanes that keep watching
over southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has promised to protect its Gulf Arab allies from any
security threats from abroad. Sources here said that during his Gulf
tour, Cohen would lobby for U.S. firms seeking arms sales to Gulf
Arab states with offers of the most sophisticated weapon systems
that money can buy.
</P>
<P>
The talks between Cohen and his Saudi counterpart would also
touch on the Kingdom's plan to purchase U.S. F-16 jet fighters to
replace the old F-5 warplanes, reports said.

HARARE, June 14 (Xinhua) -- An education review commission
will soon be appointed in Zimbabwe to look into the effectiveness
of the the country's education system, said Zimbabwean President
Robert Mugabe here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ruling ZANU (PF) National Consultative
Assembly meeting, Mugabe said the present education system is not
yielding the desired results.
</P>
<P>
He said, ''For a good number of our people, the education that
we gave them has not rewarded them with a job.''
</P>
<P>
' As a result, it has become increasingly clear that a major
need in our educational system is that of skills training,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
He is also concerned about the increasing incidences of
HIV/AIDS and other diseases such as malaria.

<HEADLINE> Air Accidents May Rise to One Each Week: Insurer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The world's airlines are expected
to suffer a serious accident a week by 2010 unless they take
effective action to improve their safety record, according to a
leading aviation insurer.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Lloyd's Aviation Underwriters' Association
Richard Maylam was quoted by the Financial Times newspaper as
saying that although airline safety had improved over the past 25
years, the rise in air travel meant greater steps were needed to
prevent the accident rate rising to unacceptable levels.
</P>
<P>
Maylam explained that the figure of one crash a week was based
on the existing rate of serious accidents registered across the
world.
</P>
<P>
"This clearly is totally unacceptable. And due to the
understandably high profile given by the world press to major
airline losses, this could undoubtedly cause a crisis of
confidence among the traveling public," he said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported more than 70 percent of aircraft crashes
occurred because of mistakes by flight crews and insurers were
encouraging airlines to use satellite navigation systems to
improve safety.

<HEADLINE> Israel Refuses UN Observer at Har Homa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Israel has informed the UN that
it would not receive a representative sent to observe the building
activities at Har Homa (Jabal Abu Ghneim), Israel Radio said here
today.
</P>
<P>
UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan was due to send an official
to Israel today as part of a UN General Assembly decision
calling on Israel to cease the construction of the new Jewish
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
Israel rejected the decision as "out of place," saying the UN
was ignoring a number of crisis and problems occurring elsewhere
in the world.
</P>
<P>
In March, following the start of the construction at Har Homa,
there were two UN Security Council debates and one in the assembly
on the controversial construction.
</P>
<P>
In the UN Security Council, the United States twice vetoed
resolutions that would have assailed Israel for the building
project on the southeastern outskirts of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Political and security contacts between Israel and the
Palestinians have been suspended since March when Israel ordered
the new Jewish settlement building go ahead despite widespread
opposition.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians have said that Israel must stop the construction
before peace talks can resume, while Israel insists the
Palestinian Authority crack down on terror and reestablish full
security cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Namibian Prime Minister Lashes at Western </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Namibian Prime Minister Hage
Geingob today lashed out at the western countries for giving
priority to the lives of animals over those of humans and
dictating how Africa should manage its wildlife.
</P>
<P>
''They have killed all their wildlife and now they want to
tell us how to look after ours,'' he said during a tour of the
Matopos National Park of Zimbabwse.
</P>
<P>
Namibia, like Zimbabwe and Botswana, has a vast elephant
population and is battling at the ongoing 10th Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) conference here
to try to allow restricted trade in the animal's products and
benefit the communities.
</P>
<P>
Namibia has stockpiles of ivory which, like its neighbours, it
has been unable to sell because of the CITES ban on the trade.
</P>
<P>
Hage Geingob said there is need to cull the elephants which
are endangering the lives of people, killing them, destroying
their crops and causing habitat degradation in the three
countries.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his satisfaction with the support being given
to the three countries' proposal with the Southern Africa
Development Community (SADC) having agreed to speak with one voice
at the conference.
</P>
<P>
It is, however, unfortunate that some of the countries which
are against the proposal are powerful and could abuse their
power, he said.
</P>
<P>
Geingob is here on a five-day official visit and will leave
Zimbabwe on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> US Endorsing Jerusalem as Israeli Capital Condemned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani today condemned the United States for its move to
recognize Jerusalem as Israeli capital.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure for Turkey to attend a summit of Islamic
countries, Rafsanjani said that Washington's conspiracy to
recognize Jerusalem as capital of Israel will be discussed at the
summit of the eight Islamic developing states (D-8).
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani said "the impudent move of the U.S. House of
Representative to shift the American embassy to Bait-al-Moqaddas
(Jerusalem) indicated Washington's disregard for the world of
Islam and Arab states."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the U.S. made the move at a time when its
influence in the Middle East is at a low ebb.
</P>
<P>
"The holding of the D-8 summit of Islamic states in Turkey has
acquired greater significance in view of the U.S. conspiracy and
we should get prepared to defend the sanctities of the world of
Islam," he said, quoted by the official news agency IRNA.
</P>
<P>
Heads of Iran, Turkey, Indonesia, Pakistan, Malaysia,
Bangladesh, Egypt and Nigeria are to hold a summit in Istanbul on
Sunday to study the grounds for comprehensive cooperation in the
world of Islam.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president said the eight states with a combined
population of 800 million people in addition to their vast
natural resources and geographical situation would endeavor to lay
the groundwork of constructive cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud
Mohammadi today strongly condemned the recognition by the
U.S. House of Representatives of Jerusalem as capital of Israel
as a move to encourage Israeli expansionism and escalate Middle
East crisis.
</P>
<P>
He called on the Islamic states to defend the interests of the
world of Islam against the unprincipled policies of the United
States and Israel, saying that the decision of the U.S. House of
Representatives unveiled the real face of those claiming to be
impartial in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi charged the U.S. House of Representatives with
trampling upon the religious rights of the Moslem world.
</P>
<P>
He warned the Israeli regime against hurting the religious
feelings of Moslems and violating the rights of the innocent
Palestinian people.

<HEADLINE> EU Delegates Warned Not to Carry Ivory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 14 (Xinhua) -- European delegates attending the
ongoing 10th CITES Conference here have been warned that they
risk prosecution back in their countries if they brought back
souvenirs made from products of protected species.
</P>
<P>
TRAFFIC, the joint wildlife trade monitoring agency of the
Worldwide Fund for Nature and the International Union for the
Conservation of Nature, has said that starting this month,
countries of the European Union (EU) were required to impose a
system of national penalties to combat illegal wildlife trade.
</P>
<P>
In a document circulated to about 1,500 delegates from 138
countries participating in the two-week CITES Conference, TRAFFIC
said that although international trade in ivory was banned in
1989, carvings could still be found legally sold, particularly in
Africa and Asia.
</P>
<P>
''Bringing home chess pieces made of ivory could cost you more
than your holiday,'' warned TRAFFIC.
</P>
<P>
''Do not be tempted to return home with ivory. It is
illegal,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
TRAFFIC also warned against bringing into EU countries
jewellery or sunglasses made from tortoise shell.
</P>
<P>
Sea turtle shell items including whole shells, stuffed
animals, jewellery, combs and sunglasses could not be legally
brought into the EU and therefore would be confiscated.
</P>
<P>
Not only animal products from protected species are proscribed
in the EU, certain wild flora is also on the list.
</P>
<P>
The agency also pointed out that over 800 species of animals
and plants are currently banned from international commercial
trade and more than 20,000 others are controlled under the
European Law implementing the convention on international trade
in endangered species.

<HEADLINE> Nujoma's Third Term Special to Him: Says Namibian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Namibian Prime Minister
Hage Geingob today said the extension of President Sam Nujoma's
rule to a third five-year term was ''special just for the
nation's founder'' and his successors would serve only two terms.
</P>
<P>
While the move required an amendment to the constitution,
Geingob said, this would apply only to Nujoma who was the
nation's founder, and leaders to succeed him would have to revert
to the current constitution which limits leaders' terms to two.
</P>
<P>
The Namibian Prime Minister noted that it was necessary to
extend Nujoma's term of office because 10 years was too short to
complete the work he had initiated.
</P>
<P>
The majority of Namibians, he said, felt that changing leaders
now would derail some processes such as tribal and racial
reconciliation as well as peace which Nujoma had brought to the
southern African nation.
</P>
<P>
The nation's ruling party, South West African People's
Organisation (SWAPO) congress recently decided to elect Nujoma
for a third term, arousing fears that the country was becoming
like other African states which had leaders for life.
</P>
<P>
Geingob however, dispelled these fears, saying Nujoma was
SWAPO's choice but would stand against other opposition
candidates in the elections, hence they would be democratic.

In a statement issued after a parliamentary session, the
National Assembly expressed grave concern over the decision
which it said would lead the region to "a turmoil of
violence."
</P>
<P>
It said Kuwaiti parliament hoped the Clinton administration
would be able to overrun the congress decision to move the
U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, especially in the
current circumstances and as a sign of respect to Muslims around
the globe.
</P>
<P>
It described the decision as "a blow to peace efforts in
the region and a declaration of war against the Palestinians
who would not accept any peace depriving them from their
legitimate rights."
</P>
<P>
The statement said the congress decision would undermine the
international and U.S. efforts to save the peace process from
the setback it suffered due to Israel's stubborn policies.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. congress made the decision recently amid the
international criticism and Arab attacks against Israeli
insistence on construction of a new Jewish settlement in East
Jerusalem it occupied from the Arab people.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli hardline policy has led the Middle East peace
process into a deadlock and roused frequent violence in the
disputed holy city where the Palestinians are struggling to make
it as their capital city of a Palestinian state.

<HEADLINE> Privatization Spurs Egyptian Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The share of the private sector in
Egypt's economic activities has increased from 39 percent in the
early 1980s, to 55 percent in 1996-97, Egyptian Minister of
Economy and International Cooperation Nawal Tatawy said today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the private sector's contribution to the gross
domestic product increased from 51 percent to 67 percent, Tatawy
said while addressing a seminar organized by Egyptian National
Bank.
</P>
<P>
"The private sector has already started to restore its role in
economic development since market economy policies were adopted,"
she added.
</P>
<P>
Since 1981 when the Investment Law was first introduced, about
5,183 projects have been established by December 1996, against
1,416 projects five years earlier, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
The banking system has played a vital role in helping privatize
the state-run enterprises and bring about new ones, Tatawy added.
</P>
<P>
The total investments during the fourth five year plan period
(1997-2002) are expected to hit about 400 billion Egyptian pounds
(about 117 billion U.S. dollars), Tatawy said.
</P>
<P>
Increased investments in the private sector have spurred annual
GDP growth rate to 5.5 percent last year, from 1.9 percent when
privatization began, Tatawy said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has privatized earnestly since President Hosni Mubarak
set up a reform-minded cabinet in 1996, five years after launching
the privatization drive to reduce government involvement in the
economy.
</P>
<P>
Egypt will have sold shares by the end of this year of a third
of the companies it has promised to privatize under its economic
reform program.
</P>
<P>
Public Sector Minister Atef Obeid said earlier that Egypt so
far has sold shares in 68 companies with a total value of 5
billion pounds (1.5 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Obeid said shares in 20 more companies will be listed in Egyptian
Stock Exchange by the end of June, and another 20 by the year's end,
raising the total to 108. Egypt has promised to privatize more
than 300 state-owned companies.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Two Ethiopian companies have
jointly assembled Renault public transport buses with carrying
capacity of 60 and 45 respectively.
</P>
<P>
According to a report here today, this is the first time
that Renaults were assembled in Ethiopia. Some 20 buses will be
assembled within a month in addition to the first two ready for
use.
</P>
<P>
The report said, the locally assembled buses will help save
foreign currency expenditure and reduce production costs between
11,000 and 1,600 US Dollars. Parts of the vehicles, save engine
and chassis, were all local.
</P>
<P>
The buses are said to be more comfortable and durable because
the whole process of assemblying the parts was affected taking into
account the road and climate conditions of the country.

<HEADLINE> Rafsanjani: D-8 Bloc Important Initiative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Istanbul (TURKEY), June 14 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Hashmi
Rafsanjani said here today that the project of the eight
developing Muslim countries bloc, known as the D-8 Group, is
"a very important initiative".
</P>
<P>
In a 50-minute-long meeting with Turkish Prime Minister
Necmettin Erbakan in Istanbul, Rafsanjani said that this project,
which was sponsored by Erbakan, has made first important steps
in cooperation, meaning that it has narrowed gaps among the
Muslim countries.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani, who is here to participate in the D-8 Group
summit scheduled for Sunday, expressed his hope that the D-8
Group should move faster and make concrete products in the
future.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Erbakan first expressed his gratitude for
Iran's support for the D-8 Group, saying that Iran has helped
much for the preparations for this project, which will be
officially announced at the D-8 Group summit.
</P>
<P>
He said that the D-8 Group will work more actively and
make further cooperation among the member states in the future.
</P>
<P>
The group is aimed at working for peace, dialogue,
cooperation, justice, equality and democracy in the world, added
Erbakan.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday D-8 Group summit will discuss measures of further
enhancing cooperation among the eight Muslim countries of Turkey,
Iran, Egypt, Indonesia, Pakistan, Nigeria, Malaysia and
Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Iran is an enthusiastic supporter for the D-8 Group, which
was initiated by Erbakan in October of 1996.

<HEADLINE> Teenager Confesses to German Church Arson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 14 (Xinhua) -- A 19-year-old gardening apprentice
has confessed to having set on fire a Catholic church in the
northern German city of Luebeck last month, motivated by
xenophobic sentiment, investigators said today.
</P>
<P>
An arrest warrant had already been issued for the offender on
Friday evening, police said.
</P>
<P>
A special police investigating team linked the arson attack to
a group of five young people who had been seen in the area of the
St. Vicelin church in Luebeck at about 1 a.m. on May 25 when the
arson took place.
</P>
<P>
According to the police, a 15-year-old and a 17-year-old of the
group later admitted to smearing the church's wall with swastikas
and the name of a Luebeck pastor who recently gave shelter to a
family of Algerian immigrants in his parish.
</P>
<P>
The 15-year-old then blamed his 19-year-old brother of having
set the church on fire, police added.
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old eventually confessed to the crime, admitting
that he broke into a shed next to the church and shot at a gas
canister inside with a starting pistol. The fire then spread from
the shed to the church, almost completely gutting it.
</P>
<P>
Police said the two youths aged 15 and 17 had been released
from their custody, but still remained suspects. The other two
members of the group were thought not to have been directly
involved in the attack.
</P>
<P>
Luebeck has hit the headlines several times in the past few
years with arson attacks on targets such as Jewish synagogs and
foreign refugee homes. A majority of the incidents have been
linked to right extremists.

<HEADLINE> UK Leading Supermarket Chains to Ban Alcopops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Britain's two supermarket chains
announced that all alcopops would be taken of their shelves from
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The move by the Co-op Retail Trading Group, with 1,200 stores
and Iceland, with 600 branches, came on the day that Prime
Minister Tony Blair signaled Friday a crackdown on manufacturers
which tempt under-age drinkers.
</P>
<P>
On the previous day Health Secretary Frank Dobson made a strong
attack on alcopop manufacturers, saying they were deliberately
trying to get children addicted to alcohol.
</P>
<P>
Bill Shannon, head of corporate affairs for the Co-op, said,
"As a responsible retailer, we feel the time has come to act."
</P>
<P>
"We believe these drinks are designed to appeal to young people
and are largely consumed by under-18s who cannot legally buy
them," he added.
</P>
<P>
Malcomlm Walker, the chairman of Iceland, said the move had
been prompted by customer concern. "While commercially this
decision will hurt, as a family company we must act responsibly
and reflect the views of customers," Walker added.
</P>
<P>
Although other stores are urged to join the ban, Sainsbury's,
Tesco and Safeway all said they would continue selling alcopops.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Sainsbury's said, "We don't make moral
decisions on behalf of our customers. Where there is a demand for
a product, we believe customers should have a choice."
</P>
<P>
Tesco announced a package of measures aimed at reassuring
customers about the sale of alcopops, including a ban on alcoholic
milks and sachets.
</P>
<P>
Safeway said that it had "a very responsible attitude" to the
sale of alcopops and staff were trained to request identification
if they thought a purchaser could be under 18.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts believe that no matter what attitude a
supermarket takes, the move taken by the Co-op and Iceland will
add to the pressure on drinks manufacturers to stop producing the
drinks or to introduce stricter controls on their sale.

<HEADLINE> Trial of Israeli Spy Adjourned Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian Higher State Security
Court today adjourned till Tuesday the trial of an Israeli textile
worker and an Egyptian charged of spying for the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
The 180-minute trial started this morning under tight security
with Azam Azam, a 35-year-old chief mechanic at an Israeli-owned
factory in Egypt, and his Egyptian colleague, 34-year-old Emad
Abdul Hamid Ismail attending.
</P>
<P>
The two, arrested in November, again pleaded their innocence
to charges of spying for the Jewish state that can carry sentences
of life imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
Two Israeli women, Zahra Yousef Greis and Mona Ahmed Shawahna,
who are at large in Israel, were tried in absentia as in the
previous two hearings of the case that opened on April 24.
</P>
<P>
The defense attorney Faird al-Dib, at the beginning thanked the
court for allowing him to defend Azam.
</P>
<P>
Dib, a well-known Egyptian lawyer, was punched by his Egyptian
colleague after the court adjourned its second hearing of the case
on May 18.
</P>
<P>
He has been under harsh criticism for the last few weeks. The
Cairo Bar Association has ordered him to appear before its
disciplinary commission on June 11 for agreeing to defend the
Israeli without notifying the syndicate.
</P>
<P>
Policemen in riot gear were deployed inside and outside the
courtroom in the Bab el-Khalq area, downtown of the capital.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is the first Arab country to have a peace treaty with
Israel but ties have been cool. The spy case, however, added to
the tensions because of the Mideast peace deadlock.

KHARTOUM, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese Minister of State at the
Foreign Ministry Mustafa Osman Ismail here today appealed to Arab
states and the Arab League for a unified stand againt a
U.S. Congress move to recognize Jerusalem as the Israeli capital.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement today, Ismail called the Arab states to
persuade the Cliton Administration not to implement the
U.S. Congress resolution eyeing Jerusalem as Israel's undivided
capital.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. Congress resolution indicates the U.S. Congress'
ostansible prejudice in favor of Israel," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The resolution stems from the Zionist pressure exerted on the
U.S. Congress with the aim of forcing the American Administration
to carry on with its well-known prejudice in favor of Israel and
to make a decision to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, which is
contrary to relevant UN Security Council resolutions," he added.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. has decided to set aside 100 million dollars to move
its embassy from Tel-Aviv to Jerusalem, which will provoke Arab
condemnation," he said.

<HEADLINE> More Newspapers Appear in S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Despite the new military government
now ruling in Sierra Leone, more newspapers are being published
in Freetown than in the days of President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here today said altogether five newspapers
appeared in Freetown on Friday. They are "The Vision", "Civic
Agenda", "For Di People", "Weekend Spark" and the "Expo Times".
</P>
<P>
These newspapers showed little sign
of censorship, raising the question if the coup leaders are in
control of the country.
</P>
<P>
"The Vision" called for the restoration of democracy in Sierra
Leone, while the "For Di People" published a detailed account of
coup on May 25, including reports of looting by coup soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Armed Forces Revolutionary Council, however, in one
of its first declarations made a fierce criticism of "inhuman"
press bills introduced by the Kabbah government.
</P>
<P>
Media-watchers expect more newspaper titles to appear in
Freetown in the next few days, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls for Race Relations Improvement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today launched a year-long campaign against intolerance by urging
black and white America to "breach racial divides."
</P>
<P>
Clinton denounced California's anti-affirmative action drive as
"dramatic and devastating."
</P>
<P>
In stern rebuke to ending racial preferences, Clinton said,
"Call it what you will, but I call it resegregation."
</P>
<P>
In a commencement address at the University of California in
San Diego, Clinton sought to trace the history of race relations
in America and offer a frank assessment of where matters now
stand.
</P>
<P>
"The ideals that bind us together are as old as our nation, but
so are the forces that would pull us apart," Clinton was quoted by
media reports as saying to the graduates.
</P>
<P>
Recalling struggles for civil rights in the South, the
president said, "We have torn down the barriers in our laws. Now
we must break down the barriers in our lives, our minds and our
hearts."
</P>
<P>
Clinton's chose California as the site of his speech on race
relations to underscore his opposition to Proposition 209, a 1996
ban on racial preferences. In 1995, the University of California
system, including the campus he visited Saturday, ended
affirmative action in admissions.
</P>
<P>
Proposition 209, approved by California voters in November,
bans consideration of race and gender in state hiring, contracting
and education. It has not taken effect because of legal
challenges, which the Justice Department has supported in briefs
to the federal courts.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has criticized university systems in California and
Texas for ending affirmative action for admission. The number of
blacks admitted to the University of California's Boalt Hall law
school tumbled 81 percent in the first year without affirmative
action, and Hispanic admissions fell 50 percent
</P>
<P>
"I know that many people in California voted to repeal
affirmative action, and did so without ill motive. But the results
are dramatic and devastating," Clinton said. "Enrollments in law
school and other graduate programs are plummeting for the first
time in decades."
</P>
<P>
With the help of an advisory board formed earlier and its 15-
to 20-member staff, Clinton has promised to start a national
discussion about racial, religious and ethnic tensions in America.
The president is expected to come up with concrete solutions in a
report to the American public in a year.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has also promised to devote at least one major
presidential event on the topic.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We know what we will look like -- but what will we be
like? Can we be one America, respecting, even celebrating our
differences, but embracing more strongly what we have in common?"
</P>
<P>
"Our hearts long to answer yes, but our history reminds us that
it will be hard," Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Reaffirms Necessity of China's MFN Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 14 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton today
used his weekly radio speech to repeat his call for the renewal of
the Most Favored Nation (MFN) trade status for China.
</P>
<P>
"One thing we must not do is take any measures that would
weaken Hong Kong," Clinton said in his five-minute radio speech.
"No step would more clearly harm Hong Kong than reversing the
course we have followed for years by denying normal trading status
to China."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that the United States has a big economic interest
in a smooth transition in Hong Kong because more than 1,100 U.S.
firms operate there, "making it the heart of American business in
the fastest-growing part of the world."
</P>
<P>
He argued that shrinking ties with China would derail
U.S.-China efforts to combat drug trafficking, and jeopardize U.S.
jobs dependent on the emerging market.
</P>
<P>
"I am convinced the best way to promote our interests and our
values is not to shut China out, but to draw China in," the
president said.
</P>
<P>
"If we treat China as our enemy, we may create the very outcome
we're trying to guard against," he said.

<HEADLINE> SADC Energy Action Plan Approved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 14 (Xinhua) --The energy ministers meeting
of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) held in
Arusha, northern Tanzania today approved a Energy Action Plan to
implement agreed projects and strengthen co-operation among
members states.
</P>
<P>
According to a report reaching here, the ministers in their
one-day meeting noted that SADC had developed many projects and
programs without successful realisation or with limited results.
</P>
<P>
The ministers stressed the need to "realise the agreed
projects and bring faster economic development in the region".
</P>
<P>
The action plan derives from the strategies defined in the
SADC energy sector co-operation and strategy document.
</P>
<P>
The ministers reviewed the financing energy services for Small
Scale Energy Users (FINESSE) project and noted that phase one of
the program covering Lesotho, South Africa and Zimbabwe has been
completed while phase two embracing Angola, Malawi and Namibia
will be initiated soon.
</P>
<P>
The main objective of FINESSE is to facilitate the financing
of renewable energy and energy conservation measures by financial
institutions, international aid agencies, government and private
sector.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, chaired by Albian Assis of Angola, chairperson of
the SADC energy ministers committee, was aware of the slow
response by member states in submitting energy data for the 1998
energy statistics yearbook.
</P>
<P>
However, the ministers were satisfied with the progress
achieved so far in the energy sector since the creation of the
SADC energy co-operation in 1993, although much more is left to
be done.
</P>
<P>
The next SADC energy ministers meeting is scheduled for
Zimbabwe in June next year.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait Cabinet today
expressed regret over the U.S. congress resolution recognizing
Jerusalem as the "undivided capital of Israel."
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti State Minister for Cabinet Affairs Abdul Aziz
Al-Dakhil said after a weekly session that the "council of
ministers expressed regret and concern over the U.S. congress
resolution."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the resolution "undermines the peace process
and violates all signed (peace) agreements" between the
Palestinians and Israelis.
</P>
<P>
But the Kuwaiti minister praised the Clinton administration's
criticism of the non-binding resolution.
</P>
<P>
The resolution adopted by U.S. Congress Wednesday recognized
Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and earmarked 100 million
U.S. dollars for moving the U.S. embassy in Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made amid international criticism and Arab
attacks against Israeli insistence on construction of a new Jewish
settlement in Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli policy has caused the Middle East peace process to
a standstill and deepened Palestinian resentment in the disputed
holy city which the Palestinians are struggling to make it capital
of their future state.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti National Assembly issued a statement Saturday
condemning the U.S. congress resolution and asked President
Bill Clinton to overrun it.
</P>
<P>
The National Assembly described the resolution as "a blow to
peace efforts in the region and a declaration of war against the
Palestinians who would not accept any peace depriving them of
their legitimate rights."

Since then, complaints have been heard all over Nepal. Some are
worried that the rise in petroleum products may lead to higher
prices for other daily necessities.
</P>
<P>
The Federation of Nepalese Transport Entrepreneurs has warned
that if the government does not withdraw its decision immediately,
it will increase transportation fares by 35 to 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
The NOC has said that it had no other choice because in the

rupees (about 8.5 million U.S. dollars).

<P>
TEHRAN, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations has granted 17
million U.S. dollars to Iran for eliminating substances that
destroy the ozone layer, local Persian daily Jomhuri Islami
reported today.
</P>
<P>
This is part of a worldwide effort of the UN to stop the use of
CFCs, accused of thinning the ozone layer that protects the earth
from excessive ultraviolet radiation, during the period from 1996
to 2005.
</P>
<P>
Nasser Moharram Nezhad, deputy president for Human Habitat of
Iran's Ecological Organization, said "by implementing plans aimed
at reconstructing the ozone layer, all the substances that play a
role in destroying the ozone layer will be eliminated from the
cycle of industrial and chemical products."
</P>
<P>
The official said that these plans were implemented in 1996
in the industrialized countries and will be fully implemented in
developing countries by the year 2005 with UN assistance.
</P>
<P>
Iran has pledged that it would reach the defined aims of this
program in 1999, about six years ahead of the schedule for
developing countries, he added.

LANZHOU, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua has called
on local officials in northwest China's Gansu Province to further
emancipate their minds and make practical efforts to push forward
economic growth in the country's central and western areas.
</P>
<P>
During his inspection tour in Gansu from June 11 to 15, Zou
expressed appreciation for good water conservation measures to
improve farming conditions, saying that water problem has been the key
factor to holding economic growth in northwest China.
</P>
<P>
Local officials and the masses have been active in constructing
both large and small water conservation projects, and they have
found a feasible way out for agricultural development and poverty
eradication in the mountainous areas through building terraced
fields, collecting rain water, and employing trickle and spray
irrigation.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier noted that in the mountainous areas, it is
important to map out an overall plan to improve the farming
conditions, transport and other infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
In his inspection, Zou pointed out that township enterprises,
which may do processing of farm and sideline produce,
constitute an important component of the rural economy.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he urged local officials to carry out the central
government policies about the reform of state-owned enterprises.

<HEADLINE> US Reaffirms Its Commitment to Saudi Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The United States Defense
Minister William Cohen today reaffirmed the US commitment to the
security of Saudi Arabia, reports reaching here from Saudi red-sea
coast city of Jeddah said.
</P>
<P>
Cohen made the remarks before he wrapped up his two-day visit
to the world top oil producer and exporter. He held talks with
Saudi King Fahd Bin Abdul Aziz and his Saudi counterpart Prince
Sultan Bin Abdul Aziz last night.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said his talks with Saudi leaders also tackled means of
boosting security and stability in the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
Cohen called on Iran to change its positions towards Saudi
Arabia through deeds, noting Iran's desire to improve its
relations with Saudi Arabia following the victory of moderate
Mohammed Khatami in Iranian presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
He said Washington was "hopeful but skeptical" on Iran and
"for the time being our policy is going to remain constant."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Saudi Prince Sultan denied Cohen's visit was aimed
at "resolving disputes between both countries" on the
investigation of the truck blast at the Khobar military housing
complex in Dhahran on June 25 last year that killed 19 U.S. airmen.
</P>
<P>
Cohen also reportedly brushed aside that the Federal Bureau of
Investigation lodged complaints over the Saudi security
authorities' non-cooperation due to what reports said Washington
and Riyadh were at odds over the investigation.
</P>
<P>
U.S. relations with Saudis have at times been strained in
the past year over Saudi handling of the investigation of
the car bomb.
</P>
<P>
So far the evidence is still inconclusive and the
investigation continues, Cohen reportedly said aboard his
plane en route to Saudi Arabia Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Prince Sultan also said his country hoped the U.S.
"should back the Oslo, Madrid and Washington peace accords" on
the Middle East process.
</P>
<P>
Cohen will arrive in Kuwait later today to continue his
Gulf tour. Official sources said Cohen's talks with Kuwait
leaders would focus on military cooperation and the situation
in Southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister Sheikh Salem
Sabah Al-Salem Al-Sabah said Saturday that Cohen's visit came
within the framework of bolstering the Kuwaiti-U.S. ties and
common understanding in the defense field.

<HEADLINE> Israeli High Court Rules Against Indicting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu survived another legal challenge today as Israeli High
Court of Justice rejected petitions to indict him for his role in
a corruption scandal.
</P>
<P>
The five-judge panel ruled with a vote of 4-1 against
overturning the decision made by Attorney General Elyakim
Rubinstein and State Attorney Edana Arbel, who rejected the
police recommendation of indicting Netanyahu and Justice Minister
Tzahi Hanegbi for their roles in the Bar-On scandal.
</P>
<P>
The court said there was no reason to review the state
prosecution's decision not to indict Netanyahu and Hanegbi. It
claimed that it would not intervene in the decision unless it was
entirely unreasonable.
</P>
<P>
On April 20, Rubinstein and Arbel announced that they had no
sufficient evidence to indict Netanyahu and Hanegbi with fraud and
breach of trust in appointing former Jerusalem lawyer Roni Bar-On
as the attorney general.
</P>
<P>
The scandal, exposed in January by state television Channel I,
sparked a government crisis that threatened to topple Netanyahu
government.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu was suspected of making a deal with his political
ally Aryeh Deri, leader of the powerful Shas party, who allegedly
conditioned his party's support to the Hebron agreement on
Bar-On's appointment.
</P>
<P>
By getting Bar-On appointed, Deri hoped to gain a favorable
plea-bargain deal in his bribery trial. The state prosecution
decided to indict only Deri with fraud and breach of trust for
pushing for Bar-On's appointment.
</P>
<P>
Following the state prosecution's announcement not to indict
Netanyahu and Hanegbi, the opposition Meretz leader Yossi Sarid
and Labor lawmaker Yossi Sarid filed two separate petitions
against the decision.
</P>
<P>
The civilian watchdog organization The Movement for Quality
Government also submitted a petition demanding remove Hanegbi
from his office "for failing to act according to accepted norms"
of public behavior. Hanegbi reportedly gave false information to
cabinet ministers on Bar-On's qualification in order to get
Bar-On's appointment.
</P>
<P>
The petition was also rejected by the high court. Moreover, the
court upheld the state prosecution's decision not to publish the
recommendation by the police investigative team calling for
indictments all round.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's office immediately welcomed the high court ruling,
saying "justice has been done."
</P>
<P>
While conceding their defeat in the legal battle to bring down
Netanyahu government over the Bar-On scandal, opposition lawmakers
vowed to continue challenging Netanyahu in the public arena.
</P>
<P>
"It's not the end. It's a turning point in the whole
affair. And it's beginning of the end of Netanyahu's term in
government as the prime minister," said Yossi Beilin, a former
minister in the Labour government.

<HEADLINE> Premier Li Peng Completes Inspection Tour in Sichuan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, June 15 (Xinhua) -- During an inspection tour from
June 11 to 14 in southwest China's Sichuan Province, Premier Li
Peng showed great concern for a gigantic hydraulic power project,
the reform of state-owned enterprises and poverty relief work.
</P>
<P>
On June 12, Li went to the construction site of the Ertan
Hydraulic Power Station, a major stop in his inspection. He had
proposed the construction of the station in 1982 when he was
a vice-minister of the then Ministry of Water Resources and
Electric Power.
</P>
<P>
Being the biggest hydraulic power project in China by the end
of the century, the Ertan station will play a decisive role in
boosting economic growth in Sichuan Province and Chongqing
Municipality, and southwest China as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The station has been under construction for six years, its
total installed capacity will be 3.3 million kw. It is expected
that the first group of 550,000-kw water turbo-generators will go
into operation in July next year.
</P>
<P>
The premier was pleased to learn the smooth progress of the
station's construction and affirmed the way of competitive
international bidding to raise funds and seek loans for the huge
power project.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he noted that the saving on water should be
given the same importance as the exploitation of water resources.
</P>
<P>
During his inspection, Li urged local officials to actively
explore the way of revitalizing state enterprises in line with the
requirements of the socialist market economy, adding that advanced
technology and strict management measures have proved successful
in bringing about the success of enterprises.
</P>
<P>
As to the fact that more than four million people in Sichuan
are living in poverty, the premier pointed out that to increase
local people's scientific knowledge and raise their educational
quality are key to changing the backward outlook in impoverished
areas.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of local resources, the areas must develop crop
planting, poultry raising and other undertakings to improve
economic returns and raise farmers' income, Li said.

<HEADLINE> 3 Palestinians Wounded in Clashes with Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 15 (Xinhua) -- At least three Palestinians
were injured this morning during clashes between Israeli
soldiers and Palestinian demonstrators in the West Bank town of
Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported that the clashes erupted when
dozens of Palestinian youngsters started to throw stones and
fire-bombs at Israeli soldiers guarding the Jewish quarter of
Beit Hadassah in downtown Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Israeli soldiers and border police fired rubber bullets and
tear gas at the demonstrators to disperse the crowd, reportedly
injuring three Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Today's clashes came after a six-hour confrontation in the
city between Israeli soldiers and Palestinian protesters Saturday
when at least 30 Palestinians were wounded.
</P>
<P>
A series of clashes erupted between Israeli soldiers and
Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip since the United
States Congress adopted a resolution Wendesday recognizing united
Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) cabinet
issued a statement blaming the U.S.resolution. PNA chief
Jerusalem representative Faisal Husseini warned that if the
U.S. approves the resolution, "the whole peace process will be
lost."
</P>
<P>
Jordan's King Hussein, who is currently visiting Europe,
Friday criticized the U.S. resolution on Jerusalem, which, he
said, somewhat undermined the U.S. role in Middle East peace
efforts.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians have been
stalled since March when Israel started to build a controversial
new Jewish neighborhood at Har Homa (Jabal Abu Ghneim) on the
southeastern outskirts of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians have said that Israel must stop the construction
before talks can resume, while Israel is insisting that the PNA
must crack down on terror and reestablish full security
cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Iran Says Its Unemployment Rate Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Iran said it has reduced the
unemployment rate from 11.9 percent eight years ago to 9.1 percent
at present.
</P>
<P>
According to a local press report today, Karamali Ahmadi,
Director of the Fund for Supporting Employment Opportunities
(FSEO), said that the figure will further drop to 9 percent by the
end of the Second Five-Year Development Plan (1995-1999).
</P>
<P>
Ahmadi was quoted by the Persian daily Salam as saying that
some 40 million U.S. dollars was allocated by the government for
establishing training centers for the jobless.
</P>
<P>
He added that this year some 45,000 people would be trained in
450 centers across Iran; his organization has allocated some 6.3
million dollars this year in self-employment loans to a total of
5,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Specialists noted that the highly fluid nature of Iran's labor
market and the large size of the informal service sector makes
relatively accurate estimates of employment levels impossible.
</P>
<P>
They noted that the official unemployment rate of 9.1 percent
is far too low, since the younger generation born after the 1979
Islamic revolution, which accounts for almost half the population,
now began to join the labor force.
</P>
<P>
Private estimates put the unemployment rate at 25 percent, but
the Business Monitor International believes a rough estimate is
round 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
Foreign diplomats in Tehran suggest that the country's
unemployment rate is rising, rather than declining, and this trend
will continue in the short-to-medium term as population growth
outstrips job creation.

<HEADLINE> Clan Attack Kills 10 in Somali Port City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, June 15 (Xinhua) -- At least 10 people were killed
and about 15 others wounded when armed men attacked stores and
restaurants in Somalia's southern port town of Kismayu last
night, a local radio said.
</P>
<P>
According to the commercial VHF radio from Kismaio, 500 km
south of the capital, the attack was carried out by more than 50
armed men belonging to the Marehan clan of the former dictator
Mohamed Siad Barre who fired indiscriminately upon people
enjoying tea at about 9:15 local time last night.
</P>
<P>
The attack was said to be a continuation of the previous
conflict over the control of Kismaio between Marehan and Majerten
clansmen.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the Marehans were taking revenge over
those of Majerten militiamen who dominate the town.
</P>
<P>
The Marehan militiamen have come from Gobwein village, north
of Kismaio, and sneaked through the defensive positions of the
Majerten clansmen outside the city.
</P>
<P>
All streets were deserted and business centers were closed
down as a result of the attack.
</P>
<P>
The Marehans have deserted the town of Kismaio after last
night's incident and retreated back to Gobwein village.
</P>
<P>
The Marehan clansmen were driven out of Kismaio early in the
year following the Majertens suspicion that they aligned
themselves with the government of Hussein Mohamed Aidid.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, thousands of people demonstrated in Mogadishu
Stadium today, in commemoration of the second anniversary of the
government established by late general Mohamed Farah Aidid.
</P>
<P>
Hussein Mohamed Aidid and his senior officials in their
government also attended the demonstration.
</P>
<P>
Aidid has called the Ethiopian forces to withdraw
unconditionally from Somalia's soil, ''the Ethiopian action is
intolerable in regard to the territorial integrity of Somalia,''
said Aidid.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian forces still maintain their control over the
towns of Bulo Hawo and Luq which they have invaded Thursday in
their third military incursion into Somalia since last year.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong, Hong Kong Youth Burn Drug in Humen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Over 1,000 young people from
south China's Guangdong province and Hong Kong burned up 150
kilograms of heroin and "ice" drug today in the very pool where
China's national hero Lin Zexu ordered to burn opium seized from
foreign traders 158 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The activity, designed to greet Hong Kong's return to the
motherland, was sponsored by Guangdong Narcotics Control
Committee, Guangdong Youth Federation, and a special preparatory
committee of Hong Kong young people for the celebration of Hong
Kong's return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Over 800 young people from Hong Kong made a special trip to
attend the activity held in Humen county, known for "Opium-Burning
in Humen" in history.
</P>
<P>
158 years ago, Lin Zexu, an imperial envoy, was sent to look
into the problem of opium trafficking. Over 20,000 cases of opium
with a total weight of 1.15 million kg, were seized from British
and American traders and were all burned up at once in Humen, on
June 3, 1839.
</P>
<P>
Young participants also signed their names on a banner with a
map of China as the background to swear they would always remember
the history of "Opium-Burning in Humen" and create a bright
future. The banner with signatures of 1,997 Guangdong and Hong
Kong youth would be on display on July 6 in Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Writers, Artists Urged to Produce Good Cultural Works for People (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, June 15 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official has told
the country's literary and art workers to work hard and produce
works of higher quality and provide the people "with the best
cultural sustenance".
</P>
<P>
Ding Guangen, head of the Propaganda Department of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, made the remark
at a "national conference on creating more fine literary and art
works" held here last week.
</P>
<P>
Ding, also member of the Political Bureau and the Secretariat,
of the CPC Central Committee, stressed that all the goals should
be achieved through adhering to the literary and artist policies
of "serving the people, serving the socialist cause," and "letting
a hundred flowers blossom and a hundred schools of thought
contend."
</P>
<P>
"And the laws governing literary and art creation shall be
fully complied with and work of writers and artists shall be fully
respected," Ding said.
</P>
<P>
He said that since Chinese President and CPC Central Committee
General Secretary Jiang Zemin made an important speech last
December on the work of literature and art, writers and artists
have given full play to their initiatives, and increased their
sense of responsibility for the society, and have written more
fine works of high political and moral standards.
</P>
<P>
"The current trend is very good," Ding commented.
</P>
<P>
But much remains to be done to create more works to inspire the
public, he said, adding that this is the need of reinvigorating
national spirits, the reform, opening up and the socialist
modernization, the development of socialist cultural market and
resistense against decadent ideological and cultural influences.
</P>
<P>
Ding pointed that while focusing on the purposes of serving the
people, reform and opening up, writers and artists should
diversify their creative forms, themes and styles, to match the
colorful life of the people.

<HEADLINE> UNDP Urges to Close Gender Gap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The united Nations Development Program
(UNDP) has urged developing countries to close gender gap so that the
energy and productive capabilities of women can be unleashed
for national development.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries should commit themselves to gender equality
if they are to eradicate poverty by the 21st centuary, said the 1997
Human Development Report available from the UNDP office in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
In developing countries, illiterate women outnumber men by 60
percent and that women still have less access to employment
opportunities, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that such trends should be reversed if developing
nations are to eradicate poverty and achieve sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries which will achieve economic
growth in the next five years are those that have made poverty
eradication a priority and give women more access to political and
professional opportunities, said the report.

<P>
BEIJING, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Jiang Chunyun
today urged Township entrepreneurs to improve their overall
quality so as to promote essential changes of their businesses.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who is also a member of the Political Bureau of the
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), said that
township enterprises are facing good opportunity as well as
rigorous challenges under new circumstances, while meeting with
representatives of China Association of Young Township
Entrepreneurs (CAYTE) here today.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that township enterprises have become the most vital
economic sector in rural areas of the country since China
initiated reform and opening up policy in late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
He said that tasks for township entrepreneurs are to grasp the
spirit of the national conference on township enterprises held
earlier this year, and implement the Law on Village and Township
Enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Township entrepreneurs, he stressed, should upgrade step by
step the management, technological and service levels of their
enterprises. The overall quality of township enterprises should be
promoted so that they could fit in with market demand and market
competition, the vice-premier said.
</P>
<P>
The development of township enterprises is considered a
strategic choice of China to make the country prosperous and its
people well-off.
</P>
<P>
The CAYTE, set up in 1988, is a national organization for
excellent young township entrepreneurs. Incomplete statistics

ISTANBUL, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Hashemi
Rafsanjani today accused the United States of trying to move its
embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a controversial
city between Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the first D-8 Group summit in Turkey's largest
city of Istanbul, Rafsanjani strongly slammed the adoption of a
resolution by the U.S. Congress last Wednesday concerning the
transfer of the U.S. Embassy in Israel, describing it as "a
flagrant violation of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian
people."
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani said that Iran was deeply concerned about the
U.S. move, saying "it illustrates once again that U.S. policy is
completely dedicated to serving the illegitimate interests of
Israel."
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president called on the Islamic world and the D-8
Group to make appropriate reaction in response to the U.S. embassy
transfer resolution.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani is an enthusiastic supporter for the D-8 Group
sponsored by Islamic Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan late
last year.
</P>
<P>
The D-8 Group summit, which has attracted presidents, prime
ministers as well as other senior officials from the eight

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia Rejects US Decision to Remove </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia has expressed
full rejection to the U.S. Congress' decision to move the
U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, saying it's an
actual consideration of the disputed city as Israel's capital.
</P>
<P>
This was expressed by Saudi Second Deputy Prime Minister and
Defense Minister Prince Sultan ibn Abdul-Aziz during his talks
with the visiting U.S. Defense Minister William Cohen in the Saudi
port city of Jeddah last night, according to the Kuwait News
Agency today.
</P>
<P>
Prince Sultan said "Saudi Arabia will be glad to hear the
U.S. leaders' opposition to this decision."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Congress issued a resolution last Wednesday to
recognize Jerusalem as the undivided capital of Israel and
allocate 100 million U.S. dollars to move the U.S. embassy in Tel
Aviv to the controversial city.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made amid strong international criticism and
Arab condemnation.
</P>
<P>
The hardline policy of the Jewish state has again plunged the
Middle East peace process into deadlock since mid-march, due to
its construction of a new Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem it
seized from the Arabs in the 1967 war.
</P>
<P>
The Israelis have claimed Jerusalem as the inseparable capital
of the country while the Palestinians want to make it as the
capital city of their independent state in the future.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the Kuwait National Assembly also
condemned, in a statement Saturday, the U.S. congress' decision
and requested U.S. President Bill Clinton to overturn the decision.
</P>
<P>
The national assembly expressed grave concern over the
decision which it said would lead the region to "a turmoil of
violence."
</P>
<P>
It said the Kuwaiti parliament hoped the Clinton
Administration would be able to overturn the congress decision,
especially under the current circumstances, as a sign of respect
for Muslims around the world.
</P>
<P>
It described the decision as "a blow to the peace efforts in
the region and a declaration of war against the Palestinians who
would not accept any peace depriving them of their legitimate
rights."
</P>
<P>
The statement said the congress decision would undermine the
international and U.S. efforts to save the peace process from
the setback it suffered due to Israel's stubborn policy.

<HEADLINE> Bank Loans to Help Nepalese Women End Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 15 (Xinhua) -- A Nepal Bank Ltd. branch has
started distributing loans to help lift women in this Himalayan
kingdom out of poverty with the assistance of the Asian
Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
Under a women's small credit project implemented by the
government, women who have received basic training in savings and
loans and who have formed into savings groups are provided loans
without collateral, the official RSS news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
With the loans, women are encouraged to be involved in income
generating activities, so as to uplift themselves out of poverty
both socially and economically.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali government has listed poverty eradication within a
given time frame through pro-poor growth and employment-friendly
programs as an overriding objective of the upcoming Ninth Five
Year Plan (1997-2002).
</P>
<P>
The poverty of women arrests in particular the attention of the
government, since Nepal is one of the two exceptional countries in
the world with life expectancy of women less than that of men.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the Nepalese women lag far behind men in literacy,
access to education, health services, land and credit.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Civil servants in northern Nigeria's
Kaduna State have been urged to begin an indefinite strike from
tomorrow, the Sunday Vanguard reported today.
</P>
<P>
The directive for strike comes from the Kaduna State
Public Service Negotiating Council, the report said.

<P>
The civil servants are demanding the payment of a 50 percent
increase in their awards and allowances for medical, transport

ago, according to the report said.
</P>
<P>
The council advised the government to maintain security to
safeguard public property, as all watchmen are expected to fully
participate in the industrial action.
</P>
<P>
The council decided to go on strike after the expiration of a
21-day ultimatum persuading the government to meet its demands.

ROME, June 15 (Xinhua) -- England international Paul Ince
planned to leave the Italian club Internazionale Milan for
England, Italian newspapers reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The papers speculated that the 29-year-old star, who has been

<HEADLINE> Expansion Starts on Northwest Chinese Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua
attended an inauguration ceremony today for expansion on
Zhongchuan airport in Lanzhou, capital of northwest China's Gansu
Province.
</P>
<P>
Total investment for the project will reach 1.23 billion yuan,
involving the fourth batch of loans, totaling 6.3 billion Japanese
yen, from Japan's Overseas Cooperative Fund. Work will be
completed in four years.
</P>
<P>
The project, approved by the State Council, has been listed as
a key basic construction project by the State Planning
Commission. The airport will be expanded in line with its required
passenger handling capacity in the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
The expansion project includes a 3,600-m-long runway with
4D-category standard, a parallel slideway and four roads for
liaison purpose, as well as parking aprons for 16 more airplanes,
and a terminal with a floor space of 25,000 sq m.
</P>
<P>
Other necessary facilities, in terms of pilot, meteorology, the
supply of oil, water, and electricity, will also be built, airport
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Zhongchuan airport plays an important role in the country's
airport and air route layout. Built in 1968, however, it cannot
accommodate large aircrafts because of its low technological
standard.
</P>
<P>
In order to meet the demands of an ever increasing cargo and
passengers, the airport has to be upgraded, authorities say.

Economically booming areas should increase cooperation with the
ethnic areas for common progress on the basis of equality, mutual

<HEADLINE> Enhanced Cooperation Called for in D-8 Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISTANBUL, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel called, at the ongoing D-8 summit today, on the Muslim
member countries to strengthen their cooperation in a bid to play
a bigger and more energetic role next century.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the summit of the D-8 Group summit in Turkey's
largest city of Istanbul, Demirel said that the D-8 Group, namely
Turkey, Iran, Egypt, Nigeria, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Malaysia and
Indonesia, should make use of what he called the new mechanism to
boost bilateral and multilateral cooperation in various sectors
among all the countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
He noted that an increasingly interdependent world urges the
D-8 member countries to join forces to overcome their
difficulties faced with their economic development.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the participants at the meeting, Turkish Prime
Minister Necmettin Erbakan stressed that the eight Muslim
countries should further cooperate for the benefit of their
peoples.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan claimed that the formation of the D-8 Group is aimed
at helping their member countries play " a productive role"
instead of competing with the Western states in the
international affairs.
</P>
<P>
At the summit, Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani said that
the D-8 Group opens "new dimensions for cooperation among Muslim
countries," describing the creation of the Muslim group as "a
particularly important event."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the D-8 Group member countries have
considerable potentials in enhancing their economic and
technical cooperation in various fields.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of his president Hosni Mubarak who did not attend the
meeting, Egyptian Prime Minister al-Ganzouri said that his country
has positively responded to the establishment of the group, adding
its structure would provide a distinct forum for cooperation at
different levels.
</P>
<P>
In his speech made at the meeting, Indonesian President
Suharto called for close coordination among the eight Muslim
countries to make the D-8 group's mechanism work smoothly.
</P>
<P>
Suharto appealed to the group to attach great importance to
their cooperation in private sectors, noting "the contributions
of our private business sectors will be crucial in the fight
against poverty."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the summit, Pakistani Prime Minister Mian Nawaz
Sharif explained in details the six principles adopted at the
summit, "peace instead of conflict, dialog instead of
confrontation, cooperation instead of exploitation, justice
instead of double standards, equality instead of discrimination
and democracy instead of oppression."
</P>
<P>
Noting that stability and economic development is closely
linked, Sharif urged the D-8 Group member states to spare no
efforts to work more for the benefit of their people.
</P>
<P>
Describing the Istanbul summit as "a historic meeting,"
Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said that the D-8 group
should play a substantive role in promoting cooperation among its
member states as they share deep-rooted historical, religious,
cultural affinities and abundance of human and natural resources
within the bloc.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Bangladesh leader called on the D-8 group states
to make special efforts for enhanced cooperation with the seven
major industrialized countries, known as G-7 Group comprising the
United States, Britain, France, Germany, Canada, Italy and
Japan.
</P>
<P>
At the Istanbul summit, the formation of the D-8 Group was
officially announced, and some presidents, prime ministers and
senior leaders from the eight member states attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The D-8 Group was launched by Turkey late last year, and its
first foreign ministerial meeting was convened in Istanbul early
this year.

<HEADLINE> Fierce Media Battle to Unfold Around HK's Handover (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 15 (Xinhua) --The opening of a 9,000-sq. m
press center here today raised the curtain on a media battle of
the century, in which more than 8,000 journalists from all over
the world will exert themselves in the coverage of Hong Kong's
historic return to China.
</P>
<P>
Calling it "the media battle in the century" is by no means an
exaggeration now that over 770 media organizations deploy their
best contingents equipped with state-of-the-art equipment to
capture the historic moment at midnight June 30, when China
resumes its exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Many journalists described the handover as a historic event
that happens only once in history and only once in one's lifetime.
</P>
<P>
"You can't afford not to be there," said a corespondent of CNN
International, which sends an additional staff of 50 to join the
16 residential journalists in Hong Kong. The total number of
American applicants for the coverage hits 1,030, trailing Hong
Kong with 2,755 and Japan with 1,319.
</P>
<P>
All the three major television networks in the United States
-- ABC, CBS and NBC -- are dispatching strong contingents to Hong
Kong together with top newscasters on the scene. Three leading
American anchors -- Peter Jennings for ABC, Dan Rather for CBS and
Tom Brokaw for NBC -- will all fly in to air their regular
half-hour nightly news broadcasts from the newly-established
Special Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
A large corps of 1,319 journalists are coming in from Japan,
including all leading television networks -- NHK, Fuji TV, TV
Asahi, TBS, NTV and TV Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
NHK, the oldest broadcasting corporation in Japan, will enhance
its presence in Hong Kong by forming a 50-member special coverage
pool and bringing in a set of advanced equipment called
Communications Satellite Portable (CSP), which can transmit
signals directly from the ground to the satellite.
</P>
<P>
Ryuichiro Nakamura, NHK Hong Kong Bureau chief, said: "The 21st
century is the era of China. The return of Hong Kong to China will
enhance China's position in the Asia-Pacific region, both
politically and economically." He believed that the devising of
"one country, two systems" is a "unique and practical way" to
maintain Hong Kong's vitality.
</P>
<P>
CCTV, China's national television network, will have a record
number of 289 reporters, newscasters, cameramen and technicians on
the scene -- a strong battalion equipped with helicopters and
DSNG, a mobile satellite TV station.
</P>
<P>
"We will give a live, 72-hour blanket coverage of the event.
For the Chinese nation, it is a moment to wash off the 150-year
humiliation and shame," said Li Liansheng, deputy chief of CCTV,
who has started to command at the forefront -- CCTV working booths
at the Press and Broadcasting Center.
</P>
<P>
The center provides some 600 free seats for news writers, and
more than 230 working booths which have all been booked well
before its opening today.
</P>
<P>
The handover ceremony is doubtless the center of attention for
all TV networks. At the stroke of midnight local time, all eyes
will be riveted on TV screens -- the lowering of the Jack Union
and the raising of the Five-Star Red Flag.
</P>
<P>
The final lap of transition is where the dominant battlefield
lies, and where every TV producer competes fiercely for speed and
accuracy to attract its audience. Many TV networks will start from
June 23 to mount a week-long or ten-day program focusing on
various aspects of the handover.

<P>
CNBC, a service launched by the Asian subsidiary of NBC,
announced that its live, blanket coverage would be spliced with
in-depth analysis and interviews with prominent figures. Names of
these interviewees are still kept in secret at this moment since
"it is our edge", as a CNBC spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
For cameramen, taking a good shooting position is gaining an
advantage in the game. CNBC has rented three rooms on top of the
Regent Hotel, which commands spectacular views across the Victoria
Harbor to the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center
Extension, the official venue of the handover ceremony.
</P>
<P>
NHK also has obtained a good filming place, which commands a
good view of both the handover site and Tamar, where Britain will
hold the farewell ceremony, according to its bureau chief.
</P>
<P>
Competition is keen not only among television producers, but
also among news agencies, newspapers and magazines. A veteran
journalist in Hong Kong called the coverage of the handover "a
world-class news writing competition".
</P>
<P>
Reuters will bring in seven extra reporters to strengthen its
20-member residential team, AFP will double its group to 16
correspondents, and AP will boost its contingent to 80, who will
belong to four divisions of news, photo, audio and TV.
</P>
<P>
"The return of Hong Kong to China is a vital part of China's
growth and development," said Rodney Pinder, Reuters Asia news
editor.
</P>
<P>
"Economically, it's a huge and immensely important story,"
according to Pinder, who believed that the importance of China is
the no.1 reason that turns Hong Kong into a global focus.
</P>
<P>
Fok Yit Wye, a reporter from Singapore daily Lianhe Zaobao,
said: "The handover is important for the whole of Asian people,
because it is the end of colonial rule in the region, something
they or their ancestors have experienced over the past century."
</P>
<P>
Economic relationship is also a factor affecting Asian people's
feelings toward the handover, she said. Many Asian countries have
strong economic interests in Hong Kong and they reasonably want to
see a smooth and successful handover.
</P>
<P>
Chief Editor of AFP Hong Kong Bureau Richard Ingham said that
there has never been an event like this in history. It is the
first time that a piece of land is transferred from one country to
another in a peaceful and negotiated way rather than resorting to
arms.
</P>
<P>
The big event is unfolding in two weeks' time and the entire
world is watching.

LAGOS, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Oil production in Nigeria, the
African oil giant, might suffer a setback as its leading
multinational partners in the oil industry are threatening to
shut down operations.
</P>
<P>
According to industry sources, Shell, Mobil, Chevron, Elf and
Agip, all major foreign oil companies in Nigeria, are considering
shutting down oil operations for some 30 days to forestall
financial crisis with the 40 percent budget cut by the federal

of 2.05 billion U.S. dollars for cash-call payments, which is
down from estimated 3.5 billion dollars for the joint venture
partner operations between the Nigerian National Petroleum
Corporation and the foreign firms.
</P>
<P>
The foreign partners have appealed for re-consideration by the
government, but half way into the year, they saw no sign of a
government review of the budget to maintain the current levels of
crude oil production.
</P>
<P>
Worse still, given the 40 percent cut, the payment by
government did not commence until April. Before then the high
interest from the funds the oil companies borrowed made them "all
losers on all fronts," according to an oil company official, who
described the situation as "rather disappointing".
</P>
<P>
Most of the leading oil companies, industry sources said, have
started giving back leased rigs which are used in oil drilling,
apparently because the machines have become idle for lack of
funds so as to reduce the cost for hiring them.
</P>
<P>
At least four rigs, two hired by Shell and two by Mobil, have
left Nigeria and more are expected to leave, they said.
</P>
<P>
Shell alone produces about one million barrels per day, almost
half of Nigeria's daily production of 2.3 barrels. Mobil also
takes a rather big share of the daily output.
</P>
<P>
Analysts noted the withdrawal of rigs will necessarily
increase the expense to re-hire them if and when the situation
becomes more conducive for the Nigerian operators, resulting in a
shoot up of oil production cost.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Small City Taps Market with Small Commodities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Years ago, only a few Chinese
could point out-of-towners in the direction of Yiwu, a remote city
in the central part of East China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
Now, the 27,000-stall China Small Commodity Market in the city
is a well-known destination for traders and shoppers seeking to
buy bunches of goods and test their bargaining skills.
</P>
<P>
"The transaction volume in the market hit more than 20 billion
yuan (approx. 1.5 billion US dollars) last year, the largest among
100,000-odd trade fairs in China," said Li Zizhou, deputy general
manager of China Small Commodity Holding Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that about 200,000 people from home and abroad
trade at the fair everyday. So far this year, more than 1,000
businesspeople from 20-plus countries and regions, including
neighboring southeast Asian nations and Latin America, bought
goods here, Lin said.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 20 years ago, when China's economy switched from the
rigid centralized planning system to a market-oriented mode, Yiwu
needed a new means of connecting with the outside business world.
</P>
<P>
Like other counties and small cities in south and east China,
Yiwu had no natural resources, limited farmland and increasing
numbers of surplus laborers in the rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The local government created a plan in the mid-1980s to build a
commercial hub from scratch. It started out with a free market,
where only poor-quality products were sold, accompanied by the
strong local dialects of the peddlers.
</P>
<P>
Now, the market has 28 categories of commodities with more than
30,000 varieties, all of which give a powerful boost to the local
economy.
</P>
<P>
"The commodity circulation gave impetus to the overall
development of the small city, in particular its tertiary sectors,
such as finance, transport, real estate, catering and
warehousing," said Yiwu's mayor Wei Chaoran.
</P>
<P>
Wei said Yiwu has been regarded as one of the fastest-growing
cities at the county level in China. "The per-capita income of
farmers last year reached 4,200 yuan, or ten times the figure of
ten years ago. Both the per-capita gross domestic product and
savings deposits ranked first in similar administrative localities
in Zhejiang," he said.
</P>
<P>
The speedy development in the city even caught the attention of
Chinese economists who dubbed it the "Yiwu Phenomenon."
</P>
<P>
"Yiwu has set an example for activating the economy at the
county level by building up a local commodity circulation system
that caters to the market economy," said noted economist Gao
Shangquan.
</P>
<P>
The market is now not only renowned in China, but is also
considered a springboard for foreign manufacturers seeking to
enter the vast Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
Margo Robinson, business planning director of Eastman Kodak
Co., recently toured the market to learn about film sales. "It is
incredible that a small city now runs such a big market," she told
Lin.
</P>
<P>
Years ago, Toshiba Corporation of Japan only set up regional
sales branches for its batteries in China's provincial
capitals. Now Yiwu has become its general agent in all of east
China, thanks to the reputation of the market. Sales of Toshiba
batteries in Yiwu are estimated to exceed 30 million yuan this
year.
</P>
<P>
Guests from Japan, Russia and Brazil have even suggested that
the market operators set up shops in their countries. "We're
considering the possibility," Lin said.

<P>
Istanbul, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel today called on the eight Muslim developing countries,
known as D-8 Group, to strengthen their cooperation and to
play a more energetic role in the next century.
</P>
<P>
Opening the D-8 Group summit meeting in Turkey's largest
city of Istanbul, Demirel said that the D-8 countries should
make use of the new mechanism to boost bilateral and
multilateral cooperation in various sectors among all the
countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
He noted that an increasingly interdependent world urges the
D-8 Group member countries to make joint efforts to overcome
their difficulties they are facing in economic development.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the participants in the meeting, Turkish Prime
Minister Necmettin Erbakan said that the group will make further
cooperation among the eight Muslim countries for the benefits of
their people.
</P>
<P>
He said that the formation of the D-8 Group is aimed at
helping their member countries play " a productive role" in the
international affairs.

<P>
Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani, Egyptian Prime Minister
Ganzouri, Indonesian President Suharto, Pakistani Prime Minister

<HEADLINE> Turkish Official Denies Military Withdrawal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISTANBUL, June 15 (Xinhua) -- A Turkish high-ranking official
today denied the reports that Turkey has begun to withdraw its
troops from northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry Spokesman Omer Akbel told Xinhua that
the return of some government troops to Turkey is "a garrison
relief", adding that it is only a routine move of the military.
</P>
<P>
Rejecting latest media reports concerning the alleged Turkey's
withdrawal from northern Iraq, Akbel said that the Turkish
government has no such a plan at the moment.
</P>
<P>
Some 50,000-strong Turkish troops began a cross-border military
operation on May, 14 in northern Iraq to attack the outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), which has fought a 13-year
separatist war in southeast Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's large-scale military operation to wipe out the PKK
rebels has become a sensitive subject of the Istanbul summit of
eight Muslim developing countries bloc, known as D-8 group, consisting of
Egypt, Turkey, Iran, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nigeria, Malaysia and
Indonesia. The summit opens today.
</P>
<P>
In a Saturday meeting with his Turkish counterpart Necmettin
Erbakan, Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri urged Turkey to
end its military incursion as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan, however, said that Turkey's military action is aimed
at sweeping PKK out of this region, stressing that the Turkish
government troops launched the campaign at the request of the
Iraqi Kurdistan Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
Tukey's military operation in northern Iraq has drawn sharp
criticism from the Arab world and some Western countries as well.
</P>
<P>
Local reports has said that Turkey has begun to pull part of
its troops out of the region as a gesture to appease some D-8
member states which are opposed to the Turkey's military
incursion in northern Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Reiterates Decision to Restructure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 15 (Xinhua) --Tanzanian President Benjamin
Mkapa Friday reiterated the government's decision to restructure
the National Bank of Commerce (NBC) despite public outcry to stop
the move, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The president said this during a meeting with the Director of
the World Bank, Jim Adams, assuring him that his country
remains committed to economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said that the doors were wide open for foreign investors
in a bid to strengthen the operations of the largest banking firm
in the country.
</P>
<P>
He said the government cannot bolster NBC any more, because
the government can not pump tax payers' money to back the bank up
as it did before.
</P>
<P>
The president said the past trend cannot be sustained because
the funds initially provided to NBC would now be channelled to
improving social services for the benefit of the people.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa assured the World Bank director that the restructuring
process would be warily implemented, adding that national
interest would be a priority during the exercise.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank director agreed with the president, saying that
the bank reform should ensure provision of banking services in
the rural areas where the majority lived.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, addressing commanders of the Tanzania People's
Defense Forces (TPDF) last Wednesday, President Mkapa said that
the idea to restructure NBC was first recommended by the
Nyirabu Commission in 1990.
</P>
<P>
However, the bank has been limping financially since then,
forcing the government to pump in funds to sustain it.
</P>
<P>
When restructured, the NBC will be divided into three
subsidiary banks - trade, regional and micro-finance banks - each
serving different customer groups, according to the president.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Tries to Fill Up U.S. Sugar Quota </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today authorized the Department of Agriculture to export 27,000
tons of sugar to the United States to fill up the additional U.S.
quota for this crop year, and import the same amount for domestic
consumption.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement, the presidential office said Ramos
"authorized the Department of Agriculture, through the National
Food authority (NFA), to fill up the additional United States
sugar quota of about 27,000 metric tons for the fourth quarter of
crop year 1996-1997."
</P>
<P>
Ramos directed the Department of Finance and other concerned
agencies to grant the NFA tariff-free privileges for the
importation of an equivalent volume of sugar, the office said.
</P>
<P>
The NFA or its assigned agents will export some 27,000 tons of
qualified domestically produced "B" sugar held as domestic stocks
to the United States before September 30, 1997, it said.
</P>
<P>
And the NFA or its assigned agent will import sugar from the
world market through a countertrade arrangement to satisfy
domestic market requirements.
</P>
<P>
U.S. embassy officials has said that if Manila fails to fill up
the U.S. quota this year, Washington will cancel the quota and
import sugar from other countries.
</P>
<P>
Since the Philippines opened its sugar market several years
ago, large amounts of imported sugar have poured into the country
with prices much lower than the local product. The Philippine
sugar industry has been seriously undermined by imported sugar and
could hardly meet export demands.

<HEADLINE> Car Simulators Introduced in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Car simulators are now being
adapted in Israel to teach drivers without denting bumpers or
endangering others on the road.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of the Jerusalem Post today, classes
using a driving simulator will be held in Jerusalem within the
coming months.
</P>
<P>
Eli Cohen, an entrepreneur and owner of a towing company in
Jerusalem, received a loan from the Jerusalem Center for Business
Initiatives to open the preventive-driving course project.
</P>
<P>
The simulator has a chair that looks like a driver's seat, a
steering wheel, brakes and other instruments.
</P>
<P>
The advantage of a simulator, Cohen said, was that it tests the
driver's reaction time to various situations on the road.
</P>
<P>
The computerized device also tests the driver's ability to
carry out difficult tasks, such as slowing down on a highway to
park on the soft shoulders, driving on a slippery highway or
coping with inclement weather.
</P>
<P>
If the driver is involved in an "accident," the sequence can be
screened over and over so he can learn from his mistakes.
</P>
<P>
Cohen, who has witnesses the results of bad driving as a
towing company owner, noted that the technique is useful not only
for teaching and testing driving learners, but also to teach
licensed drivers to hone their skills.

<HEADLINE> India's Ruling Front to Discuss Oil Price Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The Steering Committee of
India's ruling United Front (UF) is expected to meet on Monday to
take a final review of the vexed issue of hiking prices of
petroleum products, the Sunday Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The issue has been discussed at length at the committee's two
previous meetings recently, but no consensus could emerge as the
left parties in the 16-party UF stoutly resisted any move by the
government to raise prices of petroleum products.
</P>
<P>
The government is heavily burdened with a financial deficit
caused by subsidized prices of oil products, and favors a price
hike in oil products to reduce the deficit.
</P>
<P>
The Monday meeting will also discuss the UF's position on the
coming presidential election for which nominations close on June
23.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Exports To Sweden Doubled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's exports to Sweden rose
from 4.45 million U.S. dollars in 1991 to 8.92 million U.S.
dollars in 1996, according to a local press report today.
</P>
<P>
The report said a development program initiated by Sri Lankan
Export Development Board (EDB) and implemented under a contract
between Sri Lanka's Chamber of Commerce and the Swedish
International Development Agency contributed to the increase in
exports to Sweden.
</P>
<P>
The program was designed to develop the two export-oriented
sectors of rubber and textiles.
</P>
<P>
This year, Sri Lanka has received orders from Sweden worth
400,000 U.S. dollars, of which nearly 50 percent were from new
contacts.
</P>
<P>
The EDB has also launched similar programs in other European
markets such as Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Switzerland.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Bank, Cathay Pacific Sorry on Whale Meat Ads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Bank and Cathay
Pacific Airways Ltd. have admitted they were wrong to promote
whale-eating in advertising holidays to Japan, according to local
English-language newspaper South China Morning Post here today.
</P>
<P>
The joint Hong Kong Bank-Cathay Pacific promotion for credit
card holders - "All-Inclusive Fun in the Land of Rising Sun" -
told potential customers that local attractions included "Osaka
style cuisine such as sushi and whales."
</P>
<P>
Conservationists accused Cathay Pacific of hypocrisy for
promoting its green image while encouraging people to eat whales.
</P>
<P>
Whaling some species is permitted in Japan for research but
animal welfare campaigners say it is cruel to allow rare species
to end up in restaurants.
</P>
<P>
International Fund for Animal Welfare China director Jill
Robinson urged Hong Kong Bank and Cathay Pacific to retract the
words.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Bank head of public affairs Michael Broadbent said
the company's usual checks and balances had failed.
</P>
<P>
"We just missed it. Obviously we are aware of the sensitivity
- it is a good old fashioned mistake," he said. "We apologize,"
he was quoted by the newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
Cathay Pacific spokesman Kwan Chuk-Fai said the "minor
oversight" was the result of copying a Japanese travel brochure.
</P>
<P>
"It is unfortunate and I hope it won't happen again. It is
definitely not the intention to promote people going to the city
for that purpose," said Charlie Stewart-Cox, a spokesman of the
Swire Group, of which Cathay Pacific is a member.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Italy said today it won support from
France in its drive to write key EU reforms into a revised
Maastricht Treaty due to be approved at the end of the two-day
Amsterdam Summit on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A French diplomat Hubert Vedrine had told the Italian Foreign
Minister Lamberto Dini that France backed Italy's efforts to
secure "substantive results, especially in the field of
institutional reform" in Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
The 15 EU leaders are expected to give final approval to a
revised draft of the Maastricht Treaty which was drawn up by the
Netherlands -- the country holding the rotating six-month EU
presidency -- and included some suggestions by Dini.
</P>
<P>
The draft proposed cutting the size of the EU commission to one
commissioner per country, reweighting votes to give bigger
countries more say and putting an end to veto rights by member
countries over EU policies.
</P>
<P>
Some member countries, notably Britain, opposed an end to veto
rights and small and large countries wrangled over the proposal
of reweighting votes.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Not to Impose Embargo on Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian President
Fernando Henrique Cardoso said Friday his government will not
impose any embargo on Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Cardoso made the remarks while talking with visiting vice
president of Cuban Council of State Carlos Lage and Cuban
ambassador to Brazil Ramon Sanchez.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Congress passed the notorious Helms-Burton law in
March, 1996, tightening the rein of embargo on Cuba. The law
requested the U.S. government to impose sanctions on foreign
companies investing in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The international community had strongly urged the U.S. to end
its three-decade-long embargo against Cuba, and to stop imposing
its laws on other countries.
</P>
<P>
Cardoso said the Brazilian government will insist on its
foreign policy of not imposing embargo on Cuba.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Experts Helping Develop Key Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Foreigners are working for more
than 130 key State projects and about 500,000 foreign-funded
enterprises, today's China Daily reports.
</P>
<P>
Of the 80,000 foreign experts in China every year, about 25,000
work for key State projects and 30,000 for foreign-funded
enterprises. They install equipment and provide technical guidance
and managerial consulting.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, imported technology and equipment approved by the
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation reached 13.1
billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
About ten percent, or 1.3 billion dollars, is for technical
services including foreign experts. Although the figure seems
large, the direct and indirect benefits are worth the price, the
paper quoted Miao Mantian, a division chief of the State Bureau of
Foreign Experts Affairs' economic and technical experts
department, as saying.
</P>
<P>
With help of foreign experts, some key State projects began
operating on time or ahead of schedule, saving money.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, China has learned advanced technology and managerial
experience and has gained trained domestic professionals, Miao
said.
</P>
<P>
Miao said that the State Bureau of Foreign Experts Affairs will
work out regulations on management of foreign experts this year,
and will select 100 key State projects and 100 foreign enterprises
to improve management of foreign experts.
</P>
<P>
Last August, the bureau designated Hubei and Sichuan provinces,
Shanghai, Qingdao, and the China National Offshore Oil Corp. to
pilot management of foreign economic experts. And the work will be
expanded on the basis of experience, Miao said.

<HEADLINE> Yuan Hits Two-Year High Against Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese yuan hit a two-year
high against the US dollar twice in May on the Shanghai-based
national interbank foreign exchange market.
</P>
<P>
The renminbi surged to a 8.2913 high against the green-back on
May 27, the highest closing price since May 18, 1995 when the yuan
ended at 8.2892, today's "China Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
The yuan has been rising slowly but continuously for more than
two years.
</P>
<P>
It closed at 8.2924 on May 30, slightly up from 8.2947 on May
5, the first trading day in May.
</P>
<P>
"The renminbi has been rising steadily for more than one year,
which is manily due to the substantial trade surplus and the surge
of foreign exchange reserves," a Bank of China dealer said.
</P>
<P>
China posted a 10.29 billion US dollars trade surplus in the
first four months of this year, a dramatic increase from 6.71
billion US dollars in the first three months.
</P>
<P>
China's foreign exchange reserve, however, stood at 115 billion
US dollars at the end of April.
</P>
<P>
Fewer interventions by the central bank also helped the yuan
soar to a two-year high.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe the yuan will continue its upward trend in the
near future because of the over-supply of dollars in the domestic
market.
</P>
<P>
The continued inflation decline strengthened the yuan, the
paper said. Statistics show that China's bench-mark retail price
inflation rose moderately by 0.8 percent year-on-year in
May.

<HEADLINE> Sino-overseas Gold Mine Cooperative Project Going Ahead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 15 (Xinhua) -- A Sino-foreign gold mine
cooperative project is gaining progress, as two overseas investors
involved have been required to present their prefeasibility
reports by the China National Gold Corp (CNGC) before August 10.
</P>
<P>
The US-based Newmont and Australia-based Broken Hill
Proprietary Ltd Co. have long been interested in the Lannigou Gold
Mine cooperative project in southwestern Guizhou Province, today's
Business Weekly of China Daily quoted a CNGC official as saying.
</P>
<P>
China began in 1993 to open low-grade and metallurgically
refractory gold mines to foreign investment on a trial basis.
</P>
<P>
CNGC has provided the two companies with the geological
materials of the mine, whose main vein has a proven gold reserve
of about 60 tons.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign investors are also interested in a larger-scale
cooperation by exploring and exploiting the area surrounding the
mine. So CNGC provided them with all the geological materials
currently available of the surrounding area.
</P>
<P>
But the materials are far from enough for the investors to make
a decision to develop the project. And CNGC is looking forward to
further cooperation.
</P>
<P>
China produced 120 tons of gold last year, and gold production
is likely to approach 130 tons this year, said Ai Dacheng, deputy
director of the Gold Bureau's production section of the Ministry
of Metallurgical Industry.
</P>
<P>
This projected output will make China the fifth largest gold
producer in the world, Ai said. China came after South Africa, the
United States, Australia, Canada, and Russian last year in gold
production.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's energy needs to reach three billion BEO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's needs for primary
energy will increase from 494 million barrels equivalent of oil
(BEO) at the start of the Second Long-Term Development Plan in
1994/95 to 3.0 billion BEO by 2018/19, a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
"Such an increase is based on an assumption that during the
Second Long-Term Development Plan (from 1994 to 2019), Indonesia
will have an average of seven percent economic growth and 0.7
percent population growth," Mines and Energy Minister Ida Bagus
Sudjana said in Semarang, Central Java, on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According reports reaching here today, Sudjana said that by
2018/19, the country's population will exceed the 250 million mark
and the country's per capita primary energy consumption is
expected to reach 11.8 BEO per annum.
</P>
<P>
"This means that primary energy consumption by 2019 will be
five-fold compared with that in 1994 which stood at 2.5 barrels
equivalent of oil," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that oil and natural gas remain the main suppliers of
the country's increasing energy needs.
</P>
<P>
He also said the country's consumption of oil fuels as sources
of energy has been steadily declining from 94.6 percent of primary
energy in 1970 to 73.5 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Despite declining in the percentage, the consumption of oil
fuels has been increasing in volume from 36 million BEO in 1970 to
271 million BEO in 1996, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Such a situation was mainly caused by the increasing economic
growth rate and higher people mobilization," Sudjana said.
</P>
<P>
He said the country's needs for oil fuels will continue to
increase in the future if Indonesia was unable to develop
alternative energy sources.

<HEADLINE> Hall of HK in Great Hall of People Completed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 15 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin recently
wrote an inscription to mark the completion of the Hall of Hong
Kong of the Great Hall of the People, which will be officially
open after July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
He wrote, "Carry out the principle of one country, two systems,
and maintain the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong." The
inscription has been carved on a giant Oriental screen in the main
reception room of the Hall of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Located in the southwest part of the Great Hall of the People,
the Hall of Hong Kong covers an area of 1,728 square meters, and
is the largest of all the 32 halls representing China's provinces,
autonomous regions or municipalities there.
</P>
<P>
The hall has two parts: a main reception room and a
multi-functional room. An 818-square-meter garden is on the roof.
</P>
<P>
The design of two entrances and two rooms of the Hall of Hong
Kong is unique in the Great Hall of the People, as the
significance of the return of Hong Kong is reflected in the
architectural details.
</P>
<P>
An embroidered tapestry will be placed on the wall of the
reception room, depicting Victoria Harbor at night. In the
corridor outside the multi-functional room is a group of
sculptures of white dolphins, symbols of celebration of the return
of Hong Kong. The copper mural in the multi-functional room
reflects the 100-year changes since the Opium War.
</P>
<P>
"To come here seems to return home," said a Hong Kong visitor
when viewing the hall during construction.
</P>
<P>
The building of the Hall of Hong Kong caught the attention of
tens of millions of people, and it has also been a dream of the
Hong Kong compatriots for years.
</P>
<P>
Chairmen of various terms of the National People's Congress
Standing Committee, Peng Zhen, Wan Li, and Qiao Shi, all
emphasized the importance of the establishment of the Hall of Hong
Kong in the Great Hall of the People.
</P>
<P>
The Great Hall of the People is the site of China's important
political and diplomatic activities. Late Premier Zhou Enlai said
that each administrative region of China will have a hall in it.
Therefore, the new Hall of Hong Kong is an important symbol for
the return of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The proposal to establish the Hall of Hong Kong was first made
in 1985 by Fei Yimin, a Hong Kong deputy to the National People's
Congress. During the National People's Congress last year, Henry
Fok Ying-tung took the lead to form a group that would carry out
the preparatory work for the hall.
</P>
<P>
After soliciting opinions from experts from both Hong Kong and
the inland areas, the project was started last June. During the
construction, dozens of alterations have been made to the design,
in order to fully reflect the characteristics of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Nan, director of the Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch,
said that as Hong Kong is a special administrative region, the
design of the Hall of Hong Kong should be unique.

BANGKOK, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Thailand and Myanmar are to
formulate common policies to curb the re-emergence and spread of
infectious diseases that are seriously affecting both countries.

Thai and Myanmar health officials will hold a meeting next
month to consider cross-border health problems, according to an

malaria, tuberculosis, meningococcus meningitis, filariasis from
the Myanmar border area Thailand. Some of these illnesses had
been considered eradicated in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Organizers hope the meeting will come up with a concrete joint
plan for the prevention and elimination of these illnesses, the

</P>
<P>
The plan is likely to include the establishment of joint

<HEADLINE> China's Land Freeze Hurts No Foreign-funded Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Foreign-funded projects won't be
affected by China's one-year land freeze on farmland requisitions
for non-agricultural purposes, today's China Daily quoted a land
administration official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Pan Mingcai, director of the construction land department of
the State Land Administration (SLA), said that overseas-backed
projects are encouraged to use idle land, such as unused land in
development zones.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investors are also encouraged to requisition wasteland
and shoaly land. And another way for them to get land is to
cooperate with Chinese companies who can invest their land in
cooperation, Pan said.
</P>
<P>
Projects that occupy farmland must get approval from the State
Council or wait for one year for the freeze to be lifted. "The
freeze is not to hold up construction projects but to promote
proper and efficient use of idle land," he said.
</P>
<P>
The freeze is expected to force non-agricultural construction
projects including foreign-funded ones to use other alternatives,
but won't apply to key State construction projects, and the
Comfortable Housing Project, which aims to ease housing
difficulties of urban families, the official said.
</P>
<P>
About 466,000 ha of farmland are occupied every year, but much
left unused. The problem is worse in some development zones.
</P>
<P>
During the freeze, SLA will strive to improve land management
and legislation to stop the sharp reduction of farmland.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Exporters Need Credit Insurance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 15 (Xinhua) -- China needs to increase export
credit insurance services to protect exporters' interests, as the
country's foreign trade is soaring, today's China Daily quoted a
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) economist as saying.
</P>
<P>
Only 1.1 percent of exports are guaranteed by export credit
insurance, and the insured exporters account for 2.7 percent of
the foreign trade companies, said Yu Lixin of CASS's Institute of
Finance and Trade Economics.
</P>
<P>
Some enterprises can't collect their money quickly after
exporting, resulting in the loss of several hundred million US
dollars annually. "It shows China's export credit insurance is in
its infancy, but it also indicates its huge potential for
expansion," Yu said.
</P>
<P>
China's foreign trade scored 289.9 billion US dollars last
year, and is expected to hit 310 billion US dollars this year,
demanding development of export credit insurance.
</P>
<P>
"To maintain the high growth, the country's foreign trade must
keep in line with international practices," he said.
</P>
<P>
By insuring the exports or fund-raising for exports, the
insured exporters can be compensated if they aren't paid by the
buyers, as the insurance is a financial practice generally
supported by governments.
</P>
<P>
The People's Insurance (Property) Company of China (PICC) and
Export-Import Bank of China are entrusted by the government to
conduct export insurance services.

<HEADLINE> Nicaragua Concerned With U.S. Resumption of Deportation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The Nicaraguan government today
expressed its concern over the United States' decision to resume
its deportation of Nicaraguans illegally residing there.
</P>
<P>
"The government of the Nicaraguan Republic expects the United
States government will use its discretional authority to stop the
deportations of Nicaraguans until the Miami Federal Court issues a
final determination on the case," the Nicaraguan Foreign Relations
Ministry said in a communique.
</P>
<P>
Federal Court of Miami Judge James Lawrence King failed to
extend the term of the judicial provision that impeded the
deportation of Nicaraguans, thus signaling the resumption of the
deportation.
</P>
<P>
But King said that is not a final decision.
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua requested the U.S. immigration authorities to listen
to King, who said he expected the immigration authorities not to
start deportations immediately.
</P>
<P>
The communique said it "sees with concern the fact that three
Nicaraguan citizens, deported by the United States, will arrive in
Managua tomorrow."
</P>
<P>
"The Nicaraguan government is confident the U.S. government, on
the basis of the excellent bilateral relations of the two
countries, will use its discretional administrative power to find
a positive and definitive solution to the thousands of Nicaraguans
who found their second home in that country," the communique
said.

<HEADLINE> Real Clinch Spanish Title in Style </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Real Madrid won their 27th
Spanish league title in fine style on Saturday with an
impressive 3-1 victory over reigning champions Atletico.
</P>
<P>
Needing just a point, Real tore their neighbours apart with
first half goals from Raul Gonzalez and Fernando Hierro. Predrag
Mijatovic added the third shortly after the break.
</P>
<P>
Atletico coach Radomir Antic made a triple-substitution
after Mijatovic's goal and was quickly rewarded with a goal from
former Real striker Juan Eduardo Esnaider.
</P>
<P>
After the match, Real president Lorenzo Sanz took the
opportunity to announce that Tenerife coach Jupp Heynckes will
almost certainly take the place of the Italian Capello, who is
returning to his former club AC Milan next season, to occupy the
hot seat at the Bernabeu stadium.
</P>
<P>
In the 36th minute of the match, the Real teenager Raul
Gonzalez controlled a difficult cross from the left and worked his
way into position before unleashing a powerful shot into the net.
</P>
<P>
Just before half-time Real went two-up when Atletico goalie
Molina was left standing by a free-kick from Hierro that caught a
deflection.
</P>
<P>
The game was sealed in the 56th minute when Clarence Seedorf
sliced open a sleepy Atletico defence before feeding the ball to
Mijatovic to score.

<P>
BUENOS AIRES, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Argentina scored twice in the
last five minutes to beat Chile 2-0 in yet another uninspiring
group A game in the Copa America Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Argentina appeared set to complete a second game without
scoring until the 85th minute when Sergio Berti was freed on the
left of the Chilean penalty, in what appeared an offside position,
and scored with a powerful low drive.
</P>
<P>
Two minutes later, Marcelo Gallardo secured Argentina's win
with a second goal.
</P>
<P>
Both countries have brought below-strength teams, saving their
top players instead for World Cup qualifiers.
</P>
<P>
The result left Argentina and Ecuador on four points, Paraguay
on three and Chile, who have not scored a goal, on none with one
game each left to play. None of the teams have either qualified
for the quarter-finals or been eliminated.

<HEADLINE> Schumacher Grabs Pole Position </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Michael Schumacher upstaged local
hero Jacques Villeneuve as he grabbed pole position for Sunday's
Canadian Formula One Grand Prix.
</P>
<P>
The two-time world champion piloted his Ferrari on the limit
during Saturday's qualifying session to wrest the advantage from
his arch-rival with one of the greatest qualifying drives of his
career.
</P>
<P>
The German claimed his 15th career pole in clocking one minute
18.095 seconds, just 0.13 seconds faster than Villeneuve.
</P>
<P>
The 26-year-old Canadian faces an uphill task after seeing
Schumacher surge late to rob him of what would have been his sixth
pole in seven races this season.
</P>
<P>
Villenueve seemed set to take the crucial place at the head of
the grid late on, only to be denied when the session was
re-started after rookie Alexander Wurz -- deputising for the ill
Gerhard Berger -- crashed his Benetton-Renault.
</P>
<P>
The pacesetting duo were on the track together in the final
minutes with Schumacher almost crashing into the perimeter wall as
he came round the final corner before scorching down the straight
to just dip under Villeneuve's time.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian Rubens Barrichello was third-fastest in a
Stewart-Ford with Heinz-Harald Frentzen of Germany fourth-quickest
in the second Williams-Renault after being fastest in Friday's
free practice session.
</P>
<P>
Villeneuve, who has won three of the six races so far this
season, leads the world championship with 30 points going into
Sunday's race. Schumacher, a winner only once but a points-scorer
in five of his six starts, has 27 points.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's race will be over 69 laps of the 4.421 Circuit Gilles
Villeneuve -- named in honor of Jacques Villeneueve's late father,
who died during practice for the Belgian Grand Prix at Zolder 15
years ago -- a total of 305.04km.

ROME, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Turkish weightlifter Halil Mutlu
claimed two gold medals and the host country dominated in the
swimming pool Saturday as the 13th Mediterranean Games got
underway.
</P>
<P>
Mutlu, an Olympic champion and world record holder, won both
the snatch and the clean-and-jerk in the 54-kilogram (119-pound)
division to take the first medals awarded in this southern port
city.
</P>
<P>
At the pool, Italians came away with half of the eight golds
and 10 medals overall.
</P>
<P>
These Games, the largest ever with nearly 3,500 athletes from
21 countries competing in 27 sports - all records - are somewhat
of a litmus test of Italy's ability to organize a big sporting
event. Rome is one of five finalists for the 2004 Summer
Olympics, and 21 IOC members are here.

<P>
WARSAW, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Poland breezed past Georgia 4-1 in
their World Cup European zone group two qualifier on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Poland, who stay third in the group eight points behind
second-placed England, made the most of their opportunities to
score their first goals in four World Cup qualifiers this year,
despite going a goal behind in the 24th minute.
</P>
<P>
Georgia striker Shota Arveladje found the net from an acute
angle but Poland struck back quickly with goals in the 33rd and
35th minutes by Adam Ledwon and Miroslaw Trzeciak.
</P>
<P>
Captain Krzysztof Bukalski added a penalty in the 70th minute
and Krzysztof Nowak tapped in a cross a minute from the end to
complete the scoring.
</P>
<P>
Poland fielded a drastically reshaped squad in their first game
under head coach Krzysztof Pawlak, who took over from Antoni
Piechniczek following Poland's 2-0 loss against England last
month, which ended their chances of advancing to the finals in
France.
