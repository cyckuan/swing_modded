   NEW YORK _ Ali Abiola of St. Peter's High School in Staten
Island starred at the 45th annual Bishop Loughlin Games in
Manhattan Saturday, setting a meet record in the boys 1,000 meters
and anchoring St. Peter's record-breaking 3,200-meter relay.
</P>
<P>
   Abiola's time of 2 minutes 31.07 seconds in the 1,000 meters and
his 1:53 anchor leg on the relay, which set a meet record of
7:56.69, earned him the most valuable athlete award in the largest
indoor high school meet in the country. More than 4,000 athletes
from 181 Eastern schools participated at the Armory Track and Field
Center in upper Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   St. Peter's finished second in the boys team scoring to
Philadelphia's Roman Catholic, 26-19. Lawrence of Long Island was
third at 18.
</P>
<P>
   The boys division produced two other meet records. Anthony
Ewers, a junior from Lawrence, lowered the 300-meter dash standard
to 34.66 seconds, and Campus Magnet of Queens posted a 1:30.28
while winning the 800-meter relay. Jason Morgan, Ewers' senior
teammate, missed the 600-meter mark by two-tenths of a second while
winning in 1:21.50.
</P>
<P>
   In girls events, which continued Saturday night, Danielle Jelley
of Clark High School in Westbury, N.Y., rallied to win 1,000 meters
in 3:00.61, Pilar Marini of St. Anthony's in Huntington, N.Y., was
first in the 3,200 meters at 11:15.07, Robin Mortel of A. P.
Randolph of Manhattan was the winner of the 600 in 1:36.10 and
Jennifer Donovan of Half Hollow Hills, N.Y., took the mile in
5:11.45.

 ARIZONA'S SENATORS MINDFUL OF CONSEQUENCES (For use by N.Y. Times
News Service
 clients)  
 By JEFF BARKER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One faces re-election in 2000, and the other is
pondering a run for president.
</P>
<P>
   For Arizona's U.S. senators, the timing of the impeachment trial
of President Bill Clinton could have fateful political
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   The trial is to start in January, just as Sen. John McCain is
expected to be nearing an announcement on whether to seek the GOP
presidential nomination. His Republican colleague, Sen. Jon Kyl, is
among the one-third of the Senate up for re-election in two years.
</P>
<P>
   Although many lawmakers assert that impeachment is a vote of
conscience, it carries political risks regardless of which way they
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans have expressed distaste for the entire
impeachment procedure, creating a potential backlash against those
who prolong it by rejecting an alternative, such as a strongly
worded censure.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's most vocal critics are certain to lash out at any
solution that seems to let him off the hook.
</P>
<P>
   Because of their status as future ``jurors,'' neither Kyl nor
McCain would speculate on how they or their colleagues would vote.
</P>
<P>
   But in interviews they dropped some hints about their thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Kyl appears to be in a camp with Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott, R-Miss. Both would like the trial to follow its course;
neither seems inclined to endorse a proposal by former Senate
Majority Leader Robert Dole, R-Kan., to wrap up impeachment in the
first week of January with a toughly worded condemnation of Clinton
rather than a trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that we ought to follow the constitutional procedure
wherever that takes us _ conclude the matter in that way,'' Kyl
said before the House vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, there are a lot of things you can do even in the middle
of a trial, obviously. You can dismiss the charges, technically. It
is even possible to go through this without having an actual vote
at the end of the process, although I think that (a vote) is
desirable.''
</P>
<P>
   Kyl disagreed with Clinton backers who argue that perjury
involving a sexual affair falls short of an impeachable offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, the most important point here is that perjury destroys
truth, which is at the heart of our judicial system. This is a
system which everybody is willing to put their faith in, even to
submit their life to the judgment of 12 people that they have never
met before because they know the system is fair,'' Kyl said. ``If
truth begins to suffer because we don't punish perjury, the entire
system could fail.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain is more of a maverick than Kyl and has bucked the GOP on
some big votes. For those reasons, McCain's vote will doubtless be
more closely scrutinized.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is on a preliminary list compiled by University of
Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato of Republican senators
who might digress from the party line against Clinton. Also
included were Sens. John Chaffee of Rhode Island, Susan Collins and
Olympia Snowe of Maine, and Jim Jeffords of Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've shown an independence in the past and they come from
states _ McCain the exception _ that are moderate and do not reward
Republicans for being loyal to the party,'' Sabato said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, a close friend of Dole's, McCain would not reject the
former senator's suggestion for censure out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pay very careful attention to Senator Dole, because I have
the utmost respect and affection for him,'' McCain said before
leaving for vacation a few days ago. &QL;

ARIZONA LEARNED THE HARD WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service
 clients)  
 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Calls for resignation ring through the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   The beleaguered chief executive stands defiant, declaring
himself a victim of a political railroad job.
</P>
<P>
   For Americans, it is now a painful reality.
</P>
<P>
   But for Arizonans, it happened 10 years ago in one of the most
bizarre events in state history. The nation watched as then-Gov.
Evan Mecham, a Republican, fell under the weight of charges of
obstructing justice and misusing public funds.
</P>
<P>
   Now, America is about to experience the political turmoil
Arizona went through in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The business of the state ground to a halt at that point in
time,'' Attorney General Grant Woods said. ``It's hard to imagine
that won't be the case in Washington today.''
</P>
<P>
   The legacy of Mecham's political rise in 1987 and fall a year
later was a political war that ended in the downfall of the House
speaker, Joe Lane; the Senate president, Carl Kunasek; and other
Republican leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Now the country is facing a similar situation but with higher
stakes: the fate of President Clinton and the public's confidence
in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public will question why we put the nation through this if
he's not going to be removed,'' Woods said.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Tom Freestone, a Republican who was a Maricopa County
supervisor during Mecham's brief reign, said Republicans in
Congress ``better understand there's going to be an aftermath.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a price that's going to be paid, regardless of what
you do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Politically, there are few things Mecham, a hard-line Republican
former car dealer, and Clinton, a former law professor, have in
common.
</P>
<P>
   But now, both have come together in the history books: Mecham is
the last governor in America to be impeached, and Clinton is the
first president to be impeached in 130 years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Mecham was convicted and removed from office in a
Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Clinton finds himself in the middle of an equally grave
dilemma, although he, unlike Mecham, has strong support within his
own party.
</P>
<P>
   One thing seems certain: America is about to undergo a kind of
political turmoil that Arizonans experienced 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Kunasek, now a member of the Arizona Corporation Commission,
said there might be an upside to be taken from Arizona's
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``In retrospect, did it paralyze Arizona? Temporarily perhaps,
but the long-term effect was the stabilization of government,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we don't have right now. We have a crippled
president whose credibility is always going to be questioned. It's
going to hurt his effectiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., said those who predict a paralysis in
government only give impetus to calls for Clinton's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will only accelerate calls for the president to resign
and spare the country this dire result,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kyl, though, does not believe the predictions of paralysis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing fine apparently in the operation in Iraq,'' he
said. ``The stock market actually went up yesterday (Friday).
People are out Christmas shopping. The Supreme Court will get along
just fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not something we should fear as a nation.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kyl, who lived through Arizona's impeachment battle, also
said: ``It is neither in the administration's or public's best
interest to have a long, drawn-out trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public doesn't want to drag it out . . . and it's a
political loser for us.''
</P>
<P>
   For Kyl and other senators, there is now no turning back.
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment trial will run its course, and then everyone
will know just what price is to be paid. &QL;

HISPANICS, BLACKS RALLY TO CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service
 clients)  
 By JULIE AMPARANO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most African-Americans and Hispanics consider President Clinton
a champion for their cause, and they're planning to stand by their
man.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the impeachment proceedings ``wasteful partisan drama,''
Rep. Ed Pastor, D-Ariz., voted against it.
</P>
<P>
   Support for Clinton is so strong among African-Americans that
Nobel Prize-winning author Toni Morrison rallied to Clinton's
defense and called him ``our first Black president.''
</P>
<P>
   Voicing the support for President Clinton in the 17-member
Congressional Hispanic Caucus at a White House meeting, Rep.
Esteban Torres, D-Calif., had these words: ``We stand with the
president to the end.''
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for their support, they say, goes beyond
partisanship. Black and Hispanic leaders say Clinton has done more
for them than any other president.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Clinton has worked to end racial disparities in
health care. The Clinton administration granted funds to establish
the Office of Minority Health Research and Alternative Medicine at
the National Institutes of Health.
</P>
<P>
   The president also has placed more time and money into civil
rights enforcement than has been allocated in the past 12 years.
More funding was provided to improve coordination among the
government's civil rights agencies and the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Clinton promoted a national conversation on race
relations in the United States. As part of the initiative, he
established a Race Advisory Board, which traveled around the
country listening to cases of bias and looking for ways to end
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks and Hispanics also have heralded Clinton for opposing
Republican-led efforts to wipe out affirmative action and for
defending bilingual education.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps most important to many ethnic leaders is Clinton's
record on Hispanic and Black appointments.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has one of the most diverse Cabinets and administrations
in history. African-Americans and Hispanics have been placed in
many non-traditional positions. A few include Rodney Slater as
secretary of Transportation, Bill Richardson as secretary of
Energy, Togo West as secretary of Veterans Affairs, and Maria
Echaveste, deputy White House chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, about 13 percent of Clinton administration appointees
are African-Americans, twice as many as any previous
administration, and about 8 percent have been Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, many believe Clinton can do more. Raul Yzaguirre,
president of the National Council of La Raza, has called on the
president to make more favorable appointments.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Black and Hispanic leaders say Clinton has done more than
his predecessors and certainly more than his opponents in the 1992
and '96 elections would have.
</P>
<P>
   For those reasons, Blacks and Hispanics stand behind Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In his re-election bid in 1996, Blacks and Hispanics played a
big role in the Clinton victory. Clinton received 88 percent of the
Black vote and slightly more than 70 percent of the Hispanic vote.
</P>
<P>
   A poll by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press
released just before independent counsel Kenneth Starr's report was
issued showed Clinton with an 88 percent job approval rating among
African-Americans, compared with a 61 percent approval rating among
Whites.
</P>
<P>
   The poll didn't provide a breakdown for Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   For many Hispanics and Blacks, their support goes beyond
programs and appointments. The impeachment movement and Starr's
investigation become an issue of fairness.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's investigation of Clinton's sexual affair with Monica
Lewinsky reminds many of J. Edgar Hoover's infamous investigation
of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s sex life in the early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``For those of us with a history in the civil rights movement,
this is an issue of fundamental fairness,'' Rep. Sheila Jackson
Lee, D-Texas, has said. &QL;

GAINOUS' LAST-SECOND LAYUP LIFTS TCU TO WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPRINGFIELD, Mo. _ In his back yard, maybe 10 years ago, TCU
forward Marquise Gainous used to practice for a moment just like
last night's.
</P>
<P>
   The game was tied, only seconds remained and he had the ball in
his hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``A layup,'' Gainous said. ``You always want to shoot a layup, a
game-winning layup.''
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what he had, the ball rolling off his fingers and
in with 0.2 seconds remaining to give TCU a 71-69 victory against
Southwest Missouri State last night in front of 9,114 screaming
fans at Hammons Student Center.
</P>
<P>
   The previous 39 minutes, 59.8 seconds had been a strange
back-and-forth game that led to TCU (10-2) in need of a shot at the
buzzer to win a game it had never trailed.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest Missouri's Allen Phillips buried a pair of free throws
with 10 seconds remaining to bring the Bears even for the first
time since the opening tip.
</P>
<P>
   TCU had a timeout remaining but declined to take it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's a scramble situation, we're good,'' Horned Frogs coach
Billy Tubbs said. ``That's our game policy. We don't want to give
them the opportunity to set up their defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs couldn't get the ball into Prince Fowler, so Shannon
Long dribbled to halfcourt. He then passed to Ryan Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only looked up once, the moment I got the ball, and I saw
there were five seconds remaining,'' Carroll said. ``I just figured
that I'd penetrate, get fouled, make something happen. Then I saw
Marquise just standing there by himself.''
</P>
<P>
   The pass went down to Gainous with about two seconds remaining.
He said he didn't have any idea how much time was left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just shot,'' said Gainous, who led the Frogs with 18 points.
``It feels good to sneak out of here with a win.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sneak'' provides a pretty good assessment of a game that TCU
seemed to dominate but never seemed to control.
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs outshot the Bears 56.4 percent to 35.3. Southwest
Missouri (7-2) especially struggled on 3-pointers, going 5-of-22.
The one place the Bears outshot the Frogs was from the free-throw
line.
</P>
<P>
   TCU attempted only four free throws, including two misses in the
final 45 seconds. Southwest Missouri shot 18, leaving TCU in foul
trouble all game. Frogs preseason All-American Lee Nailon fouled
out with 3:37 remaining and a season-low 10 points.
</P>
<P>
   None of this had Tubbs too pleased.
</P>
<P>
   He got a technical foul during the game for arguing with
officials and got in a couple of jabs after it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bye John, bye Jerry, bye Ed,'' Tubbs said, waving to officials
John Huggins, Jerry Petro and Ed Schumer as they left the building.
``Hope you make it back in the Big Eight someday.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the foul disparity and a game-high 26 points from Bears
big man Danny Moore, TCU had a seven-point lead with 1:14
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs had a two-point lead and the ball with 35.6 seconds
remaining. They immediately committed a turnover, and Phillips hit
the two free throws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure looked like it, didn't it?'' Tubbs said of the chances
for overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Said Carroll: ``If we had gone to overtime, we'd have lost.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd was Southwest Missouri's largest since 1992 and 10th
largest ever. When the Bears tied it, the closest they had been all
night, the crowd was was so loud that Carroll said he could hardly
hear himself think.
</P>
<P>
   If he had been thinking, he probably would have taken the shot
himself.
</P>
<P>
   He, too, had been a youngster once. His back yard had also
provided practice for a moment just like this.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the same except I passed instead of shot,'' Carroll
said. ``Hey, all that matters is that the good guys win.''

THIS BASKET WAS FULL OF MIRACLES
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
As the clock ticked down to 6, 5, 4 seconds left, Coach Rodger Bur
row began going over the speech he'd deliver in the locker room.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``We'd taken a timeout with 8 seconds left, down by two
points,'' he said. ``I told my point guard, who was having a great
night, to dribble coast-to-coast and take a shot. But he got
blocked and passed off, and the ball was getting bob bled around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I imagined telling the boys how proud I was of them for
getting close. It was a great learning experience. That was my
speech. The fact we'd actually made a game of it was one miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't dare ask for another.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen years ago, Burrow moved to the small town of San Manuel,
northeast of Tucson, with the idea of staying a year, maybe two.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before I knew it, I fell in love with the community,'' he
said. He's now a teacher, coach and athletic director at San Manuel
Middle School.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 14, his eighth-grade boys bas ketball team played at
home against the Hayden Lobos. In front of his players, Burrow
spoke of rising to the occasion, of fulfilling dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Realistically, he expected a nightmare. &QL; 
LESSONS TO LEARN
</P>
<P>
   The week before the game, six of Bur row's players were declared
ineligible be cause of grades. He filled out the roster with
seventh-graders. Then, the day of the game, he learned that two of
his remain ing eighth-graders had broken team rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a terrible blow to the team, but we had to suspend
them, too,'' he said. ``There are lessons about behavior and
consequences boys this age must learn.''
</P>
<P>
   If not, they may grow up and act like NBA players.
</P>
<P>
   Only one of the Lions starters was left to play. For a time,
Burrow considered forfeiting the game, but the Hayden coach wanted
to play. With all the distractions and the new players, Burrow
forgot to turn in an official lineup card before the opening
tip-off.
</P>
<P>
   The whistle sounded just after the game began and Hayden was
awarded 10 technical foul shots. They made six.
</P>
<P>
   ``From there,'' Burrow said, ``things went even further
downhill.''
</P>
<P>
   The visiting team ran up a 24-6 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was imagining what I could say to these kids to turn this
disaster into some thing positive,'' Burrow said, ``when they
started coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   His lone eighth-grade starter, Brandon Buzan, hit a
three-pointer. Then he hit an other. Then he made a steal, drove
for a layup, made it, got fouled and made the foul shot. By
halftime the Lions were within six.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning of the second half Hayden went on another
run,'' Burrow said. ``They maintained what seemed like a steady
lead of around 10.''
</P>
<P>
   Burrow's seventh graders began gain ing confidence, however, and
the score got closer. With 20 seconds left, Buzan was fouled and
made both shots. The Lions were behind by only one.
</P>
<P>
   It stayed that way until 8 seconds were left, when a Hayden
player was fouled and made one of two shots. The lead was 2. &QL; 
VALIANT ATTEMPT
</P>

though, and passed off. After getting batted around, the ball
landed in the hands of 5-foot-2 Brian Kaufman, a seventh-grader,

 THIS BASKET WAS FULL OF
 MIRACLES
 (For use by N.Y. Times News Service
 clients) 
 By E.J. MONTINI 
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  As the clock ticked down to 6, 5, 4
seconds left, Coach Rodger Burrow began going over the speech he'd
deliver in the locker room.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``We'd taken a timeout with 8 seconds left, down by two
points,'' he said. ``I told my point guard, who was having a great
night, to dribble coast-to-coast and take a shot. But he got
blocked and passed off, and the ball was getting bobbled around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I imagined telling the boys how proud I was of them for
getting close. It was a great learning experi ence. That was my
speech. The fact we'd actually made a game of it was one miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't dare ask for another.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen years ago, Burrow moved to the small town of San Manuel,
northeast of Tucson, with the idea of staying a year, maybe two.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before I knew it, I fell in love with the community,'' he
said. He's now a teacher, coach and athletic director at San Manuel
Middle School.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 14, his eighth-grade boys basketball team played at home
against the Hayden Lobos. In front of his players, Burrow spoke of
rising to the occasion, of fulfilling dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Realistically, he expected a night mare. LESSONS TO LEARN
</P>
<P>
   The week before the game, six of Burrow's players were declared
ineli gible because of grades. He filled out the roster with
seventh-graders. Then, the day of the game, he learned that two of
his remaining eighth-graders had broken team rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a terrible blow to the team, but we had to suspend
them, too,'' he said. ``There are lessons about behavior and
consequences boys this age must learn.''
</P>
<P>
   If not, they may grow up and act like NBA players.
</P>
<P>
   Only one of the Lions starters was left to play. For a time,
Burrow considered forfeiting the game, but the Hayden coach wanted
to play. With all the distractions and the new players, Burrow
forgot to turn in an official lineup card before the open ing
tip-off.
</P>
<P>
   The whistle sounded just after the game began and Hayden was
awarded 10 technical foul shots. They made six.
</P>
<P>
   ``From there,'' Burrow said, ``things went even further
downhill.''
</P>
<P>
   The visiting team ran up a 24-6 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was imagining what I could say to these kids to turn this
disaster into something positive,'' Burrow said, ``when they
started coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   His lone eighth-grade starter, Bran don Buzan, hit a
three-pointer. Then he hit another. Then he made a steal, drove for
a layup, made it, got fouled and made the foul shot. By halftime
the Lions were within six.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning of the second half Hayden went on another
run,'' Burrow said. ``They maintained what seemed like a steady
lead of around 10.''
</P>
<P>
   Burrow's seventh graders began gaining confidence, however, and
the score got closer. With 20 seconds left, Buzan was fouled and
made both shots. The Lions were behind by only one.
</P>
<P>
   It stayed that way until 8 seconds were left, when a Hayden
player was fouled and made one of two shots. The lead was 2.
VALIANT ATTEMPT
</P>
<P>
   Burrow told Buzan to take the last shot. He was well-guarded,
though, and passed off. After getting batted around, the ball
landed in the hands of 5-foot-2 Brian Kaufman, a sev enth-grader,
near mid-court.
</P>
<P>
   Losing makes you stronger. That's what Burrow planned to tell
his kids.
</P>
<P>
   Two defenders closed in on Kauf man, who whirled and flung the
ball. Burrow wasn't sure the boy could even reach the basket from
that far away.

AGGIES FALL SHORT IN 3 OTs 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ Arizona State relied on the clutch
shooting of guard Eddie House to wrestle away a 96-91 victory
against Texas A&AMP;M last night in triple overtime.
</P>
<P>
   An eventually exhausted crowd of 4,023 witnessed a performance
by House that likely won't be equaled soon in new Reed Arena as the
junior poured in 34 points. His shooting was directly responsible
for sending the game into the first, second and third overtimes. He
scored 11 of the Sun Devils' 19 points in the third OT.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say I've ever been involved in a game like that,'' A&AMP;M
coach Melvin Watkins said. ``Neither team had any quit in them.
This \RArizona State\S is the most talented team we've played so
far.''
</P>
<P>
   ASU is now 5-4. The Aggies fell to 7-2 and lost for the first
time in Reed Arena after five consecutive victories.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils also got 23 points and 18 rebounds from Mike
Batiste, a 6-foot-8 power forward who became eligible earlier in
the day after receiving a passing grade on his last final. The
Aggies, meanwhile, were without 6-9 starting center Paul Jacobs,
who sprained an ankle yesterday afternoon during shoot-around
practice.
</P>
<P>
   Shanne Jones led A&AMP;M with 26. Jerald Brown added 19.
</P>
<P>
   House, who was averaging 21.3 points at tipoff, hit 3-point
shots near the end of regulation and again in the second overtime
from both corners to prolong the contest. House clicked from the
left corner with 7.3 seconds left in the second OT to tie the game
at 77 and bring on the third extra period.
</P>
<P>
   ASU jumped out 65-62 in the first overtime, but Brown brought
the Aggies back with a 3-pointer. The teams exchanged free throws
until Batiste was called for walking and Clifton Cook hit a field
goal from the top of the key for a 69-67 Aggies lead with 1:15
left.
</P>
<P>
   House re-tied the score at 69 from the lane with 47.7 seconds
left. After two timeouts and the rebound of Chris Clayton's 3-point
attempt from the right corner _ a shot similar to the one he missed
near the end of regulation _ A&AMP;M set up the last shot off an
in-bounds with 7.7 seconds to play. Clayton again missed from the
same spot, and the teams went into their second extra 5-minute
period.
</P>
<P>
   The game was tied at 60 at the end of regulation. House knotted
the score with a 3-pointer from the deep right corner with 10
seconds left. A&AMP;M's Clayton tried almost the same shot downcourt,
but missed and Michael Schmidt's left-handed tip bounced off the
rim as time ran out.
</P>
<P>
   ASU had rallied from a 10-point halftime deficit to take a 45-44
lead and stretched that to 53-49 with 4:15 to play. But Cook hit a
three and Clayton scored from the lane to put the Aggies back up
54-53 at 3:38. Cook had two possible chances to ice it. But he made
only one of two free throws with 50 seconds left (59-57) and
followed suit at 23.3 _ making only one for a 60-57 cushion,
enabling ASU to tie on House's clutch shot.
</P>
<P>
   But looking surprisingly crisp despite a 10-day layoff for final
exams, the Aggies led 36-26 at halftime by closing with a 9-2 run
after ASU cut an 11-point lead to 27-24 with 5:51 remaining.

UT-ARLINGTON MEN OVERCOME FOUL WOES FOR VICTORY
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. _ With foul trouble, second-half
deficits and another loss looming last night for the UT-Arlington
men's basketball team, something different happened.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks battled through it for an 87-78 victory against
Air Force at Clune Arena.
</P>
<P>
   UTA coach Eddie McCarter said his team's first Division I
victory was enough to get excited about, but he was more pleased
with the way the Mavericks did it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really needed this one,'' McCarter said. ``The guys fought
through adversity, and it was everybody. I could go down the list,
and everybody stepped up. That's the way we're going to win
basketball games this season.''
</P>
<P>
   UTA (2-5) shot a season-best 61 percent from the field, and
junior forward Bill Washington led four players in double figures
with 24 points and 11 rebounds. Senior point guard Jermaine Johnson
had a season highs with 17 points and six assists.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks erased a 57-50 deficit with a 13-5 run midway
through the second half, and they held off Air Force (5-2) despite
foul trouble the entire game.
</P>
<P>
   UTA, which has eight available scholarship players, had four
players with three fouls by halftime. Washington and Dewayne
Marable picked up their fourth fouls early in the second half.
Marable and Jared Hiple fouled out.
</P>
<P>
   When UTA took a 78-74 lead with 2:12 left, Washington said the
free throws that followed were taken with attitude. The Mavericks
were 8 of 9 down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like Air Force was able to do anything they wanted
inside,'' Washington said. ``Maybe we should be angry like that
from now on when we go to the foul line.
</P>
<P>
   Washington was 10 of 12 from the field and scored 18 of his 24
points in the first half, helping keep the Air Force halftime lead
to 39-35.
</P>
<P>
   A comeback attempt by the Falcons was stopped by consecutive
Keith Greene jumpers to push a four-point lead to 78-70 with two
minutes left. Greene finished with 15 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team chemistry is what we were lacking, and I think we
found it tonight,'' Johnson said.

READY TO INVEST IN MUTUAL FUNDS?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DEBORAH ADAMSON  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ So you want to start investing this year.
</P>
<P>
   The credit card debt is under control and you're finally
managing to save money. It's time to take the next step: invest for
the future.
</P>
<P>
   One of the easiest ways to start is to buy a mutual fund.
</P>
<P>
   A mutual fund is a pool of investors' money managed by a
professional. Investors pay a fee and often a commission, too, to
buy into the fund. Money in the fund is invested as the fund
manager sees fit, within the limits of a strategy outlined in a
document called a prospectus.
</P>
<P>
   Mutual funds can be invested in stocks and bonds, whether
domestic or foreign, money market instruments and other assets.
Many people invest in mutual funds through a retirement plan at
work, such as a 401(k) plan.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a fund veteran, it's good to evaluate your fund
choices to make sure they're meeting your needs. What better time
than the start of the new year?
</P>
<P>
   Here is advice from two experts: Mary Rowland, author of ``The
New Commonsense Guide to Mutual Funds'' who writes a column for
Microsoft's www.moneycentral.com site, and George Shirk, associate
editor of Mutual Funds magazine in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   _ No. 1: Buy a no-load or no-commission fund. There are plenty
of good funds to choose from that don't charge any commission, so
why pay it?
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll have all the money working for you at the get-go,''
Shirk said.
</P>
<P>
   _ No. 2: Look for a fund with low expenses and turnover, with a
consistent investment style. Different from loads or commissions,
fund expenses are charged every year as a percentage of your
investment to pay the fund manager, marketing costs and others.
Rowland recommends looking for a fund with a 1 percent or lower
cost.
</P>
<P>
   A low turnover of less than 25percent a year is favorable. It
means the fund manager isn't changing investments in the portfolio
too rapidly _ shifting strategy in a way that will generate a
greater tax burden. You want a manager to be consistent, not to
waffle. For instance, Rowland says that the Vanguard Windsor II
fund has stayed with a consistent strategy for decades.
</P>
<P>
   _ No. 3: Don't invest in the hot fund of the moment. Returns are
usually based on short-term performance. Instead, look for
consistent performers that always land in the top 20 percent of
their mutual fund category, Rowland said.
</P>
<P>
   _ No. 4: &UR;  &LR; Spread your money around. Don't buy into only one kind
of fund, but diversify to spread your risk. For instance, Rowland
said investors might want to start with a core index fund, such as
Vanguard Total Market, and supplement it with different funds, such
as international and funds that invest in specific sectors of the
market.
</P>
<P>
   _ No. 5: Invest consistently, perhaps weekly, monthly or
quarterly, Shirk said. You'll buy at various prices, instead of
trying to time the lowest point.
</P>
<P>
   _ No. 6: Pick a fund that beats its peers. While history doesn't
always repeat itself, a fund that's outperformed its peers over 10
years still is a good bet, given the same manager and investment
style. You want to compare a growth and income fund against the
same type of funds.
</P>
<P>
   Be skeptical of fund ads that tout wonderful returns. It's easy
to manipulate those figures by dropping off a weak month or quarter
in the calculations. Read the prospectus to see the actual
performance.
</P>
<P>
   _ No. 7: &UR;  &LR; Index funds rule. In the past five years, only 5
percent of actively managed funds beat the market, Rowland said.
Active funds are those whose managers analyze the market and make
investments accordingly. Index funds are those that automatically
invest in the stocks of a particular index, such as the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 or Wilshire 5000 Index.
</P>
<P>
   _ No. 8: &UR;  &LR; Leave a fund if the manager quits, the investment
style shifts or it hasn't performed up to expectations after three
years, Rowland said. But don't jump in and out of funds often.
</P>
<P>
   _ No. 9: Forget bond funds unless you're retired or you want to
reduce volatility. If you buy a bond fund, buy a no-load.
</P>
<P>
   _ No. 10: Don't blindly follow a tip on the Internet or jump
into a fund because you feel you've been left out of a bull market.
Take your time to do your research. A good source is Morningstar, a
mutual fund publication found at the public library, or on the
Internet at www.morningstar.net.

WATER HAULING A PRACTICE THAT WON'T DRY UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KATHLEEN INGLEY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Whitley headed his pickup down the pitted dirt road, towing
a 500-gallon fiberglass tank mounted on a trailer. He stopped at an
overhead pipe and fitted one end into his tank. Then he let it rip.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, the tank was full and Whitley flipped off the
switch. He hopped into his truck and returned to his home north of
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Another day, another tank of water.
</P>
<P>
   On the verge of a new century and at the edge of booming
metropolitan Phoenix, hundreds of folks aren't hooked up to a water
system and don't have wells. Instead, they haul water to their
houses.
</P>
<P>
   Whitley has been doing it for 17 years.
</P>
<P>
   He can get by with two trips a week in the winter, but he goes
almost daily once the weather heats up.
</P>
<P>
   It's no hardship, Whitley insists, ``it's just a chore, like
taking out the garbage.''
</P>
<P>
   People haul water for the same reason they did a century ago:
They want to live in a rural area that water service hasn't reached
and perhaps never will. Drilling a well is expensive, and in many
parts of Arizona, there's no guarantee of hitting water at a
reasonable depth.
</P>
<P>
   Hauling is the trade-off for putting people where there isn't
any water. And thousands of people across the state are willing to
put up with it.
</P>
<P>
   The Ash Fork area, east of Flagstaff, received all its water by
train until 1975. Now, there's a community well, 1,700 feet deep,
serving both customers on a conventional pipe system and others who
have to haul.
</P>
<P>
   It's one of the few successful wells in the area, said Lewis
Hume, manager of the Ash Fork Development Association, the area's
non-profit water company.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, someone went down more than 1,000 feet without any
luck. And with a layer of volcanic rock to go through, ``it's tough
drilling,'' Hume said.
</P>
<P>
   Water hauling isn't limited to Arizona. The American Water Works
Association doesn't keep count, but it's ``a fairly common practice
throughout the country,'' said Dallas Post, who works for the
association.
</P>
<P>
   The local water supply may be full of sulfur, or a farm pump may
freeze in winter.
</P>
<P>
   You can use any kind of tank to haul water: metal, fiberglass,
plastic. Some people go as small as 55-gallon drums. Practically
speaking, it's hard to pull more than 1,000 gallons. As everyone
who hauls water knows, the stuff weighs 8 pounds a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   You load up on water at a standpipe, a tall inverted U of pipe
that's hooked up to a big storage tank.
</P>
<P>
   A few water companies run their standpipes on the honor system,
by which people write down how much they take. Others are
coin-operated. But like almost everything else these days, the
business is going high-tech, and many standpipes take electronic
cards.
</P>
<P>
   Southeast of Phoenix, in Queen Creek, you can get 144 to 160
gallons for a quarter, or use a card for $5 a month, plus $1.75 per
1,000 gallons. Of course, that price doesn't include the wear and
tear of driving back and forth over country roads. And there's
always the danger of a blowout.
</P>
<P>
   That's why John Whitley keeps close watch on the tread on his
tires.
</P>
<P>
   He's fortunate to live just 3{ miles from the standpipe in New
River, in a stretch of desert north of Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Once Whitley gets home with a load of water, he hooks up a hose
to the tank and lets gravity transfer the water to his 1,000-gallon
underground storage tank.
</P>
<P>
   The whole routine takes about a half-hour.
</P>
<P>
   To him, it's a small price for living in quiet country with
spectacular views of distant mountains.
</P>
<P>
   The water tastes great, Whitley added. And with a pump and a
pressure tank, the water in his two-story wood home runs no
differently than in the city. The family has a washing machine, a
dishwasher and even an evaporative cooler, a notorious water
guzzler. The property has desert plants and no grass, but Whitley
has trees that get daily drinks in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just turn it on like everyone else,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   But there was one time when he soaped up in the shower just as
the water ran out.
</P>
<P>
   Whitley's water bill runs $35 a month in winter, $60 to $65 in
summer. He figures a well would cost at least $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, there's a brisk business in rural Arizona
hauling water for people who don't want to pick it up themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I deliver to people that are in manufactured homes all the way
to people with million-dollar houses,'' Rob Ingram said of his
one-man operation.
</P>
<P>
   He hauls to about 60 regular customers around New River,
charging $45 for a standard 2,000-gallon load.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix, by comparison, charges a basic monthly fee of $5.16 in
the winter, which includes 4,500 gallons of water; above that,
water is $1.06 per 748 gallons.
</P>
<P>
   Ingram's average customer, a family on an acre-plus lot, takes
two loads a month. That's a third less than just one Phoenix
resident uses in a month.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, he also has customers with swimming pools and
lawns. He jokingly offers to buy everybody a pony for Christmas.
Horses can drink 30 gallons a day in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Tary Taylor says her two horses polish off even more than that.
</P>
<P>
   Hauling water is part of the daily routine since the Taylor
family moved five years ago from downtown Mesa to southeastern
Maricopa County.
</P>
<P>
   On the way back from picking up her daughter at school, Taylor
stopped at the Queen Creek standpipe to get another 425-gallon
load. The water mains are being extended around Queen Creek, but
her house isn't yet in the path of pipes.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Taylor doesn't even bother to unhook the water
trailer from her truck.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need milk. Might as well get a load of water,'' she
explained. ``Pick up parts? Get a load of water.''
</P>
<P>
   No wonder. She and her husband have four children, plus an
employee living on their property. Then there's the grass she
planted this year because she was tired of the desert look. And, of
course, the horses.
</P>
<P>
   In October, they used 21,000 gallons, ``a lot of hauling,''
Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   When the Queen Creek standpipe was coin-operated, the lines were
endless. Now, there's rarely much of a wait.
</P>
<P>
   The Taylors don't take radical steps to conserve water, although
some haulers go as far as reusing bath water. But they try to hold
down how much they use, such as switching off the shower while
soaping up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, I'll treat myself to a full shower,'' Tary Taylor
said.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest headache is turning on the hose and forgetting it.
Just that morning, Taylor had stuck the hose into a tree well to
give some flowers there a good soak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I forgot, and it was going down the driveway,'' she said
ruefully. ``I probably ran 50 gallons over. You want to kick
yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Water hauling may seem like a relic of the pioneer past to city
folks. But Mary Ripplinger, owner of Desert Hills Water Co., said
tartly, ``This is only an amazing thing to those who have never
done it.''
</P>
<P>
   If everyone had to do it for a year, she added, ``we wouldn't
have any water conservation problems.'' &QL;

DUAL LANGUAGE APPROACH GAINING POPULARITY IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CATHRYN CRENO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   West Phoenix mother Erika Rivera says she grew up in the era
when Mexican-American children were discouraged from speaking
Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Now she's a gate agent for America West Airlines and frequently
calls upon her limited Spanish to answer passenger questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my daughter was born, I said she ``had'' to learn
Spanish,'' Rivera said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing a second language is so important. You can't look
through the want ads without seeing `bilingual preferred.' ''
</P>
<P>
   So this school year, Rivera is driving daughter Erika-Jasmine,
now 6, to a public school in central Phoenix that offers
``dual-language immersion.''
</P>
<P>
   The program, new this year at William T. Machan Elementary,
allows kids to spend half the day in a room with a teacher who
speaks in English and the other half in a room with a
Spanish-speaking teacher.
</P>
<P>
   And half of Erika-Jasmine's classmates are native speakers of
English, while the others speak Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   The goal for pupils in Machan's eight dual-language classes is
to become fluent _ and able to read and write _ in both languages
in elementary school, rather than waiting for high school to start
foreign-language classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dual language is a good idea,'' said John Schilling, Arizona
Department of Education chief of policy and planning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids need to know how to read and write English in order to be
successful. But it's a misperception that the department does not
think the opportunity to learn two languages is important.''
</P>
<P>
   He is helping state Superintendent of Public Instruction Lisa
Graham Keegan sort through the myriad programs that
non-English-speaking children encounter in Arizona public schools.
</P>
<P>
   As the debate over bilingual education rages, dual-language
seems to be one program that people on all sides embrace.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that it is voluntary _ parents must sign their
children up for programs. Machan even has a waiting list of
children whose parents want them in dual-language.
</P>
<P>
   Another plus is that dual-language classes do not isolate
Spanish-speaking children, but combine them with English speakers
so children can tutor and learn from each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``I speak English to my parents and Spanish with my friends and
sometimes to my little brother,'' explained fourth-grader Avant
Brown, who is 9 and in a dual-language program at Valley View
Elementary near South Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   His classmate since kindergarten, 9-year-old Rita Gonzalez,
speaks Spanish at home and on the playground plus excellent English
in class.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be bilingual so I can be a doctor and help people,''
she explained.
</P>
<P>
   At least eight Arizona school districts have dual-language
instruction programs.
</P>
<P>
   Machan Elementary started its program this year with a $1
million five-year grant from the U.S. Department of Education.
Mountain View Elementary in Sunnyslope received a $1.6 million
grant.
</P>
<P>
   The schools are expected to set up studies of their programs and
have them evaluated by independent researchers.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge, said Valley View Elementary Principal John Wann,
is finding enough bilingual teachers to fill the classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Valley View's program differs from Machan's in that children
spend all day with one bilingual teacher. The program is so popular
that parents drive from as far as Ahwatukee and north central
Phoenix to enroll their kids in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people question it,'' said an Ahwatukee mother, who
requested that her name not be printed because she is fed up with
those who challenge her desire to have bilingual children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Valley View has all the aspects I would want in a small
private school. Classes are small, and by the time they leave, my
children will be bi-literate in Spanish and English.''
</P>
<P>
   Josue Gonzalez, director of Arizona State University's Center
for Bilingual Education and Research, wonders whether the
controversy over teaching children in Spanish could have been
avoided if dual-language programs were the norm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditional programs separate kids out, and we have now
learned that that is not a good idea,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dual-language programs really work better _ English-speaking
kids and Spanish-speaking kids are mixed and learn each other's
languages.'' &QL;

AVENGING BRUINS CUT DOWN RED WINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It had only been three days since they had seen each
other. Wednesday night, the Bruins had been in Detroit to face the
Red Wings and the result was a disappointing but not unpredictable
5-3 loss to the two-time defending Stanley Cup champions.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit was deeper, more talented, and on home ice. Saturday
night, with that defeat as a burning source of motivation and
familiarity breeding the kind of contempt that makes for compelling
games, the Bruins dug deep and gutted out a 4-1 victory at the
FleetCenter in the rematch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really special, especially that they beat us in a tough
game a couple of nights ago and it was fresh in our minds,'' said
goalie Byron Dafoe, who had 23 saves. ``They're the Stanley Cup
champions and they're one of the best teams in hockey and it was a
very good test for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston's attack consisted of two power-play goals, a shorthanded
goal, and an empty-netter, all scored after Detroit had taken a 1-0
lead into the first intermission.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a hard-fought battle all the way through, it wasn't
just the special teams that won the game,'' said coach Pat Burns.
``What won the game was the grit that we showed, especially in the
second and third periods. We came out with more emotion and emotion
caused turnovers because we were a little more physical down in
their end.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first period we lacked that a little bit. Our power
play (which finished 2 for 5) is coming to the way we had it
before. We're trying to be less fancy. We're getting the puck at
the net. Detroit's a big team. They can throw speed at you and
skill at you, size at you. They can throw a lot of things at you. A
lot of people maybe don't expect us to win, but if we go out there
with the grit and the emotion, we're going to win. I thought
everybody did a great job tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the Bruins played the Red Wings evenly in the
first period, with both teams generating nine shots. Left wing
Brendan Shanahan put the Wings on the board at 13:27. Center Igor
Larionov attempted a back-door pass from the right-wing side with
Shanahan dashing down the left toward the net. The relay would have
been on target were it not for Bruins defenseman Grant Ledyard. The
puck caromed off Led-yard and went behind the net. Shanahan, who
had four shots in the period, chased it down and, from a position
behind the cage to Dafoe's right, banked it off the netminder and
into the net.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins tied the game midway through the second period on a
shorthanded strike by Chris Taylor. P.J. Axelsson banked the puck
off the boards after a Wings defenseman was caught pinching and
Taylor took off after the loose puck and motored in on the
breakaway, beating goalie Norm Maracle with a wrist shot from the
right circle at 9:06.
</P>
<P>
   Boston took the lead for good with a power-play goal at 18:33.
Jason Allison, at the top of the left circle, dished the puck down
low to Sergei Samsonov. Samsonov, off to Maracle's right, fired the
puck and it went off the netminder's right arm and into the net for
the 2-1 advantage. Ray Bourque picked up his first of three assists
on the score, moving past Gordie Howe into sole possession of third
place on the NHL's all-time list. The three helpers give him 1,052.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins sealed it on the power play at 15:11 of the third.
Detroit center Sergei Fedorov became aggravated with Allison and
cross-checked him to the ice and punched him in the head. To his
surprise, Allison was whistled off for interference and Fedorov got
a double minor for interference and cross-checking, setting the
stage for Darren Van Impe's slapper from the right point that
zipped past Maracle. Anson Carter closed out the scoring with an
empty-netter at 19:07.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just frustrated,'' said Allison of Fedorov. ``I
would've probably hit him if I knew I was getting a penalty. The
reason I didn't was because I thought we were getting a four-minute
power play and there was (5:48) left in the game. If I hit him when
he comes back, I get one and it's even. He came back and I let him
hit me again. I don't know how I got (a penalty). But we scored on
the power play and that was the biggest punishment for him, I
guess. He ruined any chance of his team winning by being stupid.''

WHITHER BILINGUAL EDUCATION IN ARIZONA? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CATHRYN CRENO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   State schools chief Lisa Graham Keegan has no assurances for
educators who think kids should spend years in bilingual education.
</P>
<P>
   ``Information we have tells us that children in bilingual
education in this state are languishing,'' the state superintendent
of public instruction told a roomful of educators last week as
pickets chanted outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to see us move these children along into English
as quickly as possible. My position is it should not take as long
as it is taking.''
</P>
<P>
   By next month, Keegan and staff members at the Arizona
Department of Education are expected to decide which of a number of
bilingual education bills to support next year. Bills range in
philosophy from the virtual elimination of bilingual ed to boosting
programs for non-English-speaking children with infusions of money
for new classes and teachers.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Keegan sponsored the second of a series of forums
with educators and community leaders on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Such comments, however, infuriate parents and teachers who
support bilingual education and frustrate academics who believe
they have given the Arizona Department of Education piles of data
supporting the value of educating children in Spanish for as long
as eight years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The children might be speaking English after a few months, but
when you try to get them to read and write in English you see how
little they really understand,'' said Vivian Martinez of the Fowler
Elementary School District in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``They speak `social English,' but their comprehension of
subjects like math and social studies is still better in Spanish.
It's better that we teach them those subjects in Spanish so they
don't fall behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Maria Elena Sotomayor, a technical writer for a Tucson
engineering firm, traveled in a van with other bilingual education
supporters to picket the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Sotomayor and about 50 others chanted a bilingual slogan ``Exito
en dos idiomas'' (success in two languages), English-plus for
Arizona.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just a bunch of political hogwash,'' said Sotomayor,
46, who still recalls the day her fifth-grade teacher made her stay
after school and write ``I will not speak Spanish in school.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Children should have the opportunity to learn more than one
language in school.''
</P>
<P>
   Although protesters were allowed at the meeting, speaking was
invitation-only. Keegan said she will have an open forum on the
issue at the next meeting.
</P>
<P>
   But Keegan said she wonders whether bilingual education students
are learning foreign languages at the expense of English and
academic subjects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when we talk about kids who are successful in (bilingual
education programs), we are only talking about kids who reach the
35th percentile'' on the Stanford 9 achievement test, said Keegan.
``I'm not satisfied with that.'' &QL;

SAMSONOV HAS KNACK FOR KEY GOALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN VELLANTE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ He went into Saturday night's game having scored either
the winning or tying goal in four of the Bruins' last eight games.
</P>
<P>
   You can now make that five of the last nine because once again
Sergei Samsonov was the right man in the right place at the right
time.
</P>
<P>
   His second-period goal, in which he threaded the needle to beat
Detroit goaltender Norm Maracle, snapped a 1-1 tie and lifted the
Bruins past the two-time defending Stanley Cup champions, 4-1, at
the FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   It came at 18:33 on a power play and Jason Allison and Ray
Bourque drew the assists. Bourque passed the puck from the point to
Allison inside the left circle and he steered it to Samsonov.
</P>
<P>
   Maracle moved across to cut down the angle and Samsonov didn't
have much to shoot at. But he picked his spot and softly lifted the
puck over Maracle and into the near corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just tried to put the puck on the net, I really couldn't see
where I was shooting,'' said Samsonov. ``I knew there wasn't much
of an opening, so I just shot and hoped that it would go in and it
did.''
</P>
<P>
   The goal had some extra meaning for Samsonov because by drawing
the assist, the 1,050th of his career, Bourque moved into third
place ahead of Gordie Howe on the NHL's all-time list. Later,
Samsonov and Bourque teamed up again, this time assisting on a goal
by Darren Van Impe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little bit of history and it's nice to be a part of
it,'' said Samsonov. ``It's something special. I guess now I can
tease him about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Samsonov, who won last year's Calder Trophy as the NHL's top
rookie with 22 goals and 25 assists in 81 games, is ahead of that
pace this season with 11 goals and 17 assists after 29 games. Five
of those goals have been winners.
</P>
<P>
   But Samsonov shrugged off the importance of the goals,
preferring to talk about the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it's important, I guess,'' he said. ``But it's just
another goal. I don't know how they count game-winning goals, how
they determine them, but it's a team thing and a team goal, so
they're really not special. There's nothing personal in it. It's
all about team.''
</P>
<P>
   He wanted, also, to talk more about the win, and what it meant
to the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the Stanley Cup champions and it's really nice to get
a win like that, especially at home,'' he said. ``This is probably
going to be good for our confidence and other teams coming in here
will have to look at us a little differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were not winning much at home but now we've won two
straight here and it's nice to get those points here. They're
really important to this team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, we didn't win that much at home, but it looks like
we might be ready to go on a roll. It seems like we're playing a
little better than we were at the beginning of the season. It's
nice to have all the guys back.''
</P>
<P>
   Samsonov may have scored the winner but he thought the tying
goal, a shorthanded tally by Chris Taylor, was the spark that
ignited the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so important, especially coming at the beginning of the
second period,'' Samsonov said. ``It got us going. Obviously, we
had some chances but just couldn't score. We started to be a little
sharper after that. That goal was the key.''

UCLA SWATS AWAY CSUN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The rumblings began Thursday in the Cal State
Northridge gym, floated east along the 101, turned south over the
Sepulveda pass and _ here's where the Matadors got into trouble _
settled in a certain locker room in Pauley Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   Matadors guard Jason Crowe called it CSUN's ``best chance'' to
beat the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   Derrick Higgins predicted it would be ``one of the hardest
games'' of UCLA's season.
</P>
<P>
   And Markus Carr theorized that CSUN and UCLA have ``the same
talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Not quite.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, not close.
</P>
<P>
   Staggering out of exams and pre-dawn practices, the bleary-eye
Bruins awoke in time to slap some sense into the Matadors with a
114-97 victory Saturday night at Pauley Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   ``They feel they can beat us,'' UCLA coach Steve Lavin said
Friday. ``When I watched the tape, they looked really dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I explained to our guys that a majority of (CSUN's) kids are
from Southern California and they would have loved to opportunity
to play at UCLA. Because of that, there's a natural built-in edge
to the underdog.''
</P>
<P>
   That edge lasted just over 10 minutes, as the Matadors matched
UCLA basket-for-basket and grabbed a 25-24 lead with 9:50 remaining
in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins (6-2) responded with a devastating 20-0 surge that
spanned 4:26 and ended with a dazzling pass from Baron Davis to Dan
Gadzuric for a three-point play, giving UCLA a 44-25 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' display didn't stop there. In his most effective game
since returning from knee surgery, he slashed through CSUN's
defense time and again, collecting six assists against one turnover
in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors (6-4) played without talented forward Rico Harris,
who missed his fourth consecutive game with a hip pointer. It
showed, as they scored eight points in the final 10 minutes of the
half and shuffled to the locker room with a 24-point deficit.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA shot 64.5 percent in the first half, and most of its
baskets in the 20-0 surge were layups and dunks. CSUN had neither
the size, speed or stamina to stay with the Bruins once they broke
a sweat. The Matadors compounded their problems with horrendous
ballhandling, committing 20 turnovers in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first game in a week for both teams because of exams.
To maintain timing and conditioning, the Bruins practiced at dawn
and held three full-scale scrimmages, complete with uniforms,
timeouts and Pacific-10 officials. Tuesday's practice began at 5
a.m., meaning the Bruins arrived at Pauley Pavilion at 4:15 for
taping and stretching.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found out who the morning guys were,'' Lavin quipped.
</P>
<P>
   One of them was rapidly-improving freshman guard Ray Young, who
played well in practice and finished with 14 points Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a three-game winning streak, Lavin had a plethora of
problems to address. Against Nevada-Las Vegas, for instance, UCLA
played well for the first five minutes and again for the final 13.
In between, the Bruins struggled with impatience, court balance and
transition defense. They took too many quick shots and gave the
Runnin' Rebels too many easy baskets.
</P>
<P>
   The scrimmages failed to correct the problem, as the Bruins
played passively and allowed CSUN to score at will in the opening
minutes.

<P>
   Andre Larry and Jeff Paris took turns dunking over UCLA freshmen
Dan Gadzuric and Jerome Moiso, surprising the Bruins and silencing
the crowd. When Greg Minor drained back-to-back 3-pointers from the
818 area code, UCLA's lead had dwindled to 18-16.
</P>
<P>
   The teams exchanged baskets for several minutes, until Brian
Heinle's 10-foot leaner gave CSUN its 25-24 lead. Two minutes
later, the game was over.
</P>
<P>
   Earl Watson started the blitz with a crisp bounce pass to Travis
Reed for a layup. A minute later, reserve Ryan Bailey sliced
through the appropriately-named Matadors for an uncontested layup.
JaRon Rush buried a 3-pointer from the right corner, and Bailey
teamed with Gadzuric for a nifty give-and-go layup.
</P>
<P>
   By the time CSUN coach Bobby Braswell called timeout, UCLA had a
37-25 lead.

DAUGHTERS OF MIGRANT WORKERS GET TASTE OF SCOUTING

<P>
   AGUILA, Ariz. _ At one of Brownie Troop 2285's first meetings,
troop leader Barbara Smith tried teaching the girls how to play red
light-green light, a child's game where players run when the leader
shouts, ``Green light!'' and stop at the call of ``Red light!''
</P>
<P>
   But they ran when she called ``Red light!'' and stopped for the
green. Smith was perplexed by their confused faces until she
realized that the girls, mostly the daughters of Mexican farming
workers, had never seen a traffic light.
</P>
<P>
   There's not one traffic light in this small rural community of
about 600 people. There's no Circle K, department store or even a
movie theater.
</P>
<P>
   But, for the first time, there is a Brownie Troop, a program of
the Girl Scouts of America for girls ages 6 to 8, though here in
Aguila there are some 9-year-olds in the troop.
</P>
<P>
   Smith moved to Aguila _ an hour and a half drive northwest of
metro Phoenix, just past Wicken burg _ with her husband, Harry, a
pilot for Continental Airlines, and young daughter about four years
ago. The family, which now in cludes 2-year-old Michael, owns and
runs Sampley Airport, a dusty landing strip and hangar.
</P>
<P>
   Until a year ago, Barbara Smith drove Heather, now 7, to Wicken
burg _ about a half-hour each way _ for weekly Brownie meetings and
events. She decided to start her own troop closer to home, figuring
there would be plenty of little girls from the nearby school who
would be interested in joining.
</P>
<P>
   But a majority of the girls are first-generation Americans.
Their parents were not familiar with Girl Scouting, and newfangled
ideas _ though Girl Scouting dates back to 1912 _ are regarded with
some suspicion in Aguila.
</P>
<P>
   Smith doesn't speak Spanish, so the troop got off to a slow
start with three or four girls showing up each week. Smith sent
Heather to school in full uniform to drum up interest.
</P>
<P>
   She recruited Nena Gutierrez as her co-leader, and Gutierrez,
who speaks Spanish, won over reluctant mothers. Now, the troop is
14 girls strong, and there is a waiting list long enough to make up
another troop.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1997, a national study assessing the effect of Girl
Scouting on girls' lives reported that the longer a girl stays in
Scouting, the less likely she is to fail at school, abuse drugs or
alcohol, or commit juvenile crime.
</P>
<P>
   Eagle Produce, Aguila's major employer, donated $500 for the
troop to buy Brownie uniforms. Instead, they bought material, and
the Wickenburg chapter of the American Sewing Guild and the Tuesday
morning sewing class at the Youngstown Arizona Discount Sew and Vac
made their brown skirts and vests.
</P>
<P>
   There was enough money left over to buy start-up materials such
as Girl Scout handbooks and scis sors, construction paper and glue
for craft projects. Still, the girls share scissors and even
pencils.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent meeting, the girls were making Christmas candles out
of empty toilet paper rolls. Con struction paper and girls spread
out over the cement floor of Smith's workroom.
</P>
<P>
   Heather is the only native English speaker, but she fares well
in both languages. The other girls speak both English and Spanish,
and they all talk at once as they eat an afternoon snack of
pudding, fruit and hot chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   Their vests are spotted with badges.
</P>
<P>
   There are no dues, though many troops do collect weekly fees
rang ing from 50 cents to a few dollars. Smith didn't want cost to
keep any of the girls from joining.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, they would be attending a free puppet show in
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not much for little girls to do here, and they need to
have exposure to things outside of little Aguila,'' Smith says.
</P>
<P>
   Few of the families own cars, so Smith, Gutierrez and another
mother pick up the girls after school using two station wagons and
a truck. They take them home after ward.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the girls live in houses; the rest live in trailers.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than making the rounds in town, the troop went to Sun
City _ an hour and a half away _ and sold Girl Scout cookies
outside a grocery store there every weekend for five weeks. They
made $200.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we spent more on gas,'' Smith says.
</P>
<P>
   She took a handful of the girls to Arrowhead Mall while they
were in the city to pick up more supplies, again not realizing this
was a big adventure to children who thought Wickenburg was a
metropolis.
</P>
<P>
   For Leslie Herrera, 8, it was the first time she ever rode on an
elevator. She watched the glass contraption go up and down a few
times before venturing onto it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it would break, and I would be hanging from up
there,'' Leslie says.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother is pleased that she joined the troop, she says,
adding, ``She thinks Brownies are better than staying home and
seeing the television.''
</P>
<P>
   Leslie says she likes being a Brownie, going camping for the
first time and roller skating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody fell down like 100 times,'' she says, laughing. ``I
just fell down two or three times.''
</P>
<P>
   She has a badge to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   This month, the troop went to camp in Prescott, sleeping in
cabins and building fires and cooking their dinner outside. It was
a first for almost all of the girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so fun,'' Sarai Diaz, 8, says.
</P>
<P>
   On the way back to Aguila, it started to snow, another first for
Diaz and many of the other girls. They stopped at a rest area and
made snowballs, pelting one an other.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really neat when you are there for one of their firsts,''
Smith says. &QL;

IMPEACHMENT PROCESS AGAINST CLINTON FAIR, JUST
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
The following editorial appeared in Sunday's Arizona Republic: &HT;     
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With Saturday's vote in the House, William Jefferson Clinton is
now only the second president in this nation's history to be
impeached.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who as a youth dreamed of becoming president and
leaving a legacy of greatness, now occupies a lowly place in
history. His name will forever be linked with impeach ment.
</P>
<P>
   But this ignominious chapter is not yet closed. The president
could be convicted and removed from office by the Senate, action
that would be unprecedented in Ameri can history.
</P>
<P>
   This is an occasion of sadness, but one whose momentousness is
still not felt or realized by many Americans. Even the president
seemed to go about his business Saturday as the House adopted two
of four articles of impeachment, finding that Clinton obstructed
jus tice and lied under oath about his sexual affair with White
House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The sharply partisan vote, Rep. Bob Livingston's surprise
resigna tion as speaker-to-be over extramari tal affairs and
anguished questions over the timing of military attacks on Iraq
have left many wondering just how we got to this painful juncture.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the blame rests with Clinton. His actions shaped his
fate. The president violated his oath of office and misled the
American people. Clinton's efforts to conceal his affair with
Lewinsky began in January, but his downfall began many years ago
with his penchant for deceit.
</P>
<P>
   We will leave it to historians and others to sort out the roots
of Clinton's personal failings. Our con cern is with the future.
Now what? Where do we go?
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is expected to take up Clinton's case in early
January. The matter could be disposed of quickly, with a reprimand
or censure, or the trial could last for months.
</P>
<P>
   We pray for the former.
</P>
<P>
   Both political parties and the country want to get this over
with. But for that to happen, the president must separate himself
from the highly partisan remarks of Demo crats like House Minority
Leader Richard Gephardt, who railed Satur day against Republicans
and de clared that the ``politics of smear and slash and burn must
end.''
</P>
<P>
   After the vote, surrounded by Democratic supporters, Clinton
also portrayed the matter as one of Republicans vs. Democrats and
called for an end to the ``politics of destruction'' and the
``poisonous venom of excessive partisanship.'' That may play to the
Democratic faithful, but Clinton must drop the attacks and fully
acknowledge his wrongdoing if he expects Senate Republicans to show
mercy and resolve this in an expeditious man ner.
</P>
<P>
   We agree with the president that there is important work to
tackle over the next two years, including saving Medicare and
Social Secu rity, improving our schools, ensuring a strong economy
and maintaining America's military might.
</P>
<P>
   We did not join the chorus of newspapers that months ago called
for Clinton's resignation or ouster. We see no reason to do so now,
believing that the process we are embarked on is fair and just. &QL;

WITH EXILE OVER, CSUN'S WELCH GETS TO PLAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Jermar Welch remembers the loneliness and the
self-pity.
</P>
<P>
   His memory of sitting inside the midcourt circle, alone, is
still vivid. Even a 1,600-seat gym like Cal State Northridge's can
be eerie when it's 8 p.m. and no one else is around.
</P>
<P>
   It was hours after coach Bobby Braswell's yelling stopped, and
long after every Matador left the practice. The silence broken only
by the `thud' of the ball pounding the court.
</P>
<P>
   It was Welch's punishment for being a nonqualifier out of Canyon
Springs High, and those traumas cost him 1{ years of basketball.
For that, the stinging will never end. Even as of late Friday he
was awaiting word of his sociology final, a test he was certain he
passed though he tortured himself nonetheless because he feared the
worst.
</P>
<P>
   His grade was fine, though his game a bit rusty. However, he
played Saturday against No. 12 UCLA. He finally played.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't seem like this was ever going to get here,'' Welch
said. ``I missed the intensity. That's the part I missed the most.
It's been such a long time, and I made it longer on myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Welch, an architecture major, was expecting to be eligible at
the beginning of this season. But he lapsed during the spring
semester and his grade-point average dipped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being ineligible because of grades, that's hard,'' Welch said.
``Everybody looks at you. But I'm more confident in myself now.''
</P>
<P>
   In reality, it's been nearly 20 months since Welch played a
game, so it'll take time to understand what type of impact he'll
have on CSUN. Or whether he'll have one.
</P>
<P>
   However, he's perhaps the Matadors' most athletic player on what
is tabbed as CSUN's most athletic team.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's so doggone athletic and such a great rebounder,''
Braswell said. ``There's a lot of things he still doesn't know, and
he doesn't know all of our plays. It's going to be nice to have an
extra post body, and he runs like a deer. He runs as well as
anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   That oversimplifies what the Matadors expect from Welch, and
what he offers.
</P>
<P>
   In CSUN's helter-skelter defensive style, Welch's athleticism
should help. Offensively, he can shoot the jumper and slash to the
basket. As a senior at Canyon Springs, Welch averaged 14 points
10.2 rebounds per game.
</P>
<P>
   The rebounding is particularly important considering power
forward Rico Harris missed his fourth consecutive game with a hip
injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``He brings so much because of his size and how athletic he
is,'' CSUN guard Jason Crowe said. ``He can bang and he's a strong
kid. That's going to help our rebounding. I believe he makes us a
much better team, especially after he gets a few games
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Which works perfectly for CSUN. While the UCLA game served as an
opportunity to gain community respect, the more important aspect is
for Welch to get ready for the Big Sky Conference season, which
begins Jan. 2 at Northern Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I can play, but I have to put it all together,'' Welch
said. ``I didn't get to practice at all last year, and with limited
practice this year I know it's going to take time.''

UMASS CAPTURES DIV. 1-AA CROWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. _ Unbelievable.
</P>
<P>
   Absolutely unbelievable.
</P>
<P>
   How do you explain it, going from the worst team in school
history last season to the best in Division 1-AA this season? What
do you compare it to?
</P>
<P>
   Nothing.
</P>
<P>
   There is no frame of reference from which to compare the
University of Massachusetts' storybook football campaign. The
compelling plots and subplots. The dramatic characters. The moments
of drama and suspense, triumph and tragedy. For 15 games, the
Minutemen often left you on the edge of your seat, wondering how
the final chapter would conclude.
</P>
<P>
   And what an ending it was.
</P>
<P>
   The Minutemen etched themselves in college football history by
capping one of the most unlikely runs for the Division 1-AA
national championship with one of the most amazing performances in
a final. UMass scored 38 first-half points and went on to upset
top-ranked, top-seeded, and previously unbeaten Georgia Southern,
55-43, for the 21st Division 1-AA title.
</P>
<P>
   UMass running back Marcel Shipp posted championship game
rec-ords in rushing attempts (35) and yards (244) and scored three
touchdowns and UMass linebacker Kole Ayi had three fumble
recoveries and 10 tackles to lead the Minutemen to their second
NCAA championship in school history (the women's lacrosse team won
an NCAA title in 1981).
</P>
<P>
   It was the second trip to the fi-nals for the Minutemen, who
lost the first 1-AA championship game to Florida A&AMP;M, 35-28, in
1978.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of how our kids came out and played. This is a great
day for UMass and for our seniors,'' said UMass coach Mark Whipple,
who on Dec. 16 of last year took over a program that finished 2-9
last season, and at his first press conference boldly declared he
would field a team capable of winning a national title.
</P>
<P>
   Whipple made good on his claim Saturday, putting together an
offense that racked up 462 total yards (303 rushing) and frustrated
Georgia Southern's high-octane offense at several critical points
of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played against (Division 1-AA player of the year) Jerry
Azumah of New Hampshire, and many other great players in the
Atlantic 10,'' said Whipple, ``so we weren't intimidated by these
guys at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Southern entered the game having allowed just 54 points
in the first quarter. But UMass showed early on it wouldn't
struggle offensively. The Minutemen capped a seven-play, 67-yard
drive with a 25-yard run by Shipp to make it 7-0 with 12:56
remaining in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Running back Adrian Peterson was stuffed for no gain on Georgia
Southern's first play from scrimmage. Then the Eagles showed why
their offense is one of the most explosive in college football.
Quarterback Greg Hill faked a pitch left, stutter-stepped at the
line of scrimmage to elude defenders, then ran 41 yards before
being pushed out of bounds by defensive back Jeremy Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   But UMass got the ball back when Hill was popped at the line by
defensive end Chris Price and coughed up the ball, which was
recovered by defensive lineman Paul Bolden. UMass could muster
nothing and was forced to punt, but Georgia Southern's turnover
problem (the Eagles finished with seven giveaways) would continue.
</P>
<P>
   The Minutemen went ahead, 14-0, on defense as Ayi recovered
Hill's second fumble and returned it nine yards for a touchdown
with 8:29 remaining in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Then, trailing, 14-7, with 5:11 left in the first, the Eagles
fumbled again as Ayi stepped in front of a Hill option pitch and
pounced on the ball. One play later, Jamie Holston, on a halfback
option, threw a 7-yard scoring pass to wide receiver Adrian Zullo
to put UMass up, 21-7.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you turn the ball over that many times you don't expect
to win a ballgame,'' said Hill, who finished with 29 carries for
228 yards and two touchdowns for an offense that amassed 595 yards
in defeat. ``They lined up as we expected and made big plays, but
we helped them by turning the ball over.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill's third fumble led to a 22-yard field goal by UMass's Jason
Cherry to up the lead to 24-7 with 14:56 remaining in the second
quarter. Georgia Southern cut the deficit to 10 on a 6-yard
touchdown pass from Hill to wide receiver Corey Joyner, but UMass
added two more rushing touchdowns _ on a 1-yard run by Bankhead and
a 4-yard run by Shipp _ to lead at halftime, 38-14.
</P>
<P>
   In the third quarter, Southern played its best football of the
game, shutting out the Minutemen while cutting UMass's lead to
38-33 on a pair of touchdowns by Peterson (28 carries, 161 yards).
</P>
<P>
   ``At halftime, I told them (in the 1985 championship game) we
were down to Furman, 28-6, and came back to win it (44-42),'' said
Georgia Southern coach Paul Johnson. ``I told them the game was
there to be had. I felt if we could get them to punt four times in
the fourth quarter we would win.''
</P>
<P>
   But UMass punted just twice. Meanwhile, Shipp and running back
Kevin Quinlan each scored on 2-yard runs to put UMass ahead, 52-33,
with 11:51 remaining. And the Minutemen were never seriously
threatened again.
</P>
<P>
   With 18 seconds left and the clock running out, the team bounded
onto the field in a raucous celebration that quickly included band
members and fans. And Whipple said the players thanked him for
guiding them to a most unexpected title.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I thanked them back,'' he said. ``That's what it's all
about. It's just like at Christmas, when you see your son open up
the bike for Christmas. This is Christmas. You have 56 kids here
and see their parents there, it is just a wonderful experience.''

VICTORY TRIGGERS MASS. HYSTERIA 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. _ The University of Massachusetts has the
best football team in the country. That is not my opinion. It was
not determined by a writers' poll, a computer's whims or a
corporate sponsor's desire for a lovely matchup in the Insight.com
Bowl, Hotmail Bowl or AOL Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   There was a legitimate championship game played at Finley
Stadium Saturday and the Minutemen won it. It was not the Tostitos
Fiesta Bowl, which is supposed to be the Bowl Championship Series
title game for Division 1-A teams. Please. Show me a championship
game that is determined by a computer and I'll argue it is a Bill
Gates gimmick. Show me a championship game that is determined by
voters and I'll argue that it's politics.
</P>
<P>
   The Minutemen didn't have to deal with that. They turned into
Southern tourists the past few weeks, making two trips to Louisiana
and one here. They were the 11th seed out of 16 teams in the
Division 1-AA playoffs, came to a city that is only a few miles
north of the Georgia line, and scored 55 points off a previously
undefeated team from Georgia. When the Georgia Southern fans
finally left _ reluctantly _ late in the fourth quarter, they saw
``UMass 55, GSU 43'' staring at them from the scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   All I can say is that I hope you found time to watch this team
during the season. I hope UMass athletic director Bob Marcum has
the state's checkbook open so he can retain Mark Whipple as head
coach. I hope the NCAA can see the beauty of having a true playoff
system for all levels of football. And, please, I hope you do not
think I am gloating when I say this: I cannot believe I was paid to
watch this wonderful game.
</P>
<P>
   The rule is that you're not supposed to cheer in press boxes. It
is unprofessional. Everyone was reminded of that before UMass and
Georgia Southern produced their 98-point gem. I wish I could have
seen the people who made that announcement. I wish I could have
seen if they were cheering. If they weren't? Well, I'm convinced
that they are otherworldly extras from ``Star Trek'' or Area 51
experiments who left Roswell, N.M., to see how crazy earthlings
play football. And if that was truly the case, the aliens still
don't know how Americans play football because this was rare. Many
teenagers and college students in their early 20s have video game
consoles in their rooms. I would bet that half of the players on
the UMass team couldn't go back to school and score 55 points
during a video game explosion.
</P>
<P>
   And that was the intrigue of Saturday. It was not virtual
reality. It was a scoring binge in real time. When NCAA officials
handed out the records sheet after the game, there were 10 new
entries. At one point in the second half a rushing rec-ord was
broken on every series. It was a battle between UMass running back
Marcel Shipp and Georgia Southern quarterback Greg Hill. When the
Minutemen had the ball late, the announcer would say, ``The
single-game rushing record belongs to Shipp.'' When the Eagles had
the ball he'd say, ``The single-game rushing rec-ord belongs to
Hill.'' Finally he said, ``The record belongs to Hill ... for
now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles may have been misled by Shipp. His voice reminds you
of a verbal tiptoe, so you might be surprised that a man who speaks
so softly can run so ferociously. He ran for 244 yards Saturday, 16
more than Hill. The first time Whipple saw him run in spring
practice, he made such a nice move on a linebacker that a position
coach whispered, ``Are we that bad on defense or is Marcel that
good?''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Southern can answer both questions. Shipp scored three
touchdowns. It took him just over two minutes to score his first,
on a 25-yard run. And linebackers Khari Samuel and Kole Ayi helped
force the Eagles into seven turnovers. Ayi, who walked on at UMass,
forced a first-quarter fumble and ran it in for a 9-yard touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Score after one: UMass 21, GSU 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told someone earlier in the week that it definitely was not
going to be a 10-9 game,'' Whipple said. The coach went on to say
that he thought ``45 (points) would be enough to get it done.'' He
did not smile when he said that. Think about it: It's one thing to
say that your team needs 45 points to win. It's quite another to
have confidence in your team's ability to score 45.
</P>
<P>
   That's only one reason Marcum should be a little nervous this
morning. Whipple took a team that was 2-9 last season and turned it
into the best group in the country. In only one year. He tinkered
with his quarterback, got a 100-meter champion from Florida (Jimmy
Moore) to play receiver, and recruited a few other players. But he
basically took the core from a last-place team and produced 12
wins. He is also an offensive nut. He instructed his team to begin
the game with an outrageous five-receiver flood set called,
``Chatta-nooga.'' He promised the players that they would run that
play to begin the game, regardless of starting position. He said he
did it to ``break up the tension'' on the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Whipple's play-calling. He likes to go for it on
fourth down, even if he can feel the shadow of his own end zone.
Against Lehigh, the Minutemen went for it on fourth and 1 from
their own 28. They made it. Saturday, Whipple was about to go for
an onside kick late in the second quarter and his team up 17
points. Georgia Southern coach Paul Johnson noticed this and put
his hands team on the field. Whipple was in their heads early. They
couldn't make halftime adjustments because what exactly were they
going to adjust to? Big-time programs pay attention to people like
Whipple. Don't be surprised in a couple weeks when his name pops up
as someone's coaching candidate for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Whipple's players were thanking him Saturday. He was the one who
told them to get over their low expectations and think about a
title. He wasn't always nice when he said it either. He once got on
Shipp during a road trip because he was not wearing a tie. He is a
man of details and discipline. The players learned to absorb those
qualities. Saturday they practiced them.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Eagles' players, defensive back Arkee Thompson, had
said during the week, ``My name is Arkee and I major in national
championships.'' The UMass players didn't say anything about that
comment until after the game, at which point they told Arkee that
he had better go to summer school.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, all the Minutemen smiled and made their way home.
The two-win team morphed into a 12-win team in one season. The
Minutemen are the best team in the country. It's not an opinion.
You can go to Amherst if you don't believe it. There you will find
players with mud on their jerseys, stories from the South in their
memories, and a trophy in their school's halls.

UMASS HANDLES DETROIT INSIDE AND OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMHERST, Mass. _ The University of Massachusetts basketball team
is glad to be home for the holidays. After a difficult series of
road games, the Minutemen returned for a 59-46 win over the
University of Detroit Saturday night, the first of a four-game home
stand.
</P>
<P>
   The Minutemen (3-5) capitalized on a big advantage at the low
post and effective perimeter play from Charlton Clarke, Jonathan
DePina, and Monty Mack in recovering from a somnambulant start
before a crowd of 6,726. Detroit (7-3) disrupted UMass with its
quickness, but the Minutemen were in command after Mack's 3-pointer
gave them a 16-14 edge midway through the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the time of year when we turn things around,'' Clarke
said. ``Everyone is gone from campus and there are no distractions,
no ringing phones. It's just us. It shouldn't take everyone going
home for us to do well, but that's the way we operate.''
</P>
<P>
   Clarke sparked the UMass attack, scoring 19 points on eight
field goal attempts. The Minutemen secured the inside, making room
for the perimeter game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to be more aggressive,'' Clarke said. ``When I am
aggressive and going to the basket, the team feeds off that, so
that was the focus for me. We had been standing around too much and
we had to open up our game and go to the basket.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the way we are supposed to play every night, and
tonight could be the start of that happening. We need to play that
way for the whole game.''
</P>
<P>
   Detroit displayed resourcefulness, despite an inept inside game.
Guard Rashad Phillips kept the Minutemen off balance and scored 20
points. The Minutemen countered with DePina in a three-guard
alignment in stretching their advantage midway through the second
half.
</P>
<P>
   DePina connected on successive field goals for a 46-33 advantage
with 8:52 remaining. The Titans pulled within 49-39 on Jermaine
Jackson's bank shot with 5:06 to go. But only Phillips scored after
that for Detroit as the Minutemen asserted themselves on two Lari
Ketner dunks and a Mike Babul foul shot for a 54-41 lead with 3:35
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lost to the No. 1 and No. 15 teams, to teams that were
8-2 and 6-2,'' UMass coach Bruiser Flint said. ``We've lost to some
pretty good teams on their home courts. We haven't played well but
we'll turn it around, I'm not worried about that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been playing some great defense. We played better
offense and (Clarke) made plays for us. We haven't made plays on
the offensive end all season.''
</P>
<P>
   Clarke set up Ketner for an alley-oop dunk off the opening tap.
But the Minutemen faltered until Clarke took command as the
Minutemen went on a 17-3 run. Clarke's 3-pointer gave UMass a 30-17
lead with 2:45 left. Detroit then scored the next 9 points before
Clarke converted successive drives for a 34-26 edge 2:40 into the
second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to (Clarke) before the game, `who told you you were a
3-point shooter?''' Flint said. ``I told him you have to take the
ball to the basket and get to the line. He's our best free throw
shooter.
</P>
<P>
   ``They call it a Tyson, he gets the ball and bulls his way to
the basket. He started to play with more aggression.''
</P>
<P>
   UMass, off to its worst start since 1986, seemed vulnerable in
the opening and closing minutes of the first half. The Minutemen's
lack of concentration, and Detroit's persistence, prevented the
margin of victory from being even greater.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans' lack of an inside game was a pleasant relief for the
Minutemen. Once 6-foot-11-inch Walter Craft displayed his
ineffectiveness, UMass played with an uninhibited style, defending
Detroit on the perimeter with an overplaying, switching man-to-man
defense.

LONG BEACH CAPS PERFECT SEASON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAMELA LEWIS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADISON, Wis. _ Call it the perfect ending to a perfect season.
Can you say 36-0?
</P>
<P>
   In one of the most dramaticamazing
</P>
<P>
   NCAA Division I volleyball championship matches ever, Long Beach
State went the distance Saturday to culminate a perfect season and
become the first national championship team to go undefeated.
</P>
<P>
   After taking a 2-0 lead in the match, the top-seeded 49ers
rallied from an 8-4 deficit in the rally-scoring fifth game to
defeat No. 2 seed Penn State, 15-3, 15-10, 13-15, 14-16, 15-12, in
the finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty-six and 0, the first NCAA undefeated team the best team
in my 14 years I've seen play volleyball,'' Long Beach coach Brian
Gimmillaro said. ``It was a glorious moment to see that ball go
down and the pure joy of the team. I jumped up there with them and
the joy in their eyes and their faces, it was really great. One of
the other things about volleyball is it happens suddenly. The clock
is running out, it's that last point. It's really an incredible
feeling that you go through when that last ball goes down.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for the 150 or so Long Beach fans who came along to
witness the end of a spectacular season, the 49ers silenced the
pro-Big 10 Conference, NCAA-record crowd of 13,194 at Kohl Center,
just like it did here in 1993 when it defeated the Nittany Lions in
the championship at the old University of Wisconsin Field House.
The 49ers also won the NCAA title in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Junior outside hitter Veronica Walls played the match of her
life, leading all 49ers with a career-high 19 kills and five
blocks.
</P>
<P>
   With two-time1998
</P>
<P>
   National Player of the Year Misty May serving match point, Walls
got the set from May right of center net and sent an off-speed shot
into an open right corner of the Nittany Lions' court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the opening,'' said Walls, who hit .455. ``I didn't hit
it really hard, but I saw the opening and I hit it to the corner.''
</P>
<P>
   Then it was time to celebrate, at least for the 49ers, who piled
on one another in the customary fashion teams do when they win
championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crowd was certainly a Big 10 crowd, which it should be,''
Gimmillaro said. ``I'm very excited they got a good show to see.
For our players to win under these circumstances is great.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first two games, the 49ers completely dominated Penn
State. Then they fought back from two consecutive game losses to
rally from four-point deficits twice in Game 5, in which points are
scored on each serve. They hit a whopping .556 in that game,
committing only one hitting error on 18 attempts.
</P>
<P>
   It was an incredible comeback for the 49ers, who outplayed the
Nittany Lions, while dealing them their first defeat in 36 matches.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers, ranked second in the nation in hitting percentage
behind Penn State, outhit the Nittany Lions, .328 to .166,
outblocked a supposedly better blocking team, 15 to 12, and outdug
them, 82-60. The 49ers had 17 more kills than Penn State and 10
less attack errors.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't a done deal until Walls' final hit.
</P>
<P>
   Penn State made a valiant comeback to force the fifth and
deciding game. Lauren Cacciamani, who had a match-high 33 kills,
took the match into her own hands and nearly succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   The Nittany Lions and took a 10-5 lead in the third game and
held off the 49ers' late surge. In Game 4, Cacciamani had 11 kills
to pace Penn State. The score was tied, 14-14, when Carrie
Schonveld and Emily Stout combined to block Benishe Dillard to make
it 15-14 and, four sideouts later, Lindsay Anderson solo-blocked
Anja Grabovac for game point.
</P>
<P>
   The Nittany Lions went up 6-2 and then 8-4 in Game 5 before the
momentum shifted back to the 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   Long Beach benefited from Anderson's attack error, then Jessica
Alvarado served three unanswered points to tie the score, 8-8.
</P>
<P>
   The score stayed close until the 49ers took their first lead on
a kill by Dillard. After Cacciamani tied the score for the fifth
time, the 49ers took the lead for good on a kill by Alvarado, who
followed up with another one to give Long Beach a two-point lead,
one point away from match point.
</P>
<P>
   Penn State called a timeout to try to slow the 49ers' momentum,
but it was too late as Walls ended the match with her 19th kill.
</P>
<P>
   It was an especially sweet victory for the three 49er seniors
who didn't want their careers to end without a championship ring.
Losing to Stanford in a national semifinal last year, of course,
was all the motivation May, Alvarado and Dillard needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming in as a freshman, it's always been our goal to win,''
said Dillard, who had 16 kills. ``We expected it but didn't know
when it was going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely learned a lot from last year,'' said May, who
finished with nine kills, 11 digs, and 70 assists. ``The feeling is
flipped around. We're on the winning side now. I knew we would do
it, but we just didn't know when. This was our year.''
</P>
<P>
   That last line unofficially served as the 49ers' motto this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We set lofty goals in the beginning,'' said Alvarado. ``We
wanted to go 36-0. That was our goal and we attained that goal and
I don't think it's hit home yet. It's going to take a little time.
But this is what we set out to do... and we've done it.''

SUN DEVILS THRILLED BATISTE MADE TRIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ No wonder Mike Batiste couldn't wait to
play.
</P>
<P>
   In a game for the ages, Arizona State beat Texas A&AMP;M, 96-91, in
triple overtime Saturday night, just the second three-overtime game
in school history.
</P>
<P>
   And Batiste was there. He took a plane, a car and a bus, but it
didn't matter. He would have run, walked or crawled to Reed Arena
if he had to.
</P>
<P>
   Batiste, academically ineligible for the first eight games of
the season, left Tempe in the morning and was in the starting
lineup. The 6-foot-8 forward scored 23 points and had 18 rebounds
in 50 minutes. But the real hero was junior guard Eddie House, who
scored 34 points, 31 after halftime and 11 in the third OT. He tied
the score in regulation. He sent the game into the second and third
overtimes. Then he broke an 86-86 tie with a three-pointer with 47
seconds left after ASU blew a nine-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   House's resurgence was due to ``not wanting to lose the
ballgame,'' he said. ``We prepared so hard and we wanted to come in
and make history because Texas A&AMP;M hadn't lost at their new
arena.''
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies were 5-0 at Reed, a 12,500-seat arena completed in
April.
</P>
<P>
   House, who played 53 minutes, said he didn't think he was
playing hard enough in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't competing,'' he said. ``I was lagging a little on
defense. Coach (Rob Evans) talked to me about it at halftime. I
thought I picked up my defense in the second half and the offense
came easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Batiste, meanwhile, surmounted deficiencies that threatened to
wipe out his senior season at ASU and got the necessary grades in
all six of his courses _ 18 credit hours _ during the fall
semester. In summer school, he had taken 12 hours. Batiste's last
final exam, in a justice class, was Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Batiste waited all day Friday in Tempe but heard nothing. The
team left without him. Finally, at about 11 a.m. Saturday, he got
the call. The grade was officially posted, and he was eligible.
Coaches found Batiste a flight to Austin, where assistant Dan
O'Dowd met him for the drive to the team hotel. They arrived at 6
p.m., 2{ hours before the game.
</P>
<P>
   A short bus ride to the arena later, Batiste had reached the
destination he had been thinking about since last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when I slept (Friday night), I was thinking about it,''
he said. ``I got up at 7 a.m. and I just waited. When the call
came, I was so relieved.''
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't the only one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good for Mike,'' said Evans, who interviewed for the
A&AMP;M job when it was vacant and thought he might get it. ``The kid
did everything he said he was going to do to rectify the
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   ASU (5-4) came out looking like a team that hadn't played in 11
days while trying to fit somebody new in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Batiste missed his first two shots and tumbled over the press
table chasing a loose ball. Then he got hot. He scored 11 of ASU's
next 13 points, and when House hit a three-pointer, the Sun Devils
trailed, 29-26, with 4:43 left in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Those were the last points of the half for ASU. Texas A&AMP;M (7-2)
scored seven straight to take a 36-26 lead into halftime. Aggies
Coach Melvin Watkins, waging a battle with Pac-10 officials Charlie
Range and Terry Christman, was hit with a technical foul as the
teams left the court.
</P>
<P>
   House made one of two free throws on the technical to start the
second half. Keyed by its defense, ASU went on an 18-5 run to take
a 45-43 lead with 7:58 to go.
</P>
<P>
   ASU went up by four on three occasions, but it went no further
than that, and the Aggies took a 54-53 lead with 3:28 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   A shot clock violation gave the Aggies the ball and Shanne Jones
scored to make the score 56-53. But House scrambled for a loose
ball and scored to get ASU within one with 2:04 to go. Then it was
Jones again, inside, for a three-point A&AMP;M lead. Lazor's put-back
made it 58-57, Aggies, with 58 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Cook made one of two free throws and A&AMP;M led by two with 50
seconds remaining. Alton Mason missed on a leaner in the lane with
30 seconds to go and Cook made one of two free throws. The Aggies
led by three, but House drilled a three-pointer with 10 seconds to
go and it was 60-60. A&AMP;M missed two chances to win and the game
went into overtime.
</P>
<P>
   House's basket with 47 seconds left in the first overtime tied
the score at 69 and Clayton missed a pair of three-pointers,
setting up a second extra period.
</P>
<P>
   And it was House again, hitting a three-pointer with seven
seconds left to create a third overtime. &QL;

UCLA ROUTS CSUN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(OPTIONAL: Adds quotes, details) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Jason Crowe's comment originated in the Cal State
Northridge gym Thursday afternoon, floated east along the 101,
turned south over the Sepulveda Pass and _ here's where he found
trouble _ settled in a certain Westwood locker room Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our best chance to beat UCLA,'' said Crowe, a CSUN guard
and Inglewood native. ``We feel we're just as talented as they
are.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruins coach Steve Lavin, searching for every morsel of
motivation after a tough week of final exams and pre-dawn
practices, immediately informed his players of the comment.
</P>
<P>
   They did not take it well. Not well at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of us know Jason, and we took it personally,'' UCLA
guard Rico Hines said. ``We wanted to jump on them early to prove a
point.''
</P>
<P>
   Forward Travis Reed was more succinct.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a slap in our face,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 12 Bruins responded by slapping the Matadors around with
a 114-97 victory Saturday in front of 8,584 at Pauley Pavilion, a
game more lopsided than the score indicated. UCLA held a 33-point
lead with 2:32 remaining before a late CSUN rally made the final
margin respectable.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a very, very poor showing for our program,'' said
Matadors coach Bobby Braswell, whose team committed 20 turnovers in
the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Lavin was just as upset and spent his postgame oxygen yelling at
his reserves, who played well for much of the game but lapsed in
the closing minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, Lavin had little to complain about. The Bruins
trailed 25-24 with 9:50 remaining in the first half, then unleashed
a devastating 20-0 surge that broke the game open. It spanned
nearly five minutes and ended with a dazzling pass from guard Baron
Davis to center Dan Gadzuric for a 44-25 lead that quieted the
mouthy Matadors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, I was mad at Jason Crowe,'' said Reed, who scored a
career-high 21 points. ``I don't want to get into any of that
stuff, but we were mad.''
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors (6-4) played without talented forward Rico Harris,
who missed his fourth consecutive game with a hip pointer. It
showed, as they scored just eight points in the final 10 minutes of
the first half and shuffled to the locker room with a 24-point
deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about it not becoming a track meet by taking bad
shots,'' Braswell said. ``Then we took bad shots.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, UCLA shot 65.2 percent from the field _ most of its
baskets in the 20-0 surge were layups and dunks _ and 53.8 percent
from 3-point range. CSUN had neither the size, speed nor stamina to
stay with the Bruins once they broke a sweat.
</P>
<P>
   Seven Bruins scored in double figures, but Davis and freshman
guard Ray Young made the greatest impressions. In his most
effective game since returning from knee surgery, Davis slashed and
dashed through CSUN's defense time and again, tying his career-high
with nine assists against two turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   The rapidly improving Young scored a career-high 14 points and
credited his play, in part, to Lavin's pre-dawn practices.
Tuesday's workout began at 5 a.m., meaning the Bruins arrived at
Pauley Pavilion at 4:15 for taping and stretching.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind it,'' Young said. ``It's better to know that by 8
a.m. you have your whole day to go to class, study and sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   To maintain timing and conditioning during exams, the Bruins
held three full-scale scrimmages, complete with uniforms, timeouts
and Pacific-10 officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``The three (scrimmages) we played this week carried over to
tonight,'' Lavin said. ``It's something I'm going to do for my
whole career. Now we've basically played five games in seven
days.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins (6-2) needed a few minutes to adjust to playing after
breakfast and allowed CSUN to score at will in the opening minutes.
Andre Larry and Jeff Paris dunked over Gadzuric and Jerome Moiso,
respectively, and when Greg Minor drained back-to-back 3-pointers,
UCLA's lead was 18-16.

<P>
   The teams exchanged baskets for several minutes until Brian
Heinle's 10-foot leaner gave CSUN its 25-24 lead. Two minutes
later, the game was over.
</P>
<P>
   Earl Watson started the blitz with a crisp bounce pass to Reed
for a layup. A minute later, reserve Ryan Bailey sliced through the
appropriately-named Matadors for an uncontested layup. JaRon Rush
buried a 3-pointer from the right corner, and Bailey teamed with
Gadzuric for a nifty give-and-go layup.
</P>
<P>
   By the time CSUN coach Bobby Braswell called timeout, UCLA had a
37-25 lead.

MATADORS MUST EAT THEIR WORDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(OPTIONAL: New lead) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Cal State Northridge players talked the past few
days about having as much talent as UCLA, which the Bruins used as
bulletin-board material.
</P>
<P>
   Not even a lopsided loss could make CSUN rethink those thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   Not even the ease in which UCLA repeatedly and embarrassingly
undermined the Matadors' defense would change CSUN's mind. None of
that held any bearing.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the wake of the 12th-ranked Bruins' 114-97 throttling of
CSUN at Pauley Pavilion on Saturday, the Matadors continued to say
things would be different if the teams met again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't affect anything,'' CSUN point guard Markus Carr
said. ``We still believe that if we got another chance to get
ourselves together and keep our focus, it would be a better game
for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The one person who did take a different stance was CSUN coach
Bobby Braswell.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious I didn't have this team prepared to play this
game,'' Braswell said. ``I take responsibility. There's a reason
UCLA is ranked where they are, because they're a very good
basketball team. I think our guys took that for granted, and that's
my responsibility, my fault.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we had a chance to at least make this thing
competitive and we didn't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The carnage was masked only by the Matadors (6-4) scoring 20
points in the final 2:21. It made the final gaudy instead of
obscene, but that matters not at all.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a benchmark victory that would give the program fame,
as the Matadors had talked about, CSUN experienced a meltdown that
will most likely make the next two days of practice hellish.
</P>
<P>
   And keep the Matadors an afterthought on the Los Angeles sports
scene.
</P>
<P>
   But the non-preparedness speaks more of what happened 10 minutes
into the game rather than the pregame, because CSUN held a 25-24
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Matadors defense became literal. An ole' here, an ole'
there. Transition defense didn't exist and UCLA put up 20 straight
points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost our enthusiasm and intensity and will to play
defense,'' Matadors forward Jeff Parris said. ``We lost our will.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't be fooled. CSUN lost a lot more. Like an opportunity to be
considered more than an early-season throw-away game for the
Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN may have juniors and seniors on its roster, but it proved
it's still a young team; there are seven first-year Matadors. And
CSUN also proved its immaturity.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't take us out of focus. We took ourselves out of
focus,'' Carr said. ``We took quick shots, didn't play our pressure
defense and we let them get easy buckets. We have to maintain our
focus through that and we didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN won't get another chance to earn respectability by beating,
or even being competitive with, UCLA for a few seasons. The two
teams aren't expected to meet again until the 2000 season. And it
just so happens the Bruins figure to be loaded then, with most of
its now-freshman talent set to be juniors.
</P>
<P>
   And when the time comes, perhaps CSUN should downplay any such
future meeting with the Bruins.

 &HT;    Party from the Pantry
 &HT;    WITH PANTRY-TIPS
 &HT;    By John Kessler

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Well, hey there!'' you beam as the unexpected arrivals
show up at the door.
</P>
<P>
   They're in town for the holidays. They wanted to bring by a
little gift. They hope it's not an inconvenient time.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no! Of course not! C'mon in,'' you beckon. You grab their
coats. You pour a glass of wine. You put on a pot of tea.
</P>
<P>
   They spy the bowl of holiday nuts on your coffee table. They
look vainly for a nutcracker. They don't find one. They don't know
the nuts have been there since Christmas 1996.
</P>
<P>
   You offer to get some cheese and crackers. You run to the
kitchen. You don't have crackers. You find a block of unwrapped
cheddar as cracked and creviced as desert clay.
</P>
<P>
   They drain their wineglasses. They shift in their seats. They
crack open your coffee-table book.
</P>
<P>
   You go on a tear through the fridge. You locate capers,
mayonnaise and a bowl of clam dip that's still there?? You think
about scraping the crusty top off. You decide against it.
</P>
<P>
   But then suddenly you recall a few simple tricks. Roasting
olives with dried rosemary. Thawing tortellini to dip in a quickly
made pesto.
</P>
<P>
   There are other nifty ideas as well. Onion toasts made with
sandwich bread and mayo. Parmesan cheese crisps. Baked artichoke
balls. With a few everyday ingredients in the pantry, you can feed
drop-in guests in style.
</P>
<P>
   As you get started, they wander into the kitchen. They bring
their empty wineglasses. They offer to help.
</P>
<P>
   You say, ``Let's have another glass in the kitchen,'' and offer
them a seat at the counter. You say you're just going to throw
together a few nibbles. Little do they know.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   STUFFED DATES: Pitted dates can be stuffed with cream cheese, or
most any other kind of cheese _ a good way to use up leftover bits
of cheese. They also can be stuffed with most any kind of nut.
</P>
<P>
   BREAD STICKS: Wrap with slices of salami or prosciutto.
</P>
<P>
   BITE-SIZE ROASTED VEGETABLES: Arrange on a platter and sprinkle
with a variety of olives.
</P>
<P>
   LEFTOVER CHEESE: Combine bits of compatible cheese in a food
processor. Add a little cream and process until smooth. Stir in
some chopped nuts, if desired. Use as a spread for crackers or
place a little dollop on slices of red pepper or apples.
</P>
<P>
   LEFTOVER BREAD: Slice bread thinly and cut into approximately 2-
to 3-inch pieces. Brush with olive oil and bake until barely crisp.
Spread with bottled olive or artichoke paste or tomato or basil
pesto. Always be generous with the bread, it stretches out whatever
else you serve. Or serve baskets of bread with bowls of flavored
olive oils for dunking. Garnish with a sprig of whatever the oil is
flavored with.
</P>
<P>
   LEFTOVER TURKEY: Arrange slices in a deep platter. Combine olive
oil, lemon juice, chopped basil and a little garlic. Pour over the
turkey slices. Cover and refrigerate for a couple of hours.
</P>
<P>
   HUMMUS: Surround a small bowl of hummus with a
Mediterranean-style cocktail buffet of olives and other pickled
foods.
</P>
<P>
   LEFTOVER HAM: Combine ham with some celery and onion in a food
processor. Stir in a little chopped parsley and sweet pickle relish
and black pepper to taste. Serve with crackers or slices of
baguette.
</P>
<P>
   SPICED NUTS: Toss nuts with butter, sugar, cinnamon and cayenne
pepper. Bake until lightly browned.
</P>
<P>
   ARUGULA: Wrap around smoked mussels, clams or oysters.
</P>
<P>
   BOILED EGGS: Cover while still warm with the juice from a jar of
pickled beets. Let stand in the refrigerator overnight.

(lb) 
 By SCOTT VEALE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; CASANOVA: THE MAN WHO REALLY LOVED WOMEN &LR;  By Lydia Flem.
Translated by Catherine Temerson. Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, $13. A
Belgian scholar argues that Casanova was far more than a sexual
athlete _ in his high-spirited virtuosity he was the embodiment of
the Enlightenment. ``Perpetually captivated by Casanova, as lover,
adventurer or wanderer, Flem makes us determined to seek out his
company,'' Jonathan Keates wrote in The New York Times Book Review
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PFITZ &LR;  By Andrew Crumey. Picador USA, $12. In this slender
novel, an 18th-century German prince mobilizes the collective
mental powers of his subjects to create an elaborate imaginary
city. Unfortunately, reality creeps into his vision of aesthetic
purity, in the form of a young cartographer who falls in love with
another worker. ```Pfitz' is a surprisingly warm and likable book,
a combination of intellectual high-wire act and good traditional
storytelling,'' Andrew Miller wrote in 1997. The author ``develops
his story with admirable rigor, seizing on both the comic and the
philosophical potential of a world in which the actual and the
imagined have become fatally blurred.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TAKING WING: ARCHAEOPTERYX AND THE EVOLUTION OF BIRD FLIGHT &LR;  By
Pat Shipman. Touchstone/Simon &AMP; Schuster, $15. When the fossilized
skeleton of a prehistoric creature that was half bird and half
reptile was discovered in Bavaria in 1861, it touched off a
long-running debate about the dinosaurian ancestry of birds. The
author of this account makes a strong case for such a link.
``Shipman brings to her excellent book the authority of a
paleontologist and the talent of an accomplished writer on science
for popular audiences,'' John Noble Wilford wrote earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AFTER MAN: A ZOOLOGY OF THE FUTURE &LR;  By Dougal Dixon. St.
Martin's Griffin, $15.95. This envisions the species on earth 50
million years from now, like the vortex, a giant whalelike creature
descended from penguins. In 1982 in The New York Times Book Review,
Timothy Ferris found this illustrated book full of ``endearing and
plausible specimens'' that ``engender reflection about the
mysterious forces at work beneath the skin of real animals.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PANTHER IN THE BASEMENT &LR;  By Amos Oz. Translated by Nicholas de
Lange. Harvest/Harcourt Brace, $11. A patriotic boy is accused of
treason after befriending a gentle British soldier in Jerusalem
just before Britain's departure from Palestine in 1947. In 1997 Lee
Siegel called this ``an insightful, inventive and lyrical'' novel
that uses ``the theme of betrayal to explore the status of the
individual in a country where public and private landscapes are
constantly merging.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE FAR EUPHRATES &LR; . By Aryeh Lev Stollman, Riverhead, $13. A
first novel about a lonely rabbi's son growing up in Ontario during
the 1950s and '60s and the extended family of troubled adults
around him. ```The Far Euphrates' is remarkable both for Stollman's
eloquently understated prose and for the ease with which he
constructs his artful plot,'' Margot Livesey wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE SEA OF TREES &LR;  By Yannick Murphy. Mariner/Houghton Mifflin,
$12. Set in Indochina during the 1940s, this first novel is
narrated by a girl who comes of age in a Japanese internment camp
and in postwar Saigon. ``Her story unfolds through a dreamlike
progression of glinting surfaces, telling gestures and precisely
rendered moments, in which matter-of-fact horror butts up against
absurdist hilarity,'' Catherine Bush wrote in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AT RISK &LR;  By Alice Hoffman. Berkley, $13. A middle-class
family's comfortable world is shaken to the core when their
11-year-old daughter contracts AIDS from a blood transfusion. ``In
its simplicity and directness and restraint there is very often a
compelling power'' to this novel, Jim Shepard said in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GERSHWIN &LR;  By Edward Jablonski. Da Capo, $17.95. The author
maintains that the brash optimism of George Gershwin's music was
emblematic of a vibrant young America rising to its potential in
the arts and business. In 1987 the reviewer Francis Davis said this
biography features ``a wealth of pertinent detail and fresh
musicological insight.'' The same publisher has reissued  &UR; THE
COMPLETE LYRICS OF IRA GERSHWIN &LR; , edited by Robert Kimball ($35),
which tracks the artistic growth of George's older brother and his
search for fresh ways to avoid cliches. In 1993 Sheldon Harnick
said this book should be ``in the home of everyone who has an
interest in the art of the musical theater.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EMPIRE OF LIGHT: A HISTORY OF DISCOVERY IN SCIENCE AND ART &LR;  By
Sidney Perkowitz. Joseph Henry, $16.95. A physics professor
explores the nature of light and the complex human responses to it,
as well as various theories of the phenomenon through the ages. In
1996 one critic called this a ``smoothly written, comprehensive and
thoroughly enjoyable'' overview written with ``a fine awareness of
light's appeal to our aesthetic senses.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SKULL SESSION &LR;  By Daniel Hecht. Signet, $6.99. An out-of-work
teacher with Tourette's syndrome, hired to fix up a vandalized
Hudson Valley estate, finds that the damage may be linked to some
missing high school students. This is ``an accomplished first novel
... that keeps the reader guessing till the very end,'' Charles
Salzberg wrote this year.

requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,

 By SCOTT VEALE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; CASANOVA: THE MAN WHO REALLY LOVED WOMEN &LR;  By Lydia Flem.
Translated by Catherine Temerson. Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, $13. A
Belgian scholar argues that Casanova was far more than a sexual
athlete _ in his high-spirited virtuosity he was the embodiment of
the Enlightenment. ``Perpetually captivated by Casanova, as lover,
adventurer or wanderer, Flem makes us determined to seek out his
company,'' Jonathan Keates wrote in The New York Times Book Review
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PFITZ &LR;  By Andrew Crumey. Picador USA, $12. In this slender
novel, an 18th-century German prince mobilizes the collective
mental powers of his subjects to create an elaborate imaginary
city. Unfortunately, reality creeps into his vision of aesthetic
purity, in the form of a young cartographer who falls in love with
another worker. ```Pfitz' is a surprisingly warm and likable book,
a combination of intellectual high-wire act and good traditional
storytelling,'' Andrew Miller wrote in 1997. The author ``develops
his story with admirable rigor, seizing on both the comic and the
philosophical potential of a world in which the actual and the
imagined have become fatally blurred.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TAKING WING: ARCHAEOPTERYX AND THE EVOLUTION OF BIRD FLIGHT &LR;  By
Pat Shipman. Touchstone/Simon &AMP; Schuster, $15. When the fossilized
skeleton of a prehistoric creature that was half bird and half
reptile was discovered in Bavaria in 1861, it touched off a
long-running debate about the dinosaurian ancestry of birds. The
author of this account makes a strong case for such a link.
``Shipman brings to her excellent book the authority of a
paleontologist and the talent of an accomplished writer on science
for popular audiences,'' John Noble Wilford wrote earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AFTER MAN: A ZOOLOGY OF THE FUTURE &LR;  By Dougal Dixon. St.
Martin's Griffin, $15.95. This envisions the species on earth 50
million years from now, like the vortex, a giant whalelike creature
descended from penguins. In 1982 in The New York Times Book Review,
Timothy Ferris found this illustrated book full of ``endearing and
plausible specimens'' that ``engender reflection about the
mysterious forces at work beneath the skin of real animals.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PANTHER IN THE BASEMENT &LR;  By Amos Oz. Translated by Nicholas de
Lange. Harvest/Harcourt Brace, $11. A patriotic boy is accused of
treason after befriending a gentle British soldier in Jerusalem
just before Britain's departure from Palestine in 1947. In 1997 Lee
Siegel called this ``an insightful, inventive and lyrical'' novel
that uses ``the theme of betrayal to explore the status of the
individual in a country where public and private landscapes are
constantly merging.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE FAR EUPHRATES &LR; . By Aryeh Lev Stollman, Riverhead, $13. A
first novel about a lonely rabbi's son growing up in Ontario during
the 1950s and '60s and the extended family of troubled adults
around him. ```The Far Euphrates' is remarkable both for Stollman's
eloquently understated prose and for the ease with which he
constructs his artful plot,'' Margot Livesey wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE SEA OF TREES &LR;  By Yannick Murphy. Mariner/Houghton Mifflin,
$12. Set in Indochina during the 1940s, this first novel is
narrated by a girl who comes of age in a Japanese internment camp
and in postwar Saigon. ``Her story unfolds through a dreamlike
progression of glinting surfaces, telling gestures and precisely
rendered moments, in which matter-of-fact horror butts up against
absurdist hilarity,'' Catherine Bush wrote in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AT RISK &LR;  By Alice Hoffman. Berkley, $13. A middle-class
family's comfortable world is shaken to the core when their
11-year-old daughter contracts AIDS from a blood transfusion. ``In
its simplicity and directness and restraint there is very often a
compelling power'' to this novel, Jim Shepard said in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GERSHWIN &LR;  By Edward Jablonski. Da Capo, $17.95. The author
maintains that the brash optimism of George Gershwin's music was
emblematic of a vibrant young America rising to its potential in
the arts and business. In 1987 the reviewer Francis Davis said this
biography features ``a wealth of pertinent detail and fresh
musicological insight.'' The same publisher has reissued  &UR; THE
COMPLETE LYRICS OF IRA GERSHWIN &LR; , edited by Robert Kimball ($35),
which tracks the artistic growth of George's older brother and his
search for fresh ways to avoid cliches. In 1993 Sheldon Harnick
said this book should be ``in the home of everyone who has an
interest in the art of the musical theater.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EMPIRE OF LIGHT: A HISTORY OF DISCOVERY IN SCIENCE AND ART &LR;  By
Sidney Perkowitz. Joseph Henry, $16.95. A physics professor
explores the nature of light and the complex human responses to it,
as well as various theories of the phenomenon through the ages. In
1996 one critic called this a ``smoothly written, comprehensive and
thoroughly enjoyable'' overview written with ``a fine awareness of
light's appeal to our aesthetic senses.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SKULL SESSION &LR;  By Daniel Hecht. Signet, $6.99. An out-of-work
teacher with Tourette's syndrome, hired to fix up a vandalized
Hudson Valley estate, finds that the damage may be linked to some
missing high school students. This is ``an accomplished first novel
... that keeps the reader guessing till the very end,'' Charles
Salzberg wrote this year.

   IRAQ-US _ BAGHDAD _ With four days of air strikes by U.S. and
British forces over, the Iraqi government claims victory as
President Saddam Hussein is still standing and United Nations
weapons inspectors gone. Iraqi officials take foreign journalists
on a tour of Basra in southern Iraq, where cruise missiles damaged
precious oil fields. As U.S. and British defense officials begin to
assess just how much damage they may, or may not have done, the one
thing becoming immediatelt clear is the anger on the part of Arabs
_ and not just in Iraq. Developing. (Kaplow, Cox News Service)

   RHODES _ ATHENS, Ga. _ There probably is a profile and resume
that fits the conventional image of a Rhodes Scholar. And then,
there is Beth Shapiro. She is the University of Georgia's 18th
Rhodes Scholar and its first female Rhodes Scholar. If the Rhodes
image is simply academic excellence achieved by burrowing through a
rigorous tunnel of narrow academic pursuits, then you wouldn't
picture Beth. Shapiro, who sings a little jazz and enjoys a little
Wild Turkey, is a blaze of engery going in a lot of directions.

   DICKENS-CHRISTMAS-CAROL (Lone Jack, Mo.) _ Charles Dickens' ``A
Christmas Carol'' could be America's most significant _ secularly
speaking _ holiday legend. About 10 percent of the nonprofit
professional theaters in the United States are staging ``A
Christmas Carol'' right now. And that doesn't include the countless
amateur productions. By Bruce Weber.

Scrooge from actors who portray him. By Bruce Weber.
</P>
<P>
   BRITAIN-POET-LAUREATE (London) _ The job pays only about $165 a
year, plus a case of Spanish sherry. It is meant to be a great
honor, but is often considered faintly embarrassing. In the last 15
years it has required an unironic belief in the grave national
importance of events like the wedding of the Duke of York and Sarah
Ferguson, also known as Fergie. Why on earth would anyone want to
be Britain's poet laureate? By Sarah Lyall.
</P>
<P>
   HELLMAN-AUTHOR-PROFILE (Undated) _ Rosemary Mahoney spent two
months before her senior year in high school working for Lillian
Hellman; and when she wasn't washing dishes or answering the phone,
she kept a journal about what became a summer from hell at the
hands of the great lady of American letters. Those notes have
become the latest book about Hellman, ``A Likely Story: One Summer
With Lillian Hellman.'' An interview with Ms. Mahoney. By Alex
Witchel.
</P>

   KADDISH-BOOK-REVIEW (Undated) _ ``Kaddish'' is a meticulously
learned yet intensely personal and impassioned record by Leon
Wieseltier of his quest to understand the meaning of this Jewish
prayer of mourning. David Stern reviews.
</P>
<P>
   TV-TERRORISM-REVIEW (Undated) _ If you have lost track, amid the
unfamiliar names and murky allegations of who is supposed to have
done what in the year's terrorist bombings in East Africa, Monday

higher-than-expected earnings and strong revenue for its fourth
fiscal quarter. But while praising the company's improved
management and new products, analysts generally retained a cautious
outlook on Adobe's stock. By Lawrence M. Fisher
</P>
<P>
   EMAIL-VIRUS (Undated) _ Computer security experts are warning
clients about a new software virus that is spread by e-mail,
infects Microsoft Word files and has already caused several
networks to crash. By Rebecca Fairley Raney.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-FINANCIERS (Undated) _ Last year, flush with money from the
bull market in stocks and seeing a big upside potential in
inexpensive little films, three independent film companies were set
up by players better known as financiers than auteurs. Driving
their ambitions was the quest to find a movie as successful as Fox
Searchlight's ``Full Monty,'' a 1997 release that cost only $3.5

lived through the brutal advertising recession of the early 1990s
or the run-up in newsprint prices three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Since September, staff reductions have been announced at The
Wall Street Journal, at The Dallas Morning News and twice over at
The Los Angeles Times. From midsummer on, advertising revenue was
down unexpectedly in markets like Boston, Dallas, Los Angeles and
San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago _ even three years ago _ bulletins like these sent
shivers through newsroom executives, many of whom were forced to
reduce both their staffs and the space dedicated to news, features
and editorials. In 1995, Wall Street analysts sent the price of
Times Mirror Co.'s stock up 70 percent in the first three months
after the company's chief executive, Mark Willes, closed New York
Newsday and cut newsroom staffs at The Los Angeles Times and The
Baltimore Sun.
</P>
<P>
   There was not much evidence to contradict the popular belief
that Wall Street was the newsroom's enemy.
</P>
<P>
   But, for a change, the financial community that once seemed
indifferent, if not downright pleased, about the budgetary squeeze
on journalists is emerging as the newsroom's ally. For the moment,
at least.
</P>
<P>
   Even those newspapers cutting their work forces are barely
grazing their newsrooms. At The Los Angeles Times, there have been
cutbacks in regional editions, but increases in staff in other
areas, like financial news coverage. All told, perhaps 5 percent of
the 750 jobs being eliminated at The Los Angeles Times affect the
newsroom. At The Wall Street Journal, 136 people took advantage of
the recent buyout offer; 11 of them were in the newsroom and some
of them may be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Newsrooms have a bottom-line function, analysts said. Stronger
news coverage may help stem circulation declines. And in the
cacophony of the Internet, a distinctive editorial voice may be a
crucial advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The word ``journalism'' was notable for its absence during
interviews with financial analysts at a Paine Webber media
conference this month. Still, Douglas Arthur of Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter &AMP; Co. acknowledged, ``If you invest in color presses and you
invest in editorial, it sells papers and drives circulation, and
that's the point.''
</P>
<P>
   Arthur, who reads three papers daily _ The New York Times, The
Wall Street Journal and The New York Post _ is the brother of John
Arthur, managing editor for regional editions at The Los Angeles
Times.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur reads the industry's recent history as a tale of
companies undergoing a fundamental restructuring on the fly, and
sometimes overreacting. After the recession, he said, ``there was a
lot of cost-cutting, asset restructuring and union negotiations in
an effort to get labor costs under control; now there's a renewed
focus on the product.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Kevin Gruneich's first jobs was delivering The Des Moines
(Iowa) Register to his neighbors. When his old paper was bought by
Gannett Co., and its prized role as a statewide voice was trimmed _
along with distribution costs _ Gruneich, now an analyst with Bear,
Stearns, felt a twinge of regret. ``I hated to see the pullback
from full statewide distribution,'' he said. But the decision to
limit distribution to the areas closer to Des Moines, he said, made
financial sense.
</P>
<P>
   If forced to choose between the old, more expensive statewide
focus and the current plan, ``I'd probably come down on the
hard-eyed side,'' he said. ``There are 1,500 daily newspapers in
the country. I don't think there's any civic obligation for The Des
Moines Register to deliver everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to investment in journalism, as opposed to
distribution systems, he makes finer distinctions. Asked if Wall
Street was more sensitive to the value of newsrooms, he said,
``Absolutely.'' Why? ``In a more electronic future, the infinite
fragmentation that is the Internet means that you're really going
to have to have a brand that stands out,'' he said. ``If you keep
moving it down to the lowest common denominator, you're going to be
lost in the clutter.''
</P>
<P>
   When Lauren Rich Fine of Merrill Lynch Global Securities talks
to newspaper company executives, the first question she says she is
asked is, ``What does Wall Street think about Pulitzer Prizes?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The quick response I usually give is, `For the most part, they
don't care, unless it involves the paper they're reading,''' she
said. ``Then they care a lot.'' New York Times Co., she added,
``has been able to get away with lower margins because it's
universally accepted that we don't want the paper to cut back on
the newsroom because it offers in-depth analysis.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fine is not averse to newsroom spending _ if it can be done
efficiently. ``The culture of the newsroom,'' as she sees it, is
that journalists ``have historically held themselves apart, that
they are doing something for the good of mankind.'' But, she added,
``if you've chosen to be a public company, shareholder and God
aren't always perfectly aligned in terms of what they want.''
</P>
<P>
   Willes, a lightning rod for controversy since the cuts he made
as the chief executive of Times Mirror, is cautious about the idea
that financial analysts were once hostile to news budgets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there was a lot of question, initially, about whether
there was discipline on the cost side,'' Willes said in a recent
interview. ``As organizations increasingly demonstrate discipline
on the cost side, but also say, `We're going to continue to
maintain and improve the editorial quality' _ that's the message
they want to hear.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, we're financial analysts,'' William
Drewry of Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette said, who ``tend to be
reflecting more quantitatively than qualitatively.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not recommending one stock over another because you
think their newspaper is better,'' he said. ``You're recommending
it because the earnings growth is better.''

 &HT;    
 &HT;    Wearable computers are considerably less geeky than they used to
be. But the day when average Americans wear one as nonchalantly as
they wear a Walkman CD player is still several years in the future.
 &HT;    When that day does come, though, Xybernaut Corp. contends it
will be poised to reap the rewards from a patent portfolio it has
been building since the early 1990s.
 &HT;    This month Xybernaut received its ninth and, the company says,
most substantial American patent. The latest patent covers, for
example, a headset operated by a remote computer through radio,
satellite or cellular transmissions.
 &HT;    ``That means you don't have to wear the processor,'' said James
Ralabate, who was Xerox Corp.'s general patent counsel during the
1970s and who is now with Xybernaut.
 &HT;    ``You could have several headsets functioning off a remote host
computer, for example,'' he said. ``And it covers three types of
activation: voice, eye and brain activation.''
 &HT;    Not that Xybernaut has such a product on the market just yet.
Last week it announced its latest model: a mostly speech-activated
computer powered by a 22-ounce processor that straps onto a
person's belt and contains 128 megabytes of RAM and a 4.3-gigabyte
hard drive. This version has a head-mounted display system, which
gives the same viewing ability as a 15-inch monitor viewed at two
feet, the company says. ``What you're wearing on your belt is
essentially your laptop,'' said Michael Jenkins, chief technology
officer at Xybernaut.
 &HT;    Among those testing Xybernaut's technology, the company says,
are the U.S. Customs Service, Mercedes-Benz, Lockheed-Martin and
the U.S. Navy.
 &HT;    Xybernaut's president, Edward Newman, called the latest patent
the linchpin in the company's patent portfolio.
 &HT;    ``With this you can have multiple headsets operated by a remote
computer, like nodes on a network,'' he said. ``It totally frees up
the paradigm of wearables. This is the patent we've been waiting
for.''
 &HT;    The actual technology will require more waiting, however. The
company said it could not say exactly when such computers would be
on the market. Xybernaut received patent 5,844,824.

   Ashes to Trees
</P>
<P>
   Many patents cover gravestones, caskets and other aspects of the
funeral industry. But Mac Truong of New York City has patented an
altogether different concept: the planting of trees to pay tribute
to the dead.
</P>
<P>
   The patent covers trees ``grown from seed or seedling in a
nutrient composition featuring the dirt-like material, preferably
ashes, derived from the remains of a deceased human.''
</P>
<P>
   Truong envisions a ``memorial forest,'' with each tree bearing a
plaque identifying the person whose ashes the tree was grown in.
</P>
<P>
   He received patent 5,799,488.

   Royalties Increase at Universities
</P>
<P>
   The amount of money that universities received in patent
royalties more than doubled in five years, according to a report
released last week by the Association of University Technology
Managers. Universities and research institutions received $611
million in licensing fees during 1997, up from $248 million in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, licensing income in 1997 was less than 2.5 percent of
the total that universities spent during the year on overall
research.
</P>
<P>
   The universities reaping the most from patents in 1997 were the
University of California ($67 million), Stanford ($51.7 million),
Columbia ($50 million), Florida State ($29.9 million) and the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology ($21 million).
</P>
<P>
   Patents are available by number for $3 from the Patent and
Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231.

MARKET PLACE: PRAISE FOR ADOBE TEMPERED BY CAUTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a bruising year and a large-scale restructuring, Adobe
Systems Inc. delivered higher-than-expected earnings and strong
revenue for its fourth fiscal quarter. But while praising the
company's improved management and new products, analysts generally
retained a cautious outlook on Adobe's stock.
</P>
<P>
   Most agree that Adobe management has done a very job job of
turning the company around. They said they expected Adobe to return
to sustained strong earnings growth, but probably not in the next
two quarters, so there is no need to chase the stock at this point.
</P>
<P>
   But a longtime Adobe bull said this is exactly the time to buy
shares, before the strong growth potential of forthcoming products
is obvious.
</P>
<P>
   A new threat is Photo Draw 2000, a combined photography and
graphics program from Microsoft, which has long coveted Adobe's
lead in the publishing and imaging software business.
</P>
<P>
   But most analysts said the Microsoft product, which will likely
be bundled with the Office 2000 suite, lacks the power and
capability demanded by graphics professionals, who are Adobe's core
market. Adobe's consumer product, Photo Deluxe, benefits from
bundling itself, as it is packaged with most of the new digital
cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Adobe had a large presence in Japan and suffered early from the
recession there. As a result, it reported a 33 percent drop in
third-quarter earnings on a 3 percent drop in revenue, and
announced that it was cutting 350 employees, or about 12 percent of
its work force. The weakness attracted a hostile takeover offer
from its leading rival, Quark, which was later withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   Sales to Japan remain depressed, but Adobe received a quick
payoff from the restructuring combined with unexpectedly strong
sales of a new version of Illustrator, its core graphics product,
to deliver fourth-quarter earnings several cents above the
consensus of forecasts. Acrobat, Adobe's portable
document-formatting software, although an older product, also had
record sales, driven by its widespread use on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Adobe reported late Wednesday that its earnings for the fiscal
fourth quarter, ending on Nov. 27, totaled $50.3 million, or 78
cents a diluted share, up 7.5 percent from the period a year
earlier. Revenue rose 8.6 percent, to $246.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 2 cents a share came from an increase in the value of
Adobe's venture capital fund, and about 6 cents from the repurchase
of 6.8 million shares. Without those items, Adobe earned 70 cents a
share; analysts had expected 64 cents, according to First Call.
</P>
<P>
   Adobe shares had actually fallen in advance of the earnings
report, on rumors the earnings would fall below forecasts, and then
bounced back on Thursday, climbing $5.73, or 15 percent, in Nasdaq
trading. On Friday, it gained a further 62.5 cents, to $44.50.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts made only modest changes in their first-quarter
1999 estimates, and did not change their recommendations on the
stock. Of 11 polled by First Call, eight rate Adobe a hold, three a
buy and just one a strong buy.
</P>
<P>
   Among the analysts who retained a hold rating on Adobe was Jay
Vleeschhouwer of Merrill Lynch. ``We do think they can do 15
percent revenue growth across fiscal 1999 as a whole,'' he said,
``but the bulk of that growth is likely to come at the end of the
year. At a management level, the move to improve financial and
operational controls should improve the predictability of the
business.''
</P>
<P>
   John Warnock, Adobe's chairman and chief executive, said he was
not surprised that analysts' ratings remained unchanged. ``We went
through a major restructuring, and they are looking for more than
one quarter,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he said he was confident of the company's ability to deliver
more strong results in the coming year, adding, ``We're very
focused on operational efficiency, setting goals for ourselves and
measuring our performance against those goals. I am intensely
involved at all levels.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Like any software company, Adobe's sales increase with the
release of new programs. The release of the latest version of
Illustrator drove record sales in the fourth quarter, aided by
Photoshop, Adobe's software for the digital management and
manipulation of photographs, the latest version of which is roughly
two quarters old. A major upgrade to Pagemaker, Adobe's page-layout
program, is expected in March or April. Some analysts are already
calling it a ``Quark killer.''
</P>
<P>
   But Robert Fagin of CIBC Oppenheimer downgraded Adobe from a buy
to a hold last week because he thinks the new Pagemaker, code-named
K-2, is really an enterprise-level product, meaning that it will be
critical to the operations of the big publishers who use it.
Approaching the dreaded year 2000, corporations will defer
deploying any such programs, including K-2, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not an Adobe-centric issue,'' Fagin said.
``Fundamentally, the company has turned a corner, but there's a
macro issue looming in the future that will be difficult for any
software company that deals with corporations.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``We think K-2 is a great product. Over a three-year
period, it could be a half-billion-dollar opportunity. We just
think it will start six months late.''
</P>
<P>
   Warnock takes issue with that analysis, pointing out that many
big publishers have substantial year 2000 problems that he said
could be resolved by deploying K-2. But in any case, he said Adobe
expects early sales to be driven by existing Pagemaker users, not
big corporations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Pagemaker market really is the small graphics arts houses
that have two or three Macintoshes,'' he said. ``They can do their
Y2K evaluation in a weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Murphy, editor of the California Technology Stock
Letter, also said that the year 2000 worry is misguided, and added
that any damage it does to Adobe shares presents a buying
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will have a May-quarter launch for K-2, and it will be a
very fast conversion,'' he said. ``All of us Pagemaker users are
crying out for the change. We expect to see a steady increase in
estimates for 1999 as management proves they can successfully
introduce these new products and bump up the growth rate while
maintaining the recent cost cuts.''
</P>
<P>
   His advice: ``Buy on a dip to $45 for a target of $75.''

SCHWAB GETS NET SHY

<TEXT>
<P>
   Consumers dreaming of an e-Christmas free of the hassles of
crowds have been rushing online to shop in record numbers. While
Internet merchants are delivering plenty of convenience, they are
offering up plenty of e-reality as well. In the past weeks, some of
the best-known sites have experienced slowdowns and even service
outages.
</P>
<P>
   Among sites with traffic troubles was BarnesandNoble.com, the
Internet outpost of the retail book giant Barnes &AMP; Noble. The site
was processing orders at a snail's pace on Tuesday, and the company
blamed surging holiday traffic. Another site that has faltered
under holiday demand was IBM's much advertised Startrekstore.com,
which went out of service for several days almost as soon as it
went online just before Thanksgiving. And Macys.com has repeatedly
had troubles processing customer orders since its relaunch on Nov.
18.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Sanger, vice president of corporate affairs for Federated
Department Stores Inc., which owns Macy's, said the Macy's delays
had been caused by an ``incredible'' interest in the site. ``We've
been receiving 10 million hits a day,'' she said. ``So for us, this
is kind of a good news-bad news story.''
</P>
<P>
   David Baltaxe, an Internet commerce analyst with Current
Analysis, which gathers industry intelligence for private clients,
says companies that advertised heavily should have anticipated such
problems: ``It is amazing that all these companies hyping
electronic commerce have run face-first into capacity problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The sheer volume of holiday shoppers was not to blame for all
the more notable failures. E-Bay, the popular Internet auction
service, experienced three system outages over the last two weeks,
one because of a hardware failure and two because of software
problems that Mike Wilson, the company's vice president for product
development and site operations, said were ``completely unrelated
to demand.''

   ASTRONAUTS GET MAIL; MICROSOFT GETS A FOOTHOLD
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail revolution has breached another frontier _ space.
</P>
<P>
   The space shuttle Endeavour finished a 12-day mission last
Tuesday that was the first on which crew members could routinely
send and receive e-mail, using notebook computers and ``smart
modems'' developed by NASA engineers to overcome problems in data
communications from space.
</P>
<P>
   The five astronauts and one cosmonaut could send e-mail to
colleagues and family much as they would on Earth. The 620 messages
they sent were mostly personal, dealing with Christmas preparations
and the like, says John Grunsfeld, chief of NASA's astronaut
computer branch.
</P>
<P>
   Many messages were sent up as well. In one, a crew member, James
Newman, received snapshots of his wife and two young children from
Grunsfeld, who had scanned them and sent them as e-mail
attachments.
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail was restricted to family, other astronauts and NASA
mission personnel. ``The last thing I'd want in space is to have to
wade through all my terrestrial e-mail,'' Grunsfeld said.
</P>
<P>
   But he says the astronauts have been pushing NASA hard to have
``our workplace in space mirror our workplace on earth in terms of
access to information technology.''
</P>
<P>
   The software technology they use is largely supplied by
Microsoft Corp. and includes the Windows operating system with its
Outlook Express e-mail program.
</P>
<P>
   Is NASA concerned about extending what another branch of the
government terms the ``Microsoft monopoly'' into space? ``Despite
the Justice Department's case, we don't really worry about that
here on Earth,'' Grunsfeld said. ``Now if I were running a software
company on Mars, I might be concerned.''

   SCHWAB BACKS AWAY FROM SOME INTERNET TRADES
</P>
<P>
   In the volatile and warp-speed world of online trading, Charles
Schwab &AMP; Co. has blinked.
</P>
<P>
   Saying it wants to protect overzealous investors from market
volatility _ and from themselves _ Schwab, a discount broker based
in San Francisco, is no longer accepting trades over the Internet
for stocks of some companies on the first day they are available
for public trading.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, for example, it would not accept online trades on
Tuesday for Infospace.com, an Internet content aggregator that went
public that day. Schwab customers were still able to purchase the
shares over the phone on their first days of trading, and online
trading resumed for the stock on the day after its initial
offering.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab officials said the policy was implemented at the end of
November to protect clients and the company's own bottom line. Tom
Taggart, a Schwab spokesman, said that in the case of some
offerings, investors place online orders to buy the stock at the
market price, but by the time the trades are actually executed, the
stock costs significantly more than the investors had expected to
pay.
</P>
<P>
   Taggart said that even when investors specified a price, market
volatility resulted in ``an inordinate amount of changing and
canceling of orders.''
</P>
<P>
   Taggart said the company would restrict trading on only a
handful of stocks it identified as likely candidates for volatility
_ among them Marketwatch.com and Pacific Internet, which are
expected to go public shortly.

   AN OLD HAND AT START-UPS MOVES ON FROM I-VILLAGE
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When photographers took pictures of the three
founders of I-Village, the New York Internet service for women,
they often tried to place Robert Levitan in the center. This proved
to be a repeated annoyance to Candice Carpenter, the company's
chief executive, and Nancy Evans, its editor in chief.
</P>
<P>
   Levitan, 33, was decidedly the junior partner, but he provided
some visual variety in a company of, by and for women.
</P>
<P>
   No more. Earlier this month, just as I-Village was preparing for
an initial public stock offering, Levitan quietly departed.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, after selling his first start-up, Levitan was
recruited by Ms. Carpenter to help with a consulting assignment for
America Online. Later she invited him to join in starting
I-Village.
</P>
<P>
   Levitan brought in the revenue, selling advertising sponsorships
to big consumer products companies _ $20 million worth by his own
count. But last May, Ms. Carpenter hired John Glascott, a former
top sales executive with Hearst, to take over sponsorship sales,
and Levitan moved over to run the company's health information
site. When his stock holdings vested last fall, he began making
plans to leave the company.
</P>
<P>
   He said last week that he was eager to move on to another
start-up, which he described as involving electronic gift
certificates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was ready for another challenge,'' he said. ``I will go on
to do things that are as big or bigger than I-Village.''

ADVERTISING: AGENCY PERSONNEL CHANGES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The year may be winding down, but executive changes at agencies
show no signs of following suit. There were shifts late last week
at shops including Messner Vetere Berger McNamee Schmetterer Euro
RSCG, Partners &AMP; Shevack/Wolf, D'Arcy Masius Benton &AMP; Bowles
Communications and Digital Pulp.
</P>
<P>
   The broadest changes came at Messner Vetere in New York, a unit
of Havas Advertising, which restructured top management. Ron
Berger, 49, who had been one of four managing partners in an office
of the chief executive, sharing administrative and management
duties, becomes the sole chief executive. He continues as chief
creative officer.
</P>
<P>
   The other three managing partners _ Tom Messner, 54; Louise
McNamee, 49, and Barry Vetere, 55 _ become partners, focusing on
offering clients advice on strategy, marketing and advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``The agency has grown over the last four years from under $600
million in billings to close to $1.2 billion,'' Berger said in a
telephone interview on Friday, ``as we've produced global work for
major clients like Intel, Philips, Volvo and MCI Worldcom. It
became clear to us that the agency needed to be organized around
the scope of those needs.''
</P>
<P>
   The other major aspect of the restructuring involves the
appointments of 10 partners to the new positions of managing
directors.
</P>
<P>
   Six are creative executives, paired in three teams: Michael Lee,
46, with Paul Wolfe, 51; Joe O'Neill, 52, with Marcus Kemp, 47, and
Phil Silvestri, 44, with Rich Roth, 56.
</P>
<P>
   The others are: Tom Carroll, 43, who will oversee business
development; Larry Dexheimer, 57, agency operations, Denis Glennon,
47, worldwide agency affiliations, and Joanne Tilove, 50, the MCI
Worldcom account.
</P>
<P>
   At Partners &AMP; Shevack/Wolf, a New York-based unit of Wolf Group,
Mike Rogers is joining as executive creative director. That post
had been vacant since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers, 47, had most recently been vice chairman and chief
creative officer at the DDB Needham New York unit of Omnicom Group,
where he worked on campaigns for clients like the New York state
lottery and Michelin. He resigned from DDB Needham New York in July
after almost 18 years there.
</P>
<P>
   At DMB&AMP;B, a unit of MacManus Group in New York, Garry Titterton
has been named to the new position of president for the
Asia-Pacific region, based in Hong Kong. The position is being
created, effective on Jan. 11, as DMB&AMP;B regroups various
Asian-Pacific offices under a single regional organization.
</P>
<P>
   Titterton, 50, joins DMB&AMP;B from McCann-Erickson Worldwide
Advertising, part of the McCann-Erickson World Group unit of
Interpublic Group of Cos., where he had been executive vice
president for the Asia-Pacific region, based in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   At Digital Pulp in New York, which specializes in Internet
advertising, a new top executive is being hired from a client
company. He is Lee Nadler, 31, who joins from Double Click Inc. in
New York, where he had held two titles; one was straightforward,
director for global marketing, and the other was fanciful,
marketing sherpa.
</P>
<P>
   At Digital Pulp, Nadler becomes chief executive, a new position,
and president, assuming those duties from Steven Sachs, president
and creative director. Sachs, 32, takes the new post of chief
creative director. Nadler will also take a fanciful title at
Digital Pulp, lead sherpa.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Goodman, 33, who founded Digital Pulp with Sachs and had
been vice president and creative director, becomes chief Web
architect, a new post.
</P>
<P>
   In another personnel move related to Internet advertising, Rich
LeFurgy has joined Ad Knowledge in Palo Alto, Calif., as a
consultant, to start and head a strategic advisory board. LeFurgy,
42, will be based in New York, where he continues as chairman of
the Internet Advertising Bureau, an industry association.
</P>
<P>
   LeFurgy also remains the chairman of the FAST Forward Steering
Committee, which was formed in response to a call from Procter &AMP;
Gamble Co. to speed the development of Internet advertising.

`KADDISH': DISSECTING A RITUAL PRAYER TO LEARN ITS PROFUNDITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Publication notes appear at the end of the review.) 
(th) 
David Stern is a professor of classical Jewish literature and the
director of the Jewish Studies Program at the University of
Pennsylvania. 
 By DAVID STERN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In March 1996 after his father's death, Leon Wieseltier found
himself in synagogue, like generations of Jewish sons before him,
reciting the Kaddish.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most others in his situation, though, Wieseltier _ the
product of an Orthodox upbringing (though no longer traditionally
observant), a former graduate student of medieval Judaism, now the
literary editor of The New Republic _ was struck by how little he
knew about the ritual he was performing so faithfully even as he
realized it was taking over his life.
</P>
<P>
   Stirred by his ignorance and his natural ``bookishness,'' he
decided to take upon himself an additional discipline of grief,
which was to search out the history and meaning of the Kaddish, the
mourner's prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 11 months, often sitting in a teahouse, which
conveniently opened next door to the synagogue, he spent his
mornings poring over dozens of Jewish sources, ancient, medieval
and modern, in quest of the prayer's meaning. ``Kaddish,'' the
astonishing book written out of that experience, is a meticulously
learned yet intensely personal and impassioned record of this
quest.
</P>
<P>
   In short, journal-like entries, Wieseltier copies down, expertly
translates for the reader and works through large chunks of the
obscure and arcane texts he studied, scrutinizing each one for the
history of the prayer and of the Jews who wrote it, but also using
the texts for his own purposes as ``supports for contemplation.''
</P>
<P>
   In aphoristic reflections on their meaning, Wieseltier treats
the texts as though they were ``teardrops'' in which to view the
world, and through their prism he offers the reader glimpses of his
life during that year: his gradual acceptance into the synagogue's
community, his family's tribulations in coming to grips with their
loss, and his own frequently conflicted though never unexamined
feelings about the process and rituals of mourning.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the texts remain the unwavering focus of Wieseltier's
attention. The Kaddish, written in Aramaic (the Semitic language
that was the lingua franca of Jews in the ancient world), is a
brief prayer in praise of God. (``Magnified and sanctified may His
great name be'' are its opening words.)
</P>
<P>
   It nowhere mentions death and originally had nothing to do with
mourning. Only in the 12th century, in the aftermath of the
massacres of Jews in Western Europe by the Crusaders as they
marched bloodily to the Holy Land, ``leaving many many mourners''
in their wake, did the Kaddish become a mourners' prayer.
</P>
<P>
   This transformation of the Kaddish transpired in the territory
then known by Jews as Ashkenaz, primarily France and Germany. Most
of the texts that Wieseltier studies are Ashkenazic. To readers of
this book they may appear utterly recondite and legalistic as well
as reflecting archaic, even superstitious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   The original conception behind the Kaddish as a mourners' prayer
may come as an even greater shock. For most Jews today, the Kaddish
is understood as a prayer that mourners recite to reaffirm their
faith in God.
</P>
<P>
   Henrietta Szold, the American founder of Hadassah, once
described it (while insisting upon her right as a woman to recite
the Kaddish) as a public manifestation of the survivors' ``wish and
intention to assume the relation to the Jewish community which his
parent had.'' In this view, the Kaddish is a prayer by and for the
living.
</P>
<P>
   Not so in Ashkenaz or in its origins. The Kaddish as a mourners'
prayer took root in a soil rich in imaginings about the
tribulations of the soul after death. Contrary to common belief,
ancient and medieval Jewish tradition suggested a baroque if
unsystematic doctrine of the afterlife. Gehenna, the Jewish
equivalent of Christianity's hell, was actually more like a
Purgatory; following death, it was routinely believed, most souls
spend up to 12 months there purging themselves of sins in its
fires.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even the fires of Gehenna rest on the Sabbath. ``The Sabbath
in hell must be the sweetest Sabbath in the universe,'' Wieseltier
remarks. As a consequence the belief arose that at the close of the
Sabbath when the dead prepare to return once again to the fires of
suffering, the prayers of a son could work to spare his parents
from their suffering in the week ahead. In the view of one rabbinic
authority, each Kaddish freezes the fires of Gehenna for 90
minutes: no more, no less.
</P>
<P>
   In its origins, then, the Kaddish was a prayer not on behalf of
the living but literally for the dead, indeed a way for the living
to intervene in the fates of the dead. The idea of such
intervention skirts the scandalous, even the outrageous. Wieseltier
himself is fully alive to the idea's difficulties as well as to its
abiding potency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot save you, even if you are my father,'' he writes,
addressing his deceased father. ``But doesn't the Kaddish claim
that I can save you because you are my father? When you were alive,
I could not save you; but now I can save you.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet whatever his modern doubts about the prayer, Wieseltier is
not deterred from pursuing the countless debates and questions the
Kaddish provoked in subsequent Jewish thought: Can a father
``acquit'' or save a son as the son can save a father? (The answer
is no.) What if the parent is wicked? Can the Kaddish save such a
parent from the torments of hell? (Yes, at least partly.) Does the
prayer extend even to adoptive parents? And in the case of martyrs,
the absolutely righteous who die precisely because of their refusal
to sin, or the victims of the Holocaust, who died solely because
they were Jews, does reciting the Kaddish for them somehow imply
that they were other than blameless in their deaths?
</P>
<P>
   As he pursues these questions, Wieseltier's search for the
meaning of the Kaddish becomes a meditation on tradition itself.
The past lives on ``only posthumously,'' he writes; and like a ball
thrown and caught, tradition ``lives a long time in the air.'' In
this moving, often profound book, Wieseltier has composed a kind of
contemporary Talmud on the Kaddish in which he manages to create a
dialogue at once ancient and modern with the sources of Jewish
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   This book is less about recapturing the past than being itself
an act of retrieval, a demonstration of the power of an ancient
tradition to engage a contemporary intellectual through the urgency
of its concerns even if he or she cannot accept all its tenets.
``May my book be my candle,'' Wieseltier writes, in a prayer for
his father's memory. It is.

FCC RULES CHANGE WOULD ALLOW USE OF ULTRA-WIDE-BAND RADIO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ala.)  (mk)

<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission is considering changing
its regulations to permit the use of a radical and controversial
communications technology that has the potential to make vastly
more efficient use of the increasingly precious radio spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   Known variously as ultra-wide-band radio and digital pulse
wireless, the new technology has a broad range of possible
applications, from wireless voice and high-speed data
communications to land mine detection and advanced radar systems
that could permit law officers to see through walls or could aid
cars in avoiding collisions.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its potential, however, the technology is not in
widespread commercial use today because it would run afoul of FCC
restrictions that prohibit radio transmissions in certain
frequencies set aside for civilian aviation and military agencies.
</P>
<P>
   That could change if the agency agrees to proposals made earlier
this month by three small companies that are pursuing the
technology for a variety of commercial products.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike communications technologies that send information in
analog form, ultra-wide band uses a digital transmission consisting
of small on-off bursts of energy at extremely low power but over
almost the entire radio spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   By precisely timing the pulses within accuracies up to a
trillionth of a second, the designers of ultra-wide-band radio
systems are able to create low-power communications systems that
are almost impossible to jam, tend to penetrate physical obstacles
easily and are almost invulnerable to eavesdropping.
</P>
<P>
   Time Domain Corp., based in Huntsville, Ala., has petitioned the
FCC for a waiver so that by the middle of next year, it can begin
selling a system that will permit police officers and special
weapons and tactics teams to see through walls and doors to detect
the location of people. The company is also planning a covert
communications system that will both carry voice communications and
display locations of a counter-terrorism or SWAT team's members.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are focusing on the safety systems because it has a great
public benefit and it's a good way to introduce the technology
where it can make a difference,'' said Ralph Petroff, the company's
chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   However, Time Domain executives as well as many experts familiar
with ultra-broad band believe the technology's real commercial
potential lies in extremely low-cost communications applications.
That would entail a fundamental shift in FCC regulations, a process
that could take years.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you take its attributes and compare it to the
competition, you have very interesting technology that could lead
to awesome possibilities,'' said Paul Turner, executive director of
PricewaterhouseCoopers' Global Technology Center in Menlo Park,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The most promising application for ultra-wide-band radio might
eventually be an alternative to today's wireless office network
technologies that are generally able to transmit data at rates of
between 1 and 3 million bits a second.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its design, ultra-wide band advocates say the
technology has the potential to deliver vastly higher amounts of
data because a large number of transmitters could broadcast
simultaneously in close proximity without interfering with each
other.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most promising applications are not so much as an
alternative to cellular telephone,'' said Lawrence Larson, an
electrical engineer at the University of California at San Diego.
``It may rather provide a much better way of doing short-range data
communications because it's very energy efficient.''
</P>
<P>
   The computer and communications industries have already settled
on a standard known as Bluetooth for wireless connectivity in an
unlicensed frequency band at 2.4 gigahertz. Bluetooth, which can
send a million bits a second about 30 feet using 100 milliwatts
(about a tenth of a watt), is intended to interconnect devices like
palm computers, laptops and cellular phones.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Time Domain's devices can currently transmit 1.25
million bits a second up to 230 feet using just .5 milliwatts, or
one-thousandth the power used by Bluetooth. These transmissions are
being achieved with the first working prototype chips the company
has received from IBM, which fabricated them using the advanced
silicon germanium semiconductor material developed for
communications applications.
</P>
<P>
   Standard wireless transmissions encode data in a continuous sine
wave by varying the amplitude (the size of the wave) or the
frequency (the number of times the wave cycles each second),
sometimes both. In contrast, Time Domain's technology is similar to
a Morse code system that, at this point in its development,
switches on and off 40 million times a second. And unlike
traditional radio signals, which are confined to a very narrow
frequency, each pulse of ultra-wide band is transmitted across a
wide portion of the radio spectrum, so that only a tiny amount of
energy is radiated at any single frequency.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The company said it believes that the bandwidth, or
data-carrying capacity, of its technology can be expanded to many
times its current limit _ perhaps as high as billions of bits per
second.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, while standard narrowband wireless technologies have a
limited bandwidth, the digital pulse approach has the potential to
handle a large number of simultaneous users in close proximity,
Time Domain officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Ultra-wide band has the added advantage of being significantly
more resistant to ``multipath interference,'' a problem that
plagues indoor radio systems because signals tend to bounce off
many surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials said they did not expect an early resolution
to the FCC's inquiry, which was begun in August. One particular
obstacle is that a key official at the Federal Aviation
Administration has filed an objection with the FCC, warning about a
potential problem caused by the clustering of large numbers of
transmitters, even at very low power levels.
</P>
<P>
   However, industry officials note that current FCC rules permit
``incidental'' emitters _ generally, consumer devices like personal
computers, hair dryers, electric razors, automobiles and arc
welders _ and that no hazard has been demonstrated from the many
millions of these products in everyday use.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a group of scientists and engineers met at Interval
Research Corp., a computer industry research center financed by
Paul Allen, a co-founder of Microsoft Corp., to coordinate industry
input into the FCC decision-making process.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, an Interval physicist, Roberto Aiello, filed an
independent comment with the agency, reporting that a simulation by
his research group indicated that even if millions of
ultra-wide-band transmitters were allowed to operate, they would
have a negligible impact on aviation and other communications
systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FAA is worried about this, and I think it's a good
position for them to take,'' Aiello said. ``But I think there's
concrete evidence that there will not be interference from
ultra-wide band.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Time Domain, companies asking the FCC for
exemptions from spectrum regulations include Radar Inc., which is
developing a system for finding buried objects and looking behind
walls, and Zircon Corp., a maker of high technology tools like
devices that find joists in walls.

<TEXT>
<P>
   After a bruising year and a large-scale restructuring, Adobe
Systems Inc. delivered higher-than-expected earnings and strong
revenue for its fourth fiscal quarter. But while praising the
company's improved management and new products, analysts generally
retained a cautious outlook on Adobe's stock.
</P>
<P>
   Most agree that Adobe management has done a very job job of
turning the company around. They said they expected Adobe to return
to sustained strong earnings growth, but probably not in the next
two quarters, so there is no need to chase the stock at this point.
</P>
<P>
   But a longtime Adobe bull said this is exactly the time to buy
shares, before the strong growth potential of forthcoming products
is obvious.
</P>
<P>
   A new threat is Photo Draw 2000, a combined photography and
graphics program from Microsoft, which has long coveted Adobe's
lead in the publishing and imaging software business.
</P>
<P>
   But most analysts said the Microsoft product, which will likely
be bundled with the Office 2000 suite, lacks the power and
capability demanded by graphics professionals, who are Adobe's core
market. Adobe's consumer product, Photo Deluxe, benefits from
bundling itself, as it is packaged with most of the new digital
cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Adobe had a large presence in Japan and suffered early from the
recession there. As a result, it reported a 33 percent drop in
third-quarter earnings on a 3 percent drop in revenue, and
announced that it was cutting 350 employees, or about 12 percent of
its work force. The weakness attracted a hostile takeover offer
from its leading rival, Quark, which was later withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   Sales to Japan remain depressed, but Adobe received a quick
payoff from the restructuring combined with unexpectedly strong
sales of a new version of Illustrator, its core graphics product,
to deliver fourth-quarter earnings several cents above the
consensus of forecasts. Acrobat, Adobe's portable
document-formatting software, although an older product, also had
record sales, driven by its widespread use on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Adobe reported late Wednesday that its earnings for the fiscal
fourth quarter, ending on Nov. 27, totaled $50.3 million, or 78
cents a diluted share, up 7.5 percent from the period a year
earlier. Revenue rose 8.6 percent, to $246.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 2 cents a share came from an increase in the value of
Adobe's venture capital fund, and about 6 cents from the repurchase
of 6.8 million shares. Without those items, Adobe earned 70 cents a
share; analysts had expected 64 cents, according to First Call.
</P>
<P>
   Adobe shares had actually fallen in advance of the earnings
report, on rumors the earnings would fall below forecasts, and then
bounced back on Thursday, climbing $5.73, or 15 percent, in Nasdaq
trading. On Friday, it gained a further 62.5 cents, to $44.50.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts made only modest changes in their first-quarter
1999 estimates, and did not change their recommendations on the
stock. Of 11 polled by First Call, eight rate Adobe a hold, three a
buy and just one a strong buy.
</P>
<P>
   Among the analysts who retained a hold rating on Adobe was Jay
Vleeschhouwer of Merrill Lynch. ``We do think they can do 15
percent revenue growth across fiscal 1999 as a whole,'' he said,
``but the bulk of that growth is likely to come at the end of the
year. At a management level, the move to improve financial and
operational controls should improve the predictability of the
business.''
</P>
<P>
   John Warnock, Adobe's chairman and chief executive, said he was
not surprised that analysts' ratings remained unchanged. ``We went
through a major restructuring, and they are looking for more than
one quarter,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he said he was confident of the company's ability to deliver
more strong results in the coming year, adding, ``We're very
focused on operational efficiency, setting goals for ourselves and
measuring our performance against those goals. I am intensely
involved at all levels.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Like any software company, Adobe's sales increase with the
release of new programs. The release of the latest version of
Illustrator drove record sales in the fourth quarter, aided by
Photoshop, Adobe's software for the digital management and
manipulation of photographs, the latest version of which is roughly
two quarters old. A major upgrade to Pagemaker, Adobe's page-layout
program, is expected in March or April. Some analysts are already
calling it a ``Quark killer.''
</P>
<P>
   But Robert Fagin of CIBC Oppenheimer downgraded Adobe from a buy
to a hold last week because he thinks the new Pagemaker, code-named
K-2, is really an enterprise-level product, meaning that it will be
critical to the operations of the big publishers who use it.
Approaching the dreaded year 2000, corporations will defer
deploying any such programs, including K-2, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not an Adobe-centric issue,'' Fagin said.
``Fundamentally, the company has turned a corner, but there's a
macro issue looming in the future that will be difficult for any
software company that deals with corporations.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``We think K-2 is a great product. Over a three-year
period, it could be a half-billion-dollar opportunity. We just
think it will start six months late.''
</P>
<P>
   Warnock takes issue with that analysis, pointing out that many
big publishers have substantial year 2000 problems that he said
could be resolved by deploying K-2. But in any case, he said Adobe
expects early sales to be driven by existing Pagemaker users, not
big corporations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Pagemaker market really is the small graphics arts houses
that have two or three Macintoshes,'' he said. ``They can do their
Y2K evaluation in a weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Murphy, editor of the California Technology Stock
Letter, also said that the year 2000 worry is misguided, and added
that any damage it does to Adobe shares presents a buying
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will have a May-quarter launch for K-2, and it will be a
very fast conversion,'' he said. ``All of us Pagemaker users are
crying out for the change. We expect to see a steady increase in
estimates for 1999 as management proves they can successfully
introduce these new products and bump up the growth rate while
maintaining the recent cost cuts.''
</P>
<P>
   His advice: ``Buy on a dip to $45 for a target of $75.''

 By LAWRIE MIFFLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ask Jeff Fager, the 44-year-old executive producer of
``60 Minutes II,'' whether he has long dreamed of becoming the next
Don Hewitt at CBS News, and he shakes his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the years I spent at `60 Minutes' were the most fun I've
ever had in journalism,'' he quickly adds. ``And they had to drag
me out of there.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was dragged out, in 1994, after five years as a producer
at ``60 Minutes,'' it was to move upward. Fager became second in
command of the ``CBS Evening News with Dan Rather,'' and was
promoted to executive producer, the top job, 15 months later.
</P>
<P>
   Now he is being asked to become, in effect, Don Hewitt II,
developing ``60 Minutes II'' in the shadow of its 76-year-old
creator, one of the few people in television news who can
legitimately be called ``legendary.''
</P>
<P>
   Fager's ``60 II,'' as it is nicknamed, must walk a fine line,
living up to the standards of the original ``60 Minutes'' while not
imitating it. And he is forging this cloned creation in the wake of
a passionate battle waged last spring, when Hewitt and the
program's five celebrated correspondents vehemently and publicly
argued against the notion of any form of spinoff of the original.
</P>
<P>
   He is also steering the format into new territory _ weeknights,
when viewers are not accustomed to the beckoning of the ticking
stopwatch that for the last 30 years has introduced ``60 Minutes''
each Sunday at 7 p.m., and will now also introduce ``60 Minutes
II.'' The new program's time slot is Wednesdays at 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``60 II'' will keep the format of three segments a show, but one
will be a ``60 Minutes'' piece from the past, updated. And like the
parent show, it will have its own cadre of CBS News correspondents
_ Dan Rather (who will also continue to anchor the ``Evening
News''), Bob Simon and Vicki Mabrey. But it will also have an
unusual addition: Charlie Rose, the host and executive producer of
his own late-night current-events interview show on PBS (who plans
to keep that job, too).
</P>
<P>
   In terms of talent and internal politics, many people at the
network agree, Jeff Fager is the ideal leader, having been an
esteemed producer for CBS News and for ``60 Minutes.'' Indeed, he
is one of three factors repeatedly cited by CBS journalists as
critical for the new program's success: Fager, Rather and classics.
</P>
<P>
   Lest it forever be seen as Hewitt's stepchild, the program
needed a leader people inside CBS respected as independent and
capable _ Fager. To avoid being seen as some sort of training
ground for tenderfoots, the show also needed a correspondent
recognized as world class _ Rather.
</P>
<P>
   And it needed stories, fast, if it was to meet the network's
target of a mid-January start date. Thus the classic: Each week,
one of the three stories will be a ``60 Minutes Classic,'' in which
a story from past years will be updated (usually by the original
correspondent) to see what has happened to the people or issues
since. Although such segments may well be interesting in their own
right, they can also be produced quickly, and having them means the
new team must produce only two original stories each week.
</P>
<P>
   Only the audience will determine whether this formula succeeds,
of course, but network executives are already crediting Fager for
having brought ``60 Minutes II'' this far, given the initial
resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, when word got out that Leslie Moonves, president of
CBS Television, and Mel Karmazin, chief executive of CBS Inc., were
serious about starting a weeknight version of the most-watched news
magazine on television, the entire senior staff of ``60 Minutes''
protested.
</P>
<P>
   The attack was led by Hewitt and the program's two
longest-serving correspondents, Mike Wallace and Morley Safer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you want another `60 Minutes'?'' Hewitt asked pointedly,
both to his superiors and to the news media, ``or `Dateline' with a
`60 Minutes' label?''
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes, meanwhile, Andrew Heyward, president of CBS
News, and Moonves maneuvered like career diplomats, trying to get
the three to see the wisdom in a carefully-crafted second edition.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the biggest egos in the news business were on the line,
after all. How else to explain that the originals at first insisted
that ``60 II'' consist only of updated pieces?
</P>
<P>
   But the objections raised were primarily journalistic: It is
difficult enough to produce one crop of high-quality stories a
week, let alone two.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Andrew it was a rotten idea, an attempt simply to use
the logo,'' Safer recalled in an interview. ``Then, almost as an
afterthought, I said, `Unless you're going to take Jeff Fager off
the ``Evening News,'' and put someone like Rather or Simon and the
very best correspondents in the company on it.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, if they did that,'' Safer continued, ``how could I be
anything but for it?''
</P>
<P>
   He doubted that would happen, though. Why would a Fager, a
Rather or a Simon want to work for a program that their colleagues
were already calling ``60 Junior''?
</P>
<P>
   But Heyward knew at least one key person was amenable. He had
discussed a second ``60'' with Rather much earlier, in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan was very supportive of the idea before anyone else, and
independent of his own involvement in it,'' Heyward said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, even before Rather decided whether to join the new
program himself, he said he would give his blessing if Fager left
the nightly newscast to take the new job.
</P>
<P>
   That, plus the prospect that Rather might join ``60 II,'' helped
Heyward persuade Fager.
</P>
<P>
   It was ``a chicken and egg thing,'' Heyward said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel it was fair to secure his commitment without
knowing there was a critical mass of support and willingness to
cooperate from Don, Mike, Morley and the rest,'' he said. ``Yet,
Jeff being attached to the project, as they would say in Hollywood,
certainly gave the `60 Minutes' people a measure of reassurance.''
</P>
<P>
   In late June, after many more discussions, including some
between Wallace and Fager on simultaneous vacations in Martha's
Vineyard, the veterans were won over.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a big final meeting,'' Wallace recalled in an
interview. ``Hewitt and I and Andrew Heyward and Les Moonves and
Fager. And they made it quite clear, first, that Jeff was going to
be doing it, definitely. That allayed concerns about whether it
would be a serious broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   ``In addition to which, they said, `He will have the resources
he needs; he will have sufficient money to get enough top producers
and first-rate on-air people.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And finally, we asked, `What if the ratings don't respond in
those first six months or so, will they be asked to go down market,
to pander?' And they told us, absolutely not _ repeat, not,' ''
Wallace said.
</P>
<P>
   What helped clinch their support, too, was Hewitt's idea of
creating the ``60 Minutes Classics.'' Indeed, early on the veterans
argued that the new program should be made entirely of updated
reports, for two reasons. First, they were already doing updated
reports for ``60 Minutes More,'' a show on the little-seen cable
network Eye on People. Second, summer re-runs of ``60 Minutes''
always rank among the top-rated programs with viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about the strength of pieces we already have,''
Heyward said. ``Should that be the new show? Most of the show? Out
of it came the notion of doing the single classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great way to involve them without unrealistic
expectations to their workload,'' he said of the established ``60
Minutes'' correspondents. ``And it helps us assure that the overall
quality is where we want it to be right off the bat.''
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt agreed, saying that and Fager made the difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Considering it's Jeff and considering you'll have one foot in
our camp, we said, `We're aboard,''' Hewitt said.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Fager set out to talk Rather into coming aboard.
``I knew if we could attract Dan we'd have a big leg up on the kind
of person you expect to see when that stopwatch starts to tick,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since Rather had worked for six years at ``60 Minutes'' prior to
becoming the ``Evening News'' anchor, and since he has publicly
praised Fager as the best producer at CBS News short of Hewitt, the
sell was not too difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Simon, CBS' veteran Middle East correspondent, was another
credibility booster. He is widely considered one of best foreign
correspondents in the business, and he already contributes five
pieces a year to ``60 Minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he says he is typically terrible at recalling dates,
Simon remembers Tuesday, June 30, because he had just arrived in a
remote Swiss village for his vacation, a long-anticipated 10-day
hike in the Alps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked into this tiny hostel and the phone was ringing,'' he
said last week from Perth, Australia, where he was working on a
story. ``I couldn't believe that work had followed me there. And
frankly, I had ambivalent feelings about the idea, because of the
ways it could change my life that I didn't want changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Jeff knew this, because he said, `I really want you to
work on this show, but if you want go on living in Tel Aviv that's
OK, and if you want to keep doing your five stories a year for
Sunday, that's OK, too.'''
</P>
<P>
   With Simon and Rather signed on, the search began for perhaps
the most important staff members: producers, the journalists who do
most of the groundwork and reporting on each piece. With one or two
exceptions, Fager was not allowed to raid people at the original
``60 Minutes.'' But he did manage to fill about half his 22
producer slots with people who had worked there at one time or
another.
</P>
<P>
   ``I phoned Patti Hassler right away,'' Fager said. ``She was a
star producer for years at `60 Minutes,' had produced over 70
stories there. With her storytelling ability and her experience at
`60,' it was important to have her to guide the other producers.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hassler, who had been guiding CBS News Productions, which
makes documentaries for the network and others (like A&AMP;E's
``Biography'' series), is now Fager's second in command.
</P>
<P>
   Then came several producers from the ``Evening News,'' some
independents and some from other networks _ including three from
ABC News' ``20/20.'' It was a helpful coincidence that in August,
CBS News hired Betsy West, a veteran supervising producer, away
from ABC News to oversee all prime-time news programs for CBS News,
including Fager's show.
</P>
<P>
   The search for two more correspondents began in the traditional
way _ looking for a veteran of CBS News who had distinguished
himself or, in this case, herself. Vicki Mabrey, who had followed a
route once taken by Rather, Safer and Kroft, through the London
bureau, was hired.
</P>
<P>
   But the other choice was decidedly nontraditional. Rose had
worked at CBS News from 1984 to 1990, as an anchor on its overnight
report (seen in the wee hours of the morning), but it was on his
own PBS show that he made his name.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andrew thought of Charlie,'' Fager said. ``I took to it
instantly, because I admired his work. He's a world-class
interviewer, and he has a fantastic Rolodex _ and he works it all
the time.''
</P>
<P>
   With staff in place, Fager's greatest worry is replicating the
journalistic caliber of most ``60 Minutes'' pieces.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what's daunting about it, to look at that program, that
kind of legacy,'' Fager said. ``Can we live up to it? What will it
take?''
</P>
<P>
   And though the office politics issues seem to have been soothed,
``60 Minutes'' producers and correspondents are renowned for their
competitiveness with each other. The ``60 II'' team can expect to
feel that heat.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, with a sly smile, said last week: ``I'm sure someone
like me will say to someone, `You mean you want to go do the junior
show?''
</P>
<P>
   And Fager showed he is as much a product of that competitive
culture as anyone when asked what he would like to hear his former
colleagues say about a ``60 II'' piece.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want Don Hewitt to say, `I'd like to have that piece
Sunday,' or Mike Wallace to say, `How come we didn't have that
piece?''' Fager said.
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt now sounds philosophical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Slowly but surely, we all realized, `Hey, how long in this
world of clones can you go uncloned?' '' he said. ``If we're going
to be cloned, I'm glad the father is Jeff.''

 &HT;    WITH LITTLE KNOWN ABOUT THE DAMAGE, IRAQIS CLAIM VICTORY
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   QORNA, Iraq _ It seems that the first thing rebuilt after four
nights of U.S. and British missile attacks was the famous Iraqi
house of mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   Relieved that the barrage was called off the night before,
Iraqis Sunday claimed their victory but kept information and access
to the damage to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi officials still released no casualty figures, though
civilian casualties appear to be around 35. They took a few
reporters to see damage to this city a five-hour drive south from
the capital of Baghdad, then barely gave them access to the sites.
</P>
<P>
   But, on the impoverished streets here, the chants were in good
form and the slogans nearly uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saddam, Saddam, your name means fear for America,'' chanted a
street crowd waving flags near a tent set up to focus support for
the regime.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi officials say that near here one of the country's only
three oil refineries was badly damaged. Reporters were twice taken
to the oil company offices, but not allowed to see the refinery,
which is heavily guarded by tanks and anti-aircraft guns.
</P>
<P>
   The officials also said a hospital in the area was badly
damaged, but that did not make it on the tour either. They did show
reporters two small destroyed compounds that served as postal and
telephone centers.
</P>
<P>
   But, while witnesses initially spoke of military officers being
killed at one of the sites they soon, with encouragement, said the
two casualties were civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein declared victory
Sunday in a televised statement to his people.
</P>
<P>
   ``God will repay well and crown your heart with clear victory,''
Hussein, dressed in military garb, said in his short speech.
</P>
<P>
   The comments were echoed among his people.
</P>
<P>
   In Qorna, a town of Shiite Muslims who have faced persecution
under Hussein and formed an underground opposition movement, the
military presence is daunting. Small, whitewashed compounds with
machine-gun mounts and sometimes armored cars are spaced every few
hundred yards on the highways, often directly across from poor farm
villages.
</P>
<P>
   But, the Shiites that gathered on the streets Sunday glorified
Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iraq won. We had a victory because we held steadfast and
patient and Saddam survived,'' Khadum Rezak, a 30-year-old driver
said.
</P>
<P>
   Just who did win after this four days of flashing and rumbling
in the night skies will not be known for some time. The United
States and Britain began the assault after Hussein stopped
cooperating with the United Nations weapons inspections begun after
a U.S.-led military coalition forced Iraq out of Kuwait in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Iraq has faced eight years of inspections and
crippling economic sanctions. After the recent bombings, Iraqi
officials say they will no longer allow weapons inspectors into the
country and that could, indeed, be a victory for Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   But the ultimate effect of the air strikes is shrouded, which
may be appropriate for a country under attack that does not want to
let attackers see their specific impact. There were at least a few
clues on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials said the 70-hour offensive hit nearly 100
targets and involved 650 aircraft missions, with more than 400
cruise missiles launched on Iraq -- more than in the five-week
Desert Storm operation after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said the attacks inflicted ``significant
damage'' on Iraqi weapons programs, command structures and military
and security infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   Among targets U.S. officials said were hit: 20 command and
control facilities, 18 facilities providing security for weapons
programs, seven or eight of President Saddam Hussein's palaces and
posts of the elite Republican Guard.
</P>
<P>
   While most areas of Baghdad and the major southern city of
Basra, near Qorna, do not show any signs of damage, the damage that
is visible or acknowledged by Iraqis illustrate the U.S. goals --
reportedly to weaken Saddam's ability to build chemical and
biological weapons of mass destruction, and to soften up his regime
for a possible coup.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqis say that the major Neba factory complex near Baghdad was
hit.
</P>
<P>
   That factory is suspected to be used in making missile casings
and has been monitored by the weapons inspectors' cameras. The
attack appears to be based on the assumption that, since the air
strikes have given Saddam a pretext for forever rejecting the
weapons inspections, weapons production will be stopped instead by
force.
</P>
<P>
   The two destroyed centers for postal and telephone services that
reporters were shown in Basra and Qorna appeared to fit U.S. goals
to cut communications between the north and south, making it easier
for opposition groups to form in those areas.
</P>
<P>
   Two people -- the soldiers or civilians, depending on when
witnesses were asked -- were crushed at one site. At the other, two
people were killed at the postal center and two children were hurt
when two rooms of a house near the center were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   It left the owner of the house, Moveid Salah, 51, to interpret
American goals on his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to kill the people here. They want to destroy our
civilization,'' he said as he stood in the street amid the mixed
rubble of his house and the postal center. ``Iraq won because we
have a mind and dignity and we believe in God.''

 &HT;    WITH LITTLE KNOWN ABOUT THE DAMAGE, IRAQIS CLAIM VICTORY
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   QORNA, Iraq _ It seems that the first thing rebuilt after four
nights of U.S. and British missile attacks was the famous Iraqi
house of mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   Relieved that the barrage was called off the night before,
Iraqis Sunday claimed their victory but kept information and access
to the damage to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi officials still released no casualty figures, though
civilian casualties appear to be around 35. They took a few
reporters to see damage to this city a five-hour drive south from
the capital of Baghdad, then barely gave them access to the sites.
</P>
<P>
   But, on the impoverished streets here, the chants were in good
form and the slogans nearly uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saddam, Saddam, your name means fear for America,'' chanted a
street crowd waving flags near a tent set up to focus support for
the regime.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi officials say that near here one of the country's only
three oil refineries was badly damaged. Reporters were twice taken
to the oil company offices, but not allowed to see the refinery,
which is heavily guarded by tanks and anti-aircraft guns.
</P>
<P>
   The officials also said a hospital in the area was badly
damaged, but that did not make it on the tour either. They did show
reporters two small destroyed compounds that served as postal and
telephone centers.
</P>
<P>
   But, while witnesses initially spoke of military officers being
killed at one of the sites they soon, with encouragement, said the
two casualties were civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein declared victory
Sunday in a televised statement to his people.
</P>
<P>
   ``God will repay well and crown your heart with clear victory,''
Hussein, dressed in military garb, said in his short speech.
</P>
<P>
   The comments were echoed among his people.
</P>
<P>
   In Qorna, a town of Shiite Muslims who have faced persecution
under Hussein and formed an underground opposition movement, the
military presence is daunting. Small, whitewashed compounds with
machine-gun mounts and sometimes armored cars are spaced every few
hundred yards on the highways, often directly across from poor farm
villages.
</P>
<P>
   But, the Shiites that gathered on the streets Sunday glorified
Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iraq won. We had a victory because we held steadfast and
patient and Saddam survived,'' Khadum Rezak, a 30-year-old driver
said.
</P>
<P>
   Just who did win after this four days of flashing and rumbling
in the night skies will not be known for some time. The United
States and Britain began the assault after Hussein stopped
cooperating with the United Nations weapons inspections begun after
a U.S.-led military coalition forced Iraq out of Kuwait in 1991.

WANTED: POET LAUREATE. ANYONE WILLING? 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SARAH LYALL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The job pays only about $165 a year, plus a case of
Spanish sherry. It is meant to be a great honor, but is often
considered faintly embarrassing. In the last 15 years it has
required an unironic belief in the grave national importance of
events like the wedding of the duke of York and Sarah Ferguson,
also known as Fergie.
</P>
<P>
   Why on earth would anyone want to be Britain's poet laureate?
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be my question as well,'' said Christopher Reid,
the poetry editor at Faber &AMP; Faber, which publishes some of
Britain's best-known poetry. ``It seems to me a pretty pointless
kind of job.''
</P>
<P>
   With the death in October of Ted Hughes, the poet laureate since
1984, the position and the job description are now wide open. While
some of Britain's higher-profile poets have removed their names
from consideration with all the passion of teen-agers who think the
student council is for nerdy teacher's pets, others are gently
letting it be known that if appointed, they would serve.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most frequently mentioned candidate is Andrew
Motion, a poet, critic and biographer who is the professor of
creative writing at the University of East Anglia. In the last 18
months he has raised his own profile and helped bring poetry to the
public's attention by publishing poems in national newspapers
marking the deaths of Diana, princess of Wales, and Hughes, a
longtime friend.
</P>
<P>
   Other poets in the running are Wendy Cope, whose work tends to
poke fun at pretension, particularly that of other poets; Benjamin
Zephaniah, who attacks social injustice in often playful tones that
draw heavily on West Indian speech and culture, and U.A. Fanthorpe,
who seemed to all but apply for the post when she was moved to
publish ``A Brief Resume at 50,'' an ode to Prince Charles on his
birthday, in The Guardian.
</P>
<P>
   For reasons of its own, The Guardian has taken up Ms.
Fanthorpe's candidacy, encouraging her to submit poems for every
occasion. (Last Monday it published her poem about road rage.)
``She's liked by people who don't read any poetry, and she's
accessible,'' said the newspaper's deputy arts editor, Fiachra
Gibbons, who went on, rather confusingly, to say that the ``job is
about producing embarrassingly bad poetry.''
</P>
<P>
   Spurred by Ms. Fanthorpe's new high profile, William Hill,
Britain's biggest betting agency, has raised her chances of being
made laureate to 16-1, from 50-1.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's favorite candidate is Motion, with odds of 6-4,
followed closely by Ms. Cope (4-1) and James Fenton (5-1), the
professor of poetry at Oxford University, who appeared to rule
himself out when he told The Observer of London, ``I can think of
people who would want to take the job, other than myself.''
Similarly, Craig Raine, another Oxford poet (25-1), exclaimed,
``Oh, God, no,'' before hanging up the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Even E.J. Thribb, who is one of Britain's best-known poets
despite being a fictional teen-ager who specializes in terrible
civic verse for the satiric magazine Private Eye, is in the
running, though at odds of 1,000-1.
</P>
<P>
   What exactly would the new laureate do, at a time when old views
of Britain and the monarchy that serves as its figurehead are
rapidly changing? Some people in the poetry world say the time has
come to give the post an overhaul, perhaps creating an
American-style laureate.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the laureate serves for one year at a
time, gets an office with a stunning view of the Capitol and earns
a respectable salary of $35,000. (Hughes' job as poet laureate
earned him half as much a year as Britain's first official
laureate, John Dryden _ and 200 pounds went a lot further in the
17th century.)
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Britain's laureate should serve for a fixed term instead
of until death, critics say. And maybe he or she should be
explicitly freed from the job's chief unstated burden: churning out
quick poetry that, harking back to the days when poets depended on
the patronage of the monarch, celebrates events like royal
birthdays and royal weddings.
</P>
<P>
   Although the job has been filled over the years by some of
Britain's poetic heavyweights, including Ben Jonson, who held the
post unofficially, as well as Dryden, Tennyson, Wordsworth, Cecil
Day-Lewis and John Betjeman, it has rarely inspired their best
work.
</P>
<P>
   John Masefield, who beat Rudyard Kipling for the job in 1930,
suffered under the impression that he had to compose an ode to mark
the monarch's return to Britain after each foreign trip. He also
had such low regard for his talent that when he submitted his poems
to The Times of London, the laureate's de facto house organ, he
always enclosed a stamped, self-addressed envelope.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most notorious example of laureate poetry came
during an illness of the prince of Wales, who later became King
Edward VII. The laureate, Alfred Austin, who took the job in 1896,
is said, perhaps apocryphally, to have written:
</P>
<P>
   ``Across the wires the electric message came
</P>
<P>
   `He is no better, he is much the same.' ''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Hughes became laureate after another poet, Philip Larkin, turned
the job down. Although he was considered a great poet whose
reputation was immortalized by his last work, ``Birthday Letters''
and ``Tales From Ovid,'' Hughes generally confounded his supporters
with his royal poems.
</P>
<P>
   When Prince Andrew, the duke of York, married Ms. Ferguson,
Hughes wrote, among other things, ``A helicopter snatched you up./
The pilot, it was me.'' (The marriage ended in divorce.) On the
occasion of the 40th anniversary of Queen Elizabeth's coronation,
he said her corgis were the same color as the Lion of England. And
when the queen mother turned 95, he compared her to an old oak tree
whose ``crown of oak leaves amplifies/ A global marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Such poems were not widely admired. ``At the age of 66 I have a
cast-iron digestion and have weathered some of the worst storms at
sea,'' a reader wrote to The Daily Telegraph, having just seen
Hughes' nuptial poem for Andrew and Ms. Ferguson. ``However,
reading the poet laureate's so-called royal wedding song over
breakfast this morning, I felt very sick indeed.''
</P>
<P>
   The writer and critic Blake Morrison, who generally admired
Hughes, said: ``It did him no good. I think his reputation went
backward as a result of being laureate. People ridiculed him. Even
his admirers found his laureate poems impenetrable or
disappointing, and then, thank God, he produced some wonderful work
in the last three years.''
</P>
<P>
   Morrison and others argue that many respectable poets would
consider the post a burden and would turn it down because of its
ties to the monarchy.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me the trivial side is the royal side, and I'd like to see
the laureate detached from the monarchy,'' he said in an interview.
``If people want to produce odes to the queen mother, fine. But the
expectation that that's what the job is is a mistake. Of course,
some people hate the idea of changing the rather eccentric system
that we have, because they think at least it's English, like fox
hunting.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, said the poet Tom Paulin (33-1), the post should be
redefined ``as a way of embodying a kind of multicultural national
spirit'' that would reflect, rather than ignore, contemporary
Britain. ``One imagines a Virgilian poet in a postmodern era,'' he
said. Would he consider taking the job? ``Oh, absolutely not, no,''
he said. ``I wouldn't, not at all, no.''
</P>
<P>
   One positive side effect of the speculation surrounding the next
laureate is that it has brought poetry into the public eye. This is
part of a general trend, said Chris Meade, director of the Poetry
Society in Britain, who pointed out that in recent years there has
been a boom in poets in residence attached to institutions like the
London Zoo, the department-store chain Marks &AMP; Spencer and the law
firm Mishcon de Reya, home of Anthony Julius, the high-profile
lawyer who handled the princess of Wales' divorce.
</P>
<P>
   But, Meade said, regular people have a hard time making the leap
from appreciating ``poetryness,'' or the idea of poetry, to being
able to name actual contemporary poets.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get an interest in single poems, such as those people come
across on the Underground, but then there's a gap. The next step is
slim volumes by lots of people you've never heard of and slender
magazines full of angry critics who love one thing and hate
another,'' he said. ``The poet laureate could help to consolidate
poetry's position and bridge the gap between the initial interest
and a deeper understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Holroyd, the biographer and chairman of the Royal
Society of Literature, said the job should evolve when the new
laureate takes office. ``Poets disagree with practically everything
about the job, except that they feel they should get more money,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Meade, Holroyd and representatives of various
organizations are compiling lists of names to submit to the prime
minister's office, which will select a new laureate, with the
queen's approval, next year. They say they are unmoved by the
flurry of poems by would-be laureates, which have appeared in
national newspapers in recent years, and by the efforts of amateur
poets to put their names forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had three general members of the public who have written
a few poems, and they're very keen to do the job,'' Meade said.
``But we won't be mentioning them in our letter of recommendation.
They were newcomers to poetry, and you know, they just weren't very
good.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A wintry mix of precipitation will fall Monday across interior
northern New England as a developing low-pressure system over the
Great Lakes pushes a warm front toward the region. A few inches of
snow will accumulate in interior Maine while sleet and freezing
rain yield to rain in the St. Lawrence Valley. Snow will also fall
behind the low in parts of Wisconsin and northern Michigan, where
amounts will reach six inches in a few areas.
</P>
<P>
   Rain showers with a few rumbles of thunder will accompany a
powerful Arctic cold front draped from the low from Ohio to eastern
Texas. Some of the showers will be heavy, as increasing breezes
from the south provide ample moisture. Ahead of the front over much
of the Southeast and Middle Atlantic States, temperatures will be
unseasonably warm, especially along the Carolina and Georgia
coastline where hazy sunshine boosts readings into the upper 70s.
</P>
<P>
   Farther west, patchy freezing drizzle and light snow will
develop in the shallow cold air just west of the front from western
Missouri to Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Mainly dry but bitterly cold air will predominate from the
western corn belt to the central and northern Rockies as expansive
high pressure continues to funnel cold air from Canada into the
area.
</P>
<P>
   Snow will fall in areas of Washington and northern Oregon as a
disturbance lifts chilly air over the region. A few inches are
likely to accumulate, even in Seattle and Portland.
</P>
<P>
   California and the desert Southwest will be sunny but cool as
temperatures struggle to reach 60 degrees in many areas.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Official Start?
</P>
<P>
   The astronomical start of winter occurs Monday evening at 8:56
EST, when the sun's rays strike the Tropic of Capricorn
perpendicularly at local noon. This ``winter solstice'' will take
place in the south Pacific just south of New Caledonia. Though
TV-weathercasters pontificate that this astronomical event marks
the ``official'' start of winter, the start of meteorological
winter is commonly accepted as Dec. 1, traditionally the first day
of the three coldest months of the year. Dec. 5, which, on average,
marks the start of the coldest three-month period, also stakes a
valid claim.

E-MAIL VIRUS PREYS ON MICROSOFT WORD 97
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md.)   (ms) 
 By REBECCA FAIRLEY RANEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Computer security experts are warning clients about a new
software virus that is spread by e-mail, infects Microsoft Word
files and has already caused several networks to crash.
</P>
<P>
   The virus, officially named the ``MS Word Macro 97 Class
Virus,'' creates a pop-up box in Microsoft Word 97 files that
addresses the recipient of the e-mail message by name and informs
the user that he or she ``is a big stupid jerk.''
</P>
<P>
   Large-scale infections of the virus, which are activated on the
14th of each month, have been reported worldwide, security experts
say.
</P>
<P>
   The virus itself contains no programming that would cripple a
network server, but experts said that a big infection of document
files can start a chain reaction on a computer network that in turn
can cause a general system failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the No. 1 virus in the world right now,'' said Vincent
Gullotto, manager of the antivirus emergency response team for
Network Associates, a company that develops and publishes antivirus
software.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few weeks, Gullotto said, he has received thousands
of complaints about the virus. In one recent case, he said, the
network server of a major U.S. corporation, which he declined to
identify, was crippled after 7,000 documents were infected. The
company's server was set up to sound alerts upon the discovery of
viruses, and the constant alerts brought down the server.
</P>
<P>
   ``It basically went into alert overload,'' Gullotto said.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 15, Don Goff, an adjunct professor of information
technology at the University of Maryland, wrote in an e-mail
message: ``In the last 48 hours, a `class virus' has been
propagating from MS Word attachments to e-mail documents. It
manifests itself as a pop-up with the phrase `(recipient by name)
is a big jerk.' It is going around Washington, D.C., like lightning
_ like a cold through my preschoolers class.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that ``it has to be cleaned from each file,'' he
described the macro virus as ``a pernicious cuss'' and ``a mean
little spud.''
</P>
<P>
   The virus infects only machines that are running Microsoft's
Word 97 word processing program. Since it was first reported to
Symantec, an antivirus software company, in late July, the virus
has sprouted 43 different strains, said Eric Chien, a software
engineer for Symantec's antivirus research center.
</P>
<P>
   Because the original virus was not protected by encryption, it
has been easy to alter. Some variants contain references to
President Clinton and Monica Lewinsky, and with those variants,
pop-up boxes about the relationship appear when users open Word
documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't have Word, it's not an issue,'' Chien said. If a
user has Word 97, however, and opens the e-mail attachment, he
added, ``the virus will infect any other Word document'' on the
user's hard drive or network drive.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Word documents are frequent targets of virus writers
because Word enables users to write simple programs known as macros
that can, for example, automatically end every letter that a user
composes with the word ``Sincerely.'' That functionality, intended
to spread instructions through all Word documents on a machine,
also helps viruses infect documents, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first Word macro viruses, known as the Concept Virus,
is thought to be the most widely dispersed computer virus in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft officials point out that people who use Word can
instruct the program not to run macros, an option that is part of
Word's built-in protection against viruses.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should be careful not to open a document whose source you
don't know,'' said Andrew Dixon, a group project manager for
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   One problem the Word Macro 97 virus can create for networked
computer systems is that it changes the software registration
information. System errors can occur when the registration
information on an individual machine does not match information on
the network. The virus changes the company name to ``Dr. Diet
Mountain Dew,'' and it changes the user name to
``VicodinES/CB/TNN.''
</P>
<P>
   Chien said ``Vicodin'' is the pseudonym of the virus writer,
while ``CB'' stands for ``Code Breakers,'' a virus-writing group,
and ``TNN'' stands for the writer's own group, known as ``The
Narcotic Network.''
</P>
<P>
   Vicodin has been quite active lately, writing and distributing
viruses through the Internet, experts said. He even issues press
releases, which he attributes to the fictitious ``Disassociated
Press.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about Vicodin is, he has a sense of humor,''
Gullotto said.
</P>
<P>
   But victims are not laughing.
</P>
<P>
   As the virus mutates and spreads, antivirus companies, not
surprisingly, are recommending that corporations be more
conscientious about updating their antivirus software.
</P>
<P>
   Goff wrote in his e-mail message that the latest versions of
antivirus software defended computers and networks from the virus
but that earlier versions did not.
</P>
<P>
   Gullotto said, ``I can only preach so much to customers that
they need to update.''

THAIS TAKE `DINNER ON THE GO' LITERALLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN OWEN  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bangkok is one of the few places in the world where a jaywalker
risks being run over by a kitchen. Some are motorized. Others are
powered by bicycle gears. They are food stands that don't always
stand still.
</P>
<P>
   Cruising alongside these mobile kitchens are three-wheeled
motorcycle taxis called tuk-tuks. Because of Bangkok's pollution
problem, tuk-tuk drivers were ordered to replace their small
gasoline engines. So they are now sitting astride cooking-gas
tanks.
</P>
<P>
   Even when they are stuck in traffic, residents or visitors are
confronted by food. Food stands line each street at curbside. Some
also offer diners a sidewalk table. At others, you eat it and beat
it.
</P>
<P>
   You can buy fried grasshoppers in Bangkok. Some vendors in
Ayuthaya, the ancient capital of Siam, offer roasted field rat on a
stick. Often on a rural road travelers will notice a card table
with four or five bottles on top and a single chair. Almost anybody
can open an instant bar.
</P>
<P>
   At fancy sit-down establishments, gourmands might find serpent
fish souffle on the menu alongside Chinese hairy crab or noodles
with lemonade chili sauce, fish balls, squid, shrimp and jellyfish.
</P>
<P>
   Thai families stay together, so you often will see three
generations occupying one small abode. Often small apartments are
rented without kitchen facilities. So when the Thais want to party
or entertain guests, they most often end up at the food stands.
</P>
<P>
   There are some 30,000 registered restaurants in Bangkok. There
must be 10 times that number of food stands.
</P>
<P>
   They serve satays with peanut sauce, grilled meatballs made of
chicken, fish or beef. You can buy spicy sausages, shrimp cakes,
fried bananas, corn on the cob, fresh mangos, pineapples, melon
slices. Or a vendor will whack the top off a coconut and hand it to
you with a straw.
</P>
<P>
   If all the noodles in Bangkok were tied end to end, they would
stretch to Naples and back several times, yet the staple of
Thailand is rice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Thai eat boiled rice in the morning, maybe with a bit of
salt egg, pickle or chili,'' a female guide told us. ``That's why
Thais are not fat.''
</P>
<P>
   She didn't add, ``like you-know-who.'' But she might well have.
The Americans at our hotel breakfast buffet had their plates piled
high with ham, sausages, bacon, French toast, omelets, fresh fruit
and French pastries.
</P>
<P>
   Four hours later they're ready to eat again, slowed only by a
cautionary slogan: If it's not hot, it's not Thai.
</P>
<P>
   My wife cauterized her tonsils over a bowl of soup in Chiang Mai
during our recent trip to Thailand. But most of the dishes we
encountered promoted only a warm sweat and an occasional hiccup.
</P>
<P>
   The uninitiated might begin with Thai dishes like these.
</P>
<P>
   Siam Satay
</P>
<P>
   1 flank steak (1{ to 2 pounds)
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon curry powder
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon sugar
</P>
<P>
   \ cup cooking oil
</P>
<P>
   \ cup soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   2 cloves garlic, minced
</P>
<P>
   Cut the steak in thin diagonal strips. Combine the other
ingredients, moosh together with the meat in a plastic bag and let
it marinate in the refrigerator all day or overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Thread on satay sticks that have been soaked 30 minutes in
water, grill on the barbecue or under a broiler, and serve with
this dipping sauce:
</P>
<P>
   Satay Sauce
</P>
<P>
   { cup salted peanuts
</P>
<P>
   1 medium onion
</P>
<P>
   1 clove garlic
</P>
<P>
   3 small dried whole red chilies
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons cooking oil
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon coriander
</P>
<P>
   { teaspoon cumin
</P>
<P>
   6 ounces canned coconut milk
</P>
<P>
   1{ tablespoons brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   Dump the peanuts into a blender or food processor and hit the
button a couple of times until the goobers are finely chopped.
Remove to a saucer.
</P>
<P>
   Now toss the onion, in chunks, into the processor along with the
garlic and chilies. Blend until smooth.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the oil in a skillet, add the onion mixture, coriander and
cumin. Stir-fry 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low and add the peanuts.
Gradually stir in coconut milk, sugar, lemon juice and soy. Cook
just below a simmer for 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Pathum Thani Prawns
</P>
<P>
   1 pound large shrimp (shelled and deveined)
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon minced garlic
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon black pepper
</P>
<P>
   { tablespoon soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   { tablespoon Thai fish sauce
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons canola oil
</P>
<P>
   Moosh together the garlic, pepper, soy sauce and fish sauce. If
your eyeballs tend to revolve counterclockwise in reaction to spicy
food, you might want to use less than a teaspoon of pepper. Add the
shelled prawns, stir a few times, then let everything marinate for
30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the oil in a wok or skillet over medium-high. Toss in the
shrimp and stir fry about 30 seconds, until the shellfish is pink
and crispy.
</P>
<P>
   Serve as a main dish, a side dish or an appetizer.

   The D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, named for Richard D'Oyly Carte,
who commissioned William S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan in 1875 to
write a one-act operetta, ``Trial by Jury,'' is putting down roots
again in London. After a century at the Savoy Theater, the company
ground to a halt in 1982. Six years later it was resurrected, in
Birmingham. Now, for the first time in 10 years, it is appearing in
London's West End, opening at 7:30 P.M. Monday at the Queen's
Theater with a production of ``The Pirates of Penzance,'' playing
through Jan. 9. Information: 011-44-171-494-5040.  &QL;

AFTER 155 YEARS, TALE OF SCROOGE IS POPULAR AS EVER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo., Okla., Minn., Wash., Ill., Calif.)  (See also SCROOGE-ACTORS) 
(lb) 
 By BRUCE WEBER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONE JACK, Mo. _ Quite dapper in a Victorian frock coat, period
chalk-stripe trousers and a black top hat, Gerald Charles Dickens,
great-great-grandson of the great, great novelist, pointed his
walking stick at the audience gathered here at the local library.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bah, humbug,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dickens, an English actor, is 35, a little young yet, and far
too pleasant looking, for the initial grave misanthropy of Ebenezer
Scrooge, the famous character (created by his famous ancestor) that
he was busily recreating on a makeshift stage.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that didn't faze the audience, 100 or so children and
their mothers, all of them either being introduced to or revisiting
``A Christmas Carol,'' the sentimental story of a bitter man
redeemed by stern but benevolent ghosts on Christmas Eve.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't escaped Dickens' notice that, English provenance
notwithstanding, the Carol, as scholars often refer to it, has
become perhaps America's most significant _ secularly speaking _
holiday legend.
</P>
<P>
   He has spent the last three Christmas seasons in the United
States, doing one-man performances of the Carol and other
Dickensiana in hotels, theaters and libraries, many in towns in the
South and Midwest where live theater performances of any kind are
far from daily fare. Here in Lone Jack, a rural community about an
hour southeast of Kansas City, his listeners gathered afterward for
autographs and a brush with literary history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dickens has total celebrity status over here,'' Gerald Dickens
said in an interview. ``In England, we are blase about him. It's
more like `We've got Chaucer, we've got Shakespeare, all those
other blokes.' Here they show me their copies of the Carol and hold
them out reverently, as though it were an altar cloth. The first
year I did this, I was in total shock.''
</P>
<P>
   Shocked? He probably shouldn't even have been surprised, for the
Carol is such a favorite, such a guaranteed revenue producer, that
according to the Theater Communications Group, an umbrella
organization for nonprofit theaters, there are 33 member theaters
producing it this season; in other words, about 10 percent of the
nonprofit professional theaters in the United States are staging
``A Christmas Carol'' right now.
</P>
<P>
   And that, of course, doesn't include the countless amateur
productions, or the enterprise of the merchants in Skaneateles,
N.Y., who five years ago created an annual Dickens festival on
December weekends, featuring actors performing scenes from the
Carol on street corners.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Gerald Dickens is a mere extra in the cast of thousands
who have played Scrooge for U.S. audiences over the years,
including well-known names from Lionel Barrymore, who performed the
Carol on radio almost every year between 1934 and 1955, to George
C. Scott and Henry Winkler, who appeared in television films of the
Carol, to Albert Finney and Bill Murray, who starred in U.S.-made
feature films (the 1951 British version, starring Alastair Sim,
nonetheless remains incomparable), to Mr. Magoo, Fred Flintstone
and Donald Duck.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Daltrey, the former lead singer of the Who, is the latest
Scrooge to take the stage in Madison Square Garden's annual
production in New York, which has in the past featured Tony
Randall, Hal Linden, Terrence Mann and Roddy McDowall in the role.
</P>
<P>
   But in some ways _ and for many, many people _ it doesn't matter
who is in it. ``I love the play,'' said Kathy Adamec, a 49-year-old
investment counselor from Hinsdale, Ill., who has seen the annual
production at the Goodman Theater in Chicago a dozen times. ``It
still thrills me with the spirit of sharing, and with receiving the
reminder of those less fortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   It used to be that Mrs. Adamec and her husband, Bruce, the
general auditor for Ameritech, would gather several friends and
make an evening of it. Then their nieces came of age, and the Carol
became a family tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It ushers in the Christmas season for us,'' she said. ``For
the kids, there are scary scenes in the play that thrill them, and
it's our way of talking to them about values, like charity, that we
want our girls to know about.''
</P>
<P>
   Written in the fall of 1843, in a break from the serial
composition of ``Martin Chuzzlewit,'' whose popularity was
flagging, the Carol was meant by the author, somewhat
paradoxically, both to draw attention to the plight of the London
poor and to earn money from what he recognized as a holiday market
for tale telling. Published in mid-December, the story was an
immediate sensation, and instantly recognized as adaptable for
dramatization.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it had its archetypal hardhearted villain; its
frightening specters (Scrooge's former partner, Jacob Marley, plus
representatives of Christmases past, present and future _ is there
anyone who doesn't know this?); its poor but forgiving victims (the
Cratchit family, with the lame youngster, Tiny Tim, to tug
mercilessly on the heart), and Scrooge's unmitigatedly joyous
reformation.
</P>
<P>
   That it makes only incidental reference to the religious
occasion of the holiday added to its universal appeal. By
mid-February there were at least five productions, including a
musical, on London stages. The United States' first Carol was in
New York the following Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the Carol has been set to Broadway music, symphonic
music, operatic music. The first movie, silent of course, appeared
in 1901. Adaptations have presented Scrooge as, among other things,
a gay man, a black man, a woman, a television executive and a
Muppet.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>

</P>
<P>
   Each year of its existence, the 11-year-old Pollard Theater in
Guthrie, Okla., has performed ``A Territorial Christmas Carol,'' an
adaptation that takes place in Guthrie in 1889, during the Oklahoma
land rush, with Scrooge as an evil land baron.
</P>
<P>
   The troupe's founding director, Charles Suggs II, said ticket
sales for the Carol were responsible for sustaining the theater
through its first season, and the Pollard has sold about 5,000
tickets to the Carol during its six-week run every year, twice the
total of any of the theater's other offerings, in a city with a
population of 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   At the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, 60,000 people attend
performances of the Carol every year, the vast majority of them not
subscription holders. At A Contemporary Theater in Seattle, the
company is doing so many weekly performances _ up to 13 _ that it
uses two Scrooges, who perform on alternating days.
</P>
<P>
   This year in Chicago, the Goodman Theater is putting on two: its
annual, full-scale version, and in its studio theater a one-man
show, written and performed by Tom Mula, that purports to tell the
story from the perspective of Marley, Scrooge's deceased and
penitent partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is, I would say, largely an American phenomenon, and it's
something that stuns me,'' said Joe Dowling, an Irishman who is now
in his third season as artistic director of the Guthrie.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means this country is more liberal than it sometimes
represents itself,'' he said. ``After all, in the early part of the
play, the market rules. People are responsible for their own
actions, and those who haven't got are at fault.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the end, Scrooge has come round to believing we must have,
if not socialism, then a great deal of social democracy. It's
fascinating that audiences embrace a notion from a 19th-century
British writer. If a 20th-century American writer said the same
things, he'd be viewed as left-wing fringe.''
</P>
<P>
   Carey Perloff, artistic director of the Actors Conservatory
Theater in San Francisco, called the Carol ``the most successful
piece of propaganda ever written,'' noting particularly that for
many in her audience in a city where homelessness and affluence
exist so visibly side by side, the play can't help feeling
political.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's because there's so much wealth here that there's so
much guilt here,'' Ms. Perloff said. ``But you know, Americans
basically do have a social conscience, and they really do believe
they can redeem themselves. They're hopeful that there still is a
body politic.''
</P>
<P>
   But beyond the political, the Carol, with the transformation of
Scrooge at its center, also seems to provide personal solace for
the American soul. In a society as diverse as this, said Jerry
Patch, the dramaturge at the South Coast Repertory Theater in Costa
Mesa, Calif., for which he adapted the Carol, it is an apt
spiritual vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It brings out, as much as any play does, the religious nature
of the theater,'' he said. ``It is an ecumenical experience at a
religious time of year, and the theater becomes more like church
than theater usually is.''
</P>
<P>
   And in a society as emotionally self-conscious as today's, the
Carol may also provide a cautionary tale: Scrooge as mirror.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know who I think it really gets? Men,'' said Kurt Beattie,
who is one of the two Scrooges this year at A Contemporary Theater.
``Particularly the ones I see dragged to the theater by their
wives. But those are the guys who fall over like tenpins. One of
the the things that's powerful is the identification of Scrooge's
grief with childhood, which always has tremendous resonance with
the audience. And particularly with men, because I think the story,
to a large degree, is about a man having walled himself off from
society.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Perloff, whose 9-year-old daughter is performing in the
play, was one of many Scrooge aficionados who said that the Carol
served as a commentary on the commercial nature of modern
Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many parents are overwhelmed by their children's need to
own things they've been told are worth owning,'' she said. ``So in
a way they feel like they hate Christmas. It's so dispiriting that
it comes down to `Did you get the first Cabbage Patch on your
block?' So when Scrooge humbugs around about how horrible Christmas
is, there are many people who relate to it. And even though the end
is so sentimental, it's rejuvenating for people to have that
awfulness stripped away.''
</P>
<P>
   One peculiarity of the Carol's lingering appeal is that though
the spirit of the tale is in Scrooge's emerging humanity, it is his
meanness that people remember. Often fondly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all love a villain more than a regenerate soul,'' said Fred
Kaplan, a Dickens biographer. ``A regenerate soul is wonderful, but
he's a bore. I mean, who wants to hear Clinton apologize?''
</P>
<P>
   In popular usage, after all, a scrooge is, in the words of
Gordon Edelstein, artistic director of A Contemporary Theater, ``a
miser and a misanthrope, two Moliere characters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to encourage our Scrooges to try and find their own
misanthropy, depression, rage, separation from the world,'' said
Edelstein, who is Jewish and who has just directed the Carol for
the first time. Still, he added, that is what supplies the power of
the tale.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not my tradition,'' he said. ``But you know what? I found
it moving. And in some ways transformative. It's a story about
someone who is the worst version of ourselves who becomes the very
best version of who we might be. We all wish to be better people.''

<P>
   James J. Cramer, the money manager, columnist and television

the financial media. After Cramer appeared on CNBC's ``Squawk Box''
program and said he had talked with a broker about the possibility
of short-selling the stock of Wavephore, an Internet broadcasting
company, the network said Cramer would not be allowed back pending
an investigation of complaints made by the company and the
Securities and Exchange Commission.  &QL;

 &HT;    UGA student not your `average' Rhodes Scholar
 &HT;    By Plott Brice
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ There probably is a profile and resume that fits
the conventional image of a Rhodes Scholar.
</P>
<P>
   And then, there is Beth Shapiro. Beth Shapiro, the University of
Georgia's 18th Rhodes Scholar. Beth Shapiro, UGA's first female
Rhodes Scholar.
</P>
<P>
   If the Rhodes image is simply one of academic excellence
achieved by burrowing through a rigorous tunnel of narrow academic
pursuits, then you wouldn't picture Beth Shapiro. She's briefly
traveled the academic map at UGA.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro, who sings a bit of jazz and enjoys a little Wild
Turkey, is a blaze of energy. She's witty and poised, and she
probably never will be accused of being an intellectual snob.
</P>
<P>
   Her goal is to one day connect scientific work and its
importance to the everyday person and she believes her journalism
background will prove useful. Currently a teaching assistant in
ecology/biology, she sees herself as a teacher and researcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``She definitely deserves this,'' said John Pickering, Shapiro's
major professor. ``She has a great career ahead of her. It's hard
to say anything less than glowing comments about her work and
dedication.''
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro, whose home is in Lindale, near Rome, said it still has
not registered with her completely that she will soon walk on
sidewalks and in halls of colleges where some of the best and
brightest have tread.
</P>
<P>
   This year's 32 Rhodes Scholars were chosen from 909 applicants.
The scholarships, created in 1902 by the will of British statesman
and philanthropist Cecil Rhodes, provide two or three years' of
study at Oxford University in England.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am really in awe of going to Oxford,'' Shapiro said. ``It is
astonishing to be in the atmosphere where so many incredible and
interesting people studied.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is no sign that the 22-year-old is intimidated by the
experiences ahead. She may even get an early start next summer
using the third of her Foundation Fellows trips abroad to begin her
work in Edinburgh, Scotland, also noted for evolutionary biology,
her main interest. Her Oxford experience begins Sept. 28.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have two speeds,'' she said. ``One hundred miles per hour
and zero.''
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro spends long hours in the lab in the Biological Sciences
Building, where she is working on her thesis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here about 24 hours a day,'' she said. ``At least, right
now I am.''
</P>
<P>
   When she arrived on the UGA campus in 1994, she wasn't thinking
of the Rhodes. She left Rome High School with a 4.0 grade point
average and some experience in broadcast journalism she picked up
at a local station.
</P>
<P>
   ``And when I was a freshman, I knew exactly what I wanted to
do,''she said. ``I wanted to go into broadcast journalism and I was
very glad I was at the University of Georgia, because they have one
of the best broadcast journalism schools.''
</P>
<P>
   She even worked as news director of a local radio station.
</P>
<P>
   But after one quarter, that certainty gave way to the expansive
horizons of a major university.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized I was in a big place that had a lot of
opportunities available. So I started taking lots of different
courses,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   There was Chinese, and Spanish. Then there was a second choice
of majors and a third. And a fourth. Many students have traveled
that route. But when Shapiro found her niche, she went at it full
tilt. Next spring she will graduate with an unblemished record with
a joint bachelor of science and a master of science degree in
ecology.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are extremely pleased and excited that with Beth's
selection, UGA has produced Rhodes Scholars three out of the last
four years,'' said UGA President Michael Adams. ``Certainly Beth is
representative of the quality of students that we believe are in
place at the University of Georgia.''
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro considers herself ``just a normal student.'' She has
been known to bark with fellow Dawgs at UGA football games. When
she has time, she enjoys hiking, a night out dancing or eating
pizza with friends. Her sister, Meghan, is a junior at UGA.
</P>
<P>
   Jazz is one method of relaxation she really likes. Despite being
declared ``tone deaf'' by her mom, Shapiro tried out for a spot as
a jazz vocalist a few years ago. Her music background consisted of
violin and drums in the high school band.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I auditioned and got the (job) as vocalist and I have been
singing ever since,'' she said. ``I think I am quite good.''
</P>
<P>
   Jazz is also an escape. When the phone calls and requests for
interviews got to be too much for her this month, she ``went home
and put on some jazz and turned it up loud so I couldn't hear the
phone.''
</P>

VIEWS OF SCROOGE FROM THOSE WHO PLAY HIM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Okla., Ill., Minn., Wash.)  (With DICKENS-CHRISTMAS-CAROL) 
(lb) 
 By BRUCE WEBER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A sampling of observations about Scrooge from actors who portray
him:
</P>
<P>
   Hal Landon, 57, South Coast Repertory Theater, Costa Mesa,
Calif., who has played the role for 19 years: ``We admire people
who are good at what they do, and there is a purity about his
miserliness.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Randall, 78, who played the role in Madison Square Garden,
New York, in 1996: ``He's at a point in life where he's nothing but
regrets, excluded from happiness by his own acts, and he knows it.
He's so ready to change he's like a girl whose virtue depends only
on the fact that no one's ever asked her.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Thompson, 71, Pollard Theater, Guthrie, Okla., who played
Scrooge for seven years: ``Most people would spend a significant
portion of their lives like Scrooge if they thought they could get
away with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Raye Birk, 55, Actors Conservatory Theater, San Francisco; three
years as Scrooge: ``There are people in the audience who get off on
Scrooge's meanness, particularly as you get closer to Christmas and
they get more fed up. As the hassle quotient goes up, the arm's
length at which people hold Scrooge gets shorter.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Mula, 47, Goodman Theater, Chicago; seven years in the role,
this year appearing in his own one-man show, ``Jacob Marley's
Christmas Carol'': ``If you're honest, the part gets into you a
little bit. You pick up a little of the meanness, the misanthropy.
I would wake up in the morning with Scrooge on my face. That's not
a pretty thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarlath Conroy, in his 50s, Guthrie Theater, Minneapolis; has
played the part four times: ``What I've tried to do this time
around is put more of the journey Scrooge goes through into the
play. That means you have to explore your own feelings of what
Scrooge lacks, what it is to live without compassion, what it is to
regain compassion, what it is to confront death. The older one
gets, the more one is prepared to look back with compassion, which
is a very relevant thing for Scrooge.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Norris, 50, Goodman Theater, Chicago; played Scrooge for
last 12 years, this year appears as Fezziwig: ``The whole point of
the character is that here's a man who has killed the child within
himself and has to bring the child back to life. In the end he
becomes impulsive. Not childish. Childlike.''
</P>
<P>
   Sean Griffin, 56, A Contemporary Theater, Seattle; played
Scrooge three times: ``Nowadays, I think a lot of people identify
with the first Scrooge, the pre-redemption Scrooge. With so many
homeless people begging on the streets, a lot of us do walk by with
eyes turned away. He calls on the shame that people walk around
with. Maybe we think we are that nasty old Scrooge.''

FINANCIAL COLUMNIST'S COMMENTS START DEBATE 
ANTI-DRUG GROUP TO QUESTION DISCREDITED WRITER 
EX-REPORTER FACES JAIL FOR PROTECTING SOURCE
</HEADLINE>
   (mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the money manager, columnist and television commentator
James Cramer spoke about the fledgling Internet data broadcasting
company Wavephore on the Dec. 2 episode of the CNBC stock-market
program, he probably did not intend to spur a debate on the ethics
of commentators in the financial media.
</P>
<P>
   But that has been the result of his ``Squawk Box'' appearance,
after CNBC, a cable broadcast unit of General Electric Co., said on
Wednesday that Cramer would not be allowed back on the program,
pending an investigation of complaints that Wavephore made to the
network and the Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   In the ``Squawk Box'' segment, Kramer referred to Wavephore,
whose share price had soared 60 percent the day before, as an
example of what he termed ``Fraud-U-Net companies.'' And he said
that he had talked with a broker that morning about the
possibilities of short-selling Wavephore's stock _ that is, placing
a bet that the share price would fall.
</P>
<P>
   The day before Cramer's comments, Wavephore's shares had closed
at $15.25 in Nasdaq trading. Since his television appearance, the
shares have fallen, closing Friday at $8.0625.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ma and Pa Kettle, anyone with a Net connection, can buy and
sell stocks, which puts a certain responsibility on the sector of
financial journalism,'' Glenn Williamson, chief operating officer
for Wavephore, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Cramer declined to be interviewed about the controversy. But on
Friday he wrote at length about it in his daily column that appears
on Thestreet.com, a financial news service in which he is a
co-founder.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I was trying to do was explain why Wavephore stock had
recently soared _ I never had any intention of shorting the
stock,'' Cramer wrote.
</P>
<P>
   George Jamison, a spokesman for CNBC, said the issue had forced
the network to review its own processes with regard to guest
analysts, who already are required to disclose whether they have a
financial stake in any of the companies they discuss during
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cramer did disclose he had no position in Wavefore,'' Jamison
said. ``Our job is to root out the facts and root out the details
and to put the details on the air for our viewers so they can make
decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   In his Friday column, Cramer defended his approach to stock
market commentary: ``Saying that a money manager must never discuss
stocks because it is hopelessly conflicted is a head-in-the-sand
mentality that would deny investors substantive information from
those actually in the business.''

   EMBATTLED WRITER TO MEET WITH ANTI-DRUG GROUP
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to settle the $10-million libel lawsuit filed
against him by the drug prevention group DARE over articles he
wrote about the organization for Rolling Stone and The New
Republic, Stephen Glass has agreed to tell the group what he knows
about the two publications' editing and fact-checking processes.
</P>
<P>
   Glass, whom The New Republic dismissed earlier this year after
determining that he fabricated material for articles he wrote for
the magazine and for other publications, is expected to meet with
representatives of DARE on Jan. 5 for a formal interview that will
stop short of a legal deposition.
</P>
<P>
   Skip Miller, a lawyer for DARE, an acronym for Drug Abuse
Resistance Education, said Glass would be questioned with an eye
toward legal action against the two magazines. Miller said the
group was also seeking an admission from Glass that could be used
to refute contentions in his articles that DARE intimidated critics
into silence.
</P>
<P>
   Miller declined to elaborate on DARE's legal strategy, but Karen
Frederiksen, a First Amendment lawyer in Los Angeles, said that
building a libel case typically involved trying to determine a
publication's conduct from the inception of an article until it
appeared in print.
</P>
<P>
   Gerson Zweifach, a lawyer who has represented Glass on other
issues, said the writer had no agreement spelling out specifically
what he would tell the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Lane, editor of The New Republic, declined to comment on
the agreement between Glass and DARE. An editor at Rolling Stone,
the flagship publication of Wenner Media, did not return calls
seeking comment.

   FORMER JOURNALIST CITED WITH CONTEMPT
</P>
<P>
   A former reporter for a Southern California newspaper has been
cited with contempt and sentenced to jail for refusing to disclose
a source to authorities. If an appeals court upholds the citation,
he would be the first journalist jailed for protecting a source in
more than two decades in California, a state generally seen as
having the strongest so-called shield laws for journalists.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, as a reporter for The Inland Valley Daily Bulletin, an
Ontario, Calif., newspaper with a circulation of 67,000 that is a
member of the Donrey Media Group, John Rezendes-Herrick wrote a
series of articles about how a small agribusiness concern called
Cadiz Land Co. was able to get financing to acquire a much larger
company; he based his reporting in part on tips and documents
provided by a confidential source.
</P>
<P>
   In September of that year, Rezendes-Herrick, who is now a
seventh-grade social studies teacher, was subpoenaed to appear
before a grand jury and asked to identify his source for the Cadiz
articles. The district attorney's office declines to say exactly
what the grand jury is investigating.
</P>
<P>
   After he invoked the state's shield law, Rezendes-Herrick was
found in contempt by a San Bernardino Superior Court judge, and
sentenced last month to five days in jail and a $500 fine. The
sentence has been postponed pending review by a state appeals
court.
</P>
<P>
   Rezendes-Herrick's case may depend on the outcome of another
case being considered by the California Supreme Court. In that
case, an appellate panel found in August that government may have a
law enforcement interest that outweighs a reporter's right to
protect a source. As a result, an exception to the state's shield
law would be extended to prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   If the state's Supreme Court upholds the finding that
prosecutors can subpoena journalists, it could considerably weaken
the shield law and lead courts in other states to decide the issue
the same way, said Thomas Newton, a lawyer for the California
Newspaper Publishers Association.
</P>
<P>
   The last journalist to be sentenced to jail over a confidential
source in California was Bill Farr, a reporter for The Los Angeles
Herald-Examiner who spent 46 days behind bars rather than identify
a source for a story on the Charles Manson case in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Rezendes-Herrick, who became a teacher in January, said he was
torn between his commitments to his students and to his previous
career as a reporter. But he said he remained opposed to
identifying his sources, even if that stance meant spending time in
jail.

 &HT;    Charges dropped against woman in fatal wreck after truck defects
discovered
 &HT;    By Mark Bixler
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A Cherokee County prosecutor says he will drop charges
filed against a woman in a January chain-reaction wreck on I-575
that killed a legislator's secretary because he cannot refute her
claim that a mechanical defect caused the wreck.
</P>
<P>
   Solicitor Channing Ruskell plans to drop vehicular-homicide
charges against Karen Brackett, whose Chevrolet Suburban crossed
the median of I-575 during rush hour in southern Cherokee and
initiated a nine-vehicle crash. Ruskell said an 11-month
investigation lends credence to Brackett's claim that she lost
control when her seat collapsed without warning.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, with the information I have, I do not believe I
could successfully prosecute this case,'' Ruskell said.
</P>
<P>
   The solicitor said he plans to tell a judge Tuesday or on Dec.
29 of his decision not to prosecute Brackett. Ruskell said the
decision follows ``the most thorough investigation I've ever had in
a wreck.''
</P>
<P>
   Brackett was driving south on I-575 during rush hour Jan. 16
when she lost control of her vehicle. It crossed the median near a
bridge that carries Ga. 92 over I-575 and smashed into a
tractor-trailer. The tractor-trailer then lost control and also
crossed the median, slamming into other cars heading toward Atlanta
about 7:10 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   One of those cars, a 1991 Acura Integra, was driven by Vickie
Bell, a 49-year-old mother of two from Woodstock who was driving to
her job as a secretary for Rep. Bob Holmes (D-Atlanta) in the state
capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Nine people were injured in the chain-reaction crash, but Bell
was the only fatality.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was just the greatest person. You can ask anybody,'' said
Anna Boggs, her sister, who also works at the Capitol. ``Not a day
goes by that somebody at the Capitol doesn't come by and just break
down in tears just talking about her.''
</P>
<P>
   Brackett, 44, told state troopers investigating the wreck ``she
was driving down the road and, basically, her seat collapsed and
that caused her to lose control,'' Ruskell said.
</P>
<P>
   He said troopers confirmed that Brackett's seat had collapsed,
but they could not tell whether it collapsed before or after she
hit the tractor-trailer. He said Brackett's insurance company has
hired forensic experts to test the car to determine when the seat
collapsed. A report is expected soon, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Seven months after the wreck, on Aug. 28, state troopers charged
Brackett with second-degree vehicular homicide, failure to maintain
lane and driving too fast for conditions. The vehicular-homicide
charge is a misdemeanor that carries a maximum penalty of a year in
jail.
</P>
<P>
   To convict Brackett of second-degree vehicular homicide, Ruskell
said he would have to prove ``beyond a reasonable doubt'' that
Brackett violated a traffic law that led to Bell's death. Ruskell
said he cannot do that because he cannot disprove that Brackett's
claim that seat collapse caused her to lose control.
</P>
<P>
   The solicitor said he can refile charges up to two years after
the crash if new evidence disputes her claim.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
recalled Chevy Suburbans manufactured from August 1984 to January
1991 - Brackett drove a 1987 Chevy Suburban - because of a problem
that the recall said ``would allow the seat back to suddenly
recline and could result in loss of vehicle control and a vehicle
crash without prior warning.'' Dan Hubbert, a spokesman for General
Motors Corp. in Detroit, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Brackett still faces two lawsuits as a result of the wreck. The
estate of Vickie Bell has sued, claiming that Brackett was driving
too fast, driving recklessly and that she ``failed to maintain a
proper lookout for other known and reasonably foreseeable
automobiles.'' The other lawsuit filed on behalf of Bell's
passenger Annabella Marsano makes the same allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Jean E. Johnson Jr., an attorney representing Marsano and Bell's
estate, said he has been told that attorneys for Brackett will
argue that a mechanical problem caused the wreck.
</P>
<P>
   W. Curtis Anderson, the attorney defending Brackett against the
lawsuits, said another issue that needs ``to be explored further''
is a Georgia Bureau of Investigation laboratory report that Bell
had marijuana in her blood at the time of the wreck.
</P>
<P>
   The accident report lists the presence of marijuana in Bell's
blood as a ``contributing factor'' in the wreck, but State Trooper
Leamon Hughes, who investigated the wreck, and Ruskell said they do
not know whether marijuana played a role in the wreck. Ruskell said
alcohol or marijuana can delay a person's response time, but he
does not know if that happened in this case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say that it absolutely didn't contribute to the
accident or not,'' Ruskell said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Horton McCurdy, a GBI toxicologist, said the amount of
marijuana found in Bell's blood indicates that she had probably
smoked marijuana within 12 hours of the wreck.
</P>
<P>
   It is against the law for people to drive with any amount of
marijuana in their blood.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, the attorney for Bell's estate, said he thinks the
drug-test results are wrong. But even if they are accurate, he
said, they show such a small amount of the drug that it would not
have affected Bell's reaction time or ability to drive.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two months after the wreck, legislators named the
bridge over I-575 the ``Vickie E. Bell Memorial Bridge.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Chuck Scheid (R-Woodstock) said he introduced the measure
to name the bridge for Bell because she was ``well liked and
respected.'' He said he was surprised to hear about the test
results.
</P>
<P>
   Anna Boggs said she did not know about the test results and does
not believe her sister used the drug. Boggs said her sister, who
had worked at the Capitol for 24 years, was kind, raised flowers
and loved antiques.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was everybody's friend. She was the kind of person who
would almost always remember your birthday,'' said Boggs. ``She'd
send you a card or write a letter for no reason at all.''

   IRAQ-US _ BAGHDAD _ With four days of air strikes by U.S. and
British forces over, the Iraqi government claims victory as
President Saddam Hussein is still standing and United Nations
weapons inspectors gone. Iraqi officials take foreign journalists
on a tour of Basra in southern Iraq, where cruise missiles damaged
precious oil fields. As U.S. and British defense officials begin to
assess just how much damage they may, or may not have done, the one
thing becoming immediatelt clear is the anger on the part of Arabs
_ and not just in Iraq. Developing. (Kaplow, Cox News Service)

   RHODES _ ATHENS, Ga. _ There probably is a profile and resume

image is simply academic excellence achieved by burrowing through a

   TRUCK-DEFECT _ ATLANTA _ The Cherokee County Solicitor says he
will drop charges against a woman who caused a Jan. 16 fatal wreck
on on I-575 because he cannot disprove her claim that a mechanical
problem with her 1987 Chevy Suburban caused the wreck.
Investigators have spent 11 months looking into the wreck, which
killed a secretary for Rep. Bob Homes (D-Atlanta). They have
discovered that the National Highway Safety Traffic Administration
recalled the 1987 Chevy Suburban because its front seat could
``suddenly recline'' and cause a ``loss of vehicle control and a
vehicle crash without prior warning.'' The woman who caused the
wreck says her car seat collapsed without warning during rush hour
on I-575 in southern Cherokee County Jan. 16. (Bixler, Atlanta

AFTER MASTERING THE UNIVERSE, BACK TO THE HOMEWORK 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is time to take up childish things.
</P>
<P>
   I am toying with an ocarina, an oval, hollowed gourd with finger
holes, which I gently sound, bending the pitches, controlling the
vibrato, echoing the wispy phrases I recall from Japanese
shakuhachi players.
</P>
<P>
   When I stop fooling around, I play the ``Song of Time.'' That
simple melody helps me warp my adult self back into childhood, when
the world was somewhat less ominous, a time when an ocarina player,
protected with a Hylian Shield and a Kokiri Sword, might have a
fighting chance.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, my ocarina is a screen image in a video game. So, too, is
the wise old Deku Tree, the Fairy Slingshot, the Kakariko Village
and the evil Gonondorf (whom I have yet to encounter). And yes,
this is childish of me. But it is worth putting aside more somber
cares when Shigeru Miyamoto is involved.
</P>
<P>
   Miyamoto is not a screen image, but he has created some of the
most enduring ones for Nintendo. His invention of Mario and Donkey
Kong guaranteed Nintendo's success in the early 1980s, providing
much needed armor as corporate game wars took place, and flocks of
competing systems were blasted out of the sky.
</P>
<P>
   Each time it looked as if Nintendo was about to be undermined by
piercing laser beams from the competition, Miyamoto would invent
yet another variation on a theme, sending the industry scrambling
to produce imitations. He would use the latest gaming technology,
not to create big-breasted heroines or show more vivid spurts of
blood from crushed skulls, but to create nuanced, witty and
dazzling games that had even pretentious adults like me staying up
late, ignoring glazed eyes and strained fingers.
</P>
<P>
   Miyamoto, now head of Nintendo's development department in
Kyoto, Japan, has done it again with The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina
of Time. It is, Nintendo says, the most successful video game ever
released for the now-aging medium. By next week the company expects
to have sold more than 2.5 million copies of the $70 game in just
over a month. And the reviews from the video-game press have been
ecstatic.
</P>
<P>
   So having spent more time than I should admit toying with
various aircraft simulations, battling with invading aliens,
solving interactive detective stories and mastering countless
strategies, I am again warping into childhood. This time, though, I
confess to cutting some corners.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, a player has to wrestle through the game from the
beginning, spending months mastering the intricacies of different
worlds, accumulating weapons and objects, storing the progress in
the game's memory at the end of each session. Now I cheat. Nintendo
lent me a game that a game master had already played through and
saved, so I could sample all of the Zelda universe. I can pretend
that I earned my stripes, but actually I can barely get my boots
on.
</P>
<P>
   But cheating doesn't make it much easier. I still must slowly
learn to maneuver in this eerie 3-D universe, swinging swords and
hammers, changing shields and tunics, exploring the innards of a
fish, the slippery canyons of an ice world or the mirage-ridden
heat of a desert, trying to avoid shooting flames and find ways of
climbing sheer walls.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways the genre is the same as the first Mario game I
played more than 10 years ago: It might be called the video
picaresque. An innocent hero or heroine sets off on a quest but
must first master a strange physical world, learning how to leap,
run, duck, talk, fight. Various traps and dead ends must be
explored, along with the powers and quirks of sundry creatures.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually the player becomes an odd kind of virtuoso, weaving
gracefully through the screen images, picking up a barrel, slashing
a suspicious plant, learning how to climb through spider webs or
shoot arrows at the ceiling, all using the hand-held controller.
</P>
<P>
   Watching an accomplished player can be even more amusing than
risking death oneself. These games do require a subtle sense of
timing, a graceful way with buttons and not a little bit of
cleverness.
</P>
<P>
   But in this new Zelda the video picaresque has become so much
more complicated. The world is three-dimensional. The angle of
vision can change. There are baffling puzzles and seemingly
unwinnable battles.
</P>
<P>
   There is also, near the climax of the game, something almost
uncanny as the child on the screen pulls a sword from a stone and
(yes, the game is full of such self-conscious mythery), becomes an
adult in a wrecked and wracked world. He later returns to childhood
to solve more problems before finally taking on the mantle of
maturity.
</P>
<P>
   And his ocarina, which can really be made to sound like a
distant relative of the shakuhachi, plays tunes that transport him
through time and space.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Miyamoto's creatures often transform themselves, but in this
case the character's transformations back and forth across the
border of adolescence have an unusual resonance.
</P>
<P>
   That border is one of the central preoccupations of video games.
It is where they originated. If video games are simulations at all,
they are simulations of adult mastery. The soldier of fortune, the
sumo wrestler, the football coach and the secret agent are often
given life by a player who has yet to finish his homework.
</P>
<P>
   The game industry has, of course, been expanding its genres and
its appeal, which is why the Sony Playstation is being wryly
advertised this season as a way of keeping husbands from straying.
But the male adolescent imagery remains strong. Most video games
still invoke the experience of the arcade: crowded, dark rooms with
carnivalesque tumult and even at times an ominous sexual anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   In arcades, each hooded screen offers the thrill of near death,
along with the possibility of lasting a little bit longer the next
time, if the physical demands can be met. It is an adolescent
domain, testing and teasing its (usually) male inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   When Miyamoto invented the video picaresque, he didn't reject
the arcade. Rather, he absorbed it, inserting its slice-of-death
action into a larger narrative, treating it as an episode in a
long-range journey requiring imagination rather than just quick
reflexes.
</P>
<P>
   When Miyamoto's games first appeared they were revolutionary,
and they transformed home video games, domesticating the arcade.
They became social games, in which viewers end up coaching,
suggesting, correcting and annoying players. The arcade enshrines
death; the picaresque video game enshrines resurrection.
</P>
<P>
   But with endlessly available lives and no need for quarters, the
greatest challenge is to ensure that living yet again does not
become routine. Hence the hidden levels and treasures, the codes
and maps, the special maneuvers and easily missed details.
</P>
<P>
   And when eventually, after many hours of exploration, the
picaresque hero approaches the final battle, the child-player has
indeed mastered something, gaining some glimpse of what it must be
like for those enviable creatures living at the other side of
adolescence. Now, if only I could attain that childish level of
mastery.

BOMBING SEEN AS EFFECTIVE BUT NOT DAMAGING TO HUSSEIN
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq _ The last bomb to fall on Baghdad during the
70-hour campaign that ended Saturday night destroyed a wing of the
Labor and Social Affairs Ministry, and by midday Sunday hundreds of
people had come to view the damage.
</P>
<P>
   Repair crews were already at work. A phalanx of Kawasaki
bulldozers plowed debris into piles and lifted it onto trucks to be
carted away. Souvenir-seekers picked through the rubble in search
of shrapnel.
</P>
<P>
   Most laborers and onlookers called the bombing a barbaric and
criminal act and bitterly condemned President Clinton for ordering
it. That was no surprise, not only because Iraq has endured years
of economic sanctions and military attacks, but also because
political dissent here can be _ and often is _ punished by summary
execution.
</P>
<P>
   A 21-year-old Jordanian who is studying at Baghdad University
offered a somewhat more balanced assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both countries lost,'' the student, Hasan al-Atoun, said as he
looked over the piles of shattered brick and glass. ``Iraq lost
because it suffered terrible damage like this. America lost because
it hurt its relations with Russia, the Arab world and many other
countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreign diplomats who hurried to file reports to their
governments Sunday argued among themselves over why the ministry
was hit. Some said it had been used as an intelligence center and
speculated that sensitive documents might have been stored there.
Others guessed that the real target was a military academy across
the street.
</P>
<P>
   Such speculation was especially intense because in contrast to
earlier allied raids, relatively few bombs fell on Baghdad in this
latest campaign, and there is little damage to see. Most of the
attacks were on positions elsewhere in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary Western assessments of the damage suggested that the
bombing was effective. Those reports gained some credence when the
Iraqi government failed to invite foreign journalists to view
destroyed targets. In the past they have shown off what appeared to
be homes and other civilian buildings that had been hit.
</P>
<P>
   A British military officer, speaking in Kuwait, said 600
aircraft missions had been flown in the last week, including 50 by
British planes.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the missions were support sorties to get bombers to
their targets, said the officer, Group Commander Bryan Collins. He
added that about 400 cruise missiles had struck Iraq, fired at some
100 targets.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the raids were successful in destroying Iraqi
military bases and centers where chemical and biological weapons
may have been developed, there is no sign that they came anywhere
close to achieving the West's larger political objective of
removing President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam, whose government the United States and Britain are
determined to crush, emerged at least as powerful as he was before
the raids. He won the sympathy of France, Russia and China, all
permanent members of the U.N. Security Council. And Palestinians in
the West Bank and demonstrators in Yemen, Syria and Jordan have
poured into the streets to support him.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a military operation it was perfect, a textbook case,''
said one foreign envoy here. ``Important targets were hit, no
planes were lost and there was little or no collateral damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this was not just a military operation. The real purpose
was to weaken the regime, but he's stronger than ever now. He's a
hero among the so-called Arab masses because he defied the
Americans. Which despotic leader has survived so long in a war
situation?''
</P>
<P>
   Life in Baghdad was barely disrupted by the bombing. Sunday a
grocer named Abdul Gesan stood in his shop and said that compared
to what he had seen as a soldier in the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s
and the invasion of Kuwait in 1990, this had been ``no more
frightening than rain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people are good, but the leaders are bad,'' Gesan
said. ``They are cowboys. It is all about Monica.''
</P>
<P>
   On one Iraqi television broadcast, an announcer said it was no
coincidence that the bombing had ended as soon as the congressional
vote on Clinton's impeachment had been taken. On another, Saddam
appeared personally to thank his people for helping him win what he
called his latest confrontation with ``enemies of God and
humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You were up to the level that your leadership and your brother
and comrade Saddam Hussein had hoped you would be,'' he said. ``God
has rewarded you and delighted your hearts with the sweetness of
victory.''
</P>
<P>
   During his broadcast, Saddam was dressed in military fatigues.
It was only one of the many personas he assumes. The hundreds of
portraits of him that are painted on walls here, many of them
larger than life, show him in almost every imaginable guise.
</P>
<P>
   In some he is jowly and patriarchal, in others dashing and
movie-star handsome. One shows him earnest and looking very young,
dressed in a blue suit as if posing for a high school yearbook
picture. Another depicts him as the benevolent father, a wedding
ring on his finger and an adorable little girl on his knee.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the oddest, he grins widely and wears a Panama hat,
sunglasses and a white shirt open to the waist, looking as if he
should be sipping an exotic drink at a tropical resort.
</P>
<P>
   ``They bomb us, but our Saddam Hussein is still here,'' said a
man selling pine saplings along one of Baghdad's main streets. ``Do
you understand now why we say we love him?''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One message from the House for President Clinton on
Saturday was that he was blessed with the stalwart loyalty of his
fellow Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Only five Democrats broke ranks and voted for any of the
articles of impeachment. Afterward, in a striking display, two
busloads of Democratic lawmakers rallied behind the president on
the South Lawn of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   But many Democrats did not rally around their president out of
heartfelt fealty. Instead, in opposing impeachment and standing,
literally, with Clinton many were registering their disapproval of
how Republicans have handled the inquiry _ as well as their belief
that impeachment is not warranted. A number of House Democrats
expressed that view in interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you'd find a whole lot of loyalty to Bill
Clinton around here,'' said Rep. Louise M. Slaughter of upstate New
York. ``He's not the best Democrat any of us have seen. Most of us
are scared to death of the constitutional'' implications.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland said he, too, was ``not
rallying around the president.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A large number of us,'' he said, ``are saying, `We don't have
to cross the line of personal loyalty.' There are some who are so
outraged by how the president was treated, the whole process, the
Starr investigation. The other half of our caucus is somewhat in
bewilderment that this even elevates to an impeachable offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David E. Skaggs of Colorado said: ``If you accumulated the
credit balance on the loyalty account with all Democratic members
of the House, it's in the black, but not by a lot because there's
been this general sense over there that there's not a lot of
loyalty shown in the other direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Skaggs, who is retiring, added: ``We all have this running
love-hate relationship with the president. On one hand he's a
charming and good leader. On the other hand, he's absolutely
infuriating and alienating.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he was rallying around the president out of
loyalty, Rep. Rick Boucher of Virginia, a member of the Judiciary
Committee, said: ``Absolutely not. Every one here has a deep
disdain for his conduct. It is deplorable. He has dishonored his
office.''
</P>
<P>
   But, in opposing impeachment, Boucher said, ``I see myself
defending the public interest, the constitutional standard for
impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Rep. Robert Wexler of Florida, who was one of the most
vociferous defenders of Clinton on the Judiciary Committee,
conceded that his fervency was not borne of affection for the
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm rallying around the Constitution,'' he said. ``I'm
rallying around the American presidency. This has become far bigger
than Bill Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   The notion of an outpouring of devotion to Clinton may be
particularly misplaced because many Democrats are still bitter at
the president on a number of counts, from accusations that he shut
them out of numerous policy deliberations _ preferring to do
business with Republicans _ to blaming him for costing them control
of the House in the 1994 election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even as recently as last fall we were pretty much shut out,''
Mrs. Slaughter said. ``The difficulty I've got in my district is
people perceive that I'm protecting him. My problem is I do believe
he is being railroaded.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the lingering tensions between Democratic lawmakers and
the president, one House Democratic leadership aide said he was
surprised that members of his party had stood behind the president
so solidly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The don't like the president,'' the aide said, speaking on the
condition of anonymity. ``But the Republicans have done a good job
at uniting us _ and driving us into his arms.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster, said he believed that it
was easier for Republicans to be more passionate because even many
Democrats who oppose impeachment feel a conflict between their
anger at the Republicans and their rage at Clinton for his
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the cause looks completely holy, you're going to give it
your all,'' Mellman said. ``If Democrats thought the president did
the right thing in having this relationship _ and did nothing wrong
_ it would be easier to be a 100 percenter. It's hard to summon the
same level of fervency when you think that what the Republicans are
doing is reprehensible, but you also think what the president did
was reprehensible _ but not impeachable.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Three days after their company managed one of the
most successful initial public offerings in the short history of
the Internet, brothers Jack and Murray Hidary, the founders of New
York-based Earthweb, made a private donation of $10,000 to a
nonprofit group known as Mouse, an acronym for Making Opportunities
for Upgrading Schools and Education.
</P>
<P>
   Mouse was founded 14 months ago by Andrew Rasiej, a nightclub
owner turned philanthropist, to help wire and provide technical
support to New York City's public high schools. Essentially, the
organization consists of a staff of three and 700 volunteers _ no
hardware, no software, no wire.
</P>
<P>
   The Hidary brothers were among its first volunteers, and they
represent a growing commitment among Silicon Alley companies to
share time and, when possible, cash with a new generation of
nonprofit groups founded to distribute the benefits of technology.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Hidary said his eyes were opened to a growing social
problem when he volunteered to help wire Washington Irving High
School last year. ``That's when I realized what a lack of
infrastructure there is in the schools,'' he said. ``If we allow
students to grow up without being connected, they're going to be at
a real disadvantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Mouse is now managing programs in 13 New York public high
schools, and Rasiej is on a crusade to enlist members of the city's
new-media industry. ``Many of the people in the community don't
have the ability to write a big check,'' he said of an industry
full of cash-short start-ups. ``But they can leverage something
more valuable; they can leverage their expertise.''
</P>
<P>
   When seeking companies' resources, Rasiej, who also runs the
Intel Music Festival for profit, appeals directly to their bottom
line. ``The companies need to realize there aren't any customers if
people can't get online,'' he said. ``They have to help create
their future customers and their future employees. You have to
light a fire, and then the customers will demand it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another high-profile nonprofit group that Mouse often passes the
baton to when seeking staff development is Heaven (Helping,
Educate, Activate, Volunteer and Empower).
</P>
<P>
   The national organization, which is based in New York, was
founded in 1997 with backing from America Online and Time Warner's
New Line Cinema. It is run by Wendy Dubit, who has forfeited her
for-profit new-media career as a marketing and Web-content
developer to make Heaven work for inner-city high school students.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heaven exists to use new media to benefit society and bridge
the digital divide,'' Ms. Dubit said. ``We want to coalesce the
industry and users around using these tools for positive social
change.''
</P>
<P>
   Heaven operates a job-training and internship program, called
Angels, for inner-city high school students; Ms. Dubit describes it
as ``a way of addressing the biggest problem we face: narrowing the
gap between the haves and the have-nots.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Heaven's first students was 15-year-old Gabriel Almanzar,
a student at Beacon High School on West 61st Street. After
completing Heaven's initial training course where he learned, among
other things, how to use Adobe Photoshop, a graphics and digital
darkroom program, Gabriel took an internship at a small publishing
company called Global Liaisons in Manhattan where he helped the
owner, Wendy Diamond, find and format photographs and often worked
with other, more technologically sophisticated shops on production.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really liked meeting all the people,'' Gabriel said. ``And I
taught Wendy how to use Adobe.''
</P>
<P>
   Tiffany Lee, a senior at Benjamin Banneker High School in
Brooklyn, is finishing a Heaven internship at Silicon Alley-based
Theglobe.com, a community-based Web site. She works 15 hours a week
in the marketing and public relations department, organizing media
kits, helping with the editorial calendar and sometimes helping
organize chat groups.
</P>
<P>
   Tiffany said she was surprised by the reception she got at the
company. ``In other jobs I've had, the people in charge of me have
been really nasty,'' she said. ``But there, they respect me a
lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Heaven, the Digital Clubhouse, located at the New York
Information and Technology Center at 55 Broad St., has an agenda to
teach multimedia skills, but not just to teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   The original Digital Clubhouse was started in Silicon Valley in
1996 and opened its New York center in the summer of 1997. It is
modeled as a community resource and learning center, a place where
people can come to learn software programs, how to build Web pages
or create a CD-ROM.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clubhouse came out of a small NASA project,'' said
Jennifer Douglas, director of the New York center. ``They wanted to
see how 21st-century technology would be used by communities. What
came out of talking with focus groups was that something called the
Digital Clubhouse would make sense.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clubhouse's latest project is the Digitally Abled Producers
Project, which is financed by Mitsubishi Electric America
Foundation. ``The program is made up of students, half with
disabilities, who are learning Web production and digital
storytelling by creating CD-ROMs,'' Ms. Douglas said. ``They use
personal photographs, artwork and narration to tell their own
stories.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in cyberspace, two Web developers, David Perez and Lila
Heymann, are preparing to start the Silverlining Network, a site
for families with seriously ill children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a place where families can meet one another,'' Perez
said. ``They can link to resources, chat with experts in the field
or read feature articles, like on how serious illnesses affect
siblings.'' Perez and Ms. Heymann hope to have the site operating
by mid-1999.
</P>
<P>
   The assets that all of these fledgling nonprofit groups say they
need are more volunteers and corporate financial support. But
Rasiej, for one, insists that his organization's potential is far
too great to leave its fate to the generosity of the Fortune 500 _
and that the Silicon Alley community has a great deal to gain from
getting involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to get the entrepreneurs to think about themselves in
the silhouette of a Cooper or a Rockefeller, the leaders of the
industrial revolution,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It is a comparison that New York entrepreneurs like the Hidary
brothers are probably happy to accept.

`DEATH TO AMERICA': WONDERING ABOUT VICTORY IN THE WAR ON
TERRORISM 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you have lost track, amid the unfamiliar names and murky
allegations of who is supposed to have done what in the year's
terrorist bombings in East Africa, Monday night's ``Investigative
Reports'' provides a sketchy guide. Drawn mainly from U.S. sources,
``Death to America: The Terrorism Trail'' lays out the evidence and
suspicions of what has become the case of the United States of
America vs. Osama bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   In the months since the August explosions, bin Laden, the Saudi
millionaire who fought the Soviet Union in Afghanistan before
turning to preaching the murder of Americans, has been described by
one investigator as ``a financial godfather'' of international
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   This hourlong program, which begins with pictures of stunned and
bloodied survivors, mostly Africans, moves like an exotic-locale
paperback mystery, from a seemingly suspicious patient in a Nairobi
hospital to a Jordanian in Karachi, Pakistan, to a
Lebanese-American in the United States. The FBI says it can connect
these plotters with bin Laden, whom it also credits with playing a
part in driving U.S. troops out of Somalia in 1992 and in the
bombing of the World Trade Center in Manhattan in 1993. He has been
indicted in New York, with a reward of $5 million for anybody out
there who can bring him in.
</P>
<P>
   The charges have yet to be tested in court, but there has
already been controversy over a retaliatory strike by the United
States on what was advertised as a factory in Sudan that produced
nerve gas. The Sudanese deny it, and the program's reporter says
there are signs that the demolished factory was what they say it
was, a pharmaceutical plant. However that dispute turns out, no one
claims that America's response is likely to do much to discourage
terrorism. An investigator, who might have been commenting on last
week's headlines, says, ``You can't fight terrorism with a cruise
missile.''
</P>
<P>
   This brisk hour leaves open the question of whether even the
capture of bin Laden would make life safer for Americans. The
publicity spotlight has given the man the aura of a mastermind of
terrorism, but the program leaves the caution that such is the
nature of terror and fear that the war against them may be
unwinnable.

`GOTTA SING, GOTTA DANCE': A SINGER-DANCER'S IMPERATIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ky.)  (lb) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Can a limber, starry-eyed boy from Covington, Ky.,
find happiness as a dancer and singer on the stages of Las Vegas
and on Broadway? Lee Roy Reams' autobiographical cabaret show,
``Gotta Sing, Gotta Dance,'' at the Firebird Cafe, answers that
question with an emphatic yes.
</P>
<P>
   Telling the story of his journey from Kentucky to Broadway via
Las Vegas (where he worked as a dancer for Juliet Prowse), Reams
has an anecdote for every turn in the road. Ann Miller, Bob Fosse,
Gwen Verdon, Gower Champion, David Merrick, Dorothy Fields and
Prowse, among others, are remembered in revealing backstage
reminiscences.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most touching stories recalls Champion, shortly
before his death, explaining his decision to direct the hit musical
``42nd Street.'' ``I didn't want to be remembered as a has-been,''
he said bluntly. Ms. Verdon's fear of singing and Ms. Miller's
salty tongue are also remembered.
</P>
<P>
   The show skillfully interweaves stories and songs into a
surprisingly intimate personal history that evokes the exhilaration
and uncertainty of show business. Its happy ending arrives with
Reams' last-minute selection for the young lead role of Billy
Lawlor in ``42nd Street'' after having been told he was too old for
the part.
</P>
<P>
   Reams may not be an especially commanding vocalist (he suggests
a Broadway equivalent of Neil Sedaka), but he imparts a touching
sincerity to a program whose high point is an extended medley from
the 1966 show ``Sweet Charity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Gotta Sing, Gotta Dance,'' which plays through Jan. 2,
concludes with a winningly heartfelt version of that ultimate
Broadway gypsy anthem ``What I Did for Love.''

PLAYING MOVIES LIKE A GROWTH STOCK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Canada)  (js) 
 By LINDA LEE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Call it the ``Full Monty'' wager.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, flush with money from the bull market in stocks and
seeing a big upside potential in inexpensive little films, three
independent film companies were set up by players better known as
financiers than auteurs.
</P>
<P>
   There was Artisan Entertainment, bankrolled by the venture
capital firm Bain Capital, which had advised clients about
investing in movie companies, but never before bought one. There
was Lions Gate Entertainment, headed by Frank Giustra, an
investment banker in Vancouver, British Columbia, whose prior
specialty was taking mining companies public. And then there was
Stratosphere Entertainment, founded by the corporate raider Carl C.
Icahn.
</P>
<P>
   Driving their ambitions was the quest to find or, even better,
to make a movie as successful as Fox Searchlight's ``Full Monty,''
a 1997 release that cost only $3.5 million but grossed $256 million
worldwide. Fox Searchlight is owned by News Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the attendant glamour, ``there is a huge appeal for
people to finance movies, especially in good years,'' said Mark
Curcio, chief executive of Artisan Entertainment. ``There are
always irrational reasons for investing. If it's not movies, it's
airlines. And probably casinos and sports teams.''
</P>
<P>
   For each of the new, financially attuned companies, the real
attraction was the prospect of spotting a bargain and playing it
like a growth stock _ as Artisan did, when it paid $500,000 at the
Sundance Festival for ``Pi,'' a film about a man's mystical
obsession with numbers that has grossed $3 million at the U.S. box
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got the world for $500,000,'' crowed Amir Malin, one of
Artisan's two presidents.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, despite occasionally catching the eye of the critics,
most notably with Lions Gate's Golden Globe nominee ``Gods and
Monsters,'' there is no certainty that these independent film
upstarts will fare any better in the art-film market than the last
time a pack of start-up companies entered the independent film
business _ during the high-flying 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today mirrors the '80s, when companies like New World,
Atlantic Releasing and Cinecom were all gearing to go public,''
said Tom Bernard, the co-president of Sony Pictures Classics,
which, like many of the most prominent ``independents'' today, is
actually owned by a large studio. By the early '90s New World,
Atlantic Releasing and Cinecom had left the independent film
business.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, like such established independent film
companies as Sony Pictures Classics and Disney's Miramax, the new
crop of independents produces movies as well as buys them. And so
far, among the three upstarts, Artisan seems to be in the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Bain Capital, in partnership with the investment fund Richland
Gordon &AMP; Co., formed Artisan out of the old Live Entertainment,
which had primarily been a video distributor and owned a video
library of 1,700 titles including ``Terminator 2'' and ``Basic
Instinct.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to build a lasting independent company you need to
buy a library and build a stable cash-flow stream,'' Curcio said.
``Then you can leverage that into doing smart production.'' Artisan
has expanded its video library to more than 6,000 titles.
</P>
<P>
   Among films that Artisan has produced itself, the company this
year had a critical success _ if not a financial one _ with
``Permanent Midnight,'' starring Ben Stiller. And Artisan will soon
release Roman Polanski's ``Ninth Gate,'' starring Johnny Depp and
Frank Langella.
</P>
<P>
   Curcio said he was satisfied with the first year's results.
``Live was $120 million in revenue,'' he said. ``At the end of this
year we will be over $200 million in revenue, and very
profitable.'' He declined to elaborate _ the prerogative of a
private company.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Many people heard of Lions Gate for the first time in May, when
the magic name Leonardo DiCaprio was attached to Lions Gate's
planned film ``American Psycho,'' based on the controversial Bret
Easton Ellis novel. But after the director, Mary Harron, was
shouldered aside to allow DiCaprio to choose his own director, the
actor himself backed out of the deal. Ms. Harron recently returned
to the project, in which the male lead will now be played by
Christian Bale.
</P>
<P>
   Lions Gate Entertainment, based in Vancouver, is publicly traded
on the Toronto Stock Exchange. And, as of last month its shares
were listed on the American Stock Exchange, where they have drifted
in the $3.25 to $3.50 range, closing Friday at $3.1875, unchanged
for the day. Expanding into the U.S. equities market is part of the
company's growth plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that we have access to capital, we can exploit that
access,'' said Jeff Sackman, president of Lions Gate Films, the
film production and acquisition division of Lions Gate
Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Lions Gate Entertainment had a net loss of $1.34 million
(Canadian), or $870,500 (United States) in its fiscal second
quarter, which ended Sept. 30, but operating earnings of $464,000
(Canadian) on revenue of $24.3 million (Canadian). The founder,
Giustra, has set up Lions Gate Entertainment as a broad-based film
entertainment company.
</P>
<P>
   The Lions Gate Films division is the former Cinepix Film
Properties, which had 800 films in its library before being
acquired by Giustra. Lions Gate Entertainment also has a production
deal with the producer Peter Guber's Mandalay Entertainment, which
has made films with solid box-office results like ``I Know What You
Did Last Summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Lions Gate Films' year-end hopes rest with ``Affliction,'' a
film starring Nick Nolte, Sissy Spacek, James Coburn and Willem
Dafoe that opens Dec. 30 and for which Nolte has been nominated for
a Golden Globe award.
</P>
<P>
   The third new company, Stratosphere, is off to a slower
beginning. Having started from scratch, rather than acquiring other
distributors, Icahn's company has no library of old films. And it
has the added challenge of specializing in the release of foreign
films _ a hard way for a U.S. film company to make money, despite
Miramax's success at that game. Of the handful of foreign films it
has acquired, Stratosphere has released the subtitled Austrian film
``Inheritors,'' and the subtitled Russian-language film ``The
Thief,'' which was nominated for an Academy Award for the best
foreign-language film.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I broke even on `The Thief,' maybe even made money,''
said Paul E. Cohen, an experienced independent film executive who
runs Stratosphere for Icahn. ``We've done about $1.1 million to
date.''
</P>
<P>
   The company had a rougher time, though, with its U.S. films like
``One Tough Cop,'' starring Stephen Baldwin. Stratosphere paid
$2.25 million for the movie, which has taken in only $1.5 million
since opening 11 weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   But it has high hopes for ``Hideous Kinky,'' a film starring the
``Titanic'' heroine Kate Winslet, which Stratosphere will release
next year.
</P>
<P>
   For the independent film companies, the hot foreign markets of
last year have cooled.
</P>
<P>
   Sackman of Lions Gate Films acknowledges international concerns.
``Clearly, the worldwide economic situation affects this industry
as much as any others,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know what we're doing, but I wouldn't recommend others get
into it. Not now.'' &QL;

BOMBING SEEN AS EFFECTIVE BUT NOT DAMAGING TO HUSSEIN

<P>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq _ The last bomb to fall on Baghdad during the
70-hour campaign that ended Saturday night destroyed a wing of the
Labor and Social Affairs Ministry, and by midday Sunday hundreds of
people had come to view the damage.
</P>
<P>
   Repair crews were already at work. A phalanx of Kawasaki
bulldozers plowed debris into piles and lifted it onto trucks to be
carted away. Souvenir-seekers picked through the rubble in search
of shrapnel.
</P>
<P>
   Most laborers and onlookers called the bombing a barbaric and
criminal act and bitterly condemned President Clinton for ordering
it. That was no surprise, not only because Iraq has endured years
of economic sanctions and military attacks, but also because
political dissent here can be _ and often is _ punished by summary
execution.
</P>
<P>
   A 21-year-old Jordanian who is studying at Baghdad University
offered a somewhat more balanced assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both countries lost,'' the student, Hasan al-Atoun, said as he
looked over the piles of shattered brick and glass. ``Iraq lost
because it suffered terrible damage like this. America lost because
it hurt its relations with Russia, the Arab world and many other
countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreign diplomats who hurried to file reports to their
governments Sunday argued among themselves over why the ministry
was hit. Some said it had been used as an intelligence center and
speculated that sensitive documents might have been stored there.
Others guessed that the real target was a military academy across
the street.
</P>
<P>
   Such speculation was especially intense because in contrast to
earlier allied raids, relatively few bombs fell on Baghdad in this
latest campaign, and there is little damage to see. Most of the
attacks were on positions elsewhere in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary Western assessments of the damage suggested that the
bombing was effective. Those reports gained some credence when the
Iraqi government failed to invite foreign journalists to view
destroyed targets. In the past they have shown off what appeared to
be homes and other civilian buildings that had been hit.
</P>
<P>
   A British military officer, speaking in Kuwait, said 600
aircraft missions had been flown in the last week, including 50 by
British planes.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the missions were support sorties to get bombers to
their targets, said the officer, Group Commander Bryan Collins. He
added that about 400 cruise missiles had struck Iraq, fired at some
100 targets.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the raids were successful in destroying Iraqi
military bases and centers where chemical and biological weapons
may have been developed, there is no sign that they came anywhere
close to achieving the West's larger political objective of
removing President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam, whose government the United States and Britain are
determined to crush, emerged at least as powerful as he was before
the raids. He won the sympathy of France, Russia and China, all
permanent members of the U.N. Security Council. And Palestinians in
the West Bank and demonstrators in Yemen, Syria and Jordan have
poured into the streets to support him.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a military operation it was perfect, a textbook case,''
said one foreign envoy here. ``Important targets were hit, no
planes were lost and there was little or no collateral damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this was not just a military operation. The real purpose
was to weaken the regime, but he's stronger than ever now. He's a
hero among the so-called Arab masses because he defied the
Americans. Which despotic leader has survived so long in a war
situation?''
</P>
<P>
   Life in Baghdad was barely disrupted by the bombing. Sunday a
grocer named Abdul Gesan stood in his shop and said that compared
to what he had seen as a soldier in the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s
and the invasion of Kuwait in 1990, this had been ``no more
frightening than rain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people are good, but the leaders are bad,'' Gesan
said. ``They are cowboys. It is all about Monica.''
</P>
<P>
   On one Iraqi television broadcast, an announcer said it was no
coincidence that the bombing had ended as soon as the congressional
vote on Clinton's impeachment had been taken. On another, Saddam
appeared personally to thank his people for helping him win what he
called his latest confrontation with ``enemies of God and
humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You were up to the level that your leadership and your brother
and comrade Saddam Hussein had hoped you would be,'' he said. ``God
has rewarded you and delighted your hearts with the sweetness of
victory.''
</P>
<P>
   During his broadcast, Saddam was dressed in military fatigues.
It was only one of the many personas he assumes. The hundreds of
portraits of him that are painted on walls here, many of them
larger than life, show him in almost every imaginable guise.
</P>
<P>
   In some he is jowly and patriarchal, in others dashing and
movie-star handsome. One shows him earnest and looking very young,
dressed in a blue suit as if posing for a high school yearbook
picture. Another depicts him as the benevolent father, a wedding
ring on his finger and an adorable little girl on his knee.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the oddest, he grins widely and wears a Panama hat,
sunglasses and a white shirt open to the waist, looking as if he
should be sipping an exotic drink at a tropical resort.
</P>
<P>
   ``They bomb us, but our Saddam Hussein is still here,'' said a
man selling pine saplings along one of Baghdad's main streets. ``Do
you understand now why we say we love him?''

<P>
   Reports of a drastic falloff in the 18- to 34-year-old
television audience this season, costing the broadcast networks
tens of millions of dollars, have touched off an angry debate
between the networks and the company that provides the measurements
they live by.
</P>
<P>
   Broadcasters' relations with Nielsen Media Research, always
tense, have degenerated to the point where an NBC executive accused
Nielsen of ``something approaching fraud'' for reporting that the
young-adult viewing audience has plunged 6 percent this fall,
compared with its level a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Schiavone, senior vice president of research for NBC, made
that accusation in an interview on Friday in which he described
Nielsen's measurements as seriously flawed. ``If we don't get an
answer soon,'' about how Nielsen intends to correct its data,
Schiavone said, ``then they are in breach of their contract with
us.''
</P>
<P>
   With the economics of network television already at a crisis
point, a reported decline in viewing by the young adults highly
prized by advertisers has enormous financial implications.
Schiavone estimated that NBC has lost $66 million in advertising
revenue since September because of Nielsen's audience data. That
loss comes at a time when NBC's profits are already in steep
decline because of the departure of ``Seinfeld'' and the enormously
inflated cost of other shows, like ``E.R'' and ``Mad About You.''
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen's reports of a 6 percent decline in television viewing
throughout the day by adults between the ages of 18 and 34 applies
to all channels, not just network channels, both in broadcast and
cable television.
</P>
<P>
   The latest data mean that the average young adult viewer is
watching a little over half an hour less each day, according to
Barry Cook, senior vice president of research for Nielsen.
</P>
<P>
   The networks argue that such a drastic change in viewing habits
is simply not plausible.
</P>
<P>
   But Nielsen, without venturing a reason for the shrinking
audience, argues that a separate study it has conducted not only
validates its initial findings but suggests that the falloff may be
even worse _ as much as 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Cook dismissed the networks' accusations of flawed data. ``They
are losing focus on what is happening,'' he said, citing what he
described as a long-term trend line that shows diminishing viewing
by younger adults that goes back to 1991.
</P>
<P>
   But Schiavone's contentions at NBC have been backed by research
executives at the other networks, all of whom dispute Nielsen's
findings as outside the realm of statistical probability. ``A
change in viewing habits this radical just doesn't make sense,''
said Alan Wurtzel, senior vice president of research for ABC Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Wurtzel noted that a similar problem in 1990, later corrected by
Nielsen, wound up costing ABC $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   David Poltrack, executive vice president of research for CBS,
said, ``The problem with this is that even if Nielsen eventually
corrects the problem, in the interim you're losing money, big
money.''
</P>
<P>
   One potential outcome of this dispute is renewed hope for a
rival ratings service, Smart, which has been mounted on an
experimental basis by Statistical Research Inc., a company based in
Westfield, N.J., that is best known for measuring radio network
audiences. Smart _ which stands for Systems for Measuring and
Reporting Television _ is still seeking a partner with the
financial clout to establish a full-fledged national rating service
to compete with Nielsen, which has held a monopoly on television
measurement for most of the history of the medium.
</P>
<P>
   As a bit of evidence contradicting Nielsen's data, Poltrack
cited results from the Smart experimental system now operating in
Philadelphia. Smart's ratings there show a slight increase this
fall among viewers in the 18-to-34 category. He also pointed to the
fact that viewing levels for other age groups tracked by Nielsen
have not demonstrated a comparable one-year collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Poltrack and other network research executives contend that the
problem lies in Nielsen's methods. They say young viewers are
notoriously resistant to the daily button-pushing required in the
Nielsen ``people meter'' system and argue that Nielsen has
consistently had trouble keeping the level of young adults willing
to participate its in survey at acceptable levels.
</P>
<P>
   The Smart system is designed to streamline the button pushing
while also using program codes that automatically track each show
that the television tunes in.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But Cook, of Nielsen, said that this season's fall-off simply
looked excessive when compared with an uptick in viewing reported
by Nielsen last fall. And he suggested that last year may have
actually been the the anomaly. He said a ``unified study'' that
measured the same young viewers known to be in the Nielsen sample
both last year and this year indicated a full 10 percent drop-off
in television viewing in the 18-to-34 group.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to offer any theory for the dropoff. But he
dismissed suggestions that it might be related to higher use of the
Internet because another Nielsen study had previously indicated
that Internet users were already light viewers of television _ and
so would not account for such a significant change from last fall.
</P>
<P>
   The network researchers attacked Cook's unified study, saying
the sample included viewers who had been participants for as little
as a single day in the month measured during both years, and that
it did not include the same number of viewers from one year to the
next.
</P>
<P>
   Cook acknowledged that ``billions of dollars are at stake'' for
the networks and for every television channel that sells commercial
time in advance to advertisers. The sales are based on audience
forecasts, and the networks have to give away free commercials to
make up for any shortfalls. But Cook suggested that the networks
should have made their estimates to advertisers on the basis of the
longer-term trend, not on the uptick recorded last fall.
</P>
<P>
   He also noted that it was not surprising that NBC was leading
the charge against Nielsen, because the network's ratings have
taken a particularly precipitous fall this season _ 25 percent
fewer households, compared with last year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is most alarming to some people who sold the audience
ahead of time,'' Cook said. ``They should have hedged their
promises.''
</P>
<P>
   That suggestion only added fuel to the outrage among some of the
network executives, who accused Nielsen of trying to glibly explain
away a serious problem with its measurement methods.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Wurtzel noted that Nielsen's first response
to network complaints earlier this month about younger men falling
out of its survey was to suggest, in a letter sent to ABC, that the
cause was lower interest rates for home buyers. (If more young
people were moving, Nielsen argued, there was a higher rate of
turnover in its sample.)
</P>
<P>
   NBC does clearly seem the most willing to take the fight with
Nielsen to an active stage. Schiavone said the network intends to
challenge Nielsen's credibility. He said the company may decide to
file suit for breach of the network's $12 million-a-year contract
with Nielsen, on grounds that the company is not conducting
accurate measurements. And he said it was not out of the question
that NBC might turn to Smart.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I put the $12 million we pay to them in with the $66
million we've lost, then paying $7 million for an alternate service
starts to sound cheap to me,'' Schiavone said.
</P>
<P>
   A lawsuit is certainly more likely to come from NBC than from
any other network. NBC, according to another senior executive, who
spoke on condition of anonymity, was very close to filing a
breach-of-contract suit against the ratings company in 1996. One
thing NBC promises will not happen, Schiavone said, is a decision
to shrug Nielsen off as a necessary evil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every Nielsen client is a hostage assumed by the Nielsen
management to be either stupid or forgetful,'' Schiavone said.
``Whether Nielsen is demonstrating active negligence or passive
negligence, their actions are unforgivable.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lillian Hellman was someone people seemed to love or
hate (sometimes simultaneously), and the latest book about her, ``A
Likely Story: One Summer With Lillian Hellman'' by Rosemary
Mahoney, is one that people seem to love or hate, but not
simultaneously. Ms. Mahoney, 37, whose ``Whoredom in Kimmage: The
World of Irish Women'' was nominated for the National Book Critics
Circle Award in 1993, spent two months before her senior year in
high school working for Hellman; and when she wasn't washing dishes
or answering the phone, she kept a journal about what became a
summer from hell at the hands of the great lady of American
letters.
</P>
<P>
   What does she think her former employer would make of the fuss
the book has caused? Ms. Mahoney smiles. ``She would either have
completely dismissed it, or she might have said, `I never met the
girl, never had her in my house.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The real point of ``A Likely Story,'' however, is not so much
the catalog of hurts inflicted by the elderly, ailing Hellman, but
the kind of teen-ager who would take a maid's job thoroughly
convinced that a literary icon of the 20th century was just waiting
to be her best friend.
</P>
<P>
   A rather typical one, it turns out. ``I wanted Lillian Hellman
to be perfect because I wasn't perfect myself,'' Ms. Mahoney says.
``I really wanted a mentor. I wasn't thinking about cleaning her
toilet. I thought she'd be my friend. That was silly. A recipe for
disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mahoney has come to New York, where she lived for five years
until recently, from her new home in Providence, which she finds
``peaceful and inexpensive.'' She is eating a curried chicken salad
at Hanratty's, a Carnegie Hill restaurant she frequented while
living in the city. Lean and angular, she is one of those people
who walk miles each day; and now that she lives on Narragansett
Bay, she also likes to row. She smiles, and her thin cheeks pleat.
``The locals can't see the point of getting in a rowboat and going
nowhere,'' she says. ``The rest of the time I'm at my desk alone,
writing, in my pajamas with dirty hair.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so, though on this day her hair is shiny and clean. Ms.
Mahoney is a serious-looking woman with pale skin, dressed all in
black. She carries a brown briefcase somewhat awkwardly, as if it
belongs to someone's father, and even when seated indoors, holds
herself as if braced against the wind. But she is open and
forthright, and when it comes to disclosing the role her own
troubled family history plays in her book, unflinching.
</P>
<P>
   As the youngest of Nona and John Mahoney's seven children, she
was raised in Milton, Mass. Her mother, a graduate of the Columbia
School of Journalism and a former women's editor of The Boston
Post, contracted polio after having her first two children and
never walked without crutches again. Her husband, a doctor,
suffered from depression, and following hospitalizations that
included shock therapy, committed suicide when Rosemary was 8.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother told her younger children their father died of a
heart attack, but as Ms. Mahoney writes, her attempts to protect
them only added to the confusion and shame she instinctively felt
about her father's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people called the house asking for him, I didn't say he
had died, I said he wasn't in,'' she recalls. ``I knew something
was wrong, but mental illness was not talked about in those days.''
After his death, her mother started to drink, though she also
earned a second master's degree and supported her family by working
as an English teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Rosemary Mahoney won a scholarship to St. Paul's in New
Hampshire, and the summer before her senior year, her only job
prospect was to return home and work as a waitress at the local
Howard Johnson's, where, ``my mother went to drink martinis,'' she
writes. ``I pictured myself on hot afternoons to come, wearing a
hairnet and a prim Howard Johnson's uniform, waiting on the table
next to my mother's, while she talked drunkenly at me across the
booth divider. . . . I imagined myself putting down a tray of hot
dogs and fried clams, untying my apron, picking up my mother's gray
metal crutches, cold now in the air-conditioned dining room, and
ending the spectacle by driving her safely home from my place of
work.''
</P>
<P>
   She sighs. ``People say it was so brave of me to write to
Lillian Hellman and ask for a job,'' she says. ``But it wasn't
brave. It was pure pride and desperation.''
</P>
<P>
   It was in a high school course called Women in History that Ms.
Mahoney read Hellman's writing and fell in love. ``Her life,'' she
writes, ``even in its smallest details, meant something; it was
guided by honesty and courage, while mine seemed fearful and
tainted and dishonest somehow.'' It is almost too predictable that
Ms. Mahoney's idol would reveal herself to be so completely
imperfect. It is jarring, however, at her book's beginning, to read
of the author's glee years after that summer when she comes upon
Hellman's obituary in the papers and exults in her death.
Certainly, by most accounts, her own included, the woman _ off the
page _ was cheap, petty, even mean. But isn't enough enough?
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mahoney nods gravely. ``I think I reacted that way because I
was ashamed of how that summer went,'' she says. ``For several
years after, I couldn't look at my journal. I felt I had failed.
She was a difficult person, but I blamed myself and I still felt
bad about it. Now I have a lot more sympathy for her. She was very
lonely, very unhappy. She could be so abrasive and controlling and
domineering, but she had this other side that was fearful and very
insecure. I had gone there hoping to find someone who was better
than I was. It's why we want idols. We don't want them to be human
beings. But we're all just people.''

 NEW YORK: just people.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Did it ever occur to her at the time that she could have tried
flattering Hellman to soften her up a bit?
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mahoney shakes her head. ``Once I got in the house I was
paralyzed,'' she says. ``She could be very frightening and I was
intimidated. It got to the point where I just decided not to tell
anything about myself, which was childish. I was very insecure in a
lot of ways, though I did have a bold side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a good student, sort of funny and athletic, I had
friends. But at school I would go back to my room at night totally
scared. I didn't want anyone to know my mother had a drinking
problem. She was everything to me, but I felt I had to hide her.
That was hard. But you can't figure it out when it's happening.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I deliberately tried to keep the book from the perspective of
a 17-year-old girl,'' she continues. ``As a teen-ager I was
constantly trying to please people, which I guess is true of all
adolescents. I tried to recreate that feeling of powerlessness,
wanting to get away from my family, be my own person in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though most of the response to the book has been good, there
are some people who think I'm too hard on poor Lillian Hellman.
They don't get what the story is really about, which is my
relationship with my mother. Lillian Hellman is the catalyst for
the story, the hook it's hung on. But it's about being a teen-ager
and trying to grow up.'' Part of being a teen-ager, of course, is
cruelty, especially about physical shortcomings and Ms. Mahoney
stints on none that she observed. Descriptions of Hellman include
her ``big beaky face of a sea turtle,'' and breasts like ``bladdery
bags.'' What she only hints at but does not explore is the range of
Hellman's own insecurities, which apparently led to inventing
herself as the heroine of other people's stories, then waltzing
away with the credit.
</P>
<P>
   But those real-world complications were more than a 17-year-old
seeker of truth and wisdom could be expected to grasp, so Ms.
Mahoney sticks to the everyday slights of a woman who became more
imperious, demanding and rude in direct proportion to her declining
health, diminishing eyesight and diminishing pride. The portrait
that emerges finally is how alone and pathetic she really was.
</P>
<P>
   Couldn't Ms. Mahoney have woven a bit of hindsight through the
harsher threads of the book, not only to give a more balanced
picture of the woman she worked for, but to save her 17-year-old
self from looking like the solipsistic brat most 17-year-olds are?
</P>
<P>
   She shakes her head impatiently. ``Yes, the book is dark in
places,'' she says. ``It's not all nice. But I'm not doing this to
be polite. This is reality. Life isn't all pretty, it has an ugly
side. I actually embrace that. Our flaws and failings make us
interesting, I think. And it wasn't just about her. I made it clear
what a big ego I had. I wasn't at all interested in working. I was
a bad housekeeper, hasty with everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``But your job as a writer is to have the emotional truth come
out. I know some people say I'm nasty and a brat, but this is much
more than a revenge book. My feeling in general is `Let's stop
pretending.' We're just desperate for idols, desperate.''
</P>
<P>
   So, once she discovered that her own idol was such a letdown,
why didn't she quit?
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother encouraged me not to,'' she says quietly. ``She told
me: `People don't like to be quitters. You made Lillian Hellman a
promise.' Also, I think she had a sense that the woman really did
need help.''
</P>
<P>
   She thinks a moment. ``Why did she hire me?'' she asks. ``There
was nothing to recommend me except that I had read her books.
People just didn't want to work for her. There had been a whole
series of young girls before me. But my mother said: `Stick it out.
It's a way to learn how to handle yourself in difficult
situations.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, Ms. Mahoney says, is 75 now and is mostly confined
to a wheelchair. She no longer drinks. And after years of searching
for the perfect woman to idolize and coming up empty with Lillian
Hellman, Ms. Mahoney has been able to recognize her own mother's
heroism. Despite the book's searing honesty about her alcoholism,
Nona Mahoney applauds it. When her daughter offered to remove
anything that might be hurtful, Mrs. Mahoney insisted it all stay
in.
</P>
<P>
   ``She thinks we have a right to talk about our experiences,''
Ms. Mahoney says. ``Her attitude is: `I know who I am. They don't
make me who I am. I do.' She always told me, if you want to avoid
controversy, say nothing, do nothing, be nothing. You have to stick
your neck out and just say it, whatever it is. Nothing gets learned
by hiding things.''

BANDS NERVOUSLY AWAIT RECORD INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By NEIL STRAUSS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Right now is not a good time to be in a rock band. The reason is
Seagram's $10.4 billion acquisition of Polygram from Philips, which
became official on Dec. 10. In the process of consolidating
Seagram's Universal Music Group with Polygram's music holdings
(which jointly account for some 25 percent of the U.S. and European
music markets), Seagram executives have pledged to unload enough
assets to save $300 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, buildings will be sold, some 3,000 employees
will be let go, and record labels will be gutted. As a result,
15,000 Polygram and Universal employees and hundreds of bands will
have an anxious Christmas, wondering whether they will still have a
job or a career in the New Year.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 200 bands estimated to be dropped from their labels, most
will be rock performers who thought that signing a record deal
meant they were on their way to stardom. Soon they will find
themselves right back where they started. The remaining hundred or
so rock, pop and rap acts, including such well-known musicians as
Sting, Sheryl Crow, U2, Hole, Beck, Elton John, Melissa Etheridge,
Bon Jovi, Ice Cube, Hanson, Axl Rose and Amy Grant, will find
themselves on a record label different from the one they originally
signed with. In most cases, the record-label personnel they had
grown comfortable working with _ the company heads, the radio
promotions people, the artists-and-repertory executives _ will be
gone.
</P>
<P>
   Though labels routinely shed dead-weight bands and undergo
structural changes after a new owner takes over, a reorganization
on the scale of this one is a first in the record business.
</P>
<P>
   Under Universal's restructuring plan, two labels founded as
artist-friendly havens but sold by their owners over the past
decade _ David Geffen's Geffen Records and Herb Alpert's and Jerry
Moss' A&AMP;M _ will be collapsed into Interscope, the 8-year-old label
that achieved notoriety through controversial gangsta-rap and
industrial-rock releases by acts like Tupac Shakur and Nine Inch
Nails. In addition, Universal executives will merge Island Records
(the 40-year-old label that got its start in Jamaica with reggae
records before going on to make its money with U2, Dru Hill and the
Cranberries) and Mercury Records (founded in Chicago in 1947 and
now home to John Mellencamp, Hanson, and Kiss) into one label.
</P>
<P>
   Making matters more confusing is that two of the most lucrative
rock and pop acts at these new companies, Sting (who is supposed to
be on Interscope) and U2 (which is supposed to be part of the new
Island Mercury), may not go with the program, causing some
consternation for executives. Spokespeople for both bands said they
were exploring their options at other labels, with U2 in
discussions with Interscope and Sting considering Island Mercury as
a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``We, like everyone, are concerned with how the whole thing
comes down,'' said Miles Copeland, who manages Sting. ``A lot of it
concerns how many releases Interscope has at the same time Sting
wants to put his record out. Fortunately, Jimmy said that if there
was another place that was better for us, he'd let us make that
decision.'' (Jimmy is Jimmy Iovine, chairman at Interscope
Records).
</P>
<P>
   Copeland added that he would wait until Interscope makes final
its staff and roster next month or in February before making a
decision about where to place Sting's album, which he expects to be
ready for a June release. But a Universal executive speaking on
condition of anonymity said that the label was not just going to
let Sting go and open the floodgates for other acts to leave.
</P>
<P>
   The reorganization is an inconvenience, too, for acts like the
Cranberries and Melissa Etheridge, who have been forced to delay
the release of new albums. For less popular acts, the situation is
even grimmer. New groups that were signed to big deals at their old
labels may find themselves forced to renegotiate their contracts in
order to stay on Interscope or Island Mercury. And two-thirds of
the rosters at each label will be dropped outright. For some bands
this sudden independence will be a blessing; for others it will be
a blow that could lead to their breakup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an odd situation,'' said Elliot Roberts, Neil Young's
manager since 1968. ``It's the first time in all my years that this
has ever happened on this scale. If I had a band that was a
borderline band, I'd be losing sleep right now.''
</P>
<P>
   For bands on the borderline _ with moderate sales but the
potential to be more popular _ the waiting period can be difficult.
Geffen's acts, like the bass-heavy rock group Girls Against Boys
and the former 'Til Tuesday singer Aimee Mann, are recording new
records using advance money from Geffen. If they are dropped from
the label, Interscope would still not only own the music they have
already released on Geffen but also the new music they are working
on. (A Universal executive, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said that in most cases the band would have the option of buying
its new music back.)
</P>
<P>
   Michael Hausman, Ms. Mann's manager, said: ``I think this
situation is really going to affect her career. We would have
delivered her record now, and it would have come out in March or
April. Now, I'm not really sure what's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   An even more potent source of anxiety is that in some cases
Interscope and Island Mercury will prolong their decision on
whether or not to keep an act until after it turns in its next
record. ``I think that we're a band that, if they broke down the
numbers and looked strictly at the sales figures as we expect them
to do, they'll decide to shed us,'' said Johnny Temple, the bassist
in Girls Against Boys, a band that turned down Interscope to sign
with Geffen two years ago. ``On the other hand, people in the
company could decide that we have a certain underground following
and artistic integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We stepped into the whole process with a very optimistic yet
cynical perspective,'' Temple continued, ``and we understood the
corporate nature of the beast that we were doing business with.
What we don't want to happen is just to end up in some limbo land.
We want them to keep us or drop us. We don't want them to say,
`Let's hear some demos.'''

   Robbie Fulks, a singer-songwriter who chose to sign with Geffen
last year despite interest from four other labels, used to talk to
executives at Geffen every day. Now, he said, it's gone silent,
with ``secretaries over there giving me the impression that it's
like Dresden after the war.''
</P>
<P>
   With the loss of financial, administrative and tactical support
from his label, Fulks has been promoting the record that Geffen
released in September on his own. ``I'm not doing as many shows as
I'd like to now, just what I can afford,'' he said. ``There are
some places where I can make money, other places where if I play
without a band I can make some money. It's not nearly as much as
I'd like to be performing, but I'm not going to just wait around
and see.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Christopher Sabec, who manages Hanson, also works with a new
band on Mercury called Swirl, a pop band led by two brothers that
many thought had hit written all over it. Perhaps the prophesy
would have come true already, Sabec said, if not for the sale of
Polygram.
</P>
<P>
   ``This merger threw a tremendous wrench in the whole thing,'' he
said. Both Hanson and Swirl, officials at Universal said, would
make it into the new Island Mercury group.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Young's manager, Roberts, also works with a rock band on
Geffen, the Eels, who seem likely to get accepted into the
Interscope fold. But in the meantime, the ambitious record they
released in September, ``Electro-Shock Blues,'' is suffering.
``Half the people there don't know whether they will have jobs come
Jan. 15,'' Roberts said, referring to the date when many believe a
mass Universal firing will take place. In actuality, it is the date
that the heads of Interscope and Island Mercury will meet with
Edgar Bronfman Jr., the president of Seagram, to present plans for
their expanded labels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think they'll be worried about promoting a single, or
how they're going to take care of their house payments?'' Roberts
continued. ``We were ready to go with a second single, but we don't
have one because most of the people who have to pick it don't know
if they'll still be working and can't focus.''
</P>
<P>
   The punk band MXPX put its career on hold to wait out the
transition. It chose to have its label, A&AMP;M, stop promoting its
single, ``The Downfall of Western Civilization,'' because it felt
the employees were not motivated, said the band's manager,
Creighton Burke.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the anxiety the changes are causing, there is a reason
these labels are getting trimmed. A&AMP;M and Geffen have both suffered
from budget crunches and unproductive band signings over the past
few years _ neither of them have any records now in the Billboard
top 40. Many of the acts being transferred say they may be going to
a better place, one willing to spend more money and time to help
them grow.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan Schur, owner and president of Flip Records, had been
unhappy from the beginning with the way things were working out for
two of the new bands he made deals with through A&AMP;M: Big Hate and
Cold. When the label was shut down, things only got worse, he said.
He describes Cold's career as ``a car shut off in midgear.'' But,
like others who work with rock bands in waiting, he knows that if
Interscope chooses either of his bands, there's no better place
they could be. ``What Interscope is good at is taking bands that
other people wouldn't work with and breaking them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As he consolidation proceeds, rival companies and independent
labels seem likely to benefit from the fallout. Some have already
gotten in touch with the managers of bands who seem likely to be
dropped. Acts like Fulks said that if they did not make the cut,
they probably would not subject themselves to the major label
process again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wouldn't chase anyone while they're still signed,'' said
Jeff Rougvie, the head of artists and repertory at Rykodisc, a
leading independent, who has received inquiries from worried
managers of Polygram and Universal acts. ``But a lot of those bands
are really talented ones with loyal audiences, so it would be crazy
for an indie like us not to look into them if they're dropped. It
could really enhance our artist roster.''
</P>
<P>
   The Polygram labels that specialize in country and urban music
will not be going through major changes. Mercury Nashville, home to
Shania Twain, will undergo little change. Motown will be made
stronger, with Universal acts like Erykah Badu being let into the
fold. And Def Jam, in which Polygram owned a 60 percent stake, will
stay more or less untouched. It is one of the only Polygram-related
labels releasing a major record in the interim period, a rap
release by DMX to go on sale tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Def Jam had one of its most successful years in 1997, by its own
account taking in $190 million, and though Universal has offered to
buy the remaining 40 percent of the label, at present the owners do
not intend to sell it.
</P>
<P>
   The hands-off attitude toward these labels, some in the industry
say, is not just a sign of the prominence of urban and country
music on the charts but also of the inadequate understanding the
corporate structure has of markets other than rock. In fact,
executives at Universal expressed disappointment at the small
number of rap and rhythm-and-blues acts at Geffen, A&AMP;M, Mercury and
Island, which is one reason why it is the rock bands on these
labels that will be the hardest hit. An executive at Universal said
Island Mercury would try to set up its own urban music subdivision
next year.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Universal said that they were relying on a lot
more than album sales figures to make their decisions, despite
claims by bands and managers to the contrary. They said they would
listen to a group's records multiple times, check out current
studio recordings, talk to band managers and artist-and-repertory
executives, meet with group members and even try to see a show when
possible to make sure no potential hit slips through their hands.
</P>
<P>
   Bands whose singers recently went through a distressful period
that could affect their work positively, they said, would be more
likely to make the grade than singers who have lost interest in
what they are doing.
</P>
<P>
   At present, however, the executives said their first priority
was a more stressful job: cutting staff, as many as three-quarters
of the employees of some labels, including well-known and respected
record company chairmen like Danny Goldberg at Mercury, Al Cafaro
at A&AMP;M and Ed Rosenblatt at A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   Though executives at Interscope and Island Mercury have been
meeting with the top acts coming into their labels, they have only
just started scrutinizing the less established bands. Their final
decision will be made over the next two months, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to take our time,'' said one Universal executive.
``At the end of the day, we'll be fair to both the acts we let go
and the ones we keep. For the ones we keep, we'll be able to focus
on them. And for the ones we let go, they've probably already been
dragged over the coals by a record label that can't do the best job
for them.''

ASSESS: ATTACKS LEAVE U.S. POLICY ON IRAQ IN SHAMBLES 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also IRAQ-RDP, IRAQ-MILITARY, IRAQ-SANCTIONS, IRAQ-BRITAIN.)

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While American officials went on television Sunday
to assert the military achievements of four nights of air attacks
against Iraq, there is considerably less clarity about American
strategy now.
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that President Saddam Hussein's military
capacity has been ``degraded,'' to use the Clinton administration's
word of choice, but it is not clear how degraded, or for how long.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam retains the capacity and the scientists to produce
biological and chemical weapons, which do not need to be delivered
by sophisticated missiles and cannot be eliminated by air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   And it is abundantly clear that Saddam has emerged from the
rubble like a jack-in-the-box, alive and shouting defiance, his
position strengthened in Arab public opinion simply by his survival
against the high-tech onslaught of the United States, Israel's
prime ally.
</P>
<P>
   If Saddam's government and his grip on power have been
``shaken'' by these air strikes, as senior American officials
privately hoped, there was no immediate indication that he is about
to fall, and the diplomatic consensus on Iraq in the United Nations
Security Council has again been shattered.
</P>
<P>
   President Jacques Chirac of France called Sunday for a
``fundamental review'' of the entire U.N. policy toward Iraq,
including the replacement of the weapons inspection regime. Even
Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, the only ally to join the
bombing campaign against Iraq, said, ``We need a future strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   The gap between policy goals (getting rid of Saddam and
eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction) and policy tools
(with weapons inspection probably finished, air power imperfect and
the Security Council split) seems wider than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Confusion about what to do next was evident in new calls by
Blair, President Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
for Saddam to let U.N. weapons inspectors back into Iraq, under
undefined but somehow more enforceable rules.
</P>
<P>
   Given that neither the Unites States nor Britain believes Saddam
ever intends to cooperate fully with weapons inspections, those
calls seemed a bit disingenuous. But officials of both countries
know that working within the United Nations, and specific Security
Council resolutions passed during and after the Persian Gulf war in
1991, is the only way to justify military action against Iraq. They
both say future air strikes are possible early next year.
</P>
<P>
   They also insist that sanctions remain in place. That means they
must also support, at least rhetorically, the weapons inspections
that are Iraq's only way of getting the sanctions lifted.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has recently begun describing its Iraq policy
as what Albright terms ``containment plus regime change.'' Last
week, she defined that policy as having short, medium and long-term
goals.
</P>
<P>
   Military strikes now _ after nearly one year of threatening them
because of the U.N. inspectors' inability to do their job _ are not
a sign of the failure of American policy, she insists, but a
``short-term goal.'' The assaults can be repeated or applied as
necessary to try to defang Saddam and buy more time.
</P>
<P>
   Such strikes, combined with sanctions and warnings to Saddam not
to use any terror weapons, constitute ``containment.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are considerable doubts, even among America's closest
allies in NATO countries, that the administration is willing to
withstand the diplomatic damage of regular unilateral air strikes
against Iraq. Even last week's long-delayed attacks were held to
only four days out of concern for Arab, Russian and Chinese
reaction.
</P>
<P>
   In the medium term, Albright said, the goal is to get Iraq to
comply with U.N. resolutions, including a functioning regime of
weapons inspection. Privately, American officials not only do not
believe that Saddam's Iraq will ever comply, but they also do not
really want him to try.
</P>
<P>
   Because if he does, the rest of the world _ and certainly
Russia, China and France on the Security Council _ will rush to
give him the benefit of the doubt. And that would make Albright's
longer-term goal _ the overthrow of Saddam _ even less plausibly
attainable than it now seems.
</P>
<P>
   For there is severe doubt, both within the American government
and outside it, that Clinton is prepared to pay the price to rid
the world of Saddam. Most officials regard the new emphasis on
``regime change'' as a way to answer those critics who felt that
American policy had no long-term goal at all. And they note that it
was Congress that pushed the $97-million Iraq Liberation Act onto
the White House, which could not veto it.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, those officials say, the administration and the CIA had
largely given up on new efforts to overthrow Saddam, given
embarrassing failures in the past. While Cabinet bosses assert
publicly that there is a new seriousness to the effort to bring him
down, senior officials joke that the money will provide the Iraqi
opposition, whose leaders live in London, with used American
armored personnel carriers in which to ride through Mayfair.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic problem is that we don't have a larger strategic
policy for Iraq,'' said Zbigniew Brzezinski, the former national
security adviser to President Carter and an Albright mentor. ``Our
policy is either strike them or starve them, and neither
accomplishes our objectives.''

BLAIR OFFERS VIGOROUS DEFENSE OF CAMPAIGN AGAINST IRAQ 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By WARREN HOGE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ In a tough-talking assessment of the air attacks on
Iraq, Prime Minister Tony Blair Sunday urged doubters and critics
to understand the new ``global reality'' that modern diplomacy must
be backed up by force.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recognize that not everyone around the world has welcomed
this action,'' he said in an apparent reference to the angry
reactions of China and Russia and the unsettled response from
European allies like France and Italy. ``But I believe at heart
that most know its necessity.''
</P>
<P>
   Saying he was determined to build a broad consensus on dealing
with Iraq, Blair added that even countries that had withheld
approval and support for the campaign ``fully accept that Saddam
has to be watched, has to be contained and that the whole of the
world community has to be engaged in that process.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair, leader of the only country to join the United States in
the four days of air strikes, used a televised address Sunday not
just to list the mission's accomplishments but to put forth an
earnest justification of the raids and the need to be prepared to
stage more in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Britain, he announced, is sending the aircraft carrier
Invincible to the Persian Gulf to reinforce its Tornado jets based
in Kuwait. The ship will arrive in late January at the end of the
Muslim holy month of Ramadan. ``The sending of the aircraft carrier
is a very big signal that we are not going away,'' said George
Robertson, the British defense minister, who appeared at the
briefing with Blair, Foreign Secretary Robin Cook and Gen. Sir
Charles Guthrie, chief of the British defense staff.
</P>
<P>
   Blair said he saw no need for any new U.N. authorization to
strike Iraq in the future, and he turned aside talk of easing
sanctions, saying that the program should instead be ``as rigorous
as we can make it.'' He pledged to intercept more traffic in the
gulf, arguing that it was being used by Saddam Hussein to
circumvent sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Blair said the objective now was to contain Saddam, and he used
a metaphor that he has employed all week, saying the Iraqi leader
must be kept ``in his cage.''
</P>
<P>
   He rejected the argument that this policy was a poor substitute
for eliminating Saddam entirely. ``I do not accept it for an
instant,'' he said. ``Just because we can't get in the cage and
strike him down, it doesn't mean we should leave the cage untouched
and the bars too fragile to hold him. What we have done is put him
back firmly in the cage and secure it.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the achievements of the bombing campaign, the two that Blair
and the officials cited most frequently were the destruction of
hangars that they said house pilotless drone planes designed to
spray deadly anthrax, and the bombings of barracks and a brigade
headquarters of the Republican Guard that protects Saddam. Sir
Charles showed film of both strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Blair acknowledged that it was unlikely that U.N. weapons
inspectors would be permitted back into the country. Unless Iraq
showed a ``completely different order of readiness'' to cooperate,
he said, the focus would now be on the proven threat of force and
heightened aerial surveillance to compensate for the absence of the
U.N. monitors. ``We will know what is happening, and whether Saddam
is yet again getting into a position to threaten others,'' Blair
said. ``If he is, he knows what to expect.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Britain would ``continue to engage with the Iraqi
opposition to help them develop their vision of a better Iraq.''
Many of the groups are based in London.
</P>
<P>
   Aware of the upset caused in Britain's growing Muslim
population, Blair said the operation was structured from the
beginning to end in four days so as not to intrude on the festival
of Ramadan. The government's chief civil rights official, Home
Office Minister Mike O'Brien, is meeting Monday with British Muslim
leaders to discuss their worries about the air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Blair lashed out at the theory that the timing of the strikes
had been predicated on President Clinton's desire to forestall
impeachment. Calling such suggestions ``grotesque and offensive,''
he said, ``I would never commit British servicemen and women unless
I thought it was necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   At home and in Europe, Blair has had to defend himself against
assertions that he is too obedient to Washington, and he and Cook
have been in frequent contact with continental leaders explaining
Britain's position.
</P>
<P>
   Leader of a party that once espoused pacifism and regularly
denounced U.S. big-power actions abroad, Blair found himself last
week in the unaccustomed role of leading war-room sessions with
uniformed officers and conducting a joint military operation with
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the domestic criticism has come from members of his own
party. The Labor-friendly Independent on Sunday said that it was
``dispiriting that Tony Blair should prove such an uncritical and
servile supporter of the president,'' while the conservative Sunday
Telegraph found the airstrikes ``logical and entirely justified.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington has welcomed the prime minister's eagerness to
articulate the mission's objectives, allowing him to speak to the
world first on Wednesday in a televised announcement of the mission
from in front of 10 Downing St. before Clinton gave his address
from the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   Blair said Britain planned an ``intensive diplomatic process''
with other U.N. Security Council members, Arab nations and other
European countries ``to forge a new strategy for stability in
relations between the international community and Iraq.'' On
Monday, Cook is to meet in London with Joschka Fischer, the new
German foreign minister, to discuss how Europe can get aid to the
needy in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Cook opened a new front in the war for obtaining
public backing for the campaign with a televised briefing devoted
to outlining the dimensions of the ``extraordinary evil'' that
Saddam represents. He cited Amnesty International reports detailing
what he called a systematic program of torture, executions and mass
murder that the Iraqi president uses to enforce his power.
</P>
<P>
   ``He runs a terror state,'' Cook said. ``As and when Saddam
goes, and when evidence of that terror state becomes more widely
known and publicized by those who replace him, the world will ask
why was it that we were in any doubt about the nature of the regime
and why there was any hesitation about standing up to him.''

<P>
   ALLAHABAD, India _ In its celebrated, brainy heyday, Allahabad
University was known as the Oxford of India. Among its graduates
are three former prime ministers, one former president and the
current minister of education _ an illustrious alumni roster that
now seems ironic for a college majoring in stagnation with a strong
minor in chaos.
</P>
<P>
   A campus built for 5,000 students now has 60,000. The academic
calendar has lost its logic, with so many postponed sessions that
years can go by without required courses being offered. The law
school is currently selecting its first new class since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Buildings are decrepit. The library not only lacks up-to-date
journals, but there is no librarian. Laboratories are of little aid
to science. ``I did an experiment with hydrochloric acid, and when
it didn't work, my teacher told me that's because the chemicals are
watered down to make them last longer,'' said a chemistry student,
Manish Kumar Verma.
</P>
<P>
   Allahabad's decline, while an extreme case, is sadly symptomatic
of a university system overstuffed with students and undernourished
with resources. Higher education was once the pride of a newly
independent nation that declared learning to be its route to
greatness. But while the words were inspiring, they have gone
unfortified by willpower and money.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the university system's problems were usually
relegated to the dry reports of obscure committees, but now one
horrific incident has drawn India's attention. Last month, a young
man at Rajasthan University fatally immolated himself during a
student protest. He was overwrought because the results of crucial
exams were three months late, creating a state of limbo that kept
students from continuing in school or applying for jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Long delays in grading such exams have become commonplace, and
this has much to do with the long delays in paying the people who
do the grading. ``Where there are areas of crisis, the crisis is
usually in the finances,'' said Armaity S. Desai, chairwoman of the
University Grants Commission, which disburses federal funds for
higher education.
</P>
<P>
   India has about 1,000 universities and colleges, double the
number of 20 years ago. Some remain first-rate, but a large portion
of the rest _ especially in the poorest of the nation's 27 states _
are the overwhelmed creations of haphazard growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``State colleges are often built by local bigwigs who use them
as a source of political patronage,'' said Kuldeep Mathur, the
former director of the National Institute of Educational Planning
and Administration. ``The buildings are built and staff are hired,
but there is no thought as to how the infrastructure will be kept
up and the salaries paid.''
</P>
<P>
   India has nearly 1 billion people _ largely-impoverished masses
who increasingly view a college diploma as the admission ticket to
the middle class. While only 3 percent of Indians ages 17 to 23
attend college, that still amounts to 7 million students.
</P>
<P>
   High school graduates have little to hold them back. Entrance
requirements are not rigorous. Subsidized tuition amounts to about
$10 a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``With colleges open to anyone who wants to attend, merit
becomes the casualty,'' said V.R. Mehta, the vice chancellor of
highly regarded Delhi University. ``Universities have become picnic
places with students whiling away their time.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite government subsidies for tuition _ and habitual promises
to spend more _ India allocates only 3.7 percent of its gross
domestic product on education. This exceeds most other nations in
South Asia, but lags far behind much of the developing world, a
fact many scholars attribute to the persisting anti-egalitarian
impulses of a caste-based society.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, caste is mentioned often enough among senior members
of the Allahabad faculty as they bemoan the decay of their beloved
citadel, although theirs is a different perspective. India's
version of affirmative action reserves about 50 percent of
admissions for traditionally disadvantaged castes. Most of these
students come from small villages with poor schools. Their fluency
is in Hindi, though the texts they are required to read are in
English.
</P>
<P>
   With such students present in great numbers, the bottom brings
the top down, many professors contend.
</P>
<P>
   ``A university should exist for the pursuit of academic
excellence, but this is now an idea that plays second fiddle to
caste-ism,'' said Professor S.P. Singh, dean of the commerce
faculty. ``Merit should rule the roost, not what caste you are born
into.''
</P>
<P>
   Allahabad is in Uttar Pradesh, a state where lower caste
politicians have come to wield great power. They are often blamed
for the university's unchecked growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite my faith in democracy, I have to ask: by giving poor
students a bad education, do you improve their lot or merely make
contagious their disadvantage?'' asked S.C. Bhattacharya, a
recently retired professor of ancient history.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, an education is something hard to come by at Allahabad.
Students very often skip class, which gives them something in
common with their instructors. Ignobly, some professors then charge
fees to ``coach'' their students privately, explaining what their
lectures would have said had they actually come to campus to
deliver them.
</P>
<P>
   But is the blame for this chaos to be placed on the multitude of
unprepared students _ or on the lagging priority that India places
on education?
</P>
<P>
   Miss Desai, of the grants commission, believes that all the
complaining about merit is a luxury for the elite. ``In a country
like this, how can you make an issue out of merit?'' she said.
``When you say quality is going down, well, yes it is, but that is
because we are mass-ifying education. In a country where the great
majority of students are first-generation learners, they need to be
nurtured. And nurturing will cost money.''
</P>
<P>
   At dawn in Allahabad, as a winter chill chews at the bone,
students line up to get kerosene. Some will wait as long as two
hours. The fuel is needed to heat the hovels where they live _ and
where they struggle over their books after the day gives in to
darkness.

   Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, who was arrested in Munich in September,
was handed over to U.S. officials at the Munich airport and left on
a special flight, judicial officials said. They declined to reveal
his precise destination.
</P>
<P>
   Washington believes Salim, 40, is a top aide to Osama bin Laden,
who has been accused by prosecutors in the United States of being
the leader of the group that bombed the embassies, killing more
than 200 people.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Salim has been described in government documents
as a manager of finances for bin Laden, and an important
intermediary in the group's efforts to buy arms and material for
nuclear weapons. He is accused of conspiring to murder Americans
abroad and use weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Salim denied the charges, but his attempts to fight extradition
ended this month when Germany's highest court dismissed his appeal.
Judicial cooperation between Germany and the United States is
generally good.
</P>
<P>
   German officials said the United States had been obliged to
guarantee that Salim would not face the death penalty. German law
prohibits extradition of suspects to countries where they could
face execution.
</P>
<P>
   That U.S. commitment could complicate the task of federal
prosecutors, who have already said ``the death penalty will
seriously be considered'' in the case of two other defendants who
are widely considered to have played a far less important role than
Salim in bin Laden's organization.
</P>
<P>
   The two men are Mohammed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali and Mohammed
Saddiq Odeh, who have been charged with separate counts of murder
in the more than 250 deaths at the embassies. They have pleaded not
guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, the United States indicted 14 people in its
investigation of the embassy bombings and bin Laden's organization.
Salim's extradition will bring to five the number of those men in
custody in the United States. One other is facing extradition from
Britain, and the rest are at large.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has described the two attacks, on Aug. 7, as
being closely coordinated by members of bin Laden's group, who are
said to have prepared the bombings throughout this year in Kenya
and Tanzania. It appears possible that Salim could provide
important details of the plot.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, said this month
that the U.S., Tanzanian and Kenyan authorities would show
``unrelenting resolve'' in apprehending and prosecuting ``every
single person who participated in the murderous terrorist bombings
in East Africa.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ David C. Leavy graduated from Colby College in
Maine six years ago and leapt into presidential politics: field
director in the Maine caucuses for the campaign of Gov. Bill
Clinton of Arkansas. Within the year, Leavy had a desk up the hall
from the Oval Office, making him a charter member of the cocky and
optimistic class of young men and women who lifted Clinton to
victory in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Leavy, 28, is one of the few remaining people of the
class of '92 in the Clinton White House. And as the generation that
charged into Washington with Clinton in 1993 took somber measure of
what has become of the promise of this presidency this weekend,
Leavy was anguished and disappointed _ but not with the second
president in the nation's history to have been impeached.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't owe me anything,'' said Leavy, spokesman for the
National Security Council. ``Quite the contrary. I owe him
everything. Everything I have professionally is because of him.
I've worked for him from the day I graduated college, and I will
probably _ God willing _ for the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will always wear a Clinton jersey. Through this crisis and
for the rest of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Leavy's testimonial was, perhaps, extreme in its sentimentality,
but it was not unusual among the people who work, or once worked,
for Clinton. It appears that House Republicans may have done for
the president what Clinton could not do for himself: won him an
absolution from many _ though certainly not all _ of the Clinton
associates who had felt most violated by his transgressions.
</P>
<P>
   The anger that many of them once felt for Clinton has been
largely drawn away by the Republicans. It almost seems that some
members of the class of '92, including many he has not even spoken
to in months, are ready to rally to his support once again.
</P>
<P>
   ``This looks and smells and is a politically inspired
impeachment,'' said David C. Wilhelm, who orchestrated some of
Clinton's early political victories and went on to become chairman
of the Democratic National Committee. ``I'm angry about it. I think
it is completely unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilhelm, recalling his disappointment with Clinton earlier this
year, described the president as ``a good man; not a perfect man,
but a good man.'' Wilhelm added, ``His behavior pales to the
actions the Republicans have caused.''
</P>
<P>
   Dee Dee Myers, the former White House press secretary who has
been sharply critical of Clinton as a television commentator, said
that ``damage being done to the Constitution by an overzealous
political party willing to hijack it for political purposes is much
more serious than anything Clinton has done.''
</P>
<P>
   Levy, Wilhelm and Ms. Myers were part of a group of people who
changed the political face of this city in 1993. They were, for the
most part, people who had not before worked in national politics.
They were Democrats, and they were relatively young.
</P>
<P>
   They were also often idealistic, invigorated by a campaign run
by Clinton that was bold in its promises and rhetoric. What that
meant was that Clinton came into office with extremely high
expectations. And the prospect now that his term might be defined
by an impeachment is distressing to people who had seen so much
potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had this moment,'' Wilhelm said. ``It was a moment ripe
with possibility, And I guess that's the frustrating thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Myers said: ``You can't help but have a sense of tremendous
wasted opportunity. And in Clinton's case, wasted potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, amid this criticism, Clinton's allies are stepping up for
one more battle, this time to counter the suggestion that the
president's failings have ruined his hope of achieving the
accomplishments he once promised.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will tell you that I think Bill Clinton did a great job as
president,'' said Rahm I. Emanuel, who was Clinton's chief
fund-raiser in 1992, and worked as a senior adviser until this past
fall. ``I am proud to have worked for him as a president. I am
proud to be associated with him.''
</P>
<P>
   In the White House, Paul Begala, a Clinton adviser who has made
a career out of dealing with Clinton's difficulties, went so far as
to argue that the president's legacy was not only intact, but
growing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be careful, be careful,'' Begala said. ``Go ahead and write
his political obit because I'm going to clip it and save it and
file it in my two-inch thick file of all the others.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. But though the loyalty, and even some of the affection,
for Clinton may be returning in some quarters, it is hard to find
many people who have the hope and enthusiasm that was once so
prevalent in the corridors of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never have dreamed two things,'' George
Stephanopoulos, who is probably the most estranged of the former
Clinton advisers, said Sunday afternoon. ``I would never have
dreamed that the country would have been so improved eight years
into his stewardship. And I never dreamed of the day that I would
wake up and see this morning's headline. Neither one can be
erased.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Wilhelm and his wife, Degee, who also worked on Clinton's 1992
campaign, expressed their feelings though an unlikely vehicle this
season: their annual Christmas card message.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a singularly depressing event, particularly for those of
us who worked so hard to elect Bill Clinton back in 1992, to see
the hope and promise that his election seemed to represent in those
heady days dissolve into a morass of partisanship and wrangling,''
the Wilhelms wrote. ``Sorry to be so downbeat in a Christmas note.
But I thought maybe you'd like one of these that didn't pretend
everything was hunky-dory.''

 WASHINGTON: them more.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was this development, said Kaiser Permanente, the biggest
nonprofit health maintenance organization, that forced it to take
age into account when calculating subscribers' premiums this year
and then order large increases in individuals' policies.
</P>
<P>
   In part because it stuck with community rating longer than most
organizations, Kaiser said, it lost $270 million last year and $150
million in the first half of this year. ``We're saying that
community rating is not possible,'' said Beverly Hayon, a Kaiser
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Now the demise of community rating is fueling an insidious
spiral that drives premiums still higher and throws more consumers
off the rolls. ``It's called, `Sick people in, healthy people
out,''' said Dean Rosen, senior vice president and counsel for the
Health Insurance Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   The sicker the individual subscribers are, the greater their
incentive to keep buying insurance. Healthier subscribers balk at
high premiums and drop out. Then the insurers, left with fewer and
sicker subscribers, must spend more per client for care. To avoid
losses, they raise premiums again, giving the spiral another spin
and chasing away the healthier of the sick.
</P>
<P>
   State legislatures, more than the federal government, are
grappling with these conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Few have tried harder, and with unhappier results, than
Kentucky. To see that all individuals had access to affordable
coverage four years ago, the state prohibited insurers from taking
an applicant's health into account in calculating premiums.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, more than 40 insurers bailed out of the state's
direct-pay insurance market. ``Now I have two,'' said state
Insurance Commissioner George Nichols. This year, the Legislature
reversed course and, within limits, permitted the companies to use
health conditions in setting premiums.
</P>
<P>
   That is what led to Ms. Couture's notice from Anthem. ``Some
people are seeing 100 and 200 percent'' increases, Nichols said.
Lawrence Ford, Anthem's spokesman, said the company had little
choice if it wanted to avoid more losses.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-six states, including Connecticut, California, Florida,
Illinois, Minnesota and Washington, have found another device to
accommodate people whom insurers reject because of their health or
scare off with high premiums: high-risk insurance pools. The pools
are no bargain.
</P>
<P>
   They charge premiums that range from 25 percent to 100 percent
above those that other people pay for comparable commercial
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   But because the pools' subscribers tend to be old and sick, the
cost of their care usually exceeds the higher premium, so the
states make up the difference with assessments on insurance
companies or with tax revenues.

BILLBOARDS CARRY HIGH-TECH MESSAGES 
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - SIGNS   By Dan Fost 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The giant trout leaps off the billboard on Highway  &LR; Interstate
880 in San Jose. But the company behind the billboard isn't selling
trout.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to tell what American Microsystems Inc. is selling,
unless you work in a semiconductor plant. The billboard exhorts:
``Catch a Cutthroat Gate Array. Convert Your FPGA to a
PCI-Compliant 66 MHz ASIC.''
</P>
<P>
   Huh?
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Incomprehension Highway. The AMI billboard is just
before the interchange with Highway 101, Silicon Valley's billboard
boulevard, where signs that wouldn't fly anywhere else thrive in a
climate that loves its geek-speak.
</P>
<P>
   If you're driving through the epicenter of the technology world,
you need an engineering degree to decipher some of the billboards.
``No Vectors, No Worries!'' reads one. Or this: ``17.7 million
transistors. 0.25 micron. Verified in 19 hours. Only with
Calibre.''
</P>
<P>
   Some ad experts say the billboards reflect the tech industry's
love affair with itself. ``We live in a special place. We are
really techno-centric here,'' said Fred Schwartz, creative director
and partner of Left Field, a San Francisco ad agency that serves
Web-based clients like Infoseek and Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you live and work in the industry, you can get really
absorbed in it,'' Schwartz said. ``You can think everyone has your
knowledge set. It's easy to get deluded.''
</P>
<P>
   The techno-billboards run all the way into San Francisco. Unlike
the signs along the Peninsula, however, those in and around the
city are easier for the average computer-using commuter to
comprehend. They tend to tout things like search engines, Sony
PlayStations, hot Web sites and cool computer games. A giant
inflatable iMac on the roof of the MacAdam computer store on Folsom
Street speaks for itself.
</P>
<P>
   American Microsystems Inc.,  &LR; AMI, the company with the trout
billboard, isn't aiming for the average person. ``It's a product
targeted toward a very focused market,'' said Vince Hopkin, a
director at the Pocatello, Idaho, company. The product _ AMI's &LR; 
 &LR; the Cutthroat gate array _ is a computer chip the company can
custom-make for specific users, such as cell phone manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Thanks to the billboard, AMI drew 250 surfers over three
months to a Web site about its chip, said AMI's  &LR; spokeswoman Tamera
Drake, and the company is pleased with that.
</P>
<P>
   Drake said the the billboard is strictly for the Bay Area's
``in'' crowd: It wouldn't play in Pocatello.
</P>
<P>
   All along Highway 101, billboards reflect the wired
sensibilities of the region. They promote products to sort through
companies' e-mail, to manage their  &LR; networks and to deliver
high-speed Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   ``ET did not `phone' home,'' exclaims a billboard for Wavepath,
the Mountain View subsidiary of Montreal's  &LR; Groupe Videotron ltee
of Montreal, Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; That may be so, but it's not especially likely that Steven
Spielberg's adorable extraterrestrial used Wavepath's high-speed
wireless data network _ ``ET'' was a hit in 1982, and Wavepath was
established this year.
</P>
<P>
   Geek-speak billboards cluster, not surprisingly, around
high-tech companies' corporate headquarters _ and their
competitors. The database software company Informix maintains a
billboard near its archrival Oracle's headquarters in Redwood
Shores, although the message is a little more muted than in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   Once, Informix's billboard almost obnoxiously taunted, ``You
have just passed Redwood Shores. So did we. Informix.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the billboard merely alludes to Informix's comeback after
one of the toughest years in technology: ``Damn the torpedoes, full
speed ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the more obtuse billboards irritate Schwartz, the San
Francisco ad-man.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way they can be there for advertising purposes,''
said Schwartz, talking from his car phone while he drove up Highway
101, taking in the signs. ``They're for PR, for recruiting, and for
the egos of the higher-ups of the companies. ... We've been in big
boardrooms where the chairman insists on a billboard on 101. It's
purely vanity.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz said the companies posting what he labels ``gibberish''
are victims of the cloistered world in which they operate.
</P>
<P>
   He said it's inefficient to post a narrowly targeted ad on a
road like Highway 101, which at some intersections averages more
than 200,000 vehicles per day, according to Caltrans.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of Eller Media Co., the biggest billboard
company in the country, contend that the big signs work well even
when their messages seem murky.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Coca-Cola or Marlboro, which sell relatively inexpensive
products to the masses and have simple, easy-to-understand
billboards, companies selling computer products can afford to
target fewer customers, because each customer may represent
thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   A billboard can cost from several hundred dollars a month to
tens of thousands of dollars, depending on how elaborate it is and
how wide-reaching the media buy is, said George Broder, Eller's
Oakland-based vice president of public affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix-based Eller made an estimated $66 million from high-tech
billboards last year. That figure was double the previous year's
and should double again next year, said Stephen Freitas, Eller vice
president of marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outdoor is the best place to advertise an Internet address,''
Freitas said. ``Web site addresses have high levels of recall.
People are seeing the boards, remembering, and going to the Web
sites.''
</P>
<P>
   Which would explain billboards that say simply,
`` &LR; www.donatefood.org &LR; ,'' or, ``Where cows and cyberspace collide:
 &LR; www.gotmilk.com &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   Heading north past San Francisco International Airport, tech
signs continue to dominate, although they're somewhat more easily
understood.
</P>
<P>
   Apple has one of its successful ``Think Different'' billboards
in San Mateo, but the face on it is hardly a household name:
Richard Feynman, the late Caltech Nobel Prize-winning physicist.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Julio Solorzano Jr., who was unloading a truck at Attachments
International, a dental supply company underneath the Feynman
billboard, had no idea who loomed above him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's one I've seen with Einstein, that was pretty cool,''
said Solorzano, 30. ``Some of them, though, it's like, `Who in the
hell is that?'''
</P>
<P>
   Further north, search engine companies Excite and Infoseek try
to tempt Web surfers stuck in traffic.
</P>
<P>
   In Brisbane, Imagine Media, which publishes a range of computer
magazines, posts a billboard that is often hard to figure out. But
the company likes it that way.
</P>
<P>
   The billboard says ``Last Great Media Company For 3,000 Miles,''
with an arrow pointing in the general direction of Imagine's
headquarters, three miles away. At first, the sign didn't say
``Imagine,'' but now it does. Weed-whacked into the hillside near
the sign is a ``B2'' _ an apparent reference to Business 2.0,
Imagine's newest magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The 3,000 miles refers to the media capital of New York, and not
to any company in particular, said Diane Carlson, marketing
director for Business 2.0.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just trying to be cheeky,'' Carlson said. She wouldn't
comment on the mowed ``B2,'' which is on public land, but she did
discuss the billboard. ``One of the No.1 reasons we have that
billboard is for recruitment. ... We work hard, play hard and have
fun with things.''
</P>
<P>
   The billboards themselves are more fun once they cross San
Francisco city limits. In an ad for the game Tomb Raider on the
side of a South of Market building, a two-story cartoon character
showing off ample cleavage announces, ``The name's Croft. Lara
Croft.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt Lara Croft confuses most of the
non-computer-game-playing (and non-13-year-old-male) populace.
</P>
<P>
   But such simple tech ads still assume some level of computer
savviness. Even in San Francisco, which Yahoo Internet Life
anointed as the most wired city in America, only one-quarter of the
population is online. ``There are people who aren't on the
Internet, and I wonder what they think,'' said Melinda Whitehouse,
a San Francisco writer who has a paean to area billboards posted at
 &LR; www.posthoc.com/billboards.htm. &LR;  cq &LR; ``Probably the same thing as
when they see the Spanish language ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Billboards, said ad-man Schwartz, are a difficult medium. ``I
love them and hate them at the same time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While he checks out the billboards along Highway 101, he
acknowledged that he does sometimes take an alternate route down
the Peninsula. ``Highway 280 is beautiful,'' he said, ``for its
absence of billboards.''

 XILINX'S TINY CHIPS GET WITH THE PROGRAM  &HT;     By Dan Fost 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Xilinx stock may not seem like a big winner compared to many
Internet issues. After all, it only doubled in the past three
months.
</P>
<P>
   But the San Jose company, which makes cheap, tiny chips that can
be programmed to do almost anything the customer wants, is poised
for ``explosive growth,'' said Mark Edelstone, a semiconductor
analyst with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Xilinx's chips don't go into personal computers, but they do go
lots of other places _ into networking, telecommunications and
factory equipment and medical instruments, to name a few.
</P>
<P>
   There's even a Xilinx chip in a German coffee-maker that's
networked to a milk dispenser and an electronic cash terminal.
</P>
<P>
   Xilinx's products are known as field programmable gate arrays,
or FPGAs, and complex programmable logic devices, or CPLDs.
Customers can program these chips to do all sorts of things, making
them much more flexible than preprogrammed chips sold by companies
like Intel or LSI Logic.
</P>
<P>
   Xilinx chief executive Willem ``Wim'' Roelandts, 53, said the
chips cost about $10 apiece, which is making them affordable for
more and more uses.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 10 years, every electronic device will contain programmable
chips,'' Roelandts predicted.
</P>
<P>
   When he joined the company in early 1996, after a 30-year career
at Hewlett-Packard, Xilinx ``felt like Intel in the early 1970s,''
the Belgian-born Roelandts said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts share his view of Xilinx's  &LR; the company's potential.
</P>
<P>
   Xilinx's earnings for fiscal 1999, which ends in March, are
expected to be around $1.60 per share _ about the same as last
year. But Edelstone forecasts earnings of $2.20 per share in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Xilinx stock is up 100 percent since August 31, outperforming
chip giant Intel, which is up 68.5 percent in the same time frame.
Shares in Altera Corp., a Xilinx rival also based in San Jose, is
up 91 percent _ reflecting broad interest in programmable chips.
</P>
<P>
   Edelstone expects Xilinx stock, which closed at $61.25 Friday,
to climb as high as $80 in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the company has laid the foundation for the last two
years that should give it a springboard to accelerated growth over
the next two or three years,'' Edelstone said. Xilinx will be
cutting expenses at the same time, he said, improving profit
margins.
</P>
<P>
   Roelandts' task from the moment he arrived has been to recover
market share Xilinx lost to Altera.
</P>
<P>
   Xilinx invented the FPGA, and Altera invented the CPLD, which
have similar uses. According to Roelandts, Altera did a better job
of moving in on Xilinx customers than Xilinx did stealing business
from Altera.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took our eyes off the ball,'' Roelandts said. ``We were not
as aggressive as we could have been.''
</P>
<P>
   The companies are also locked in an intellectual property
lawsuit that's dragged on for four years. Edelstone said no
resolution is near, and even if it is resolved, it's not likely to
have a major impact on either company's business.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Roelandts said he wanted the company to focus on developing
new products rather than the court case.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the company unveiled its Virtex product line, which
puts 1 million tiny gates &UR;  &LR; on a chip, twice as many as its previous
product. The more gates, the more functions you can program onto a
chip.
</P>
<P>
   But Xilinx has only sold $1 million worth of Virtex chips since
they hit the market in October, and Roelandts said it will take a
while before the new product takes hold.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; By 2002 or 2003, Roelandts expects it  &LR; the chip to bring in
more than $500 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Roelandts has relocated his office twice in the past three
years, moving from building to building at Xilinx, in order to stay
close to the employees and the production process.
</P>
<P>
   ``By being among the troops, I get a first-hand feel for how
they enjoy themselves, how they feel. You don't have that if you
create the isolation of paneled offices.''
</P>
<P>
   Edelstone praised Roelandts' leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wim has done a great job of helping take the company to the
next level,'' he said. ``He's got a good team around him, and
that's played a big part of helping the company refocus its
energy.''

 CHRON - BERNIE  
 TV PIONEER STILL CHIPPING AWAY  &HT;     By Dan Fost 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bernie Vonderschmitt just bought nine television sets to furnish
his newly built home, but none of them are high definition TVs.
</P>
<P>
   This is only noteworthy because Vonderschmitt was one of the
pioneers of color television technology, holding 13 patents.
</P>
<P>
   But Vonderschmitt is a little more skeptical of the tube's next
frontier.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  People wanted color television, he said. The demand is not
yet there for HDTV: The sets cost too much, he said,  &LR; there's not
much programming yet, and the untrained eye can barely detect a
difference unless it's side-by-side with a regular TV, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take some time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Just as television has changed, so too has Vonderschmitt. Now
75, he'd much rather talk about his second career as co-founder and
chairman of the San Jose semiconductor company Xilinx.
</P>
<P>
   He launched the company 15 years ago when he was 60, an age when
many people are retiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's still very sharp, let me tell you,'' said Wim Roelandts,
who has succeeded Vonderschmitt as chief executive of Xilinx.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Forbes ASAP magazine included Vonderschmitt on its list
of the 100 wealthiest people in technology, although he slipped off
the list this year.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes noted Vonderschmitt's reputation as ``one of the true
gentlemen in the chip business.''
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Mark Edelstone of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter called him
``a phenomenal individual, one of the true class acts in the
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Vonderschmitt grew up in Indiana and earned his electrical
engineering degree from the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology in
Terra Haute, Ind., in 1944.
</P>
<P>
   He went straight to work at RCA in New Jersey, where the
legendary David Sarnoff was leading the early charge into
television, but three months later Vonderschmitt joined the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   He worked as an electronics officer for two years, &LR;  and returned
to RCA in 1946. The company soon began working on broadcasting in
color, and Vonderschmitt was on the team.
</P>
<P>
   RCA, which was then the parent of NBC, flopped with its early
demonstrations of color TV. The pictures featured green lips and
blue bananas, according to Joel Brinkley in the book ``Defining
Vision.'' But CBS had an even worse solution, Vonderschmitt
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``CBS wanted to put a big disk in front of the set,'' he said.
``It would spin, and you'd get virtual color. But if that got away
in the house, people would get hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   The adoption of color took many years, finally catching on in
the 1960s. Around that time, Vonderschmitt moved to the solid state
division, in which transistors replaced clunky old vacuum tubes in
TV sets.
</P>
<P>
   By 1973, he was running the division. When RCA was sold to
General Electric, his division was a $500-million-a-year operation,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; At age 58, he could easily have retired. But Vonderschmitt
decided not to let the picture fade out.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he went back to school, earning a master's in business
administration from Rider University in Lawrenceville, N.J. He also
earned the chartered financial analyst designation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just a scientist and engineer,'' he said with
characteristic humility. ``That's a terrible introduction to the
business world.''
</P>
<P>
   After graduation he moved to California and joined Zilog, then a
small chipmaking division of Exxon. Within three years he and two
colleagues split from Zilog to form their own chip firm, Xilinx.
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind Xilinx was programmable logic _ chips that
engineers could tweak for their own purposes. Vonderschmitt was
inspired by the success that Wilf Corrigan was having at LSI Logic.
Xilinx co-founder Ross Freeman, a brilliant engineer, put his own
spin on it.
</P>
<P>
   They raised some money and, in February 1984, launched the
company. Freeman died five years later, at age 40, of complications
from a disease he originally contracted serving in the Peace Corps
in Africa. Jim Barnett, the other founder, left the company six
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Vonderschmitt relinquished the chief executive title in 1996.
``I had served my term in purgatory,'' he said. &UR;  &LR; He hired
Hewlett-Packard veteran Roelandts as president and CEO, and stayed
on as chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Vonderschmitt also serves on about eight other corporate boards
and remains active with his alma mater, Rose-Hulman. He has a
condominium in Silicon Valley, but is putting the finishing touches
on a house he's built on 280 acres near Evansville, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   He leases out most of the land, which is farmed for corn, wheat,
beans and hay.
</P>
<P>
   ``The contrast between here in Silicon Valley and there is day
and night,'' he said. ``In the valley, there's still a frenzy.''
</P>
<P>
   But for this septuagenarian, even the tranquility of rural
Indiana isn't exactly relaxing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got so many things to do there,'' he said. ``A conference
call, preparing for a board meeting, watching the stock market.
Retirement is hardly retirement.''

 By ADAM NAGOURNEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ David C. Leavy graduated from Colby College in
Maine six years ago and leapt into presidential politics: field
director in the Maine caucuses for the campaign of Gov. Bill
Clinton of Arkansas. Within the year, Leavy had a desk up the hall
from the Oval Office, making him a charter member of the cocky and
optimistic class of young men and women who lifted Clinton to
victory in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Leavy, 28, is one of the few remaining people of the
class of '92 in the Clinton White House. And as the generation that
charged into Washington with Clinton in 1993 took somber measure of
what has become of the promise of this presidency this weekend,
Leavy was anguished and disappointed _ but not with the second
president in the nation's history to have been impeached.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't owe me anything,'' said Leavy, spokesman for the
National Security Council. ``Quite the contrary. I owe him
everything. Everything I have professionally is because of him.
I've worked for him from the day I graduated college, and I will
probably _ God willing _ for the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will always wear a Clinton jersey. Through this crisis and
for the rest of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Leavy's testimonial was, perhaps, extreme in its sentimentality,
but it was not unusual among the people who work, or once worked,
for Clinton. It appears that House Republicans may have done for
the president what Clinton could not do for himself: won him an
absolution from many _ though certainly not all _ of the Clinton
associates who had felt most violated by his transgressions.
</P>
<P>
   The anger that many of them once felt for Clinton has been
largely drawn away by the Republicans. It almost seems that some
members of the class of '92, including many he has not even spoken
to in months, are ready to rally to his support once again.
</P>
<P>
   ``This looks and smells and is a politically inspired
impeachment,'' said David C. Wilhelm, who orchestrated some of
Clinton's early political victories and went on to become chairman
of the Democratic National Committee. ``I'm angry about it. I think
it is completely unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilhelm, recalling his disappointment with Clinton earlier this
year, described the president as ``a good man; not a perfect man,
but a good man.'' Wilhelm added, ``His behavior pales to the
actions the Republicans have caused.''
</P>
<P>
   Dee Dee Myers, the former White House press secretary who has
been sharply critical of Clinton as a television commentator, said
that ``damage being done to the Constitution by an overzealous
political party willing to hijack it for political purposes is much
more serious than anything Clinton has done.''
</P>
<P>
   Levy, Wilhelm and Ms. Myers were part of a group of people who
changed the political face of this city in 1993. They were, for the
most part, people who had not before worked in national politics.
They were Democrats, and they were relatively young.
</P>
<P>
   They were also often idealistic, invigorated by a campaign run
by Clinton that was bold in its promises and rhetoric. What that
meant was that Clinton came into office with extremely high
expectations. And the prospect now that his term might be defined
by an impeachment is distressing to people who had seen so much
potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had this moment,'' Wilhelm said. ``It was a moment ripe
with possibility, And I guess that's the frustrating thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Myers said: ``You can't help but have a sense of tremendous
wasted opportunity. And in Clinton's case, wasted potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, amid this criticism, Clinton's allies are stepping up for
one more battle, this time to counter the suggestion that the
president's failings have ruined his hope of achieving the
accomplishments he once promised.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will tell you that I think Bill Clinton did a great job as
president,'' said Rahm I. Emanuel, who was Clinton's chief
fund-raiser in 1992, and worked as a senior adviser until this past
fall. ``I am proud to have worked for him as a president. I am
proud to be associated with him.''
</P>
<P>
   In the White House, Paul Begala, a Clinton adviser who has made
a career out of dealing with Clinton's difficulties, went so far as
to argue that the president's legacy was not only intact, but
growing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be careful, be careful,'' Begala said. ``Go ahead and write
his political obit because I'm going to clip it and save it and
file it in my two-inch thick file of all the others.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. But though the loyalty, and even some of the affection,
for Clinton may be returning in some quarters, it is hard to find
many people who have the hope and enthusiasm that was once so
prevalent in the corridors of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never have dreamed two things,'' George
Stephanopoulos, who is probably the most estranged of the former
Clinton advisers, said Sunday afternoon. ``I would never have
dreamed that the country would have been so improved eight years
into his stewardship. And I never dreamed of the day that I would
wake up and see this morning's headline. Neither one can be
erased.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Wilhelm and his wife, Degee, who also worked on Clinton's 1992
campaign, expressed their feelings though an unlikely vehicle this
season: their annual Christmas card message.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a singularly depressing event, particularly for those of
us who worked so hard to elect Bill Clinton back in 1992, to see
the hope and promise that his election seemed to represent in those
heady days dissolve into a morass of partisanship and wrangling,''
the Wilhelms wrote. ``Sorry to be so downbeat in a Christmas note.
But I thought maybe you'd like one of these that didn't pretend
everything was hunky-dory.''

 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Internet continued to magically weave its way into the
American fabric in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Online stocks soared, millions logged on and lawmakers embraced
the medium with Web-friendly bills. There were problems, to be sure
_ free speech took some body blows and several startups bit the
dust _ but the Web remains a remarkable societal force whose
influence will grow.
</P>
<P>
   Here is one person's take on the year's winners and losers.
</P>
<P>
   WINNERS
</P>
<P>
   _America Online. From Web pariah to powerhouse in just two
years, AOL emerged as a dominant force. With its $4.2 billion
acquisition of Netscape Communications, the world's largest online
service is in position to lord over the multibillion-dollar market
for e-commerce and online advertising.
</P>
<P>
   _Internet stocks. A conga line of Net ventures struck it rich on
Wall Street _ many by simply showing up. Inktomi, eBay and
Broadcast.com have made nary a dime, but their combined market
value is a stratospheric $12.6 billion. One analyst even predicted
that Amazon.com could top (gulp) $400 per share. Indeed, the market
was so receptive that even a pair of companies that postponed their
IPOs _ Xoom.com and theglobe.com _ eventually made off with a
bundle.
</P>
<P>
   _Matt Drudge. Reluctantly, we nod our notepad to the Net's
nattering nabob of nastiness. Unconstrained by pesky journalistic
standards, the Drudge Report ``broke'' the Monica Lewinsky scandal
after Newsweek had done all the reporting. Drudge was the first to
disclose the ``cigar'' story and, hey, he got his own TV show on
Fox.
</P>
<P>
   _Legislation. The Internet gladly read Congress' lips this fall,
when legislators passed a three-year moratorium on no  &LR; new Net
taxes. What's more, it approved a three-year increase in the number
of foreign workers who can be hired under H-1B &LR; H1-B visas and
rubber-stamped a digital copyright act.
</P>
<P>
   _Web performance. It withstood the Starr Report and a citywide
blackout, and just kept chugging away. The Internet grew to more
than 100 million users worldwide this year, while avoiding
wide-scale brownouts that many skeptics had predicted.
</P>
<P>
   _Salon. The plucky Net zine consistently scooped its traditional
media brethren with insightful, hard-hitting pieces. Special kudos
for exposing hypocritical House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry
Hyde, R-Ill., who bayed for President Clinton's head while
conveniently overlooking his own extramarital fling in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   _Infoseek. The Wonderful World of Disney, indeed. The Internet
media company, overshadowed by South Bay neighbors Yahoo and
Excite, quickly made a splash by selling a 43 percent stake to Walt
Disney Co. to create a super site of dynamite news, sports and
e-commerce content. Nothing Mickey Mouse about this deal.
</P>
<P>
   LOSERS
</P>
<P>
   _Microsoft. The software behemoth and its CEO, megabillionaire
Bill Gates, were vilified in a landmark antitrust lawsuit filed by
the Justice Department. By then, however, Microsoft had carved up
Netscape like a Christmas turkey, essentially forcing its premature
sale to AOL. Congrats on helping kill an Internet pioneer, Mr. Bill
&AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   _Netscape. Self-inflicted wounds and tough competition
accelerated the downfall of cyberspace's Camelot. It's a pity. The
company that made ``Web browsing'' a household phrase deserved a
better fate than becoming the West Coast operations of AOL,
nicknamed ``the cockroach of cyberspace'' by the digital elite.
</P>
<P>
   _Atbigger.net. The dysfunctional Internet service provider,
wracked by money and management problems, left thousands of
subscribers without Web access when it abruptly pulled the plug on
operations this fall. Brigadoon.com _ itself a victim of Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection _ acquired the remnants in a bankruptcy fire
sale. Atbigger.net had promised a lifetime Internet account for
$60: It lasted two years.
</P>
<P>
   _Free speech. They trampled the First Amendment in a Sacramento
courtroom last month, and seriously endangered free speech on the
Internet. A superior court judge barred Ken Hamidi, a disgruntled
ex-Intel employee, from sending thousands of e-mails critical of
the chipmaker. The decision has sent a chilling message to
cyber-rights activists. Funny, I thought the Internet was supposed
to be a major new source of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   _Legislation. For all the high-tech gains on Capitol Hill, there
was The Child Online Protection Act. &UR;  &LR; It imposes criminal penalties
on commercial Web sites that allow anyone under 18 to access
pornographic material deemed ``harmful to minors.'' Violators would
face up to $50,000 in fines and six months in jail. Civil-liberties
groups immediately challenged the constitutionality of the law in
federal court.
</P>
<P>
   _Healtheon. The third time wasn't necessarily the charm for Jim
Clark, the high-tech legend who founded Silicon Graphics and
Netscape. A planned IPO for his latest venture, online health care
service resource Healtheon, was pulled at the 11th-hour in October.
At the time, the Santa Clara company blamed a sickly market for the
delay. The prognosis for &UR;  &LR; another offering? Cautious.
</P>
<P>
   _PointCast. This wasn't a fall from grace: It was a free-fall.
From the toast of the Internet, hyping ``push'' technology, to the
subject of an unflattering Ken Auletta piece in The New Yorker.
Can't get more dire than that.
</P>
<P>
   _Zapata. An oil-exploration-company-turned-fish-oil-concern
founded by former President George Bush decided to dive into the
Internet market with two dozen acquisitions to pump up its stock.
The hair-brained &LR;   &LR; harebrained scheme soon devolved into stitching
those Web sites into a super portal site like some Frankenstein
monster. The plan was ditched within months. Calling Dr. Kevorkian.
</P>
<P>
   _Digicash. OK, let me get this straight. Anyone who used the
company's electronic cash for an online transaction _ whether
customer, bank or merchant _ needed to use special software. That's
an enormous obstacle for a high-tech startup, and a big reason
Digicash filed for Chapter 11 last month.

 This article was reported and written by JILL ABRAMSON, LIZETTE

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It appeared to be the ultimate comeback in a career
marked by seemingly miraculous political resurrections. The night
of Tuesday, Nov. 3, was a time of celebration at the White House.
Bill Clinton had again defied the odds, embarrassed the experts and
vanquished his political enemies.
</P>
<P>
   As election results poured in from across the country, it became
clear that Clinton, though not on the ballot, had won a smashing
victory over the Republicans who had bet their chips on his
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The president gathered with friends and aides in his chief of
staff's office to revel in the returns, one of those there
recalled, chewing on cigars, drinking wine and delighting in the
victory until 2:30 in the morning. The public had spoken. Surely
the Republicans must finally heed its voice.
</P>
<P>
   But the despair in the Republican camp was tempered by
determination. The next afternoon, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., the
chairman of the House Judiciary Committee that would soon conduct
hearings on impeaching the president, dialed a conference call from
a meeting room in the O'Hare Airport Hilton in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   After each of the 20 other Republicans on the committee clicked
onto the line, Hyde somberly delivered his marching orders. ``We
took a shellacking in the elections,'' he told his colleagues,
several of them recounted last week. ``But we have a constitutional
duty to carry out, and we always said the election would have no
bearing on it. We will move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his allies badly misread the resolve of Hyde and
other Republican leaders to sail into the wind of hostile public
opinion. To this day, the president's friends say, Clinton, the
most poll-driven politician ever to rise to the presidency, is
mystified that Republicans in Congress would defy the poll-tested
will of the people.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton, through a strategy of denial and attack, had long
ago given Republicans the weapons they turned against him in their
campaign for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   In the final days before Saturday's vote, many wavering
Republicans argued that they could not trust a president who had
stood in the Roosevelt Room of the White House in January and
angrily denied having sexual relations with ``that woman, Miss
Lewinsky.'' That public lie was not among the impeachment charges,
but it stiffened the resolve of the president's opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is something a president should never never do,'' one
senior adviser who also counts himself a friend of Clinton, said of
the president's defiance that day. ``That's most troubling to me. I
am still working through forgiving him for it.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the view of many, neither did his opponents bring credit
upon themselves. Some say Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel,
sacrificed his reputation for fairness and civility in his
relentless pursuit of the president.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans, by refusing to allow a censure measure to
reach the House floor and by forcing a partisan vote that succeeded
on only two of four impeachment counts, have risked further erosion
of their falling public support.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews with the president's closest advisers, who helped
formulate his strategy for dealing with the mounting legal and
political crisis, and with his staunchest foes, both in the
independent counsel's office and within the Republican
congressional leadership, it is apparent that the impeachment vote
was sadly inevitable. The two sides in this conflict could not find
common ground to resolve the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Clinton surprised even some of his own legal
advisers by stiffening his denials in the face of ever-more
tenacious questions from Starr and, later, Hyde. And Hyde, whose
abilities and determination were underestimated in the White House,
played a more pivotal role than is generally recognized, pushing
impeachment forward as his party's leadership was plunged into
post-election disarray.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always believed that impeachment was avoidable,'' Rep.
Jim Leach, a thoughtful Iowa Republican, said last week before
casting his vote to impeach Clinton. ``But at each stage, the
combination of congressional action and executive response worked
against bringing closure at an earlier moment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Testimony
</P>
<P>
   A Concession, and a Threat
</P>
<P>
   Moments before Clinton swore to tell the truth to a federal
grand jury on Aug. 17, David Kendall, the president's personal
lawyer, asked to speak privately with the independent counsel,
Starr, in a hallway outside the White House Map Room.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall told Starr that the president was prepared to
acknowledge that he had an inappropriate relationship with Monica
Lewinsky, according to several people with direct knowledge of the
encounter. ``But,'' Kendall warned Starr, ``if you go into details,
I will fight you to the knife, both here and publicly.''
</P>
<P>
   And so the president offered what he viewed as a profound
concession, underlined by a threat. Starr withdrew and huddled with
his fellow prosecutors to map out their strategy. Unanimously, they
decided to press the president on the details of the relationship;
these were critical to the definition of ``sexual relations''
allowed by the judge in Clinton's deposition in the Paula Jones
sexual harassment suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was clear that the president would only make a limited
statement, refuse to provide any details and try to run out the
clock,'' recalled Charles Bakaly III, the spokesman for Starr.
``And we saw that as an attempt by the president to defy both the
prosecutors and the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   In the days before the grand jury appearance, one of Clinton's
lawyers had strongly counseled him to refuse to testify. But the
president was swayed by polls that showed he would put his 70
percent approval ratings at risk by refusing to testify or by
exercising his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyers also told the president that it would be
suicidal for him to lie to the federal grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the president of the United States to lie before a grand
jury is a big deal,'' a longtime adviser of the president said in
an interview. ``I don't care if the lie is about a fender-bender or
about sex. We always knew that perjury before a grand jury was a
dastardly, very serious act that most people would not tolerate.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the weekend before his testimony, the president's lawyers
decided that Clinton should make an opening statement acknowledging
an inappropriate relationship with Ms. Lewinsky and then not answer
any specific questions about the nature of the sexual contact.
</P>
<P>
   But in the four hours of grand jury testimony, the president
surprised his lawyers by straying from the plan and maintaining
that Ms. Lewinsky performed sexual acts on him while he never
touched her in a sexual manner, several advisers said. On several
major points, Clinton's testimony and Ms. Lewinsky's directly
contradicted each other.
</P>
<P>
   That night, the president addressed the nation and attacked the
unfairness of Starr's 4-year-old investigation. But for the first
time, Clinton directly acknowledged that he had an inappropriate
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky that was ``wrong,'' contradicting
seven months of his public denials. While many people had assumed
he had not told the full truth in January, the admission further
damaged his credibility.
</P>
<P>
   At the conclusion of Clinton's testimony, the prosecutors
returned to their Pennsylvania Avenue offices and gathered in a
large, windowless conference room. When Starr repeated Kendall's
threat, ``there was an audible gasp'' among the 30 lawyers present,
said Ronald Rotunda, an aide to Starr.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 18, Starr's prosecutors read transcripts of the
president's testimony. After a somber discussion, Starr and his
deputies decided to send to the House of Representatives an
impeachment referral that would accuse the president of lying
repeatedly to the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Not long afterward, Clinton's lawyers received a transcript of
Ms. Lewinsky's grand jury testimony. They were shocked to read her
detailed account contradicting the president's description of their
physical contact.
</P>
<P>
   What Clinton's lawyers did not know, several of his advisers
said in interviews, was whether Ms. Lewinsky was exaggerating or
whether Clinton had misled his own legal team.
</P>
<P>
   There was another problem that confronted the president, his
advisers conceded. Many Republicans and even some Democrats doubted
his word.
</P>
<P>
   One was Rep. W.J. ``Billy'' Tauzin, a Louisiana Republican who
had switched parties in 1995, in part because he said the president
had lied to him on an energy-tax issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lied to me, he lies to others, and he uses us like rag
dolls,'' Tauzin said. ``And that's not helpful in this business.''
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 19, the House majority whip, Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas,
had become the first leading lawmaker to call for Clinton's
resignation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly,'' DeLay said, ``the president has done irreparable
damage to the office of the presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his allies dismissed the threat of impeachment as a
partisan exercise. But the die was cast.
</P>
<P>
   A case for impeachment was on its way to the most partisan
committee on Capitol Hill, the House Judiciary Committee. And
DeLay, the Republicans' chief vote counter in the House, was
determined to drive impeachment forward.
</P>
<P>
   The Starr Report
</P>
<P>
   Miscalculations and Repercussions
</P>
<P>
   The next miscalculations were made by Starr and the Republicans
in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Two Starr deputies, Brett Kavanaugh and Stephen Bates, had been
assigned to write what became the 445-page Starr report. On Sept.
9, two government vans disgorged the document, along with 17 boxes
of supporting documents.
</P>
<P>
   Kavanaugh, who had worked at Starr's Chicago law firm, and
Bates, an editor from the scholarly Wilson Quarterly, had written a
140-page narrative that chronicled in graphic detail each of 10
sexual encounters with the president that Ms. Lewinsky had
described in her grand jury testimony. The details, the prosecutors
believed, were necessary to show conclusively that the president
had lied.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not `Lady Chatterly's Lover,''' said Rotunda, the
aide to Starr. ``It was necessary to include all those details. The
details also made it ring true.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde had spoken reverently of bipartisanship and fairness. The
hearing process, he promised repeatedly, would be slow and
cautious. And to a certain extent, it started that way. Two days
after the Starr report's delivery under lock and key, the full
House, in a bipartisan vote, chose on Sept. 9 to release its
contents, without any member having read it. And two days later,
Republicans decided to publish it for the world on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans defended their decision, saying that the impeachment
of Clinton carried such import they could not justify withholding
even one word of the Starr report. The public, they argued, had a
right to know.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Clinton had sometimes overplayed his hand at crucial
moments, the Republicans badly miscalculated the public's reaction
to the 445-page report. Parents were soon bombarding congressional
offices with complaints that their children were reading about oral
sex online. Pundits called the report ``soft-core pornography.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A penny-ante high school sex novel,'' one of Clinton's
defenders sneered.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans had also refused to provide the president's
lawyers with an opportunity to review the Starr report before it
was made public. Then, despite grand jury secrecy rules, they
released the videotape of the president's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Seething Democrats blasted the Republicans as unfair. Polls
quickly showed that two-thirds of the public continued to support
the president while Starr's approval ratings fell to single digits.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Clinton's advisers saw a clear danger in the independent
counsel's report. Senior White House aides quietly opened
discussions with allies on Capitol Hill to seek a censure
resolution as an alternative to the Republican intention to open
impeachment hearings.
</P>
<P>
   When the president's top two lawyers, Kendall and Charles Ruff,
the White House counsel, appeared on television on the Sunday after
the Starr report's release to respond to the charges, they did not
provide a factual response to the accusations. Instead, they said
that even if Clinton had lied to Paula Jones' lawyers and to the
grand jury, those lies did not amount to impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever the president did or whatever the president said,''
Ruff said, ``whether it was in January or August, there simply is
no basis for removing the president from office.''
</P>
<P>
   That was to be the backbone of the president's defense
throughout the fall. It echoed in Saturday's impeachment debate on
the House floor, as Democrats argued that Clinton's wrongs were not
impeachable and Republicans invoked their duty to protect the rule
of law.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As House members headed home in October to campaign for
re-election, the Democrats had one worry. The Republicans had
announced a $30 million advertising blitz for their House
candidates called Operation Breakout.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican election strategy, however, seemed strangely
devoid of issues. Then the Republicans decided to raise the
Lewinsky scandal in some of the Operation Breakout ads. As
Democrats hammered away at a do-nothing Republican leadership
obsessed with scandal and the politics of division, the Republicans
were highlighting the one issue that voters were telling pollsters
they did not want to hear about.
</P>
<P>
   Almost no political analysts predicted the outcome: In a midterm
election when the party not occupying the White House typically
gains more than 20 House seats, the Republicans lost five.
</P>
<P>
   Brief Delusion
</P>
<P>
   Election Victory and False Hope
</P>
<P>
   The election claimed one immediate casualty, the speaker and
Clinton nemesis Newt Gingrich. Three days after Gingrich announced
he was resigning, his heir apparent as speaker, Rep. Bob Livingston
of Louisiana, telephoned the Republican strategist Ralph Reed for
his advice on an agenda for House Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Reed recalls telling Livingston to play down the scandal so the
impeachment inquiry would not further taint the party: ``I said,
`Lay low _ don't let this impeachment bomb blow up in your face.'''
</P>
<P>
   But Livingston startled Reed by replying that the march to
impeachment was unstoppable, and that it was being orchestrated by
Hyde.
</P>
<P>
   ``He goes, `I don't know how you turn the thing off,''' Reed
said. ```Henry's going to hold hearings. And I don't know how you
stop that.'''
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, the administration seemed oblivious to the
fact that Hyde and his committee were plunging ahead. White House
aides had all but halted their lobbying campaign on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The election happened and the media created this delusion that
somehow because the Democrats won seats, the Republicans somehow
grew less interested in impeachment,'' said Rep. Robert Wexler, a
Florida Democrat on the Judiciary Committee. ``That just was never
the case. From the start, the Republicans had one goal in mind and
only one: to impeach Bill Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet rather than deter Republicans, events after the election
made Clinton's impeachment more likely.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's resignation as speaker removed an embattled
Republican leader who might have felt more pressure, with his own
weakened status, to forge a compromise with the White House for a
censure of Clinton short of impeachment, Republican officials say.
And Livingston kept a low profile because he did not want the
beginning of his tenure to be marked by impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Into the leadership void stepped DeLay, the Republican whip and
impeachment firebrand. But behind the scenes it was the less
caustic Hyde who never wavered from his intention to move forward
with impeachment charges in his committee, the most politically
polarized in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hyde had predicted early that any impeachment process
would require bipartisan cooperation, he soon realized that
Republicans would have to go it alone. In his view as chairman, the
panel's constitutional duty to conduct an inquiry, no matter how
swift and skeletal, was more important than succumbing to public
opinion and Democratic outrage.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining the altered dynamic, Rep. David Skaggs, D-Colo.,
said, ``There was a much more disciplined, single-minded effort on
the part of Henry Hyde and the Republican members of the Judiciary
Committee than perhaps we had understood would happen, and a
certain taking of ease, prematurely, on the part of the White
House.''
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 6, Hyde and the Republican majority on his committee
made their main move: They submitted 81 questions to Clinton for
his response.
</P>
<P>
   The questions were cast as an opportunity for the president to
clear the air with the committee and with the public. But they
asked for one-word answers _ ``admit or deny,'' each began _ to
often complicated summaries of the Starr report or grand jury
testimony. In many cases, to admit now would be to admit Clinton
had lied under oath before.
</P>
<P>
   The White House took three weeks _ until the Friday after
Thanksgiving _ before submitting responses after Clinton had
reviewed them, following a round of golf.
</P>
<P>
   The president himself was most responsible for the tone of the
answers; one adviser said Clinton believed the questions were a
trap designed to trick him into admitting that he had committed
perjury. But he was not alone. One White House adviser recalled
counseling Clinton and his lawyer: ``I'd like to take those damn
answers, tie them around a rock and throw them through Henry Hyde's
office window.''
</P>
<P>
   The responses were lawyerly and finely drawn. But in carefully
avoiding any traps posed by the questions, the president again
appeared evasive.
</P>
<P>
   The first question, for example, asked him to ``admit or deny''
that the president is the chief law-enforcement officer of the
United States. Clinton delicately dodged a direct answer: The
president is often said to be the chief law-enforcement officer, he
replied, but that role is not among the duties spelled out by the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Again, the president's defiance, or determination to defend
himself, infuriated his enemies. ``Regrettably,'' said Rep. Michael
Forbes, R-N.Y., who made up his mind on Wednesday to impeach,
``there was an arrogance coming out of the White House that this
was slam dunk over.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Rep. James Moran, a moderate Democrat from Virginia, found
himself cringing at the 81 responses. ``Most of us know the
president well enough that he has a bear trap of a memory,'' he
said. ``And here he was acting like he had Alzheimer's.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's accumulated vulnerability to assaults on his honesty
was evident on Dec. 10, in the final presentation to the committee
of the Republicans' chief investigative counsel, David Schippers.
Schippers, a lifelong Democrat from Chicago, used the
plain-spokenness of a county courthouse prosecutor, with a generous
dose of sarcasm, to persuade many moderates to vote for
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lied to the people,'' Schippers said in his summation,
dwelling on statements by the president that were not included in
any of the articles of impeachment. ``He lied to his Cabinet, he
lied to his top aides, and now he's lied under oath to the Congress
of the United States. There's no one left to lie to.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Clinton's political advisers conceded, ``It was very
powerful. It was much more damaging than the Starr report.''
</P>
<P>
   In defending Clinton before the committee, the White House
counsel, Ruff, again argued that the president's statements, while
deceptive, did not constitute impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no doubt that he walked up to a line that he thought he
understood,'' Ruff said. ``Reasonable people, and you maybe have
reached this conclusion, could determine that he crossed over that
line, and that what for him was truthful but misleading or
nonresponsive and misleading or evasive, was in fact false.''
</P>
<P>
   For Republicans, an admission by Clinton's lawyer that the
president might have given misleading or nonresponsive or even
evasive answers under oath was not enough. They had wanted the
president to acknowledge that he lied under oath before the grand
jury and in the Jones deposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The White House was given two full days to present a
defense,'' said Rep. Frank Riggs, R-Calif., who is retiring, ``but
the defense never questioned the underlying facts and
circumstances. I was waiting for them to present new and different
information, and they didn't. That was crucial.''
</P>
<P>
   By now, Republicans had succeeded in casting Clinton as
unrepentant unless he explicitly confessed to lying to the grand
jury. But on Dec. 11, in a brief Rose Garden speech to the nation,
Clinton tried one more time to appease his doubters.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I want the American people to know, what I want the
Congress to know, is that I am profoundly sorry for all I have done
wrong in words and deeds.''
</P>
<P>
   Once more he did not specifically address the accusations
against him, and Republicans pronounced his efforts feeble and far
too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really needed to say that he lied under oath, even if he
didn't use the term `perjury,''' Moran said. After the speech, he
said, Republican moderates came up to him and said, ``Jim, I just
can't accept the reality of this guy's ability to lie so
bald-facedly and so convincingly. It's scary how convincing he
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, in a series of letters and statements, Hyde made
clear that if a censure resolution had left the committee, he would
oppose bringing it to the floor. The Republicans were not going to
back down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then it was clear that this thing was wired,'' said Steve
Elmendorf, chief of staff to Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the
minority leader. ``Up until that point, I still thought there was
some hope that these moderates would band together.''
</P>
<P>
   The Final Days
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's Mantra, `I'm Fighting'
</P>
<P>
   On one level, the answer to the question ``How did we get
here?'' is easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a consequence, first and foremost, of the president's
appalling behavior,'' said Mike McCurry, the president's former
press secretary. ``And you can't get around it and you can't
explain it.''
</P>
<P>
   But equally important was the determination of Clinton's
political enemies to not see him slip off the hook one more time,
even if that meant a wrenching and unpopular impeachment vote.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Moran, a Democrat who had harshly criticized
Clinton's behavior, surprised himself by going to see the
president's secretary while Clinton was in the Middle East. ``I
went and talked with Betty Currie,'' Moran said.
</P>
<P>
   In the impeachment charges, Clinton was accused of taking part
in a plan involving Mrs. Currie to conceal his gifts to Ms.
Lewinsky. Moran needed to know, he told Mrs. Currie, whether
Clinton had ``used a good, decent, honest, civil servant to assist
him in covering up evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So I told her all that,'' Moran said. ``And she said she does
not feel he ever lied to her, nor does she feel used, and she feels
he is a very good man.'' The visit help persuade Moran to vote
against impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Riggs, the California Republican, said he was so torn that he
telephoned former Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter, former
Vice President Dan Quayle and the former Senate majority leader Bob
Dole. ``Their advice has been very helpful,'' said Riggs, who would
vote for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   After he reached out to local political figures, Forbes got a
bit of unsolicited advice. Robert DeNiro, the actor, called him to
make a pitch for the president. ``That doesn't help,'' Forbes said.
He backed impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   As the last remaining undecided Republicans, one by one,
announced that they would vote to impeach Clinton, the last hopes
of the White House faded.
</P>
<P>
   Aboard Air Force One, as he returned home from Israel on Tuesday
evening, the president told a close friend that he knew that his
political fate would soon be before the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   This alarmed the friend, who admonished the glum-sounding
Clinton. ``You've got to fight this thing,'' the friend recalled
telling Clinton by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am fighting,'' the president replied. ``I'm fighting, I'm
fighting, I'm fighting.''

DEAL TO SELL COPPER MINES IS IN PLACE, ZAMBIA SAYS
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ After two years of on-and-off
negotiations, a deal to sell state-owned copper mines in Zambia has
finally been reached, the finance minister has announced.
</P>
<P>
   Anglo American Corp. of South Africa will take over the
important Nchanga, Nkana and Konkola mines, Finance Minister Edith
Nawakwi said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Copper is Zambia's most important industry and earns 56 percent
of its export earnings. At independence in 1964, copper made the
country, then Northern Rhodesia, one of Africa's richest nations.
But decades of falling copper prices and the government's failure
to invest in new technology turned the mines into a burden on the
state. Recently, they were estimated to be losing $1 million a day.
</P>
<P>
   The state-owned copper company, Zambia Consolidated Copper
Mines, is the centerpiece of the aggressive privatization program
started by President Frederick T. Chiluba after his election in
1991, when the state owned 80 percent of the economy. It was put up
for sale two years ago, but there have been many disputes along the
way.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of bidding against one another, the buyers _ including
Phelps Dodge of the United States, Noranda of Canada, Commonwealth
Development Corp. of Britain and Anglovaal of South Africa _ formed
a consortium to make a unified bid for several mines and their
associated smelters and power companies. Negotiations ended in May
with the government seeking $500 million and the consortium
offering $131 million.
</P>
<P>
   The government accused the companies of trying to grab Zambia's
greatest asset at a fire-sale price. The consortium countered that
the mines, smelters and equipment were so old that they would need
billions of dollars in new investment.
</P>
<P>
   Falling copper prices made other companies back out of deals for
lesser mines. Political uncertainty made matters worse; the copper
belt is on the border with Congo, which is in the middle of a civil
war, and Chiluba's government has become increasingly repressive.
</P>
<P>
   As foreign donors told Zambia it would get no more aid until the
mines were sold, Anglo American, which already owned 27 percent of
the state copper company, stepped in.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press said the deal includes an agreement to keep
paying for the high-quality schools, hospitals and water systems
that mining communities enjoy. The copper belt region, including
some of the country's biggest cities, depends on them.
</P>
<P>
   The state will retain 20 percent of the new company. Anglo has
agreed to pay $10 million in royalties and dividends on profits and
eventually to invest $1.1 billion in upgrading the mines. It was
not clear how many miners would be laid off.
</P>
<P>
   If copper prices ever rise, the deal could be a rich one. The
Konkola mine is estimated to have deep ore bodies that could last
100 years and are three times as concentrated as those of U.S.
mines _ but it will cost more than $600 million to get to them.

DISSIDENTS IN MEXICAN ARMY CRITICIZE GOVERNMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By SAM DILLON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ In a broad display of internal division that has
no precedent in modern Mexican history, several dozen dissident
soldiers, led by a lieutenant colonel, have emerged to publicly
criticize government economic policies and civilian control of the
military as well reputed abuses by military courts.
</P>
<P>
   The army's top prosecutor responded angrily on Saturday to a
street protest by the dissident soldiers, vowing a crackdown on
members of the fledgling movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any soldier who speaks badly of his institution and of his
superior officers must be severely punished,'' said the prosecutor,
Gen. Rafael Macedo de la Concha.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent head of the group, the Patriotic Command to Raise
the People's Consciousness, is Lt. Col. Hidelgardo Bacilio Gomez, a
43-year-old army surgeon who led about 50 soldiers on a march
Friday along Mexico City's main downtown boulevard, Reforma. They
carried Mexican flags and placards criticizing the army high
command.
</P>
<P>
   At the march's close, Bacilio Gomez, flanked by two leftist
senators, read a statement criticizing government corruption and
called for Mexicans to join his protest. Plainclothes military
intelligence officers surrounded the dissident officers, but made
no arrests.
</P>
<P>
   Bacilio Gomez met briefly with officials and later told
reporters he had asked the government to guarantee his safety
because he feared for his life. He voiced admiration for Hugo
Chavez, Venezuela's president-elect, who as army officer led an
attempted coup in 1992, and said he hoped to travel to Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   After the march, Bacilio Gomez dropped from public view. But on
Sunday, news media received a faxed statement signed by him
accusing generals of corruption and criticizing Mexico's system of
civilian control over the military.
</P>
<P>
   Federal police agents, apparently seeking to detain him, swarmed
through the Mexico City airport on Saturday before the scheduled
departure of a commercial flight bound for Caracas, Venezuela, the
Mexico City newspaper Reforma reported.
</P>
<P>
   In several statements faxed to news media, the colonel has also
quoted the leader of the Zapatista guerrillas in southern Mexico,
Subcommander Marcos, and Gerry Adams, the Irish Republican leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can't be possible that in a country of 98 million people
there is not a single intelligent, pragmatic, innovative leader who
can assume power with a political, social and economic model
designed to lead Mexico out of its current difficulties,'' he said
in a statement issued on Saturday. He said the government should
provide a life of dignity for its people, ``which means to eat, to
be dressed, to be educated, to have shelter.''
</P>
<P>
   A Mexico City television station reported that Bacilio Gomez has
been facing a court-martial for murder and robbery. But a statement
signed by another dissident army officer denied the report, saying
he is charged with lesser offenses, including insubordination.

WHAT'S BEHIND AMERICA'S FALLING RATE OF SAVINGS? 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Americans should be saving like crazy. Baby boomers _ the oldest
in the group of 78 million who were born between 1946 to 1964 are
due to retire in a decade or so _ are now in their prime earning
years. The after-tax return on investments has rarely been better
and the proliferation of 401(k) plans, individual retirement
accounts and other tax-favored saving plans has made thrift more
painless than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Americans are saving less than ever. Indeed, according
to the latest government figures, consumers have recently been
spending all of their incomes and then some. In September, the
personal saving rate slipped below zero for the first time since
the Great Depression. October was more of the same.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface the reason seems perverse: Economists say the
better people feel about their situation these days the less likely
they are to put aside extra money for the future. The seemingly
imperturbable stock market, strong confidence in the economy and
the ease of borrowing all help make consumers feel richer and less
inclined to postpone gratification.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts warn of dire consequences, but the situation may
not be as bad as it looks. Despite the drop in personal savings,
the broadest measure of saving _ the national saving rate, which
includes not just households but corporations and the government
sector _ has rebounded from its low in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of saving now compared to then,'' said Gary
Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution. Investment in
the nation's capital base certainly has not suffered. Foreigners
have been more than happy to send America their extra savings and,
given the risks abounding in the rest of the world, seem inclined
to continue to do so. Besides, with Asia and Latin America mired in
recessions that threaten to spread to Europe and the United States,
Americans' grasshopper habits may _ at least for now _ be more boon
than bane.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the time to tell people to stop spending,'' said
Gregory Mankiw, an economics professor at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the fear that consumers will react to the recent orgy
of spending by slamming on the brakes and suddenly turning thrifty
seems overblown. Consumers are not as stretched as the saving
numbers make it look. Wage and salary income is going up faster
than spending, and that is what most households rely on.
</P>
<P>
   One reason the official savings rate is falling is that interest
income, which goes mainly to the rich, has been shrinking, dragging
down overall reported income gains. Most forecasters agree,
however, that each individual's own income, job situation, wealth
and confidence loom far larger in household spending decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, many Americans are passing up a chance to get back $2
in eight years for every $1 they save today. That seems a trifle
irrational, even for well-off citizens of a very wealthy country.
``The standard neoclassical view that people make rational
trade-offs between present and future and that we're saving the
amount that best suits our purpose is obviously wrong,'' said
Robert Frank, an economist at Cornell who argues in his new book,
``Luxury Fever,'' that Americans ought to be saving 20 percent of
their incomes.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, what is good (or at least acceptable) for the nation
is not necessarily what is best for the Joneses. Even optimists
concede that one- to two-thirds of baby-boomer households are not
saving enough to maintain in retirement the lifestyles to which
they have become accustomed.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many economists say that focusing on the plunge in
personal savings is a bit misleading.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the personal saving rate is one of the
government's least reliable statistics. That is not because the
government does not count 401(k)s and pensions or subtract loans.
It is because saving is the difference between two very large
quantities, overall personal income and overall personal spending.
Minuscule changes in either reported income or spending can produce
huge changes in the savings rate.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, revisions based on more complete data sometimes paint
a different picture than the initial impression left by the
published statistics. For example, a rigorously researched 1987
paper, written with another economist by Lawrence Summers, now
deputy Treasury secretary, who was then teaching at Harvard,
attributed half of the drop in national saving at that point to a
decline in household savings. But subsequent revisions of the
national income accounts showed that the decline they cited had not
actually occurred.
</P>
<P>
   It is even harder to interpret the data in a period when
households, especially wealthy ones, are reporting lots of profits
from investments in the form of capital gains. Last summer,
government statisticians started subtracting capital gains, which
are not part of the nation's gross domestic product, from personal
income. That change, which reflects a shift in accounting practices
rather than any real change in household behavior, sliced two
percentage points off the published saving rate.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is to deny that there have been real changes in
savings as well.
</P>
<P>
   As stock prices have risen, pushing up the value of assets held
by pension funds, corporations have cut back contributions to
defined benefit pension funds, which pay a set amount based on
previous salary and years of service. With more profit on their
investments, corporations do not need to set as much aside to meet
their obligations.
</P>
<P>
   Pensions are counted as household saving. John Sabelhouse, an
economist at the Congressional Budget Office, figures that nearly
half the decline in the personal saving rate is a result of the
slowdown in pension contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Then, too, consumers have been spending part of their capital
gains, especially on big-ticket items like houses, furniture,
appliances and cars (although, interestingly, not as large a part
as historical experience would suggest). More of them have been
borrowing, too.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Wolfe's down-and-out banker, Ray Peepgas, in his recent best
seller, ``A Man in Full,'' is maxed out on 18 credit cards and does
not know how he will make it through the weekend unless another one
arrives in the morning mail. He is a perfect symbol of the credit
revolution of the last five years that has allowed borrowers who
previously might have been forced to stop running up debt to keep
on spending. And companies that provide credit have been able to
discriminate better between different credit risks, tailoring
interest charges accordingly. Worse risks may have to pay higher
rates, but they can still usually get credit.
</P>
<P>
   The big fear is that the majority of baby boomers will wind up
working a lot longer than they expected because they have not saved
enough for their retirement. Although experts cannot agree on what
fraction of baby boomers is headed for trouble, the best estimates
range from one- to two-thirds. And everyone agrees that
middle-class, middle-aged Americans ought to be more worried about
their futures than they appear to be.
</P>
<P>
   For all the concerns, however, Americans seem better prepared
for retirement than the citizens of most other countries. Thanks to
the high-flying stock market, household wealth has swelled by a
record $8 trillion in just four years. The net financial worth of
American households equals nearly four times their income. German
households, by contrast, have a net financial worth of just twice
their incomes.

 WASHINGTON: them more.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was this development, said Kaiser Permanente, the biggest
nonprofit health maintenance organization, that forced it to take
age into account when calculating subscribers' premiums this year
and then order large increases in individuals' policies.
</P>
<P>
   In part because it stuck with community rating longer than most
organizations, Kaiser said, it lost $270 million last year and $150
million in the first half of this year. ``We're saying that
community rating is not possible,'' said Beverly Hayon, a Kaiser
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Now the demise of community rating is fueling an insidious
spiral that drives premiums still higher and throws more consumers
off the rolls. ``It's called, `Sick people in, healthy people
out,''' said Dean Rosen, senior vice president and counsel for the
Health Insurance Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   The sicker the individual subscribers are, the greater their
incentive to keep buying insurance. Healthier subscribers balk at
high premiums and drop out. Then the insurers, left with fewer and
sicker subscribers, must spend more per client for care. To avoid
losses, they raise premiums again, giving the spiral another spin
and chasing away the healthier of the sick.
</P>
<P>
   State legislatures, more than the federal government, are
grappling with these conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Few have tried harder, and with unhappier results, than
Kentucky. To see that all individuals had access to affordable
coverage four years ago, the state prohibited insurers from taking
an applicant's health into account in calculating premiums.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, more than 40 insurers bailed out of the state's
direct-pay insurance market. ``Now I have two,'' said state
Insurance Commissioner George Nichols. This year, the Legislature
reversed course and, within limits, permitted the companies to use
health conditions in setting premiums.
</P>
<P>
   That is what led to Ms. Couture's notice from Anthem. ``Some
people are seeing 100 and 200 percent'' increases, Nichols said.
Lawrence Ford, Anthem's spokesman, said the company had little
choice if it wanted to avoid more losses.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-six states, including Connecticut, California, Florida,
Illinois, Minnesota and Washington, have found another device to
accommodate people whom insurers reject because of their health or
scare off with high premiums: high-risk insurance pools. The pools
are no bargain.
</P>
<P>
   They charge premiums that range from 25 percent to 100 percent
above those that other people pay for comparable commercial
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   But because the pools' subscribers tend to be old and sick, the
cost of their care usually exceeds the higher premium, so the
states make up the difference with assessments on insurance
companies or with tax revenues.

SPORTS COLUMN: A CAREER GAME BALL FOR LEON HESS
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's known as the game ball, the actual pebble-grained leather
football representing a team's triumph. As the New York Jets'
owner, Leon Hess had been awarded a few game balls by his team
through the years, but none as treasured as the ball from the 17-10
triumph last Saturday over the Bills at Buffalo that assured the
Jets of finishing in first place for the first time in 29 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Hess,'' Bill Parcells said after the victory, ``is one of
the strong patriarchs of the National Football League.''
</P>
<P>
   Hess doesn't have his game ball yet. It's at the Jets practice
complex at Hofstra University in Hempstead, N.Y., being painted
with the score and other vital statistics that will forever
separate it from being simply another football.
</P>
<P>
   But for the 84-year-old owner of the Jets, it's more of a career
ball. Nobody deserves it more.
</P>
<P>
   When the Jets didn't win in other years, Hess suffered. In
silence. Unlike some other owners of New York sports teams, he
preferred not to go public, not to spout sentences that would
scream in headlines. But some frustrated Jets followers mistook his
quietly tough dignity for indifference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hess doesn't care,'' they often complained.
</P>
<P>
   What those frustrated followers didn't know, or didn't want to
know, was that Leon Hess was more frustrated and more embarrassed
than they were, that he cared more than they did. The Jets were his
team, exactly like Amerada Hess was his oil business. And anything
that is his, he cares about. Deeply.
</P>
<P>
   This is a man who started out in the oil business in Perth
Amboy, N.J., in 1933 during the Depression by driving his father's
fuel delivery truck, a man who was Gen. George S. Patton's
oil-supply officer for World War II troops, a man who now,
according to Forbes magazine, is worth $700 million.
</P>
<P>
   If Hess hadn't cared about the Jets, he would have sold the
franchise long ago.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the Jets' struggles made Hess care even more. In 1995,
when the Jets were 2-9 en route to 4-28 with Rich Kotite as coach,
he was asked if he was thinking about selling. He never hesitated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not at all,'' he said. ``This is one of the few pleasures I
get out of life, win or lose.''
</P>
<P>
   More often than not, it was lose. When Hess hired Kotite, he
made a rare appearance at a news conference and in a rare burst of
impatience, he blurted, ``I'm 80 years old; I want results now.''
He didn't get results with Kotite, but Parcells has quickly
produced results.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning the division,'' Hess said Sunday, ``is one of the
greatest thrills of my life, but we're not through.''
</P>
<P>
   Hess had watched last Saturday's game at his Park Avenue
apartment with Steve Gutman, the Jets president, and a few friends.
That evening he got a call from Frank Ramos, the Jets' director of
public relations, about the game ball and Sunday morning he talked
to Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just thankful,'' Hess continued, ``that Bill was able to
rally everyone together. He's a great man, a great coach. He took
us further faster than I ever thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Hess has been the Jets' sole owner since 1984, its principal
owner since 1976, a part owner since 1963 when he was part of the
group formed by the late David (Sonny) Werblin that purchased the
American Football League franchise known as the Titans and changed
the nickname to the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   When the 1968 Jets stunned the pro football realm by winning
Super Bowl III, Hess was there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe what I was watching,'' he recalled. ``It
was like David and Goliath.''
</P>
<P>
   But by 1976, when Hess took command as owner following the death
of Phil Iselin, the Jets were in disarray. Hess approved the hiring
of Walt Michaels, Joe Walton, Bruce Coslet and Pete Carroll as
coaches, then hired Kotite himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of those coaches were in over their head; I probably
kept them two or three years longer than I should have,'' he said,
reflecting. ``I had the idea the team could be run by committee,
but it's like business. You need a strong man.''
</P>
<P>
   When Parcells split with the Patriots' owner, Robert K. Kraft,
after the 1996 season, that ``strong man'' was available. Gutman's
hiring of Parcells as a consultant for a year evolved into the
Patriots' accepting draft choices in exchange for permitting
Parcells to become the Jets' coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill wanted to come back to New York,'' Hess said, alluding to
Parcells' two Super Bowl rings as the Giants coach and his northern
New Jersey background. ``He never promised me anything, he just
worked hard; we have something in common.''
</P>
<P>
   And whatever Parcells has wanted to help turn the Jets around,
Hess has provided _ a bubble for indoor practice, new grass and
artificial turf practice fields, new weight-lifting rooms and
medical rooms, a computer link to the NFL offices.
</P>
<P>
   And now Parcells has provided Hess with a first-place team and a
Super Bowl XXXIII contender.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't win another game,'' Hess said Sunday, ``Bill
doesn't owe us anything.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the Jets win a bigger game than last Saturday's, Leon
Hess will get another game ball. &QL;

DOLPHINS STILL NEED A WIN AGAINST BRONCOS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Some of the marquee value of Monday night's game between
the Denver Broncos and Miami Dolphins is gone, courtesy of last
week's upset of the Broncos by the Giants. Yet the game is not
lacking for drama, at least with the Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   With Denver's first loss after a 13-0 start, members of the 1972
Dolphins no longer have to put a hex on the Broncos to remain the
only team in National Football League history to go through a
season unbeaten.
</P>
<P>
   Miami must win Monday night to assure itself a wild-card playoff
spot because the New York Jets clinched the American Football
Conference East title last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Miami (9-5) has been dealing with the effects of its loss to
those same Jets a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``That one has stuck with us a while,'' linebacker Robert Jones
said. ``But we realize if we beat Denver, that's what everybody
will be talking about, and the loss to the Jets will be
forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the Broncos have clinched home-field advantage throughout
the playoffs, Monday night's game for them has been reduced to one
of pride and momentum contrasted to Miami's urgency.
</P>
<P>
   Denver Coach Mike Shanahan has shown no inclination to ease off
the throttle, though he most likely will not take any chance with
the standout defensive end Neil Smith, who is healing from an
abdominal pull.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Broncos said they felt the loss lifted a burden off
their shoulders and that the team could now focus more on repeating
as Super Bowl champions than challenging the 1972 Dolphins' 17-0
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure was building each week,'' Smith said. ``I'm glad
it's over. We have to go on with business.''
</P>
<P>
   This will be only the second regular-season meeting between the
teams, and the first here. Miami won by 30-26 in 1985 when John
Elway and Dan Marino were mere third-year pros.
</P>
<P>
   Now, of course, they are two of the most decorated quarterbacks
in league history. Never before has there been an NFL game between
two quarterbacks who have compiled such glittering statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Marino (58,238) and Elway (50,986) are the only two 50,000-yard
career passers. They have combined for 699 passing touchdowns,
including Marino's 403, and have totaled nearly 9,000 completions.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the fanfare about their matchup, Marino comes into
this game dragging some not-so-subtle shackles. He is acutely
mindful that he must temper his passing to accommodate Miami's
sporadic running game. After Marino threw 57 times in the loss to
the Jets, Coach Jimmy Johnson bluntly said that forsaking the
running game had been a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Miami, which has used nearly an equal split between running and
passing this season, is 2-8 in games in which Marino has thrown at
least 51 times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early in the year, people talked about us winning ugly, but
those games look pretty now,'' the offensive coordinator Kippy
Brown said. ``We're going to get back to doing what we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is Denver that will offer the game's top runner. Terrell
Davis needs 199 yards in the last two regular-season games to
become only the fourth NFL rusher to reach 2,000 in a season,
joining O.J. Simpson, Eric Dickerson and Barry Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``On film, you can see why he has so many yards,'' the Dolphins'
Jones said. ``He can see from tackle to tackle, and that's why his
change of direction is so good.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins built up some anger for this game late last week
after Denver had nine players named to the Pro Bowl against only
one for them _ defensive tackle Tim Bowens, a mystery pick since
even he acknowledged he did not deserve it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little extra motivation, because we can get a little
respect here,'' said linebacker Zach Thomas, whose 149 tackles lead
Miami. ``But we had a meeting to throw a lot of that behind us.
What it comes down to, our total focus is we need to win this
game.''

SPIRITUAL ADVISER ASKS PRAYERS FOR CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS FARRAGHER AND DANIEL VASQUEZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEXINGTON, Mass. _ Less than 24 hours after the US House of
Representatives marked the Clinton presidency with the stain of
scandal, his spiritual adviser stood in a house of worship Sunday
and implored heaven for help.
</P>
<P>
   His head bowed and his eyes shut, the Rev. Gordon MacDonald,
senior pastor of Grace Chapel, said the impeached president and the
country he still leads need prayers, not partisanship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pray for the president, for his wisdom, and for those who
advise him that they may understand what steps to take in the
coming days that will be best for our country,'' said MacDonald,
one of three clergymen on the spiritual team Clinton assembled in
the wake of the Monica S. Lewinsky scandal that culminated in
Saturday's impeachment vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pray for those in the Senate and the House, for those who
will have to sit in judgment in the coming weeks about the future
of our president and we ask, oh God, that men and women will rise
to the highest possible level of statesmanship; that partisanship
of any kind will be set aside and that wisdom will prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   Divine guidance was sought from pulpits and church lecterns
throughout the region Sunday after the House's historic
condemnation of Clinton, whose friendship with MacDonald stems from
the 1988 book the pastor wrote about his own adultery and his
repentance for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``All around us there is anger, chaos, and destruction,''
Cardinal Bernard Law said Sunday during a crowded Mass at the
Cathedral of the Holy Cross, referring to the bombing of Iraq and
what he termed character assassination on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Law spoke of the pain and costs associated with the prolonged US
embargo against Iraq and recent bomb attacks, but also focused on
the Clinton crisis, saying there is no room for polarized
bipartisan politics. He asked Americans to have faith in a
political process ``that allows us to deal with these serious
charges.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Impeachment is now a fact,'' Law said. ``This is a painful
time for us as a nation. But we can survive it and be strengthened
by it.''
</P>
<P>
   In Oxford, the Rev. Gerard P. Walsh, pastor of St. Roch Roman
Catholic Church, urged his parishioners to use the Christmas season
as a salve for the healing of the national spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's turmoil in Washington and we should draw together,''
Walsh said after services. ``People need to be reconciled. We are
now a splintered nation. People feel very strongly one way or the
other on this and we need that process of healing, especially at
this point when people have become so polarized.
</P>
<P>
   ``Christmas is a time to heal. We need to put this behind us. .
.''
</P>
<P>
   After an hour-long service of Christmas music in a brightly lit
sanctuary decorated with holiday greens and poinsettia, MacDonald
said his congregation of 2,500 _ New England's largest evangelical
church _ has been ``torn up'' by the scandal and its fallout.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fabric of unity of our country is under great threat,''
MacDonald said. ``We're a people who believe in prayer, so we've
got to pray that God is going to allow this process over the months
to provincially work out to the best for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   MacDonald, who said he has spoken with Clinton ``quite
frequently'' in recent weeks, added: ``I'm just heartbroken this
weekend watching the lives of people broken _ and the hatred. I
don't like the partisanship and I just feel that a lot of things
are out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   MacDonald, a much sought-after motivational speaker, is joined
in Clinton's accountability circle by the Rev. Tony Campolo, a
professor at Eastern College in Pennsylvania, and the Rev. J.
Philip Wogaman, pastor of the United Methodist Church where the
first family frequently worships.
</P>
<P>
   ``On both sides of the aisle, we're watching the consequences of
people's philosophies and the tragedy of the consequences of
people's acts,'' MacDonald said. ``It's a great theological lesson
to me. Some day we'll be able to talk about this and see the end of
the story.''

COLUMBUS RETURNS TO PUERTO RICO AS 600-TON TOURISM GAMBLE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Ohio)  (nk) 
 By MIREYA NAVARRO 
  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CATANO, Puerto Rico _ Police Officer Adan Vargas Maldonado tried
to picture what a 30-story-tall bronze statue of Christopher
Columbus would look like.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't imagine it beautiful, but attractive, yes,'' he said
as he kept watch on the mammoth head and other statue parts, strewn
about in a park, awaiting assembly. ``It'll be something
supernatural for Puerto Rico.''
</P>
<P>
   Such lukewarm views are an improvement over the reaction in
almost every U.S. city that has considered but rejected the statue
by Zurab K. Tsereteli, a Russian sculptor who gave it to the United
States as a gift of friendship in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   In South Florida, cities like Miami Beach and Fort Lauderdale
passed on erecting the 600-ton monument because of its size and the
costs involved, about $25 million for shipping and assembling. In
Columbus, Ohio, which debated adding the statue of Columbus at the
helm of a ship to its other memorials in honor of the explorer,
some nicknamed it ``Chris Kong,'' and American Indians said it
glorified someone who represented ``500 years of genocide.''
</P>
<P>
   But where some see a colossal headache, others see a potential
moneymaker. The statue is about to settle down in Catano, a city of
36,000 better known for flooding, industrial pollution and playing
ugly duckling to San Juan, its neighbor across San Juan Bay &UR; .  &LR; But
Catano's leaders soon expect the city to blossom as an
international tourist attraction.
</P>
<P>
   Plans call for the statue, which would rise here 295 feet above
sea level, to become the centerpiece of a waterfront tourism
complex that would also feature a pedestrian mall, restaurants,
shops and boutiques inspired by Epcot Center in Orlando, Fla.
Proponents say the complex, a short ferry ride from the cruise
ships that anchor at San Juan Harbor, could draw 500,000 visitors a
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to put Catano on the map of the world,'' said
Sergio Cordero, a Miami consultant who is manager of the statue
project here. ``People will recognize it like they recognize the
Eiffel Tower or the Statue of Liberty.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone in Catano thinks it will be money well spent, given
the city's municipal problems, but officials are trying to win
people over by focusing on the future.
</P>
<P>
   The unlikely but impressive journey from Russia to Catano of the
monument titled ``Birth of the New World'' began last February,
when Anibal Marrero, the vice president of the Puerto Rico Senate,
heard that the statue needed a home. Marrero, whose district
includes Catano, said he thought it fitting that the gift be given
to Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory on which, unlike the mainland,
Columbus actually set foot during his second voyage in 1493.
</P>
<P>
   (Puerto Rico's national anthem includes the lines: ``When to its
beaches Columbus arrived, with admiration he cried: `Oh! Oh! Oh!
This is the pretty land I'm looking for.' '')
</P>
<P>
   Marrero, who said the statue honored the man's daring spirit
rather than his conquest, said he also envisioned new jobs and an
economic bonanza for Catano. The city has one of the most majestic
waterfront views on the island and is already the site of a popular
tourist attraction, the Bacardi rum plant. But it does have
problems, Marrero said, including an unemployment rate of about 13
percent and a disproportionate number of public housing projects.
</P>
<P>
   After enlisting the support of Catano's mayor, Edwin Rivera
Sierra, who earmarked $3 million to bring the statue's parts to the
island, the two officials put a project team together and exchanged
visits with Tsereteli, whose large-scale art is found all over
Moscow and in cities like New York.
</P>
<P>
   Tsereteli had presented small replicas of the statue to both
President Bush and President Clinton and, last September, to the
Organization of American States, on the occasion of its 50th
anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   The statue depicts Columbus standing at the historically
inaccurate wheel of his ship (maritime historians say ships from
Columbus' day steered by a bar directly connected to the rudder),
his right arm raised in a greeting. Three sails snap in the wind
behind him while the three caravels are positioned on a map of the
New World at the base.
</P>
<P>
   The statue arrived here in more than 2,500 pieces, some from St.
Petersburg, Russia, and some from the United States, where the
11-ton head had unceremoniously languished for six years in a Fort
Lauderdale warehouse after South Florida turned the statue down. By
contrast, when the head got here last October, a welcoming
delegation from Catano was waiting at the dock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like a child receiving a gift from Santa Claus,''
Sierra, whose statue-related exploits have been the subject of both
ridicule and song, told The San Juan Star as he wiped away tears.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the mayor's constituents, however, are extremely angry
over the statue's cost, which officials plan to cover through a $30
million private bond issue. The officials say Catano would only
profit, and any expenses related to the statue would be reimbursed,
but residents wonder why a monument is the focus when many of their
streets still flood every time it rains and some neighborhoods lack
sewage hookups.
</P>
<P>
   ``That money should be used for necessities, like more hospital
services, more police officers,'' said Rafael Roman, an 84-year-old
Catano native who was talking with friends one recent evening in
the town plaza, festive with Christmas lights. ``That statue is not
going to resolve anything sitting there. It's throwing taxpayers'
money into the trash can.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Catano resident, Luis Ortiz, 47, said, ``We're just
praying Catano doesn't sink.''
</P>
<P>
   But if visits to the park where the statue pieces rest under
24-hour guard are any indication, Catano got itself a hit. Officer
Vargas Maldonado said visitors from all over the island had already
come looking for ``la cabeza de Colon'' _ the head of Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   One recent afternoon, several parents with children stopped by
to see and touch. ``It's a well-done job,'' said Marco Prieto, 8,
who visited with his father and two brothers. ``The mayor has shown
great intelligence.''
</P>
<P>
   His 12-year-old brother, Giovanni, reported excitedly, ``The
nose has holes and everything.''
</P>
<P>
   The statue has an enthusiastic ally in Gov. Pedro J. Rossello.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just picture an imposing structure at the entrance of San
Juan Bay which can be seen by air, sea and land and which will be a
landmark in United States territory where Christopher Columbus
actually landed,'' the governor said.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly by the sculptor and a crew of about 50 Russians is
expected to start in mid-1999, pending environmental and other
permits. Officials say they had to rush the transportation of the
statue before all viability studies were completed because of the
fear that political instability in Russia might prevent a move.
</P>
<P>
   Unveiling is scheduled for the anniversary of the first sighting
of the New World, Oct. 12, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a beautiful monument,'' Sierra said in an interview on
Thursday. ``I have no doubt it's going to be a success.''

   &QL;  PA LAWMAKERS MIRROR CONGRESS IN VOTES TO IMPEACH CLINTON
</P>
<P>
   By Lisa Fine
</P>
<P>
   States News Service
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Dec. 19, -- Pennsylvania Republican Congress members
voted to impeach President Clinton, despite protest from embattled
Democrats in the state delegation, who walked out briefly with
their party in protest.
</P>
<P>
   Mirroring Congress, lawmakers from the state voted essentially
along party lines to impeach President Clinton for obstruction of
justice and lying under oath about his relationship with Monica
Lewinsky. Rep. Chaka Fattah, D-Philadelphia started the tumultuous
day by speaking out against character assassination-style politics.
His remarks followed Speaker-designate Bob Livingston's resignation
at the heels of admitting extra-marital affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are seeing is the politics of personal destruction,''
Fattah said. ``How many other speakers have to resign? It is an
example of the hatred that eats at the Republican party that led us
to this impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Philadelphia, who voted to impeach Clinton,
said it was as a ``sad day for the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a difficult day for me and my colleagues,'' Weldon
said. ``I am not convinced that the President's act of perjury mean
that he should be removed from office.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he believes under the constitution, the House of
Representatives does not have the power to censure a president.
</P>
<P>
   Fattah was joined by Reps. Bob Borski, D-Philadelphia, John
Murtha, D-Johnstown, and Bob Brady, D-Philadelphia, when members of
the party walked out after Republican House leaders denied
considering a censure alternative to impeachment. The Democrats
streamed outside the Capitol and walked in front of onlookers,
cheering visitors and television cameras. Shortly after that, they
returned to the House floor to vote on the articles of impeachment.
``It was the only way to visually show our displeasure,'' Fattah
said. ``Many from our state delegation joined me out there.'' With
one member bucking party lines, several remaining undecided until
the final hour, and others adhering fiercely to party loyalty,
Pennsylvania's delegation became a cross-section of Congress in the
impeachment of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   After the vote, outgoing Rep. Paul McHale, D-Lehigh Valley, who
was the first Democrat in the House of Representatives to call for
the resignation of the president, said the right thing was done for
the nation. ``The system worked today as our founding fathers
intended,'' said McHale, who voted for impeachment. ``On a personal
level, I'm drained. I voted for Clinton twice. I had few policy
differences with him. Had he admitted what he had done and come
forward with it, I would have perhaps voted differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Bud Shuster, R-Everett, supported impeachment for the second
time in his Congressional career.

   UNITED NATIONS _ After four days of air strikes against Iraq,
the Security Council plans on Monday to begin assessing the damage
done to all three legs on which its relations with Baghdad stand _
economic sanctions, arms inspections and a relief program designed
to aid Iraqis suffering under an economic embargo.
</P>
<P>
   With President Clinton under impeachment and American attention
diverted from the coming days and weeks of debate in the council,
the British and French are expected to take the lead.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty the council faces is that more than eight years
of painstakingly negotiated resolutions have linked the sanctions,
inspections and ``oil for food'' plan in a cat's cradle of demands
and restrictions that will be hard to separate.
</P>
<P>
   The first step might be a full review of United Nations
relations with Iraq, diplomats here say, although even that is
likely to be put off until the new year.
</P>
<P>
   Baghdad has long sought such a review, which may now be the only
route to finding a consensus on how to deal with President Saddam
Hussein now that he has said, again, that he will no longer work
with arms inspectors under the existing system.
</P>
<P>
   After the latest campaign of bombing and missile strikes, a
review may create new pitfalls for the United States and Britain,
which were hoping that such a hearing might buttress their case to
leave sanctions in place.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions, particularly an embargo limiting the sale of
Iraqi oil, have been the United States' prime tool in keeping Iraq
isolated and Saddam parted from revenue that could be put toward
rebuilding Iraq's weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   Already support for the sanctions, long challenged on humane
grounds, appears to have eroded further. Sunday in Paris, President
Jacques Chirac of France called for a prompt lifting of the oil
embargo. His country's major oil companies have for years been
eager to return to work in Iraq, although record low oil prices
make this less attractive now.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is expected to share the French position on lifting the
oil embargo, which is directly linked to certification by the U.N.
Special Commission that there are no more prohibited arms or the
means to make them. The commission, known as Unscom, has been
charged since 1991 with disarming Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   So while Chirac said in a statement that it was time for a
``fundamental review'' of relations with Iraq, he also underscored
that it must proceed from the understanding that arms controls will
continue, along with some supervision of Iraqi expenditures from
the sale of oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``The international community must be able to carry out
effective monitoring of Iraqi arms and any development of them,''
Chirac said. ``This means fresh organization, fresh methods.''
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov of Russia was also looking
ahead. Sunday in New Delhi, where he is on an official visit, he
said his concern was that a political solution be found so that air
strikes would not be repeated.
</P>
<P>
   No member of the Security Council is willing to say
categorically that Iraq has answered all outstanding questions
regarding its banned arms programs, but Russia and France, with
growing support from council members like Brazil and Kenya, have
argued that all of the missing pieces may never be found.
</P>
<P>
   These members are beginning to agree that it is time to close
the books on active, kick-down-the-doors inspections and switch to
long-term monitoring. That would trigger the lifting of the oil
embargo.
</P>
<P>
   The International Atomic Energy Agency, which monitors nuclear
programs around the world and is composed largely of career
international bureaucrats, has already laid the groundwork for
closing the nuclear file, which has made it very popular with the
Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
   Baghdad now demands that if inspections of any kind are to
resume, the UNSCOM must be restructured to be more like the atomic
agency. If that is done, some diplomats say they believe that Iraq
can be persuaded to agree to some kind of future monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   But independent arms control experts say such inspection would
be meaningless, and in any case Iraqi leaders said again last week
that sanctions have to end first.
</P>
<P>
   While the Clinton administration understands that sanctions
cannot be sustained forever, it still argues _ in increasing
isolation here _ that Iraq has to do even more than account for all
of its weapons before they can be lifted.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At the center of the inspection debate is Richard Butler, the
executive chairman of UNSCOM. Iraq has made clear for more than a
year that it does not want to work with him. Last week Russia
formally called for his dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   Now, even among Butler's supporters, there are those who ask
whether inspections can ever resume in a hostile Iraq with him in
charge and whether pragmatism might not dictate that he be
replaced.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on Saturday, Butler said allowing the Iraqis to
emerge from a bombing campaign free of international supervision of
their weapons programs or with a new system tailored to their
demands ``just doesn't make sense.'' Publicly, the United States
supports Butler completely.
</P>
<P>
   But Scott Ritter, the former concealment expert who quit UNSCOM
in August in disgust at U.S. policy, said that the Clinton
administration had in fact weakened Butler time and again.
</P>
<P>
   He said the most recent incident came last week, when White
House officials put pressure on Butler to release his latest report
on Iraqi noncompliance so that it could be used as the trigger for
military action.
</P>
<P>
   ``They decided to use Richard Butler and UNSCOM in this
fashion,'' Ritter said, ``and now they have to pay the price.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem that Washington and others face now is how to
continue policing and undermining Saddam's hope of a renewed
weapons program without sanctions or effective inspections. And if
sanctions go, the ``oil for food'' program will go with them,
unless another system is devised to control how Iraq spends its oil
money.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis rejected for almost five years the offer of the ``oil
for food'' plan, under which they now pump 1.8 billion barrels of
oil a day and can buy a wide range of goods and equipment with it
under U.N. supervision.
</P>
<P>
   The program has been severely disrupted in the last week because
of the military strikes, with more than 100 relief workers
withdrawn from the country and scores of trucks carrying food,
medicine and spare parts for the oil industry backed up at the
border. A U.N. official, Prakash Shah, said on Sunday that the
workers would return to Baghdad by Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   All Security Council members acknowledge that Saddam, who has
always been permitted to import medicine and food, chose not to.
And despite the embargo, huge quantities of marble found their way
to Iraq for dozens of presidential palaces, the Baghdad police got
new Korean cars, officials of Saddam's party bought computers and
smugglers stocked stores in fashionable neighborhoods with Western
consumer goods.
</P>
<P>
   Unrestricted new income, many diplomats here fear, now more than
ever, would be sunk directly into rebuilding weapons.

ISSUES IMPACT GOP PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFULS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two conflicting messages about sex and politics
have emerged from the extraordinary events of this past weekend,
and they could have a direct effect on Campaign 2000, particularly
the Republican presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   First, members of both parties seemed to agree that they wanted
to put the ``politics of personal destruction'' behind them. That
led some analysts to conclude that candidates in the next election
should have less fear that their opponents will try to make an
issue out of their personal and sexual lives.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, though, the resignation of Speaker-designate
Robert L. Livingston indicated conservative Republicans may insist
that GOP candidates pass a ``marital fidelity test,'' as one party
member put it. While plenty of Republicans decried Livingston's
resignation, it was widely hailed within the party as necessary
because he had committed adultery.
</P>
<P>
   Underlying these crosscurrents are polls showing the vast
majority of Americans are upset with the Republican Party for the
way it pushed the impeachment of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be retribution and the retribution is going
to be at the polling place,'' Clinton politicalstrategist James
Carville said Sunday on NBC's ``Meet the Press.'' ``We are going to
storm the polling places in 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   While Carville's prediction was partisan, there are GOP fears of
a backlash, particularly against those who led the impeachment
effort. That may improve the chances of the party's presumed
presidential front-runner, Texas Governor George W. Bush, whose
``outsider'' credentials may be enhanced because he can argue that
he played no role in the impeachment fights.
</P>
<P>
   But some Republicans privately wonder whether these same events
will convince Bush to stay out of the race. He has said he doesn't
know whether he wants to subject his family to the scrutiny and
pressure that would inevitably follow. While the odds are still
good that he will run, surprises seem the order of the day and
prognostication is becoming an increasingly tough business, given
what happened with Livingston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we going to have a new test if someone wants to run for
public office: Are you now or have you ever been an adulterer?''
Representative Jerrold Nadler, a New York Democrat, asked during
the impeachment debate, reflecting a growing concern among many
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   These questions are not new. They began in earnest when a
reporter asked Democratic presidential candidate Gary Hart in 1987
whether he had committed adultery, and Hart declined to answer. But
such questions utimately drove Hart from the race and played a
major role in the 1992 presidential campaign, when Gennifer Flowers
said she had an affair with Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton denied the story until last January, when he admitted
having had sex with Flowers, once. At the same time, however,
Clinton said in a January deposition in the Paula Jones sexual
harassment case that he did not have sexual relations with former
White House intern Monica S. Lewinsky, a statement which set in
motion the events leading to his impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time you think it can't get worse, it does,'' said Paul
Taylor, the former Washington Post reporter who asked Hart the
adultery question, and who now runs the nonprofit Alliance for
Better Campaigns. ``It has to be a frightening prospect if you are
a candidate for high office in this country to have to calibrate
how intrusively the popular media culture is going to probe in your
private life.''
</P>
<P>
   The irony of all this is that polls show the vast majority of
voters have taken Clinton's misleading statements about
extra-marital affairs into account and still support him, even as
GOP leaders on Capitol Hill have taken the same information and
decided to make it the centerpiece of their agenda. While
Republicans point out that they impeached Clinton for perjury and
obstruction of justice, and not for having sex outside his
marriage, the party's conservative wing underscored its concern
about adultery by hailing Livingston's decision to resign.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is important for the GOP presidential race because
the party's candidate is expected to be chosen during a compressed
primary campaign in February and March 2000, which is likely to be
controlled by the party's conservative base.
</P>
<P>
   As the impeachment effort and the resignation of two Republican
House speakers in the past two months demonstrated, conservatives
hold sway over the party. Some have already raised questions about
Bush's ideological credentials, which they consider too moderate.
He has called himself a ``compassionate conservative,'' a label
likely to be more helpful if he gets to the general election than
it would be during a primary campaign.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush were to pull out of the race, it would create a
free-for-all among other contenders, most of whom stand to his
right. These include Senator John Ashcroft of Missouri, former vice
president Dan Quayle, publisher Steve Forbes, and former Reagan
aide Gary Bauer of the Family Research Council. Another likely
candidate, former education secretary Lamar Alexander, calls
himself a conservative but is not arguing too strongly with those
who see him as a moderate, acknowledging he prefers not to discuss
abortion unless he is asked about it.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle, in a recent interview, said Republicans did poorly in
the 1998 midterm elections because they focused too much on
Clinton. While he said Clinton should be impeached, Quayle added
that the party has to stand for much more. As it stands now,
however, Republicans may spend months focused on the president's
trial, leaving even less time to push a GOP agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost this last campaign because we did not focus on the
issues,'' Quayle said. ``We did not communicate directly what we
are willing to do. To compound that, there is a tendency to draw
the wrong lessons.''
</P>
<P>
   Quayle said one wrong lesson is that the GOP only needs to be
more pragmatic in order to be successful. ``Pragmatism is not a
platform,'' Quayle said. ``Pragmatism is not an agenda. We need to
be conservative. We are a conservative party.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, the events of the past weekend could
help Vice President Al Gore, who is seen as loyal to Clinton's
policies while not having many of his personal problems. Already,
Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska has dropped out of the race, in part
due to Gore's political and fund-raising strength.
</P>
<P>
   Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, meanwhile, plans to ponder
the matter during a Christmas vacation at his Sun Valley home,
combining a ski trip with family discussions about whether he
should run for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry said in a recent interview that he is considering setting
up an exploratory committee, which would enable him to raise money
for a presidential campaign, and he plans to visit the first-caucus
state of Iowa in January. He said he expects to make a decision in
January or early February at the latest.
</P>
<P>
   Former senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey and Senator Paul
Wellstone of Minnesota also are exploring bids for the Democratic
nomination. House minority leader Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri
is expected to pass so he can focus on a party takeover of the
House in 2000 and his own dream of becoming speaker.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's strategy for survival depends
on the differences between the Senate and the House, differences
intended by the framers of the Constitution and at least as evident
today as they were when the Senate acquitted President Andrew
Johnson in 1868.
</P>
<P>
   The constitutional difference is obvious. In terms of
impeachment, on Saturday it took a simple majority of the House to
impeach, but it will take a two-thirds majority of the Senate to
convict if the trial goes to a verdict. The 67-vote requirement, in
a Senate with only 55 Republicans, invites the censure solution so
devoutly desired by the White House.
</P>
<P>
   But the political differences are as important. The Senate's
considerable sense of self-importance and dignity makes many
members fear a trial that would have to deal with the physical
details of Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   And the negotiating process needed to agree on something murkier
than ``guilty'' or ``not guilty'' is at home in the Senate. Its
rules emphasize the rights of individual senators and invite
compromise. Effective leadership there is the art of herding cats.
Senators who get things done make deals across party lines to
succeed. In the House, majority parties bully those in the
minority. Senators also have to represent constituents of the other
party; in the House, partisan gerrymandering has made it possible
to play to only one side.
</P>
<P>
   But there was an air in Washington _ as in the nation _ that
something had gone off the rails this weekend. With articles of
impeachment voted by scant partisan margins, 228 to 206 and 221 to
212, it seemed like a European parliament in a crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats accused the House Republican majority of a naked
political power play to undo the election of a president they
despised. Republicans insisted that that was nonsense, that if
Clinton was removed from office by the Senate they would just be
left with another Democrat, Al Gore, as president.
</P>
<P>
   And Rep. Jim Leach of Iowa, a reluctant vote for impeachment,
said on Sunday that most Republicans assumed that if Clinton was
ousted, the Democrats ``would be dramatically benefited.''
</P>
<P>
   But if they were not making political calculations _ and there
is little evidence that most Republicans did not take their
responsibility seriously _ the House may reflect something at least
as bad as naked ambition. Maybe worse.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the House that was displayed to the nation on Saturday
seemed to represent an extreme level of disagreement.
</P>
<P>
   To one faction, it was obvious that the president had committed
perjury and obstructed justice, and no less transparent that these
were offenses requiring his impeachment, trial and removal from
office.
</P>
<P>
   To the other, the offenses may have seemed likely, if not
proven, but the crimes fell well short of the standard needed for
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   When only 17 representatives, 12 Republicans and 5 Democrats,
dissented from the party line as they did on the charge of
obstruction of justice, these differing views reflect the
fundamental partisanship of the House, gone to extreme.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Ross K. Baker of Rutgers University called Saturday's
votes ``an authentic expression of the polarization of the
congressional districts.'' He added, ``Both parties have been
driven down to their base, their most passionate, most committed,
most zealous voters.''
</P>
<P>
   This House seems as though it cannot talk to itself, like a
parliament in a country with two official languages but no
functioning simultaneous translation system.
</P>
<P>
   For outsiders who try to translate, the fervent serial
speechmaking left the utterly political interpretation as the
easiest analysis. But plainly one underlying difference was that
Republicans were more upset by the moral and character issues that
underlay the accusation of perjury than were Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   And Democrats, who succeeded Republicans as the suspicious,
oppressed minority after the 1994 midterm elections, were more
upset than were Republicans by the methods of the independent
counsel, Kenneth Starr, and the House Judiciary Committee, which
accepted his evidence and interpretation unquestioningly.
</P>
<P>
   Those same general inclinations will show in the Senate, though
probably not as dramatically. The Senate is indeed more partisan
than it used to be. As minority leader in 1993, Bob Dole vowed to
block Clinton from passing almost anything that his party could
filibuster. Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, a Democrat who is the
minority leader today, has profited from Dole's example. And when
House Republicans who learned congressional obstructionism at the
feet of Newt Gingrich have gotten elected to the Senate, they have
changed it a bit.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Senate seems to change them more. Even Rick Santorum
of Pennsylvania, perhaps the most strident representative to come
to the Senate in recent years, seems to be mellowing as his Senate
tenure grows.
</P>
<P>
   George Washington, who attended the Constitutional Convention,
is said to have explained the purpose of the Senate, indirectly
elected to six-year terms, to Thomas Jefferson, who did not attend,
in this fashion:
</P>
<P>
   Saying the point was to have one more deliberative body than a
House elected by the people every two years, Washington he said,
``We pour legislation into the Senate saucer to cool it.''
</P>
<P>
   That difference worked for Andrew Johnson in 1868, when the
Senate waded through a long trial and heard evidence and acquitted
him after the House, in a fit of partisan passion over
Reconstruction, had voted impeachment.

 &HT;    Despite tough loss, Eagles' future bright
 &HT;    By Earnest Reese
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The morning after his top-ranked team suddenly became
fumble-prone and more porous than usual on defense in suffering a
55-43 loss to Massachusetts in the Division I-AA championship game,
Georgia Southern coach Paul Johnson was trying to put the past
behind while looking to the future.
</P>
<P>
   According to Johnson, who guided Georgia Southern to a 14-0
record and to the brink of the school's fifth national title before
Saturday's collapse at Finley Stadium in Chattanooga, offseason
efforts will be made to strengthen the defense.
</P>
<P>
   But against UMass (12-3), which converted seven Georgia Southern
turnovers into 31 points, no big defensive stops likely would have
helped bail out an offense that self-destructed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to get to the point where we're more balanced _
where our defense is more in line with our offense,'' Johnson said.
``I'm not saying that because of Saturday. We've been inconsistent
(on defense) all season.''
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles, younger and more inexperienced on defense, were
particularly vulnerable at the linebacker spots. Because of
injuries, only one linebacker called upon to start the last few
games was on the two-deep chart at the top of the season. And it
never stopped UMass tailback Marcel Shipp, who gained 244 of UMass'
303 rushing yards.
</P>
<P>
   With the return of starters Daryl Morrell and Larry Rogers, the
growth and development of freshman Michael Youngblood, and the
addition of two players who were redshirted this season, that part
of the defense will be much improved next season, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lose only three starters on defense,'' Johnson said.
``We'll get those young linebackers, three defensive linemen and
two secondary players we redshirted.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Southern's offense, spearheaded by junior quarterback
Greg Hill and fullback Adrian Peterson, was its usual high-octane
self. But what was different for the Eagles on Saturday were the
turnovers. Hill's 228-yard, two-touchdown effort, along with
Peterson's 161 yards and two-TD performance, was overshadowed by
the collective seven turnovers between them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like a psychiatrist down there on the sidelines talking
to those guys,'' Johnson said. ``Greg was looking like he was about
to cry any minute. I told him, `Hey, if it wasn't for you, we
wouldn't be here.' '' While Peterson set nearly 40 national,
conference and school records in rushing for 2,606 yards and 34
touchdowns, Hill accounted for 1,587 yards and 24 TDs on the ground

2 FIGHTERS ARE FURIOUS WITH REFEREES IN DEFEAT
</HEADLINE>
  (ms)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Hasim Rahman and Angel Manfredy both claimed to be
victims of crimes in the ring here last Saturday night. They both
believe they were robbed. But they would have a better chance of
getting assault charges filed against their opponents than theft
charges against the referees.
</P>
<P>
   Rahman, pinned between the second and third ropes, was being
pummeled by David Tua when the referee, Telis Assemenios, stepped
in to stop the heavyweight bout at 35 seconds of the 10th round.
Manfredy, also pinned against the ropes, was being battered by
Floyd Mayweather Jr. when the referee, Frank Santore, stopped their
bout at 2 minutes 47 seconds of the second round.
</P>
<P>
   Rahman (29-1) feels more victimized than Manfredy (24-3-1) does
because Rahman was leading on all three judges' scorecards when the
bout was stopped. And he had the presence of mind to react angrily
when Assemenios called a halt to the fight, although Rahman did a
zigzag stagger as he walked back to his corner. Manfredy seemed
dazed as he headed back to his corner. Later he said politics and
the desire to see Mayweather retain his World Boxing Council super
featherweight title played heavily in the referee's decision to
stop the bout.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a strong argument, considering that Mayweather
(19-0), a bronze medalist for the U.S. boxing team in the 1996
Olympics, landed 56 of 120 punches he threw in the two rounds and
landed 45 of 86 power punches, according to CompuBox statistics.
Manfredy landed just 19 of 86 punches thrown and connected with
just three jabs.
</P>
<P>
   The Rahman stoppage caused a greater furor among the fans, who
threw ice and debris into the ring after the bout was stopped.
Rahman was in control until a heavy-handed assault by Tua (33-1) in
the ninth round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Rahman was a premature stoppage,'' said Ron Scott
Stevens, a matchmaker for Rahman's promoter, Cedric Kushner. ``The
referee should have given Rahman a standing 8-count. If Rahman
didn't respond or couldn't go on, then the referee still would have
been in a position to stop it. It was a little league call in a
major league fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Nelson, Rahman's co-manager, said he planned to file a
protest with the International Boxing Federation, which sanctioned
the bout, on the grounds that the stoppage was premature and
because Tua had hit Rahman after the bell in the previous round.
That blow hurt Rahman, and it carried over into the next round. Had
Rahman's corner vehemently protested the late blow, it could have
got a five-minute rest for its fighter. After the punch, Tua's
trainer, Lou Duva, made a noisy protest in the ring to Assemenios
that the punch was not late.
</P>
<P>
   If the protest succeeds, then the IBF can order a rematch. But
if it fails, then Tua will become the No. 1 contender for the IBF
heavyweight championship, awaiting the outcome of the unification
bout between Evander Holyfield and Lennox Lewis on March 13 at
Madison Square Garden. With a World Boxing Association defense up
first for the Holyfield-Lewis winner, it could be early 2000 before
Tua gets a title shot.
</P>
<P>
   Mayweather stopped Manfredy in his tracks and put a crimp in his
plans to rule the 130-pound division. Mayweather, 21, is trained by
his father, Floyd Sr., once a promising welterweight, and his uncle
Roger Mayweather, a former world champion in two weight classes.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Arum, the promoter of Top Rank Boxing, has laid out an
ambitious schedule for Mayweather for the early part of 1999. He
will defend his title in his hometown of Grand Rapids, Mich., in
February. In April he will defend it against Julio Cesar Chavez,
and in June he will go against Goyo Vargas.

Edwards and Eric Tracy some quality time in the afternoons this
week, and Malone has been phoning it in from his squirrel hunting
trips in Arkansas lately, it doesn't make sense to keep the charade
going any longer. The novelty has done worn off. True, hiring him
made no sense in the first place, so this could be much ado about

HASTERT HAS EARLY HOLD ON HOUSE SPEAKER'S JOB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ His many supporters call him a peacemaker, a
bridge-builder, a mentor. The man in line to be the next speaker of
the House of Representatives, says one political ally, ``is a Teddy
bear.''
</P>
<P>
   But make no mistake. Representative J. Dennis Hastert can be a
grizzly.
</P>
<P>
   In a lightning-fast, one-day show of politicking, Hastert on
Saturday made himself the presumptive speaker for the next
Congress, only hours after the stunning resignation of the
Republicans' first choice, Robert L. Livingston. Hastert has not
formally been elected but any competitor would face long odds.
</P>
<P>
   His backers said Sunday that he has already accumulated enough
votes to ensure election. And Republicans across the ideological
spectrum said his team-building ability _ some still call him
``coach'' from his days as a wrestling teacher _ makes the Illinois
Republican the right man to lead a chamber that has been riven by
the impeachment of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't have to be the star,'' said Representative David
Hobson, Republican of Ohio. ``He doesn't have to be in the
limelight all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   With his gray hair and rumpled clothes, the former high school
history teacher can come across as a friendly uncle but he seems
unsuited to play the role of telegenic spokesman for the Republican
Party.
</P>
<P>
   He cuts a softer figure than the current speaker, the
often-bombastic Newt Gingrich. But those who work with him on
Capitol Hill say his conservatism and partisanship run just as
deep.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has the capacity to bring Republicans together,'' said
Ronald Pollack, executive director of the health-reform group
Families USA, ``but I've never seen him give an inch, actually, to
bipartisanship.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been responsible for keeping the Republicans organized
around their most important issues. But thus far, he has primarily
been a bridge-builder inside the Republican Party,'' said
Representative Edward Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, implying
Hastert's reach toward the Democrats has been minimal.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert, 56, wins high grades from conservative groups like the
Christian Coalition, which this year gave him a perfect rating for
conservative votes on such issues as limiting abortion rights and
ending legal protections for homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he is a close ally and senior deputy to House whip Tom
DeLay, a divisive figure who resuscitated the effort to impeach
Clinton when other leaders had abandoned it. Some Democrats even
privately question whether Hastert will act as a front-man for
DeLay, a charge both men's supporters deny.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you're speaker, you're speaker,'' Representative Tom
Ewing, another Illinois Republican, told the Associated Press.
``Denny is not considered to be a puppet.''
</P>
<P>
   A captain in many partisan battles, Hastert led the effort to
block the Democrats' ``Patient's Bill of Rights,'' which would have
imposed new requirements on health-maintenance organizations. And
he is a principal player in the GOP fight with the White House over
how to conduct the next census, a largely arcane dispute with high
stakes because it will determine the shape of new congressional
districts.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert was closeted in his Capitol office Sunday, working with
a group of lawmakers to solidify his support. His office claimed
135 ``firm public commitments'' to vote for him as speaker; he will
need only 112 of the 223 Republicans who will serve in the House
that convenes in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's making phone calls to thank his supporters,'' said
Hastert's spokesman, Peter Jeffries. ``He's taking a flood of phone
calls from well-wishers. He's signing a lot of thank-you notes.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastert, who is heading into his seventh House term, represents
a rust belt district outside Chicago that has been given new
vitality by high-tech companies. Before he entered the House, he
was active in state politics. He has two sons.
</P>
<P>
   As chief deputy whip, Hastert's job has been to count votes on
legislation and stay in touch with Republican lawmakers. Within
minutes of Livingston's surprise announcement Saturday that he
would not stand for speaker because of his marital infidelities,
Hastert's allies congregated in his office.
</P>
<P>
   Within an hour, Jeffries said, more than 40 members had
approached Hastert to support him for speaker. By 7 p.m., his team
claimed enough votes to give him the job.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have tentatively set Jan. 5 to choose the next
speaker. Gingrich technically remains in the job until Jan. 6, but
he withdrew from the daily tasks of managing the House soon after
the GOP suffered unexpected losses in the Nov. 3 election.
</P>
<P>
   If he becomes speaker, Hastert's ability to mediate among
Republicans will be tested, as his party is sorely strained by
rifts between conservatives and moderates. But a capacity to reach
out to Democrats could be even more important.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans will have only an 11-vote majority in the next
House, making it nearly certain that GOP leaders will have to work
with members of both parties to pass legislation.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Hastert has shown mostly that he can bring together his
Republican troops. Earlier this year, for example, Clinton and
Democratic lawmakers were rallying around the ``Patient's Bill of
Rights,'' which would give Americans new powers when fighting with
their health insurers for coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich and other Republicans opposed the legislation. But by
mid-year, GOP pollsters warned that the bill was popular, and that
Republicans might pay at the polls if they blocked it.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert had been leading the House Republican effort on health
care, and a panel led by him soon produced a GOP alternative.
Still, the Republican bill was roundly criticized by health-reform
advocates.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways, Hastert's bill went backwards,'' stripping
patients of rights they already have, said Pollack of Families USA.
He said Hastert ``has not demonstrated that he's a bipartisan
bridge. He seems to almost always find his way toward rather
conservative ground, without achieving some kind of a middle
ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Markey said he and Representative Thomas Bliley, a Virginia
Republican, were trying to find support this year for a bill that
brought greater competition to the satellite industry. The bill
failed in the Senate, but not before Hastert had rallied enough
Republicans to move it through the House Commerce Committee and the
full House.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, he's a masterful inside player,'' Markey said. ``He's a
consummate vote-counter.'' But so far, he has worked mostly within
the GOP ranks, Markey added.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more to the point _ as both parties enter a new year in
which the question of partisanship may be paramount _ was this
assessment Sunday by Representative J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, the
fourth-ranking House Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are times that you've got to draw a line in the sand,''
Watts said on ABC's ``This Week'' program. ``I don't think Dennis
Hastert will be afraid to do that . . . I hope no one mistakes his
kindness as a weakness.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As he sat in the House listening to Rep. Robert
Livingston say he would never be speaker, even ``the Hammer''
cried.
</P>
<P>
   Tom DeLay of Texas, the House majority whip, who considers his
aggressive nickname a compliment, had to stop several times and
take a breath to keep from weeping again during a floor speech on
Saturday as he said, ``There is no greater American in my mind, at
least today, than Bob Livingston,'' the Louisianan and the
designated House speaker who abruptly bowed out on Saturday over a
sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of a week in which Iraq was bombed, the president was
impeached and the designated speaker sidelined before he could even
take office, House Republicans were finding their hard-won victory
even more joyless than they had always promised it would be.
</P>
<P>
   All over the Capitol _ in the foyer off the House floor, in
members' private offices and Livingston's office, where members
gathered to offer their sympathy and support _ Republicans were
tearful and overwrought.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tillie Fowler of Florida said she and Livingston both cried
as she hugged him and ``told him he's one of the finest men I
know.'' Rep. Richard Baker of Louisiana, who proclaimed himself
``not a boo-hooer'' said he was upset, too. Rep. James Greenwood of
Pennsylvania became emotional in an interview. ``This is an
incredible day,'' he said, looking down. ``You have tears in your
eyes about the process'' of impeachment, and then along comes
another good reason to cry.
</P>
<P>
   It was not only Livingston's surprise announcement that was
distressing, members said. If any Republican was delighting in the
desired outcome _ the impeachment of President Clinton _ they were
not showing it. No, they felt only sadness for the country, they
said, even if the Democrats doubted their sincerity. There was also
some anxiety about the next Congress, and about the political
future. And certainly plain exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans had begun the week with a sense of unease as
they traveled back to Washington for what they thought would be a
week completely focused on impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Most just seemed to want to do their duty and leave for the
holidays. Even DeLay, who led the impeachment drive and professed
to have no qualms about the vote, said he felt sick last Tuesday,
though it was becoming clear that Republicans did have the votes to
impeach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tragedy,'' he said in his office on Tuesday evening,
and seemed very sorry indeed, though without remorse.
</P>
<P>
   Then, one day before the House was set to debate impeachment,
Clinton announced the bombing of Iraq. As Republicans filed into
Wednesday's caucus meeting to decide if and when to proceed with
impeachment, many were beside themselves. A few seemed too angry to
speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's manipulated our military and his advisers for his own
preservation,'' said Rep. Michael Oxley of Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the meeting room, some had the sense of being trapped in
a horrible, recurring dream where Bill Clinton, once again a few
inches from the edge of a cliff, gets a steadying hand from . . .
Saddam Hussein?
</P>
<P>
   Some members not only suspected the president was trying to buy
time, to figure some way out _ but worried that it might work. ``It
was unanimous that we should worry,'' said Rep. Todd Tiahrt of
Kansas, about whether support for impeachment would erode.
</P>
<P>
   And so, even after the group cooled off and decided, with near
unanimity, to allow Livingston to postpone the impeachment debate,
the majority decided they could wait no more than a day or two.
Rep. George Gekas of Pennsylvania said the options discussed on
Wednesday ranged only from ``full speed ahead to wait till
Monday.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Steve Largent of Oklahoma rose in the meeting to pray,
calming some and apparently annoying others. Rep. Wayne Gilchrest
of Maryland, a Vietnam veteran, said they should wait to show
respect for military families. And Rep. Herbert Bateman of Virginia
suggested that moving too fast could have political consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, members said, they wanted to spare Livingston the
embarrassment of a runaway conference. They wanted to help him
weather his first crisis, so they waited a day. But by then,
Livingston had other problems, and so did they.
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday, Livingston issued a statement, saying, ``During
my 33-year marriage to my wife, Bonnie, I have on occasion strayed
from my marriage.'' The words ``on occasion'' struck fear in some
colleagues. He was using the plural in referring to the affairs,
and after all they had been through with the careful language used
to describe improper behavior, that could not be a good sign.
Still, most members absorbed this new shock pretty quickly. They
wanted to support their friend _ and what is more, felt they had
to.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, after the Monica Lewinsky scandal _ and revelations
about affairs involving several other congressional Republicans,
some conservative members thought Livingston had been arrogant and
plain wrong not to have told them about his infidelities before
they chose him to replace Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   ``It probably would have changed the outcome'' of the leadership
race, said Rep. Zach Wamp of Georgia. ``Bob should have told us.''
</P>
<P>
   When the impeachment debate began on Friday, Republicans again
dared to hope that surely the worst was over. But by the time Wamp
told Livingston on Saturday morning that he might no longer have
the votes to be elected speaker, Livingston had already decided not
to stand for the post. Friends described Livingston's wife as
devastated.
</P>
<P>
   And so were House Republicans. After Livingston's announcement,
they gasped. Some buried their heads in their hands. A few followed
him, literally running off the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   Almost unanimously, they drew a distinction between the private
matter of an affair and the public act of perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Some were also spitting mad that he had been booed by some
colleagues across the aisle in the moments just before his
announcement. ``The Democrats were shameless,'' fumed Rep. Peter
Hoekstra of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   In House speeches before the impeachment vote, members on both
sides of the aisle were uncharacteristically humble, speaking of
their own frailty.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming, as member after member suggested, that there are
affairs as yet unrevealed, some of their speeches seemed to have an
element of ``Who's next?'' nervousness.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Peter King of New York, one of handful of moderates who
voted against impeachment, pleaded that the body count was too high
on both sides of the aisle. And those who disagreed with King on
impeachment seemed to find the landscape no less depressing.
</P>
<P>
   While still numb, they impeached the president in the least
surprising development of the day, then moved quickly to line up a
new Speaker, turning to Rep. Dennis Hastert of Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after one final bit of wrangling over whether to elect him
this week or next month, they chose the latter and got out of town
before anything else could happen.

   TIERRA AMARILLA, Chile _ Five months ago, the copper mine where
Mario Olivares had dug, drilled and hammered for the last six years
shut down under the pressure of collapsing world copper prices.
After getting a monthly salary of more than $400, he now earns less
than a dollar a day selling flavored ices from his wooden shack.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,000 miners have lost their jobs this year in this town
of 14,000 people set in the desert badlands of northern Chile. The
earnings of thousands more have been reduced by more than 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Strapped for money, the local government has been forced to cut
housing subsidies and hours at the local health clinic. Drug and
alcohol use are on the rise, local officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance at the local school on Saturdays to make up for class
time lost during a teachers strike has been surprisingly high,
administrators say, because the children want the free lunches.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family could use more food,'' said Olivares, 36, who has
begun looking for seasonal agricultural work at a far lower salary
than before. ``I see more poverty in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The changes in fortune for Olivares and Tierra Amarilla are a
direct result of the economic slowdown in Asia, which has pummeled
the prices of many commodities that are the economic lifeblood of
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   Chile has been South America's economic model for the last 20
years, with growth rates averaging more than 8 percent a year over
the last decade. The country led the way in privatizing inefficient
state-owned businesses, and its privatized pension system has been
adopted by Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, El Salvador, Mexico, Peru
and Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
   But now Chile's economic miracle is stumbling, mostly because
nearly 40 percent of its export earnings come from copper. From a
price of $1.19 per pound in June 1997, the price of copper on the
world market has declined to 65 cents a pound, its lowest level
since 1987. That has meant a loss of $1.5 billion in export
earnings in the first 10 months of this year.
</P>
<P>
   The effects could have been far worse had oil prices not also
tumbled, saving Chile more than $200 million over the same period.
Nevertheless, the signs of a painful adjustment are everywhere in a
country that has become increasingly middle class over the last
generation.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of cars, televisions, houses and apartments have dropped
sharply in the last few months. Sixty-five percent of those
questioned in a poll published last week said they would spend less
on presents this Christmas than they did last year. Distribucion y
Servicio, the country's largest supermarket chain and retailer,
originally intended to open nine new stores next year, but now
plans to open only two.
</P>
<P>
   The economy, which grew by more than 7 percent in 1997, will
grow by only 4 percent this year. That would not be bad if most of
the growth had not come before June.
</P>
<P>
   A zero-to-negative growth rate for the fourth quarter is
expected by most economists to remain constant for at least the
first half of 1999. Unemployment has increased to 6.9 percent from
6.5 percent in the last year, and government economists predict a
continuing deterioration to at least 8.5 percent by June.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of 1997, we predicted an 11 percent increase in
construction for this year,'' said Horacio Pavez Garcia, president
of the Chilean Chamber of Construction. ``We've had to change our
projections four times, and now we'll be lucky to reach a growth
rate of 1.5 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   But for all the bad news, a consensus has emerged among local
businessmen and economists, government officials and Wall Street
analysts: Chile should rebound in the second half of next year,
unless a Brazilian financial collapse shakes the entire South
American economy or if Gen. Augusto Pinochet's extradition
proceedings in London should set off political turbulence here.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The analysts note that the Chilean peso has remained stable, the
local stock market has revived in recent months and the Central
Bank has lowered interest rates several times over the last two
months, after several rate increases earlier in the year that
stalled the construction and retail sectors. While the flow of
foreign investment has slowed, Exxon and Procter and Gamble have
recently announced major new investments.
</P>
<P>
   And, unlike several Asian economies that have been shaken by the
collapses of weak banks, strong government regulation and the
emergence of many foreign banks in recent years have kept the
Chilean financial sector sound. Chile's percentage of past-due
loans to total loans is projected to be a modest 2 percent by the
end of the year, compared with 13 percent in Argentina and 5
percent in Brazil, according to a report by Santander Investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an economy that's decelerating very sharply,'' said
Jose de Gregorio, an economist at the University of Chile. ``But
overall, the country is strong. It's an open economy, there's low
corruption and the financial system remains strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, to the desert towns like Tierra Amarilla that
depend on small copper mines, a recovery looks like a mirage. Four
of eight local mining companies have closed in the last year here,
and a persistent drought has slowed a transition to grape farming.
</P>
<P>
   Domingo Cortes, 49, a copper miner, has seen his earnings drop
from $250 to $180 a month, forcing him to take up seasonal tomato
and onion farming to supplement his living.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always in debt,'' he said, while hammering rocks looking
for blue veins of copper. ``One month I pay the electricity bill,
another I pay the store. It will be a very different Christmas this
year. I had to tell my children they won't be getting presents.''

IMPEACHED PRESIDENT WILL BE ABLE TO GOVERN, AIDES SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With President Clinton impeached and facing a
Senate trial, the White House says he will be able to govern, even
with a Republican-controlled House that closed ranks to try to
remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton himself said he is ``still committed to working with
people of good faith and good will of both parties to do what's
best for our country.''
</P>
<P>
   But assuming he remains in office for the final two years of his
term, political analysts predict that issues that build legacies,
like overhauling Social Security or Medicare, are likely to elude
Clinton this year due to the lack of a shared perspective with the
Republican-led Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that political gulf and the brittle feelings that exist
following impeachment, Clinton's senior aides Sunday expressed
confidence that Republicans facing tough reelection challenges in
2000 may want to work with the president.
</P>
<P>
   They said the advent of new GOP leaders in the next Congress may
produce more cooperation if the party seeks to reconstruct its
image, which has taken a beating, according to opinion polls,
because of the House Republicans' handling of the impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The House has done a lot of damage to itself and there will be
incentive with the new leadership there to repair that damage and
foster a period of bipartisanship,'' said White House press
secretary Joseph Lockhart. ``That alone will be powerful incentive
for bipartisan cooperation.''
</P>
<P>
   White House aides said the first test of any such cooperation
will occur next month after the president unveils his poll-tested
agenda in his State of the Union address. His initiative is likely
to include proposals for overhauling Social Security, some health
care programs, and, perhaps, campaign finance laws, improving
public schools and sustaining the nation's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is going to continue to work on the agenda the
American public supports. Republicans who are in political danger
in the year 2000, I fully expect to join us in working on this
agenda,'' said Clinton senior adviser Doug Sosnik.
</P>
<P>
   As in years past, Clinton plans to travel around the country,
sometimes in the company of Vice President Al Gore, to promote his
policy priorities, following his State of the Union address and in
February, after he submits his 1999 budget to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   During that time, the Senate is likely to be holding a trial on
the two articles of impeachment passed Saturday by the House. White
House aides Sunday said they hoped that even if the trial starts,
it will not have to run its full course and that a move to censure
will occur.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the administration's optimism about Clinton's ability to
govern during a Senate trial, Robert Dallek, a presidential scholar
at Boston University, said that the likelihood of major legislative
accomplishments ``seems to be pretty questionable'' without what he
described as a ``strange conjunction of interests'' between him and
the Republican majority.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than cooperate with Clinton on his legislative
priorities, Dallek said, the possibility also exists that
Republicans will propose their own ideas, forcing Clinton to veto
them.
</P>
<P>
   Those vetoes, he said, could become the ``source of campaign
rhetoric for Republicans,'' who could use them to portray Clinton
as an ``unbending president who was wrongheaded.''
</P>
<P>
   Marlin Fitzwater, former press secretary to Presidents Reagan
and Bush, said that on the big issues, like Social Security and
Medicare, Clinton is likely to become the equivalent of a
``lame-duck'' president.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can pass the budgets, and do the basic work of
government, but anything that has political controversy or great
partisan differences my guess is they will come to a halt,''
Fitzwater said. ``It will be very tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Fitzwater said that feelings between Republicans and Clinton
could further harden if the Senate aborts a trial before a vote on
conviction is taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a governing standpoint, he would be better off to go to
trial and get a no conviction vote at the end of the process than
he would to get a censure kind of plea-bargain arrangement,''
Fitzwater said.
</P>
<P>
   Senior White House aides said that though Clinton's relationship
with the Republican majority may be at a low point following his
impeachment, it has long been tenuous, especially with the party's
more conservative wing.
</P>
<P>
   Following the impeachment vote, Clinton said he ``wanted the
American people to know'' that he continued to be committed to
working with Republicans. ``It's what I've tried to do for six
years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Lockhart, the president's spokesman, said: ``The
president reached out a hand Sunday, and the question is whether
they will be smart enough to take it,'' adding: ``That's a high bar
for that group.''

WANTED: INTRIGUING MATCHUPS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The powers that be in boxing finally got a clue
and began to make some interesting fights.
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Vargas-Yory Boy Campas and Floyd Mayweather-Angel
Manfredy were first-rate matchups and we have plenty to look
forward to in the coming months: Mike Tyson's return bout against
Francois Botha, Oscar De La Hoya-Ike Quartey, Evander
Holyfield-Lennox Lewis and Pernell Whitaker-Felix Trinidad.
</P>
<P>
   Let's hope this is only the beginning. There are so many more
intriguing matchups out there if only the biggest names in the
sport would be willing to take risks.
</P>
<P>
   The following is a list of fights we're dying to see in the
coming year:
</P>
<P>
   1. De La Hoya vs. Trinidad. Assuming Trinidad takes care of the
aging Whitaker, this is the most in-demand matchup outside the
heavyweight division.
</P>
<P>
   It's a fight that could become the pinnacle of the winner's
career.
</P>
<P>
   The winner: De La Hoya. No one in or around his division would
beat him.
</P>
<P>
   2. Tyson vs. Holyfield. OK, we know who would win. Still, who
won't be watching if (when?) these two get it on for a third time.
</P>
<P>
   It would be Tyson's chance to recapture some of that faded aura
of invincibility. It would give Holyfield a chance to further
solidify his place in boxing history. And, of course, both would
make absurd amounts of money.
</P>
<P>
   The winner: C'mon.
</P>
<P>
   3. Lewis vs. Tyson. Lewis might beat Holyfield in March. Would
that mean he gets a crack at Tyson? Or do we see Holyfield-Tyson
IV?
</P>
<P>
   This matchup of two power-punchers would be more interesting
than Tyson-Holyfield at this point.
</P>
<P>
   The winner: Lewis. He's bigger and stronger.
</P>
<P>
   4. Michael Grant vs. a top contender. We've heard all the hype
and have been impressed with what we've seen from the giant young
heavyweight.
</P>
<P>
   It's time to see what he can do against a big-time opponent. Any
takers? What's Michael Moorer doing these days?
</P>
<P>
   The winner: Grant would be favored against all but Holyfield or
Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   5. Johnny Tapia vs. Mark Johnson. Some would scream that Johnson
would be at a disadvantage moving up two weight classes (six
pounds). So what? People make too much out of weight.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson needs a big-name opponent, Tapis needs a challenge. At
bantamweight, at junior bantam, wherever, this one would be
fascinating.
</P>
<P>
   The winner: Tapia by a nose.
</P>
<P>
   6. Naseem Hamed vs. any number of big names: Hamed looked
terrible against Wayne McCullough and needs to rebuild.
</P>
<P>
   The A list: Floyd Mayweather, Luisito Espinosa and Erik Morales.
The B list: Robert Garcia, Marco Antonio Barrera and Enrique
Sanchez. Naturally, Hamed, more talk than walk, will face none of
the above.
</P>
<P>
   The winner: Anyone from the A list beats him. Those from the B
list would make for a good fight.
</P>
<P>
   7. Roy Jones-Holyfield: Yep, it sounds ridiculous. But is it?
This is Billy Conn and Joe Louis a half century later.
</P>
<P>
   Jones would come in around 190, Holyfield, oh, 215. It's a big
weight disparity but not absurd. Among pertinent questions: Could
Jones move well at that weight? Could he avoid the big punch that
certainly would hurt him? Could Holyfield catch him? Or, like Conn
did before he was finally knocked out, could Jones frustrate the
heavyweight champ with his boxing ability? See, isn't this fun?
</P>
<P>
   The winner: Holyfield. Jones couldn't avoid the champ forever.
</P>
<P>
   8. Shane Mosley vs. Mayweather: First, this probably won't
happen for some time if it ever does _ the risk would be too great
for both fighters.
</P>
<P>
   However, the thought of it is exciting: Two champions, two of
the best tactical boxers in the world, two big names, only one
weight division apart. And, after all, neither has much competition
in his weight class.
</P>
<P>
   The winner: Mosley, who has the edge in experience and power.
</P>
<P>
   9. Fernando Vargas vs....: Uh, we have a problem here. No one in
Vargas' weight class (junior middleweight) is in his league except
David Reid, and that fight won't happen for some time.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas' best possible opponents are in the surrounding divisions
_ specifically, Bernard Hopkins among middleweights and De La Hoya
and Trinidad among welterweights.
</P>
<P>
   We can only hope his handlers can find him an interesting
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   The winner: Vargas is likely to stay in his own division for a
while and no one will touch him there.
</P>
<P>
   10. Tyson vs. Andrew Golota: Anything could happen here, which
is why this one is interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Golota is a big, strong man who could give Tyson big trouble if
he fights as he did against Riddick Bowe. Of course, Golota will be
through in two if he freezes as he did against Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   The winner: Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   Weight problems: A lot of people were surprised that Mayweather
handled Genaro Hernandez so easily when Mayweather won the WBC
super featherweight title in October.
</P>
<P>
   A possible explanation: Hernandez said he had a lot of trouble
making weight. He ate one meal a day for three weeks and was in the
sauna the day before the fight to lose five pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a big part of it,'' Hernandez said. ``I don't want to
take anything away from Floyd, though. He's a good fighter. He
doesn't have much power, but he has the quickness. He did what he
had to do to beat me.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, 32, said last week he is retiring in spite of his
disappointing performance.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to get into computers for a second career and hopes HBO
or another network picks him up as a television commentator.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbit punches: Jose Luis Lopez broke his hand in the second
round of his decision loss to James Page on Dec. 5, according to
Main Events.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez reportedly was grossly out of shape and had to lose
considerable weight before his loss to Page. It would be a shame
for Lopez to waste his talent by neglecting his training. &QL;

WONDERING WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One question has emerged in the aftermath of
President Clinton's four-day bombing campaign against Iraq: What
was (itals)that(unitals) all about?
</P>
<P>
   If his aim was to put a dent in Saddam Hussein's ability to
produce chemical, nuclear, and biological weapons, the dent was not
a large one.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the Pentagon's own estimates of bomb damage, John
Pike, a weapons specialist with the Federation of American
Scientists, said Saturday night, ``It doesn't look like they did
anything on what they said they were going to do, and not enough on
what they were actually doing.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Pentagon's most recent figures, the airstrikes
hit a total of 97 targets over the four days. The strikes damaged
beyond repair only a few of the targets _ the weapons sites,
military headquarters, and industrial facilities that the
Pentagon's war planners thought had to be hit to accomplish the
mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm mystified why they stopped the campaign just as they had
amassed sufficient force to complete the job,'' Pike added.
</P>
<P>
   If, as some of the air-war's targets suggested, Clinton was
trying to destabilize Saddam's regime, he did not hit its
foundations hard enough.
</P>
<P>
   More forces, including another aircraft-carrier battle-group and
more than 70 additional combat planes, had just arrived Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't deploy 70 aircraft halfway around the world just so
they can fly one combat sortie,'' Pike said.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's nuclear and chemical materials _ which one would have
thought would be a major target of the campaign, given that it was
set off by Saddam's refusal to let UN inspectors examine them _
were not attacked.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason for this might have been that nobody knew
where these materials were.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Cockburn, co-author of the forthcoming book ``Out of the
Ashes: The Resurrection of Saddam Hussein,'' noted that the UN
inspectors themselves ``couldn't find the stuff because Saddam kept
moving it.'' So, Cockburn asked, ``If a bunch of people on the
ground couldn't find it, how could some generals target it from the
air?''
</P>
<P>
   There are some well-known, immovable sites where chemical
weapons could be built, but these are ``dual-use'' facilities _
places with civilian functions as well, such as a chlorine plant
vital to Baghdad's drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of Defense William Cohen said the campaign was
avoiding these targets so Iraqi people would not be hurt. The
concern was laudable, but, given these limitations, it again raises
the question: What did Clinton expect the bombing would accomplish?
</P>
<P>
   Cruise missiles and laser-guided bombs did strike some factories
involved in producing missiles that could theoretically deliver
chemical or nuclear weapons. The Pentagon revealed that 11 such
targets were attacked. None were destroyed, one was damaged
severely, five moderately, and four lightly. The damage to one
target had not yet been assessed.
</P>
<P>
   From a purely military standpoint, it is hard to imagine the
commanders would not have wanted to go back and take another shot.
</P>
<P>
   General Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
said Saturday that even these attacks set back Iraq's ability to
produce long-range missiles ``by at least a year.''
</P>
<P>
   However, General Thomas Wilson, the Joint Staff's director of
intelligence, said that even without the airstrikes, Iraq was a
couple of years away from acquiring this ability. So, the upshot of
the bombing appears to have put off this prospect from two years to
three, not trivial, but hardly critical, either.
</P>
<P>
   Missiles were also fired at facilities for the security forces
that have guarded and hidden Saddam's weapons. These were the
people who obstructed the UN inspectors. However, if the inspectors
are no longer in Iraq _ and it is doubtful Saddam will let them
back in soon _ then their functions are no longer so vital.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, just because their facilities _ barracks,
headquarters, and so forth _ were bombed does not mean the guards
themselves were killed. Everyone agrees Saddam has become
resourceful at moving his assets around on short notice.
</P>
<P>
   William M. Arkin, a military historian and former US Army
intelligence officer, said of the airstrikes, ``I think we're
hitting a lot of empty buildings.''
</P>
<P>
   Airstrikes were also aimed at Saddam's command and control, TV
and radio transmitters, Republican Guard facilities, private
security forces _ in other words, the apparatus that keeps him in
power and maintains his links with the Iraqi army.
</P>
<P>
   These attacks, too, seemed fairly light. Of 20 command-control
targets hit, seven were destroyed, four damaged severely, four
moderately. Of nine Republican Guard targets hit, none were
destroyed, three damaged severely, five moderately. Of 18 security
targets hit, two were destroyed, five damaged severely, six
moderately.
</P>
<P>
   Bombing rarely has much effect on these sorts of targets, no
matter how heavy. During the 1991 Gulf war, American-led air forces
mounted 500 strikes on command-control and 260 strikes on Iraq's
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, ``despite the lethality and precision of the attacks,''
concluded the US Air Force's official five-volume ``Gulf War Air
Power Survey,'' Saddam's ability to command his forces ``had not
collapsed. . . The system turned out to be more redundant and more
able to reconstitute itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Operation Desert Fox was called off for diplomatic
reasons. British Prime Minister Tony Blair said Saturday night that
he and Clinton ``always envisaged it would last four days . . .
because such a campaign is the right and proportionate response to
Saddam's breach of UN obligations and also because of our
sensitivity to the holy month of Ramadan.''
</P>
<P>
   This claim is confusing, however, because the bombing continued
into Ramadan, and it leaves unexplained the costly deployment of
vast additional forces that did not arrive until the third and
fourth days.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, Sunday morning, Saddam, who lived through it all
once again, claimed victory _ which, from his point of view, might
outweigh Clinton's claim that the Iraqi leader stands ``degraded''
and ``diminished.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., has gone suddenly from
being an anonymous middle-level legislator to the presumptive
speaker of the House, less because of who he is than because of who
he is not.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert, a six-term conservative from Illinois who is the No. 2
vote counter in the House Republican hierarchy, is not a
pyrotechnical firebrand like Newt Gingrich or a driven conservative
like Rep. Tom Delay, R-Texas, the majority whip.
</P>
<P>
   He has a reputation among his GOP colleagues as a conciliator,
someone who can reach out to Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   But to heal the wounds in Congress, he will have to persuade
moderates in his own party and Democrats that he is not simply an
agent of Delay. For it is Delay, the Republicans' chief
vote-counter, who has been seen in the House as the architect of
Clinton's impeachment. And it is Delay _ more than anyone else _
who is pushing Hastert's name forward as speaker.
</P>
<P>
   As chief deputy majority whip, Hastert is responsible for taking
the temperature of lawmakers on key votes and dealing with
legislative favors. He is viewed as a low-key insider, a lumbering
former high-school wrestling coach who brokers compromises and
smooths out differences without threats or rancor, and always away
from the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   To House Republicans, reeling from the resignation of both a
speaker and a speaker-to-be in the span of two months, Hastert is a
consensus candidate who can bridge the feuding conservative and
moderate wings of the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who in the House is in the best position to heal the partisan
rift? It's Coach Hastert,'' said Rep. Gerald Weller, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   But the challenge of being speaker, who is just behind the vice
president in order of succession to the presidency, will be
difficult enough in the wake of a bitter, partisan divide that
roiled the House for months over impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   It will be even more difficult in the 106th Congress, with
Republicans holding a tiny 12-vote majority and Democrats in no
mood to accommodate. And it could be harder still for Hastert, who
is untested in the national political battles that have incinerated
his two predecessors, and is already being painted by some
Democrats as only a puppet to DeLay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't envy anyone chosen to be speaker right now,'' said
Rep. Tom Barrett, D-Wis., who has worked closely with Hastert on
issues from drug policy to national defense. ``With the slim
majority and the atmosphere Republicans have created with
Democrats, it'd be a Herculean task for anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans do not vote until Jan. 5 to pick a successor
to Speaker-elect Robert Livingston, R-La., who on Thursday
acknowledged a series of extramarital affairs and on Saturday, in a
speech on the House floor, abruptly withdrew his bid for the
speaker's post and said he would leave Congress in six months. The
full House will vote the next day, along party lines.
</P>
<P>
   But Hastert was already trying out his new title for size Sunday
in his Capitol office, declining interviews but calling to thank
many of the 135 Republicans who have committed their support. He
needs 112 votes to win.
</P>
<P>
   As the phone calls flooded in, Hastert was also mapping out the
outlines of an agenda. ``Between the congratulations and the
thank-yous, he's talking and listening to a lot of members right
now,'' said Pete Jeffries, Hastert's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours after Livingston delivered his stunning news,
Hastert used the Republican whip's organization to launch a
blitzkrieg campaign that vaulted him from obscurity to lock up the
race. The main rival, Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., was torpedoed
before he knew what hit him.
</P>
<P>
   But the whip's machinery mobilized in support of Hastert only
after DeLay declined to run for speaker himself.
</P>
<P>
   The two are extremely close, sharing the same offices and the
same staffs. Democrats say if Hastert is to have any chance of
rising above the partisan cauldron embroiling official Washington,
he will have to stand up to DeLay and to the party's powerful
right.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has the potential to reach out to Democrats, if the right
wing in his own party will allow it,'' said Rep. Henry Waxman,
D-Calif., who has worked closely with Hastert on two committees.
</P>
<P>
   But other Democrats who say they like Hastert personally, do not
give him a chance when confronted with picking between his
conservative base and wary Democrats. Party ideology, these
lawmakers say, trumps individual personalities in today's poisonous
political wars.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Sunday, Hastert's aides started to carefully distance their
boss from DeLay and his hardball politics. When he was first
elected to Congress in 1986, his aides noted, Hastert became a
protege of former Rep. Robert Michel, the moderate, courtly
Illinois Republican who led his party in the House before it won
control of Congress in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are those who may say Denny and Tom are very tight and
that's true,'' said Jeffries. ``But Denny Hastert is his own person
and always has been. He is a pragmatist and he's approachable, and
that's a clear delineation between Hastert and DeLay.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike DeLay, Hastert has achieved the rare prize of climbing to
the top of the leadership ladder making few if any enemies. Part of
this may be because of his relative anonymity. Even among many
Washington political sophisticates, the annointment of Hastert drew
blank stares.
</P>
<P>
   But for House Republicans eager to fill the breach left by
Livingston before fleeing the scandal-pocked Capitol for the
holidays, Hastert was a well-known, comfortable face. In the House
leadership races last month, a campaign to draft Hastert to
challenge Rep. Dick Armey, R-Texas, the majority leader, fell
short. But the seeds were sown.
</P>
<P>
   The list of Republicans committed to Hastert, released Saturday
night by his office, included virtually every member of the
Republican leadership, as well as moderates from Jim Leach of Iowa
and Christopher Shays of Connecticut to arch-conservatives like
David McIntosh of Indiana and Steve Largent of Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   ``His foremost skill is working with members from all
backgrounds,'' said Cox.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James Greenwood, R-Pa., a moderate, said he asked Hastert
for assurances that the centrists would have a voice if he were to
become speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to make sure that moderates are not shut out of the
process,'' said Greenwood. ``Hastert brings a reality, a
congeniality to the process. He doesn't come to the floor with an
extreme agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead to the 2000 elections, many Republicans say they
hope Hastert can move away from the slash-and-burn politics
Gingrich championed to an emphasis on legislation, an approach that
was lacking this year and cost House Republicans at the ballot box
in November.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Hastert has been a Republican leader in health-care
issues and in anti-drug policies. He also looks to let other
Republicans spread the party's gospel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a different speakership than Newt's,'' said Rep.
John Edward Porter, R-Ill., a moderate. ``Under Denny, the
speakership will be decentralized. There will be a lot more
spokesmen for the party.''

114-MEMBER COMMITTEE CONTROLS THE STATE OF THE OLYMPICS
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The International Olympic Committee has 102 male members and 12
female members. It has princesses, princes and a sheik. It has four
generals from Africa, two brothers from Mexico and a lot more bona
fide businessmen and lawyers from all corners of the world than
bona fide Olympic heroes like the French skier Jean-Claude Killy,
the Dutch judo athlete Anton Geesink and the Czech gymnast Vera
Caslavska.
</P>
<P>
   It also has a potentially serious problem. It is under internal
and external scrutiny because of allegations of bribery in the
awarding of the Games to host cities, and though the IOC has never
been eager to allow more than glimpses into its workings, curiosity
is now rising rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Just what is the IOC? How does one become a member? How does one
become an influential member? And who are the members of this
organization that has existed since June 1894, when Baron Pierre de
Coubertin called a meeting in a Paris auditorium appropriately
decorated with neo-classical murals?
</P>
<P>
   The IOC, which calls itself ``the supreme authority of the
Olympic movement,'' runs the Summer and Winter Olympics; most
significant, it chooses the host cities, decides which sports will
be included and negotiates the television contracts and sponsorship
deals that pay for it all. NBC will pay $3.5 billion to broadcast
all the Games from 2000 to 2008, money that will finance the
nonprofit IOC and also, through subsidies handed out by the IOC, go
to sports federations and commissions around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Only two members are Americans: Anita DeFrantz, a sports
administrator and former Olympic rower, who is the highest-ranking
woman in an organization that did not elect female members until
1981, and James L. Easton, a sporting goods manufacturer and
president of the international archery federation.
</P>
<P>
   Italy, with nowhere near the population or commercial clout of
the United States, has four members. They include Ottavio
Cinquanta, president of the International Skating Union; Primo
Nebiolo, president of the International Amateur Athletic
Federation, and Mario Pescante, who recently resigned as president
of the Italian Olympic Committee because of a scandal involving a
discredited drug-testing laboratory in Rome but remains a
perquisite-enjoying member of the IOC.
</P>
<P>
   And there are perquisites: first-class flights to, and
first-class treatment in, the cities that bid for the Olympics
every two years; choice seats and choice lodging at the Olympics
themselves, and at least one annual meeting, called ``the
session,'' in a major city that rarely represents a hardship
journey.
</P>
<P>
   Though their travel and IOC business expenses are reimbursed,
members do not receive salaries. They are volunteers, if remarkably
coddled volunteers, and even Juan Antonio Samaranch, the Spaniard
who has been president for the last 18 years, does not receive a
paycheck for his work, although his lifestyle in Lausanne,
Switzerland, the IOC's base of operations, is undeniably pleasant.
</P>
<P>
   De Coubertin moved the IOC to neutral Switzerland from France in
April 1915 in the midst of World War I. It remains in Lausanne
because Samaranch decided to keep it there after becoming president
in 1980, despite offers from Paris, Madrid, Samaranch's native
Barcelona and another Swiss city, Zurich. The IOC has its
headquarters in the Chateau de Vidy, which is on the shores of Lake
Geneva. The Chateau is hardly as grandiose as its name suggests:
there is a trailer park across the street, and a public park
surrounding the headquarters is routinely filled with joggers,
bikers and Olympic tourists hoping to get a glimpse of Samaranch as
he emerges from his Mercedes. (The German automaker is an official
sponsor of the IOC.)
</P>
<P>
   There is no clear track to becoming a full-fledged IOC member. A
handful of international federation presidents, like Cinquanta and
Nebiolo, hold their seats for as long as they remain in office in
their federations. Some members, like Gerhard Heiberg of Norway and
Killy of France, have joined the organization after running
successful Winter Olympic organizing committees. Heiberg headed the
Lillehammer Games in 1994; Killy was co-chairman of the Albertville
Games in 1992. Alex Gilady of Israel joined after helping NBC
negotiate television contracts. Shamil Tarpishev of Russia was once
Boris Yeltsin's private tennis coach and later became minister of
sport in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Albert of Monaco is a former Olympic bobsledder and
provides a bit of glitter for Samaranch, a former diplomat who
still has a weakness for aristocrats and holds the title of marquis
himself. Other royal members include Princess Anne of Britain, no
Samaranch fan; Prince Faisal Fahd Abdul Aziz of Saudi Arabia's
ruling family, and Prince Henri of Luxembourg and the crown prince
of the Netherlands, who became members in February.
</P>
<P>
   There is no official nomination process from outside for new
members, although the Soviets did once essentially impose a member,
Konstantin Andrianov, in 1951. The IOC relishes its independence _
it was one of de Coubertin's primary concerns, because he believed
the ancient games had been destroyed by outside influences _ and
the Olympic charter states that IOC members are ``its
representatives in their respective countries and not delegates of
their countries within the IOC.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true that the IOC has always seemed very anachronistic,''
said Maurice Herzog of France, an honorary member who retired in
1994 after 24 years on the IOC. ``It lives among itself. The
members are like cardinals in the Vatican. Governments come and go,
it doesn't matter to us.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Of the 114 current members, 48 are from Europe, 21 from the
Americas, 20 from Africa, 20 from Asia and 5 from Oceania.
</P>
<P>
   ``We function as a state,'' Samaranch said. ``We have a
president, a government in the form of the executive board, a
parliament in the form of the general membership and an
administration which is rather youthful and works well.''
</P>
<P>
   The executive board, known within the IOC as the EB and created
in 1921, is essentially the organization's board of directors.
Composed of 11 members, including Samaranch and four vice
presidents, it meets four times a year and manages the IOC's
affairs, overseeing finances, presenting any proposal for rule or
bylaw changes at the annual meeting and, perhaps most important,
deciding which new members to propose to the membership as a whole.
These new members are generally approved by acclamation and not by
a formal vote, which is a clear indication of Samaranch's and the
executive board's influence.
</P>
<P>
   Executive board members are elected at the annual meeting in a
secret ballot. Terms last four years, and the current executive
board includes long-influential members like Dick Pound of Canada;
Pal Schmitt of Hungary; Judge Keba Mbaye of Senegal; Kevan Gosper
of Australia; Kim Un Yong of South Korea, a former embassy
intelligence officer and head of the world tae kwon do federation,
and Marc Hodler of Switzerland, who made a series of allegations
about corruption in the Olympic site-awarding process at an
executive board meeting in Lausanne this month. DeFrantz is also on
the board, as are two increasingly prominent Europeans and former
Olympians: Thomas Bach of Germany and Jacques Rogge of Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   The average age of IOC members is 61{ years, although members
may now serve until they turn 80, thanks to Samaranch, now 78, who
successfully raised the mandatory retirement age from 75 so he
could run for a fourth term as president. Four men are life
members, including Hodler and the former FIFA president and IOC
doyen Joao Havelange of Brazil, because they were elected before
age limits were instituted in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the continuity that characterizes the IOC, Samaranch has
reshaped the body dramatically in the last five years, adding 42
new members and bringing the total membership well above 100. Many
of the new members are sports administrators or federation
presidents, whom Samaranch wanted in the fold to insure the IOC's
continued relevance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mass of new members has changed the family feeling within
the IOC quite a bit,'' Herzog said. ``I think it's positive because
we have to be associated with the international federations, but
the discreet side, the Vatican side of the IOC, has changed a lot.
These are sports professionals coming in.'' &QL;

IN OKLAHOMA, A SEX SCANDAL ON THE STATE LEVEL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY _ Accusations of adultery in a divorce dispute may
threaten the political future of Lt. Gov. Mary Fallin, who has been
mentioned as a likely Republican candidate for governor in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fallin has denied the accusation, made by her husband's
lawyer in a divorce hearing on Dec. 4, that she had an affair with
a bodyguard. But the controversy widened after news reports
confirmed the resignation of a highway patrol trooper who had been
assigned to protect her.
</P>
<P>
   The trooper, Greg Allen, told his supervisors in October there
was no truth to rumors that he and Ms. Fallin were having an
affair. But the Oklahoma public safety commissioner, Bob Ricks,
said Allen later admitted in a meeting that his relationship with
Ms. Fallin had ``crossed the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen, 37, a 14-year veteran of the highway patrol who is
married and has two children, was allowed to resign on Dec. 1. But
he now wants his job back. He has insisted that his relationship
with the lieutenant governor was platonic.
</P>
<P>
   Allen's lawyer, Gary James, said the trooper consoled Ms. Fallin
after she confided in him that her marriage was troubled. He said
Allen had occasionally held Ms. Fallin's hand and hugged her.
</P>
<P>
   ``They became very good friends,'' James said. ``Greg was Mary's
confidant. I guess as a security guard, you're not supposed to be a
friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fallin's husband, Joe, an Oklahoma City dentist, has
acknowledged that he had his wife followed by a private
investigator. The Fallins have been married 14 years and have two
children.
</P>
<P>
   Since the controversy became public, the lieutenant governor,
who easily won a second term last month, has kept a low profile,
refusing interview requests and occasionally working from her home.
Her spokesman, John Carsten, said her office has received hundreds
of phone calls, faxes and e-mail messages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything that I've heard coming across the reception desk
has been people calling in and offering their support, telling her
to hang in there,'' Carsten said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, one Oklahoma Republican, Mike McCarville, said there was
``no doubt this has hurt her.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Even people who will give the lieutenant governor the benefit
of the doubt privately will say things like `Gosh, surely Mary knew
better than to be hugging on her bodyguard,''' said McCarville, a
former political consultant who is now the host of a radio talk
show in Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
   McCarville said Ms. Fallin's aspirations for the governor's job
might hinge on whether Allen is reinstated.
</P>
<P>
   ``If nothing is proven in terms of a relationship beyond this
platonic hugging and hand-holding, I don't think it will be fatal
to Mary Fallin's political future,'' he said. ``But I think it will
put the question in the minds of some of her supporters. And it
sure gives the Democrats something to shoot at her with.''
</P>
<P>
   Ricks, the public safety commissioner, said the trooper's
resignation and request to rescind it were being reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   If the relationship between Ms. Fallin, 43, and Allen was
platonic, Ricks asked, ``Does it rise to the level of being so
unprofessional that it would warrant his removal? In the final
analysis, it's going to be difficult for there to be any winners in
this.''

FINALLY, A SIMPLE PLAYOFF SYSTEM

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If it were all this simple.
</P>
<P>
   Combining forces for the greater good of the game _ and, come
on, say it, for all mankind _ CBS SportsLine and The FANSonly
Network have whipped up a simulated 16-team college football
playoff that will determine a winner in the VCS _ the Virtual
Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   The Online College Football National Championship
(http://www.fansonly.com/virtual/) does use the final BCS poll, but
only to seed the teams and pit them in a single-elimination
tournament that ends on Jan. 4 in a Virtual Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The games are played with software called ``3-in-1 Football,'' a
computer simulation game produced by Lance Haffner Games
(http://www.lhgames.com). CBS SportsLine executive editor Mike Kahn
provides analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Since there are no final exams to take into consideration, the
tournament is already down to the final four. Tennessee and Ohio
State meet in the Rose Bowl and Florida State faces Kansas State in
the Sugar Bowl on Dec. 26. (K-State avenged its Big 12 Conference
title-game loss to Texas A&AMP;M with a 32-8 win.)
</P>
<P>
   As for UCLA, well, even in cyberspace, the Bruins' defense
crashes hard.
</P>
<P>
   In the first round two weeks ago, the fifth-seeded Bruins were
upset by 12th-seed Virginia 31-3 in the Holiday Bowl, which is the
gateway to the Citrus Bowl. Cade McNown was picked off twice and
sacked four times and the Bruins managed just 41 yards rushing.
Virginia's Thomas Jones ran for 92 yards and three TDs.
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't you know, UCLA was the only team to lose to a
lower-seeded opponent in the first round. Must have been a residual
effect from the (begin ital)real(end ital) loss in Miami. &QL;

than 10 hours before being spotted by a Greek freighter on Friday
morning. They were arrested that night.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard recovered the bodies of 8 of the 23 people
aboard, but the search for the six missing was suspended Saturday
evening. ``We don't have hope of recovering the bodies,'' said a
Coast Guard spokesman, Paul Henley.
</P>
<P>
   Both men charged, Francisco Gomez, 34, who owned the boat, and
Pedro Guevara, 32, are natives of Cuba who live in Florida. Border
Patrol officials said they had been investigating Guevara for
previous smuggling incidents.
</P>
<P>
   The survivors included a 4-year-old and a 9-year-old. Three
survivors were Guevara's relatives, said Dan Geoghegan, the
assistant chief of the Border Patrol in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Although the smuggling of aliens, a federal crime, normally
carries a maximum penalty of three years in prison for each person
smuggled, both men could face the death penalty, which is allowed
in cases in which lives are lost.
</P>
<P>
   The boat, a 30-foot Scarab, flipped over near the northern
Florida Keys, possibly because of engine trouble and overcrowding,
according to the Coast Guard. Border Patrol officials said it had
departed from Tavernier, in the middle Keys, picked up the refugees
and was headed back to Florida. The officials were not sure whether
the boat had taken the passengers from Cuba or from the Bahamas, a
common starting ground for Cuban refugees wishing to enter the
United States.

TIGHT SECURITY IN BASRA SHIELDS ANY POSSIBLE DISSENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BASRA, Iraq _ In the oil-rich plains 250 miles south of Baghdad,
US and British forces carried out concentrated air strikes that
could set the stage for a rebellion here against Saddam Hussein's
regime.
</P>
<P>
   On a tour Sunday of Basra, the city where Shiite Muslims mounted
a failed uprising in the wake of the 1991 Gulf War, Iraqi military
and intelligence officials made it impossible for reporters to
detect any signs of dissent.
</P>
<P>
   But the tight media control and the heavy Iraqi military
presence in the area revealed Saddam's sensitivity to a seething
opposition among Iraq's Shiite majority who live in the squalid mud
huts and modern slums that dot the alluvial plain between the
Tigris and Euphrates rivers.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Iraq's ambassador to the United Nations said
Sunday that the attacks had killed or wounded thousands of people.
According to the latest reports, at least 42 Iraqis were killed and
96 wounded in the strikes, the most severe since the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   The regime has effectively suppressed this opposition since the
end of the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   In the small towns along the Basra road Sunday, young Shiite men
waved bright green and red flags in a public display of loyalty by
southern Iraqi Shiite tribes to Saddam, while the tribal elders sat
under the traditional reed huts of these marshlands.
</P>
<P>
   The young men shouted pro-Saddam slogans for television cameras.
But diplomats here and opposition groups abroad say the public
support belies growing unrest in Iraq's Shiite south, explaining
that eight years of sanctions have eroded Saddam's authority and
increased dependence on the loyalty of tribal leaders.
</P>
<P>
   There have been sporadic incidents, including occasional
killings of government officials and the torching of two major
power stations last summer. Government troops have only limited
control after dark.
</P>
<P>
   Ghassan Attiya, publisher of the London-based opposition journal
Iraqi File, said, ``These tribes are very important. If they see a
chance of winning in a rebellion, even those who are working with
Saddam now will turn against him.''
</P>
<P>
   Attiya is a Shiite from a tribe near Basra. He added, ``But if
it comes, it would happen quickly. Until then it will be difficult
to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Basra lies inland on the confluence of the Euphrates and Tigris
rivers. The Shiite Muslim population, which makes up 60 percent of
Iraq's roughly 30 million people, is concentrated here.
</P>
<P>
   The Shiite movement, which was founded in Iraq in the Eighth
century, distinguishes itself from the Muslim world's Sunni
majority by its allegiance to religious leaders who are direct
descendents of the Prophet Mohammed. Saddam's secular regime is
built around the power base of the Baath Party, but is made up of
Baghdad's largely Sunni ruling elite.
</P>
<P>
   The Baghdad regime's tight control over the Shiite population is
evident. There are white stucco fortresses every few miles along
the Basra road with Islamic slogans stenciled on them. Military
officials maintain they are defensive positions to guard against
invasion. But the machine guns are pointed at the impoverished
Shiite villages on the opposite sides of the road.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's stated aim of four days of missile attacks was to
degrade Saddam's ability to produce chemical, nuclear and
biological weapons in the wake of his refusal to permit United
Nations weapons inspectors to carry out their work.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the chosen targets suggest an attempt to destabilize the
Saddam regime. One of the more obvious was the sprawling Baath
Party headquarters in downtown Baghdad, which absorbed at least
three direct hits from cruise missiles. They left the cluster of
buildings where some 500 of his political operatives worked in
charred skeletons.
</P>
<P>
   But many analysts in the region and in Washington stress that
the objectives were never clearly stated.
</P>
<P>
   One Western observer based in Baghdad asked in frustration,
``First of all, what was the objective of this campaign? What is
the real goal?''
</P>
<P>
   He also surmised that part of the long-term strategy appeared to
be the separation of the northern part of the country from the
southern part to help foment a rebellion against the Baghdad
regime. But he cautioned that this is a potentially dangerous path
because it could Balkanize the country along sectarian lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope they have been thinking about this,'' he continued.
``Let's assume the Shiites overthrow Saddam and come to Baghdad. Is
the US going to support the Shia movement?''
</P>
<P>
   In Basra, the allied attacks were aimed at Saddam's elite
Republican Guard and a communications network that was damaged
enough to sever television and telephone communication with the
north. They also hit oil refineries which the allies charge have
been used in the export of oil in violation of the UN embargo.
</P>
<P>
   Attiya said the US and British strikes were a ``half-hearted''
attempt to trigger an uprising. He pointed out that they destroyed
local communication stations but not the central systems. Leaflets
were dropped by air warning the Republican Guard not to defend the
``Baghdad regime.'' But they stopped short of encouraging revolt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The US showed that it is wary of sparking a rebellion, and
they are smart in this sense,'' Attiya continued. ``If something
starts in the south and is crushed again as it was in 1991, then
Saddam will be more deeply entrenched than ever.''
</P>
<P>
   He said of the airstrikes, ``This was a prepatory mission to
weaken the regime and to prepare for a more concrete and dramatic
effort in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   In central Basra, all that was left of a telephone and postal
satellite station was rubble. Bulldozers labored to clear the slabs
of concrete, mangled wires and machinery that, until the bombing,
serviced 10,000 phone lines. According to witnesses at the scene, a
security guard and a military official stationed there were killed.
Four others were wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Standing amid the rubble, Abdul Zahara, 40, the mananger of the
communication center, said, ``This is for civilians. What did the
US hit this for? They are trying to cut us off from the rest of the
country. This must only be because they hate the Iraqi people.''
</P>
<P>
   His statements were made in the presence of armed military
guards and ``minders'' from the Ministry of Information assigned to
reporters. Zahara initially said that one of the two killed was a
military officer. But the ``minders'' pulled him aside at one point
and corrected himself when he returned, saying that both of the
dead men were civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were civilians,'' he said. ``They killed civilians
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, the Ministry of Information officials took reporters to
the entrance of the regional Iraqi oil industry offices. Reporters
were told of extensive damage to oil refineries there. But they
were refused access.
</P>
<P>
   Both of these scenes reflect how difficult it is to assess the
damage and the total number of casualties caused by the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   As Iraqis counted their casualties and dug out of the rubble,
the regime defiantly declared victory after the confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Victorious again!'' crowed the banner headline in Iraq's
Al-Musawir Al-Arabi weekly. ``Iraq deserves only victory with God's
help.''
</P>
<P>
   Appearing in a taped message on Qatar-based television, Saddam
told Iraqis Sunday that they had achieved victory over the
``enemies of God and humanity.''

WONDERING WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One question has emerged in the aftermath of
President Clinton's four-day bombing campaign against Iraq: What
was (itals)that(unitals) all about?
</P>
<P>
   If his aim was to put a dent in Saddam Hussein's ability to
produce chemical, nuclear, and biological weapons, the dent was not
a large one.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the Pentagon's own estimates of bomb damage, John
Pike, a weapons specialist with the Federation of American
Scientists, said Saturday night, ``It doesn't look like they did
anything on what they said they were going to do, and not enough on
what they were actually doing.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Pentagon's most recent figures, the airstrikes
hit a total of 97 targets over the four days. The strikes damaged
beyond repair only a few of the targets _ the weapons sites,
military headquarters, and industrial facilities that the
Pentagon's war planners thought had to be hit to accomplish the
mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm mystified why they stopped the campaign just as they had
amassed sufficient force to complete the job,'' Pike added.
</P>
<P>
   If, as some of the air-war's targets suggested, Clinton was
trying to destabilize Saddam's regime, he did not hit its
foundations hard enough.
</P>
<P>
   More forces, including another aircraft-carrier battle-group and
more than 70 additional combat planes, had just arrived Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't deploy 70 aircraft halfway around the world just so
they can fly one combat sortie,'' Pike said.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's nuclear and chemical materials _ which one would have
thought would be a major target of the campaign, given that it was
set off by Saddam's refusal to let UN inspectors examine them _
were not attacked.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason for this might have been that nobody knew
where these materials were.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Cockburn, co-author of the forthcoming book ``Out of the
Ashes: The Resurrection of Saddam Hussein,'' noted that the UN
inspectors themselves ``couldn't find the stuff because Saddam kept
moving it.'' So, Cockburn asked, ``If a bunch of people on the
ground couldn't find it, how could some generals target it from the
air?''
</P>
<P>
   There are some well-known, immovable sites where chemical
weapons could be built, but these are ``dual-use'' facilities _
places with civilian functions as well, such as a chlorine plant
vital to Baghdad's drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of Defense William Cohen said the campaign was
avoiding these targets so Iraqi people would not be hurt. The
concern was laudable, but, given these limitations, it again raises
the question: What did Clinton expect the bombing would accomplish?
</P>
<P>
   Cruise missiles and laser-guided bombs did strike some factories
involved in producing missiles that could theoretically deliver
chemical or nuclear weapons. The Pentagon revealed that 11 such
targets were attacked. None were destroyed, one was damaged
severely, five moderately, and four lightly. The damage to one
target had not yet been assessed.
</P>
<P>
   From a purely military standpoint, it is hard to imagine the
commanders would not have wanted to go back and take another shot.
</P>
<P>
   General Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
said Saturday that even these attacks set back Iraq's ability to
produce long-range missiles ``by at least a year.''
</P>
<P>
   However, General Thomas Wilson, the Joint Staff's director of
intelligence, said that even without the airstrikes, Iraq was a
couple of years away from acquiring this ability. So, the upshot of
the bombing appears to have put off this prospect from two years to
three, not trivial, but hardly critical, either.
</P>
<P>
   Missiles were also fired at facilities for the security forces
that have guarded and hidden Saddam's weapons. These were the
people who obstructed the UN inspectors. However, if the inspectors
are no longer in Iraq _ and it is doubtful Saddam will let them
back in soon _ then their functions are no longer so vital.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, just because their facilities _ barracks,
headquarters, and so forth _ were bombed does not mean the guards
themselves were killed. Everyone agrees Saddam has become
resourceful at moving his assets around on short notice.
</P>
<P>
   William M. Arkin, a military historian and former US Army
intelligence officer, said of the airstrikes, ``I think we're
hitting a lot of empty buildings.''
</P>
<P>
   Airstrikes were also aimed at Saddam's command and control, TV
and radio transmitters, Republican Guard facilities, private
security forces _ in other words, the apparatus that keeps him in
power and maintains his links with the Iraqi army.
</P>
<P>
   These attacks, too, seemed fairly light. Of 20 command-control
targets hit, seven were destroyed, four damaged severely, four
moderately. Of nine Republican Guard targets hit, none were
destroyed, three damaged severely, five moderately. Of 18 security
targets hit, two were destroyed, five damaged severely, six
moderately.
</P>
<P>
   Bombing rarely has much effect on these sorts of targets, no
matter how heavy. During the 1991 Gulf war, American-led air forces
mounted 500 strikes on command-control and 260 strikes on Iraq's
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, ``despite the lethality and precision of the attacks,''
concluded the US Air Force's official five-volume ``Gulf War Air
Power Survey,'' Saddam's ability to command his forces ``had not
collapsed. . . The system turned out to be more redundant and more
able to reconstitute itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Operation Desert Fox was called off for diplomatic
reasons. British Prime Minister Tony Blair said Saturday night that
he and Clinton ``always envisaged it would last four days . . .
because such a campaign is the right and proportionate response to
Saddam's breach of UN obligations and also because of our
sensitivity to the holy month of Ramadan.''
</P>
<P>
   This claim is confusing, however, because the bombing continued
into Ramadan, and it leaves unexplained the costly deployment of
vast additional forces that did not arrive until the third and
fourth days.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, Sunday morning, Saddam, who lived through it all
once again, claimed victory _ which, from his point of view, might
outweigh Clinton's claim that the Iraqi leader stands ``degraded''
and ``diminished.''

US TROOPS SURPRISED BY QUICK END TO DESERT FOX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEAR THE IRAQI BORDER, Kuwait _ For a chopper pilot, Lieutenant
Brian Pierce of Brunswick, Maine, the miracle of the four-day
campaign against Iraq was that he never had to perform his most
important job _ rescuing downed aviators.
</P>
<P>
   All through the long nights of the short conflict, his Army unit
of attack Apaches and Blackhawk support helicopters hovered on the
edge of enemy air space as fighter-bombers hammered targets in
Iraq. The radio call the chopper crews dreaded most was the one
signaling an American or British plane had taken a critical hit,
forcing a bailout.
</P>
<P>
   That distress signal never came in hostilities where all the
blood was spilled by one side. Pierce flew reconnaissance missions,
a dangerous job in its own right, but never had to retrieve a
stricken airman. For that he offered thanks Sunday, as something
like peace returned to the troubled Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talk about Christmas gifts, that's as precious as they come,''
he said. ``We're just extremely grateful there were no
casualties.''
</P>
<P>
   The operation called Desert Fox wasn't quite a war. And the
suspension of the air attacks is not quite the same as peace. By
and large, American fighting men and women massed in the region
seemed doubtful Sunday that the conflict is truly over or their job
is fully done.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can say is we've done what we were asked to do, hit
Saddam Hussein hard and fast,'' said Air Force Lieutenant Colonel
Roy White, who flew his A-10 ground attack craft on bomb and
missile strikes deep in Iraqi territory. ``We're all hopeful that
this is all we'll need to do. That's really up to Saddam Hussein.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, however: ``But I can't say anyone is convinced the US
is finished with Saddam. He remains a menace and a source of
uncertainty for the world. And we're ready to hit again on a
moment's notice.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there was no mistaking the sense of surprise and relief
as word spread that hostilities were suspended for the time being.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peace is better than war, even to a Marine,'' said Lance
Corporal Steven Gilleo, 19, of Wakefield, Mass. ``Maybe Saddam is
learning a lesson. Probably not. I guess the US can always try to
teach him another.''
</P>
<P>
   American and British forces on land and sea remained in a state
of high alert. But in foxholes and on flight lines, the mood was
far more relaxed than in the past four days, if still something
short of jubilant.
</P>
<P>
   ``The adrenaline's down a bit, exhaustion's setting in, but it
was good to find a minute to go to chapel service and give thanks
that no Americans had to die this time,'' said Army Sergeant Robert
Taylor of Waxhaw, N.C., who'd worked virtually non-stop since last
Wednesday refueling and re-arming the combat helicopters of Army
Air Task Force 130.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, sure, everyone is kind of feeling high, but it's foolish
to think it's over,'' he said. ``We'll probably have to go back to
kicking Saddam's butt after Ramadan is done.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramadan, the Islamic holy month, started Saturday, and the
continuation of bomb attacks against Hussein during this season
infuriated even America's closest allies in the Muslim world.
Mistakenly or not, there seemed a strong impression among US
fighting forces that the termination of hostilities was a gesture
of respect for Islamic sensitivities, not a true end to the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the United States and Britain will be keeping a close
eye on Iraq. ``We'll still be enforcing the southern `No-Fly'
zone,'' said White. ``We'll still be using our assets here to keep
Saddam in line, although it's hard to predict what our exact role
is going to be a month from now, or even a day. It obviously
remains a volatile spot. Anything can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The extraordinary speed of the campaign meant most American
forces in the region worked with only a few hours of sleep and a
few hurried meals throughout the four-day operation.
</P>
<P>
   So there was more weariness than wonder at the latest twist in
the ordeal with Iraq. ``Was that a war that just whizzed by, or
what?'' asked Army Staff Sergeant Frederick Delaine of
Fayetteville, N.C. ``I'm up for a nice long sleep and a slow
breakfast, if I'm lucky. But, fact is, here on the line, we're
still going to be geared up and going flat out.''
</P>
<P>
   American combatants said Sunday they had been far too focused on
the strikes against Saddam to focus on the political troubles back
home. Many seemed barely aware that their commander-in-chief,
President Clinton, had been impeached by Congress and is locked in
a struggle for his political life.
</P>
<P>
   And even those with a fairly clear notion of the last two days'
doings in Washington reacted with a shrug.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd guess, other than the job immediately at hand, the thing
uppermost in mind for most of us is that Christmas is coming on,
and we are a long, long distance away from our families,'' said
White. ``I'm thinking of my wife and three kids. I'm thinking how
much I miss them. I'm thinking how much I love them. And I'm
thinking these things a lot harder than I'm thinking about politics
in Washington.''

IMPEACHMENT HISTORY, GOP FOCUSES ON IRAQ POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the fury over impeachment continues, President
Clinton faces another partisan debate, this time over the attack on
the Iraq airstrike.
</P>
<P>
   The end of the four-day assault against Saddam Hussein Saturday
was greeted by tough questions from Republicans in Congress, who
sharply questioned the effectiveness of the operation and the
administration's long-term policy. Democrats stood firm behind
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, at the end of 70 hours, Saddam Hussein
is still in power, as he has been for the last number of years,
despite our threats, despite our attacks and so forth,'' Republican
Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama, chairman of the Senate
Intelligence Committee, said Sunday on CNN's ``Evans and Novak.''
</P>
<P>
   The questions largely echoed those of military analysts and a
few members of Congress when President Bush halted the 1991 Persian
Gulf war while Hussein retained power and much of his
weapons-production facilities.
</P>
<P>
   But this time there was a twist: Several of the president's
Republican critics have raised questions about the way the military
operation and the House impeachment hearings coincided.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing question (is) not my question, it's a question that
is widely abroad,'' Representative Porter Goss, chairman of the
House Intelligence Committee, said on ``Fox News Sunday.''
``Eyebrows have been raised by what I would call a confluence of
circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the toughest words about the timing came Wednesday, with
the start of the bombing, from Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,
who was later criticized by his own colleagues for his remarks. He
did not comment Sunday on Clinton's decision to stop the
airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   Former senator Jack Kemp, the Republican party's 1996 candidate
for vice president, issued a statement calling the operation
``ill-conceived.'' And in an interview Sunday, Carnes Lord, who
served as national security adviser to former Vice President Dan
Quayle, said the attack appeared to do only slight damage to Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It kind of raises questions about the timing,'' said Lord, an
assistant professor at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at
Tufts University.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats generally supported the operation, known as Operation
Desert Fox. Representative Ed Markey, a Democrat from
Massachusetts, said the important question was not why the bombing
took place but why the House insisted on going ahead with
impeachment hearings as a military operation was being conducted.
``The reason that the impeachment couldn't be postponed was because
the Republican members wanted to go home for Christmas,'' Markey
said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Norm Dicks, the top-ranking Democrat on the House
Intelligence Committee, said he had no doubts about the timing of
the strikes on Iraq. ``I think it was strictly done on the
merits,'' he said on ``Fox News Sunday.'' ``I think it should have
been done. I supported it. I think it's been effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph R. Biden Jr., who is a member of the Senate Judiciary
Committee and the top-ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, said the timing seemed odd at first. ``I have
to acknowledge to you, if I read this in a book, I'd say, well, no,
it's more than coincidence. . . . This is surreal. This is
absolutely bizarre, the whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But Biden said he had no doubt tha the president ordered the
strike on Iraq because his national security team decided that it
was time to surprise Hussein and set back Iraq's weapons
development.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody assumes this president is politically sharp as can
be,'' he said. ``Nobody in this town would have advised him to bomb
while he's trying to get votes from, you know, Republicans.''

   WASHINGTON _ The morning after impeachment, the capital city
stirred back to life in its familiar Sunday ways. Deacon Gary B.
Pledger, an alumnus of the homeless contingent living across from
the White House, had the chili and cornbread cooking for his
church's weekly homily-and-handout spread for his old buddies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all good food,'' he said, keeping his observations simple
as he eased into the day and headed out to 50 or so indigents
stirring from their wraith-like sleeping lairs within shouting
distance of the White House. ``Two years ago, I was living with the
guys in that park, watching the high and mighty come and go.''
</P>
<P>
   Pledger paused to speak of President Clinton. ``The mighty is
falling, huh?'' he asked, touching on the question that haunted
Washington on the day after impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Two blocks away from the Temple Baptist church, which plucked
Pledger from the streets two years ago, Tim Russert showed up for
work as bureau chief at the NBC News television studios, easing his
own way into Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unbelievable week,'' he said wide-eyed to no one in
particular, as if acknowledging a hangover of sorts as he hooked up
his microphone and earpiece. He checked for the latest
developments, more than ready for some fresh shocker, then made
sure Secretary of State Madeleine Albright had some hot tea at hand
as air time approached for ``Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
   In his own way, Russert is one of this city's Sunday deacons of
the here-and-now, not the hereafter, of the political world with
all its headlined sins, judgments and punishments as politicians
fall from grace before the nation's eyes. He had as busy a Sunday
workload as Pledger, what with impeachment and the Iraq bombing
runs on the program agenda.
</P>
<P>
   There was no chili or cornbread cooking, but Russert offered
catered finger sandwiches and holiday chocolate truffles later,
after the morning's lineup of talking heads had their say. He
brought James Carville and Mary Matalin and their two small
children on the show for the human side of the capital, with the
couple mostly feuding about impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   With his deacon's eye, Russert seized on a politician's phrase
about granting ``absolution'' to the president and used it to stir
observations from four guest senators.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to work it through,'' the moderator estimated
afterward, sounding more like a hopeful groundling than a stage
manager in the capital's grim impeachment show.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the White House, a man in roller skates blithely sped
back and forth on Pennsylvania Avenue, saying nothing and wearing a
protest sign on his helmet: ``SEXUAL WITCHHUNT.'' On the sidewalk,
a dozen pickets protested the administration's Iraq policy,
complaining about children dying.
</P>
<P>
   A few blocks away, a customer complained in a souvenir store
that the price of the Clinton nesting dolls had been raised
overnight from $50 to $70. The customer was rudely told to leave.
Outside, tourists puzzled over the dolls at the shop window.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recognize Monica and Paula and Gennifer,'' one woman said to
a friend, identifying the painted wooden dolls that fit one within
the other, capped by a Clinton doll. ``But the fourth?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Kathleen Willey?'' the friend tried. ``Or maybe Hillary.''
</P>
<P>
   Next to the dolls sat a full mannequin version of a stupefied
looking president, reading a book about impeachment and draped with
a copy of the Starr report printed on a roll of bathroom tissue.
The effigy drew little more than a routine glance from passing
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Across from the White House, the homeless lineup was beginning
in LaFayette Park, the Sunday event unfolding reliably, impeachment
or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesus took the taste for drugs right out of my mouth,''
Pledger preached to his patient, needy flock. The chili and
cornbread were kept covered until he finished. ``Don't worry, it'll
be hot and good,'' he said as they glanced hungrily at the food.
</P>
<P>
   The White House glowed beyond them, Christmas-card perfect
except for a string of TV news encampments. ``I know, you're
thinking of when you were little and the presents and the fun,''
Pledger went on. ``But it doesn't have to be depressing,'' he
insisted of life, closing with a brief prayer, then the chili.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Gary gratefully finished a plateful and faced the White
House on a park bench, reading impeachment stories in someone's
discarded Sunday paper. ``It was a circus here yesterday,'' he
complained of rival pro- and anti-impeachment groups that disturbed
his own homeless setting as much as the presidential hearth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so wild, no one paid any attention to these two kids
playing carols on a clarinet and horn,'' he said. ``That impressed
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary said he had absolutely nothing to say about the president's
predicament that has not been uttered and heard before in this city
and the nation. ``I hope he survives,'' he said gesturing toward
Clinton's home and turning back to the impeachment story.

IMPEACHMENT HISTORY, GOP FOCUSES ON IRAQ POLICY

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the fury over impeachment continues, President
Clinton faces another partisan debate, this time over the attack on
the Iraq airstrike.
</P>
<P>
   The end of the four-day assault against Saddam Hussein Saturday
was greeted by tough questions from Republicans in Congress, who
sharply questioned the effectiveness of the operation and the
administration's long-term policy. Democrats stood firm behind
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, at the end of 70 hours, Saddam Hussein
is still in power, as he has been for the last number of years,
despite our threats, despite our attacks and so forth,'' Republican
Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama, chairman of the Senate
Intelligence Committee, said Sunday on CNN's ``Evans and Novak.''
</P>
<P>
   The questions largely echoed those of military analysts and a
few members of Congress when President Bush halted the 1991 Persian
Gulf war while Hussein retained power and much of his
weapons-production facilities.
</P>
<P>
   But this time there was a twist: Several of the president's
Republican critics have raised questions about the way the military
operation and the House impeachment hearings coincided.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing question (is) not my question, it's a question that
is widely abroad,'' Representative Porter Goss, chairman of the
House Intelligence Committee, said on ``Fox News Sunday.''
``Eyebrows have been raised by what I would call a confluence of
circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the toughest words about the timing came Wednesday, with
the start of the bombing, from Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,
who was later criticized by his own colleagues for his remarks. He
did not comment Sunday on Clinton's decision to stop the
airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   Former senator Jack Kemp, the Republican party's 1996 candidate
for vice president, issued a statement calling the operation
``ill-conceived.'' And in an interview Sunday, Carnes Lord, who
served as national security adviser to former Vice President Dan
Quayle, said the attack appeared to do only slight damage to Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It kind of raises questions about the timing,'' said Lord, an
assistant professor at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at
Tufts University.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats generally supported the operation, known as Operation
Desert Fox. Representative Ed Markey, a Democrat from
Massachusetts, said the important question was not why the bombing
took place but why the House insisted on going ahead with
impeachment hearings as a military operation was being conducted.
``The reason that the impeachment couldn't be postponed was because
the Republican members wanted to go home for Christmas,'' Markey
said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Norm Dicks, the top-ranking Democrat on the House
Intelligence Committee, said he had no doubts about the timing of
the strikes on Iraq. ``I think it was strictly done on the
merits,'' he said on ``Fox News Sunday.'' ``I think it should have
been done. I supported it. I think it's been effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph R. Biden Jr., who is a member of the Senate Judiciary
Committee and the top-ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, said the timing seemed odd at first. ``I have
to acknowledge to you, if I read this in a book, I'd say, well, no,
it's more than coincidence. . . . This is surreal. This is
absolutely bizarre, the whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But Biden said he had no doubt tha the president ordered the
strike on Iraq because his national security team decided that it
was time to surprise Hussein and set back Iraq's weapons
development.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody assumes this president is politically sharp as can
be,'' he said. ``Nobody in this town would have advised him to bomb
while he's trying to get votes from, you know, Republicans.''
</P>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton has adopted a two-track approach
to his pending impeachment trial in the Senate, preparing to mount
a vigorous legal defense while seeking to reach a compromise on a
resolution of condemnation that would allow him to keep his job,
White House officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But the strategy may founder in the Senate for the same reason
it failed so spectacularly in the House, which on Saturday passed
two articles of impeachment accusing Clinton of lying under oath
before a federal grand jury and obstructing justice. Clinton is not
prepared to confess to those charges, a senior Clinton legal
adviser said Sunday, because he does not believe he committed them.
</P>
<P>
   Former Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter on Monday will
propose a swift end to the impeachment crisis through a bipartisan
censure resolution voted by the Senate and accepted by Clinton. The
proposal, to appear as an Op-Ed article in Monday's New York Times,
would require Clinton to publicly acknowledge that he lied under
oath.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials welcomed the proposal from Ford and
Carter, one of several offered by senior figures of both parties in
recent weeks, as evidence of a bipartisan desire to end the
impeachment ordeal. But they cautioned that Clinton remains
adamantly opposed to any admission of perjury.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion that he's going to come forward and say he lied is
not going to happen,'' said Gregory Craig, the White House
coordinator of the president's defense. ``He's not going to concede
he lied to the grand jury, because he did not.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's legal team is ready for a Senate proceeding that
will begin shortly after the body convenes on Jan. 6, officials
said. White House lawyers are preparing a series of motions
questioning the legitimacy of impeachment articles voted by a
lame-duck Congress and demanding that the charges against Clinton
be spelled out in detail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going forward to prepare for trial,'' said Craig.
``We're getting ready the legal arguments. We're getting ready the
motions practice. We're getting ready to present evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig and Charles Ruff, the White House counsel, will lead the
president's defense in the Senate, as they did in the House. They
intend to rely on the same factual and constitutional arguments
that were not persuasive in the House, with one important
rhetorical difference. They can no longer claim that the
accusations against Clinton do not warrant impeachment; a narrow
majority in the House declared on Saturday that they do.
</P>
<P>
   Now the president's lawyers have begun to put forward the
argument that they do not form sufficient grounds to warrant
Clinton's removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have the burden of making the case that even if the
evidence and all the allegations are true, it rises to the level,
constitutional level, that this man should be removed from
office,'' Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   But even as they prepare an aggressive legal defense, White
House officials are openly pleading for senators to find a means to
punish Clinton with a measure short of removal from office. They
are hoping that it will be easier to reach an accommodation in the
Senate, which is less sharply divided on factional lines and which
by tradition is more attuned to compromise than is the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where there's a will, there's a way,'' John Podesta, the White
House chief of staff, said in an appearance on the Cable News
Network. ``If a majority of the Senate wants to do that, they will
find a way to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another White House official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said that the president's defenders will continue to
call attention to the sharply partisan vote in the House to impeach
Clinton. They are heartened by polls that show a rise in Clinton's
popularity after the impeachment vote and a continuing decline in
public approval of the way Congress conducts its business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The House showed that a partisan majority can do whatever it
wants,'' this official said. ``The Senate, by nature, by custom, by
rule, is a different place. A partisan majority cannot ramrod
something, because of the filibuster rule and the two-thirds
requirement for impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   While White House aides expressed confidence that the Senate
would not vote to convict and remove the president, they appeared
in no hurry to begin the actual trial. One senior presidential
adviser said that the more time passes, the less popular Congress
becomes and the stronger public sentiment for an end to the crisis
grows.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more you delay it, the more angry the public becomes,''
this adviser said.
</P>
<P>
   The president's lawyers will work through the holidays preparing
his Senate defense, while hoping that it will not be needed.
</P>
<P>
   One White House legal adviser said he believed that any censure
compromise would come only after a formal trial has opened.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good number of senators believe this cannot be resolved
without at least beginning a trial,'' the lawyer said, on condition
of anonymity. ``We have to be ready to do that, and we have to be
deferential to their view of what is required by the
Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   In remarks at the White House after the impeachment vote,
Clinton pleaded for an end to the partisanship that he described as
poisoning Washington. He said that meeting the nation's challenges
required an atmosphere of ``decency and civility, some presumption
of good faith, some sense of proportionality and balance in
bringing judgment against those who are in different parties.''
</P>
<P>
   But on Sunday morning on television, James Carville, the
president's most hard-edged adviser, put Republicans on notice that
he and other Clinton partisans would continue to attack them for
the near party-line vote to impeach the president.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``There's going to be retribution,'' Carville warned darkly on
the holiday-decorated set of NBC's ``Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
   Most senior White House officials took the day off, their first
respite in weeks of building tension.
</P>
<P>
   The president attended church in the morning with his daughter,
Chelsea, and his stepfather, Dick Kelley.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Walter Shropshire of the Foundry United Methodist
Church began the service by noting the events of the past turbulent
week, which included not only the impeachment of the president but
a furious four-day bombardment of Iraq and the resignation of Rep.
Bob Livingston, the speaker-elect. He led a silent prayer for the
nation and its leaders, U.S. forces overseas and the people of
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton left the church hand in hand with Chelsea, he was met
by a heckler who demanded his resignation, and applause from a
handful of supporters.
</P>
<P>
   One carried a placard reading, ``God Bless our Prez.''

   HONG KONG _ It is fitting that the same week England's
cricketers again surrendered meekly to Australia, the government in
London should have surrendered to Washington's perceptions of U.S.
interests in the Gulf or the more immediate concerns of the U.S.
president.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a commentary on the rights, wrongs or usefulness of
the raids on Iraq. History will be their judge. It simply flows
from Britain's apparent lack of any policy in the Middle East (and
elsewhere) other than to hang on to the coattails of the United
States, be the faithful servant and show that the United States is
not alone in its actions.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are often as surprised as other non-British at this
eagerness to be bracketed with the United States in United Nations
resolutions or bombing campaigns. Meanwhile, the British are easily
irritated when others fail to notice they had a role at all.
</P>
<P>
   France has a policy which is based on more than just being seen
to oppose U.S. views. Why doesn't Britain?
</P>
<P>
   For historical reasons, Britain's links with and interests in
the Middle East, with Israel and the various countries of the Arab
world, are different from those of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's role in the creation of the political geography of the
region after the breakup of the Ottoman Empire _ in Palestine, in
the installation of the Hashemites on the thrones of Jordan and
Iraq and in the oil industry of the region _ should give it an
identifiable policy.
</P>
<P>
   Such a view could be criticized on the grounds of being
backward-looking. But then why is London looking to Washington
rather than trying to move with its own European future and promote
a common European policy?
</P>
<P>
   The EU may have blamed Saddam Hussein for the bombing campaign.
But that is a long way from reactivating the joint military action
of 1991.
</P>
<P>
   London's solo participation merely further reduces its own
influence within Europe, and the political value of its military
presence in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   If Britain was getting much in return for this stance, it might
be understandable. Yes, there was U.S. diplomatic help during the
Falklands war. But the Clinton administration, for understandable
political reasons, has not been especially helpful on the one issue
which most matters for London _ Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Nor can the slavishness be attributed to Prime Minister Tony
Blair's personal relationship with, and support for, President Bill
Clinton. This devotion is far too deeply rooted in British policy
for that.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps sharing a language, some institutions and economic and
political philosophies, the British instinctively believe the
United States is usually right. The instinct to support a friend
even when unsure of the merits of the case would be admirable.
</P>
<P>
   But one suspects that there is a less admirable aspect to
Britain's role. Having lost its empire it has been unable to
reconcile itself to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   As Hugo Young has demonstrated in his powerful recent book
``This Blessed Plot: Britain and Europe from Churchill to Blair,''
the British have repeatedly, under every administration, failed to
recognize and participate in European integration.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they have sought solace in illusions of the
Commonwealth and by trying to stay on the world stage by
associating themselves with U.S. global supremacy.
</P>
<P>
   The United States finds this useful and is too polite to tell
London how little weight it carries in the world. The Germans,
French, even Italians and Spaniards, may say so. But they do not
say it in English. So Britain does not hear. &QL;

<P>
   Nor can the slavishness be attributed to Prime Minister Tony
Blair's personal relationship with, and support for, President Bill
Clinton. This devotion is far too deeply rooted in British policy
for that.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps sharing a language, some institutions and economic and
political philosophies, the British instinctively believe the
United States is usually right. The instinct to support a friend
even when unsure of the merits of the case would be admirable.
</P>
<P>
   But one suspects that there is a less admirable aspect to
Britain's role. Having lost its empire it has been unable to
reconcile itself to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   As Hugo Young has demonstrated in his powerful recent book
``This Blessed Plot: Britain and Europe from Churchill to Blair,''
the British have repeatedly, under every administration, failed to
recognize and participate in European integration.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they have sought solace in illusions of the
Commonwealth and by trying to stay on the world stage by
associating themselves with U.S. global supremacy.
</P>
<P>
   The United States finds this useful and is too polite to tell
London how little weight it carries in the world. The Germans,
French, even Italians and Spaniards, may say so. But they do not
say it in English. So Britain does not hear. &QL;

   HONG KONG _ It is fitting that the same week England's
cricketers again surrendered meekly to Australia, the government in
London should have surrendered to Washington's perceptions of U.S.
interests in the Gulf or the more immediate concerns of the U.S.
president.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a commentary on the rights, wrongs or usefulness of
the raids on Iraq. History will be their judge. It simply flows
from Britain's apparent lack of any policy in the Middle East (and
elsewhere) other than to hang on to the coattails of the United
States, be the faithful servant and show that the United States is
not alone in its actions.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are often as surprised as other non-British at this
eagerness to be bracketed with the United States in United Nations
resolutions or bombing campaigns. Meanwhile, the British are easily
irritated when others fail to notice they had a role at all.
</P>
<P>
   France has a policy which is based on more than just being seen
to oppose U.S. views. Why doesn't Britain?
</P>
<P>
   For historical reasons, Britain's links with and interests in
the Middle East, with Israel and the various countries of the Arab
world, are different from those of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's role in the creation of the political geography of the
region after the breakup of the Ottoman Empire _ in Palestine, in
the installation of the Hashemites on the thrones of Jordan and
Iraq and in the oil industry of the region _ should give it an
identifiable policy.
</P>
<P>
   Such a view could be criticized on the grounds of being
backward-looking. But then why is London looking to Washington
rather than trying to move with its own European future and promote
a common European policy?
</P>
<P>
   The EU may have blamed Saddam Hussein for the bombing campaign.
But that is a long way from reactivating the joint military action
of 1991.
</P>
<P>
   London's solo participation merely further reduces its own
influence within Europe, and the political value of its military
presence in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   If Britain was getting much in return for this stance, it might
be understandable. Yes, there was U.S. diplomatic help during the
Falklands war. But the Clinton administration, for understandable
political reasons, has not been especially helpful on the one issue
which most matters for London _ Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Nor can the slavishness be attributed to Prime Minister Tony
Blair's personal relationship with, and support for, President Bill
Clinton. This devotion is far too deeply rooted in British policy
for that.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps sharing a language, some institutions and economic and
political philosophies, the British instinctively believe the
United States is usually right. The instinct to support a friend
even when unsure of the merits of the case would be admirable.
</P>
<P>
   But one suspects that there is a less admirable aspect to

</P>

   LONDON _ All the world's a casino and everyone is a player. Or
so it seems these days.
</P>
<P>
   I have been gambling in Moscow, where it takes more courage to
walk out of a dubious dive with your winnings than to venture
through the doorway.
</P>
<P>
   Among the high rollers in London, I have been pampered by
periwigged footmen bearing caviar and champagne. And my first
resolution for the New Year is to stay at Bellagio, the latest
wonder on the Las Vegas Strip.
</P>
<P>
   Christmas in a casino? No problem. Once taboo, gambling resorts
have become family destinations for the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone can gamble to their heart's content. And if they cannot
get to a casino or a lottery terminal, electronic gambling, outside
the jurisdiction of any regulatory authority, is available on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The pro-gambling forces in the United States have recently
scored a great victory at the ballot box, when opponents of
gambling were routed across the country. New opportunities to play
the lottery and slot machines are on the way.
</P>
<P>
   The same momentum holds true across Europe. In Britain, the
lottery is the most successful commercial enterprise since Sir
Walter Raleigh brought tobacco to the court of Queen Elizabeth I,
with 30 million people buying tickets every week.
</P>
<P>
   What is going on? Why the worldwide fever to gamble? The answer
is that people have always liked to gamble. Even in prehistoric
graves, some of the dice were found to be loaded. But in previous
times, the desire to gamble, which has flared up in most societies,
has usually been suppressed, by church or state.
</P>
<P>
   In the Middle Ages gambling was regarded as a sin against the
laws of God. A century ago, gambling was seen as a vice, a social
crime like prostitution. But now anything goes. It is simply part
of the leisure industry.
</P>
<P>
   There are obvious dangers _ and not just for the unfortunate
compulsive gambler. For casinos, there may soon be too much
gambling for all the competing interests to survive.
</P>
<P>
   The recent battle between the Indian casinos in California,
wanting to move into slot machines, and the Nevada gaming industry
trying to stop them, was probably the most expensive campaign in
American history.
</P>
<P>
   Costing over $100 million, it was on a par with the two main
candidates' expenditure in the last presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Las Vegas lost this one, but the resort is always one step
ahead. The casinos have discovered that they can make as much
money, if not more, from other attractions like theme parks and
rides. Win some. Lose some.
</P>
<P>
   The Asian crisis has hit the high end of the market, especially
London's casinos. The Asian high rollers are staying away. But no
one doubts that when the good times roll again, the gamblers will
return.
</P>
<P>
   On the gamblers' side, how to control the current gambling
fever? A major debate has now begun in America in the forum of the
National Gambling Impact Commission, instigated two years ago by
Reverend Tom Grey, an evangelical foe of gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Grey talks a good game. But he knows he does not have a prayer
against the massed forces of Nevada, led by the former Republican
fund-raiser Frank Fahrenkopf.
</P>
<P>
   The most the commission will do, observers believe, is to put
forward a series of mild recommendations, which Congress can then
mull over at leisure.
</P>
<P>
   One of these proposals could be to provide help to gamblers who
have a ``problem,'' which is the polite term used for compulsive
gambling.
</P>
<P>
   The American casino industry realizes it had better get moving,
by funding research and treatment for problem gamblers. The
consequences of doing nothing is demonstrated by what happened to
the tobacco industry. Fines, lost markets, pariah status.
</P>
<P>
   Across Europe, governments see casino gambling as a way of
attracting foreign currency and stimulating growth. Well, most of
them do. Turkey recently closed its casinos on moral grounds. And
gambling is strictly forbidden in Israel. But gamblers are now
being lured from the Promised Land to a casino in Jericho in the
Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
   These days, there is always somewhere new to win (or lose) your
money. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A solid majority of Americans believe that the
impeachment of President Clinton was adequate punishment, and want
the Senate to resolve the case without a trial and without removing
him from office, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News
Poll.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, which began immediately after the House voted the
first article of impeachment against Clinton on Saturday afternoon,
and continued into Sunday evening, found that the more than 12
hours of debate about the perjury and obstruction of justice
charges had no effect on the public's opinion of the president or
the case against him.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's popularity remains as high as it has been at any point
of the six years of his presidency, while the public view of the
Republican Party continues to plummet.
</P>
<P>
   Two out of three Americans now oppose Clinton's removal from
office, as they did in the weeks before the hearings. Nine out of
10 respondents said they had heard nothing during the two days of
televised hearings _ in which Republicans painstakingly offered
their case against Clinton _ that had shifted their view of the
case.
</P>
<P>
   The Times/CBS News poll suggests that almost a year after the
initial reports of Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky, the
public continues to be almost completely at odds with much of
Washington's political establishment over the import and
significance of Clinton's affair, and attempts by an independent
counsel and Republicans in Congress to prove he tried to cover it
up.
</P>
<P>
   And it provided one more piece of evidence of the startling
political resilience of Clinton: one day after becoming the second
president in the nation's history to be impeached, 72 percent of
respondents said they approved of how he was handling his job.
Clinton's job approval rating actually increased since last week,
when it was 66 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone poll included 1,215 adults nationwide and had a
margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
All respondents had been previously interviewed last week, as a way
of measuring changes in public perception by the House impeachment
hearings.
</P>
<P>
   The Times/CBS News poll comes as the case against Clinton moves
from the House, which voted two impeachment counts against him in a
closely partisan vote on Saturday, to the Senate for a trial next
year.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest political concerns of Clinton's advisers is
that the impeachment vote might encourage a round of demands for
his resignation. But the poll found only limited support for
Clinton's resignation: 32 percent of respondents said it would be
better for the nation of the president stepped down, while 65
percent said he should finish his term. Those figures mirror the
proportion of Americans who believe he should be forced from
office.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Times/CBS News poll suggests something approaching
a consensus on how the Clinton case should be resolved, there has
been little evidence to date that congressional Republicans were
considering polls in deciding how to proceed with this case. This
poll found again that the Republican Party was paying a political
price for its pursuit of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Party is now viewed unfavorably by 58 percent of
respondents, up from 52 percent last week. That is the worst
standing the party has posted in the 14 years since The Times and
CBS first began asking respondents the question. The public view of
the party is even more negative today than it was after the 1994
shutdown of the government.
</P>
<P>
   Barely one-third of respondents saw congressional Republicans as
being in touch with the views of the nation, while nearly
two-thirds said they believed the Republicans were pursuing the
case for purely partisan motives: to damage Clinton and the
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said their polling has found a similar
erosion in the public's view of Republicans, and portrayed the
result in near-cataclysmic terms. ``The leadership in the House has
potentially done more long-term damage to the Republican party than
anything Richard Nixon did during Watergate,'' a senior White House
official said.
</P>
<P>
   A CBS News poll on Friday found additional evidence of another
kind of deterioration in the public's view of Congress: Only 41
percent of respondents now believe Congress shares the public's
moral values, down from 58 percent in September. This is one of the
few areas in which Clinton fares poorly. The same CBS poll found
that nearly two-thirds of Americans did not believe Clinton shared
their moral values.
</P>
<P>
   The Times/CBS poll suggests slight shifts in public perceptions
of the case from Saturday to Sunday. For example, 60 percent of
respondents on Saturday said that impeachment is punishment enough
for what Clinton had done; that had changed to 53 percent by
Sunday. Over two days, 57 percent of the respondents said they
believe that Clinton has been punished enough.
</P>
<P>
   There was also a drop over the two days in the number of
Americans who expect the Senate to actually remove Clinton; down
from 35 percent on Saturday to 26 percent on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The poll found that the public as a whole _ with the exception
being conservative Republicans _ held fairly consistent views on
Clinton and the impeachment process. Nearly two-thirds of
respondents disapproved of the House impeachment vote.
</P>
<P>
   About the same number said the Senate should not put Clinton on
trial, but should instead work out a compromise that might involve,
for example, a censure or a fine. More than half of the respondents
said they feared that a Senate trial would be harmful to the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   And if there is a trial, 68 percent of the respondents said that
the Senate should not remove Clinton from office. About half of all
Americans now expect the Senate to hold a trial, but only 31
percent expect the Senate to remove Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's high approval rating might seem surprising, but in
fact is consistent with the entire polling history of this
incident. Clinton always seemed to do better following some event
or disclosure in the nearly year-long Lewinsky case. His previous
spikes in popularity came in January, after the public first
learned of the accusations against him, and in August, after he
acknowledged that he had had an affair with Ms. Lewinsky, his
previous denials notwithstanding.

   LONDON _ All the world's a casino and everyone is a player. Or
so it seems these days.
</P>
<P>
   I have been gambling in Moscow, where it takes more courage to
walk out of a dubious dive with your winnings than to venture
through the doorway.
</P>
<P>
   Among the high rollers in London, I have been pampered by
periwigged footmen bearing caviar and champagne. And my first
resolution for the New Year is to stay at Bellagio, the latest
wonder on the Las Vegas Strip.
</P>
<P>
   Christmas in a casino? No problem. Once taboo, gambling resorts
have become family destinations for the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone can gamble to their heart's content. And if they cannot
get to a casino or a lottery terminal, electronic gambling, outside
the jurisdiction of any regulatory authority, is available on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The pro-gambling forces in the United States have recently
scored a great victory at the ballot box, when opponents of
gambling were routed across the country. New opportunities to play
the lottery and slot machines are on the way.
</P>
<P>
   The same momentum holds true across Europe. In Britain, the
lottery is the most successful commercial enterprise since Sir
Walter Raleigh brought tobacco to the court of Queen Elizabeth I,
with 30 million people buying tickets every week.
</P>
<P>
   What is going on? Why the worldwide fever to gamble? The answer
is that people have always liked to gamble. Even in prehistoric
graves, some of the dice were found to be loaded. But in previous
times, the desire to gamble, which has flared up in most societies,
has usually been suppressed, by church or state.
</P>
<P>
   In the Middle Ages gambling was regarded as a sin against the
laws of God. A century ago, gambling was seen as a vice, a social
crime like prostitution. But now anything goes. It is simply part
of the leisure industry.
</P>
<P>
   There are obvious dangers _ and not just for the unfortunate
compulsive gambler. For casinos, there may soon be too much
gambling for all the competing interests to survive.
</P>
<P>
   The recent battle between the Indian casinos in California,
wanting to move into slot machines, and the Nevada gaming industry
trying to stop them, was probably the most expensive campaign in
American history.
</P>
<P>
   Costing over $100 million, it was on a par with the two main
candidates' expenditure in the last presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Las Vegas lost this one, but the resort is always one step
ahead. The casinos have discovered that they can make as much
money, if not more, from other attractions like theme parks and
rides. Win some. Lose some.
</P>
<P>
   The Asian crisis has hit the high end of the market, especially
London's casinos. The Asian high rollers are staying away. But no
one doubts that when the good times roll again, the gamblers will
return.
</P>
<P>
   On the gamblers' side, how to control the current gambling
fever? A major debate has now begun in America in the forum of the
National Gambling Impact Commission, instigated two years ago by
Reverend Tom Grey, an evangelical foe of gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Grey talks a good game. But he knows he does not have a prayer
against the massed forces of Nevada, led by the former Republican
fund-raiser Frank Fahrenkopf.
</P>
<P>
   The most the commission will do, observers believe, is to put
forward a series of mild recommendations, which Congress can then
mull over at leisure.
</P>
<P>
   One of these proposals could be to provide help to gamblers who
have a ``problem,'' which is the polite term used for compulsive
gambling.
</P>
<P>
   The American casino industry realizes it had better get moving,
by funding research and treatment for problem gamblers. The
consequences of doing nothing is demonstrated by what happened to
the tobacco industry. Fines, lost markets, pariah status.
</P>
<P>
   Across Europe, governments see casino gambling as a way of
attracting foreign currency and stimulating growth. Well, most of
them do. Turkey recently closed its casinos on moral grounds. And
gambling is strictly forbidden in Israel. But gamblers are now
being lured from the Promised Land to a casino in Jericho in the
Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
   These days, there is always somewhere new to win (or lose) your
money. &QL;

   BEIRUT _ I called up a Saudi journalist friend of mine Thursday
and told him Downing Street was claiming the attack on Iraq was
intended to protect the Arab Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zbeili,'' he shouted down the phone to me. ``Zbeili'' is
Arabic for garbage. ``Why do you want to kill more of those poor
people?''
</P>
<P>
   The spin doctors are trying to present the Anglo-American
assault on Iraq in all its old 1991 Gulf War purity. Iraq's
neighbors are under threat and must be safeguarded from his weapons
of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   But with the exception of Kuwait _ some of whose citizens
repeated their now-familiar routine of fleeing over the Saudi
border every time the Iraqi crisis reemerges, the Arab Gulf states
wanted none of the West's protection Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the West Bank, where President Bill Clinton's visit this
week had produced the largest American banners ever seen in the
Arab world, they were back to burning the U.S. flag and shouting
``death to Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had sung with a Palestinian choir in Bethlehem three
days ago; Thursday, crowds near Manger Square were throwing stones
at Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought he (Clinton) carried a message of peace,'' a
disgruntled Palestinian girl said. ``But now it is clear he is a
murderer.''
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to underestimate the degree of cynicism and
distrust that is now felt in the Arab world towards the United
States and the only ally to support Washington in the attack on
Iraq, Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Why, the Saudis were asking privately this week, did America and
Britain continue to pretend that the Saudis supported the
bombardment when as long ago as last February, Saudi Arabia had
refused permission for the United States to use its air-bases for
raids on Iraq?
</P>
<P>
   It now transpires that when the U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen sought Saudi help during November's crisis with Iraq, Crown
Prince Abdullah not only refused assistance but suggested that the
United States might soon be asked to remove its aircraft from Saudi
air bases altogether.
</P>
<P>
   The painful truth is that most of the Arab dictatorships are
more fearful of their own people than they are of Saddam Hussein _
especially when ordinary Arabs are angry with their governments
because of their support for Washington.
</P>
<P>
   An example of this came in Cairo where 3,000 students poured
onto the streets to protest at the American attack. State security
police patrolled the university district.
</P>
<P>
   Even Iraq's traditional enemies expressed revulsion at the
bombardment. In the Iranian capital, Tehran, a foreign ministry
official said the attacks ``will lead to even more pain and misery
for the people of that country and will bring about insecurity in
the region.''
</P>
<P>
   The pro-Iranian Hezbollah guerrilla movement in Lebanon
condemned what it called ``American-British aggression'' which, it
feared, would be used by Saddam Hussein's regime ``as an excuse for
further atrocious massacres against the Iraqi people.''
</P>
<P>
   The word ``aggression'' _ `iitidak' in Arabic _ was used, too,
by Esmat Abdel-Meguid, the Secretary General of the Arab League,
and by Selim el-Hoss, the Lebanese prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we condemn this attack on Iraq,'' el-Hoss said, ``we are
astonished by the fact that Israel alone among the regional states
is free from the constraints and controls of possessing mass
destruction weapons.``
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, hypocrisy was what came across in many Arab newspaper
headlines. ``Desert Fox operation postpones Clinton's
impeachment,'' the Lebanese daily ``As Safir'' announced. ``Once
again, it is our flesh that is being eaten, and it is our blood
that is being shed. Let the perpetrators (of the air strike)...go
to hell.''
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton launched air strikes against Afghanistan and Sudan
at the height of the Monica Lewinsky scandal, the Arabs refused to
believe it was coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   Now he has attacked Iraq at the moment of impeachment hearings,
there is probably not a soul in the Arab world who does not believe
Iraqis are dying and suffering to save the Clinton presidency.
</P>
<P>
   America's failure to ensure that Israel honors the Oslo and Wye
agreements _ what is seen as Clinton's cowardice in the face of the
Israeli lobby in Washington _ is contrasted with his gung-ho,
bellicose attitude towards Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is it about Iraq that obsesses America?'' my Saudi friend
asked. ``There are plenty of terrible people in the region. Do you
want to destroy Iraq and its people?''
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to many news reports, American fixed-wing aircraft _ as
well as Cruise missiles _ were flying over Baghdad on Wednesday
night. ``We heard the planes very clearly as well as the missiles
which were literally whooshing over our heads in the darkness,''
one Westerner told me from Baghdad. ``There were a lot of impacts
near us _ and they weren't all from missiles.''
</P>
<P>
   The aircraft may well have flown from the one Arab Gulf state
which wants to help any American strike at Iraq and which still
hates and fears Saddam: Kuwait. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   We are now in the endgame, the final bankruptcy of western
policy towards Iraq, the very last throw of the dice.
</P>
<P>
   We fire 200 Cruise missiles into Iraq and what do we expect? Is
a chastened Saddam Hussein going to emerge from his bunker to
explain to us how sorry he is? Will he tell us how much he wants
those nice U.N. inspectors to return to Baghdad to find his
``weapons of mass destruction?''
</P>
<P>
   Is that what we think? Is that what the Anglo-American
bombardment is all about? And if so, what happens afterwards? What
happens when the missile attacks end _ just before the Muslim holy
month of Ramadan, because of course we really are very sensitive
about Iraqi religious feelings _ and Saddam Hussein tells us that
the U.N. inspectors will never be allowed to return?
</P>
<P>
   As the Cruise missiles were launched, President Clinton
announced that Saddam had ``disarmed the (U.N.) inspectors'' and
Tony Blair _ agonizing about the lives of the ``British forces''
involved (all 14 pilots) _ told us that ``we act because we must.''
</P>
<P>
   In so infantile a manner did we go to war on Wednesday night. No
policies, no perspective. Not the slightest hint as to what happens
after the bombardment ends.
</P>
<P>
   With no U.N. inspectors back in Iraq, what are we going to do?
Declare eternal war against Iraq? We are ``punishing'' Saddam _ or
so Blair would have us believe. And all the old cliches are being
trundled out.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, just before he bombed them, Ronald Reagan told the
Libyans that the United States ``had no quarrel with the Libyan
people.'' In 1991, just before he bombed them, George Bush told the
Iraqis that he ``had no quarrel with the Iraqi people.'' And now we
have Tony Blair _ as he bombs them _ telling Iraqis that, yes, he
``has no quarrel with the Iraqi people.''
</P>
<P>
   Is there a computer that churns out this stuff? Is there a
cliche department at Downing Street which also provides Robin Cook
with the tired phrase of the American Secretary of State, Madeleine
Albright about how Saddam used gas ``against his own people.''
</P>
<P>
   For little did we care when he did use that gas against the
Kurds of Halabja _ because, at the time, those Kurds were allied to
Iran and we, the West, were supporting Saddam's invasion of Iran.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of any sane long-term policy towards Iraq is the
giveaway. Our patience _ according to Clinton and Blair _ is
exhausted. Saddam cannot be trusted to keep his word (they've just
realized). And so Saddam's ability to ``threaten his neighbors'' _
neighbors who don't actually want us to bomb Iraq _ has to be
``degraded.''
</P>
<P>
   That word ``degraded'' is a military term, first used by General
Schwarzkopf and his boys in the 1991 Gulf War, and it is now part
of the vocabulary of the weak.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam's weapons of mass destruction have to be ``degraded.''
</P>
<P>
   How? The U.N. weapons inspectors _ led for most of the time by
Scott Ritter, (the man who has admitted he kept flying to Israel to
liaise with Israeli military intelligence) could not find out where
Saddam's nuclear, biological and chemical weapons were hidden.
</P>
<P>
   They had been harrassed by Iraq's intelligence thugs and
prevented from doing their work. Now we are bombing the weapons
facilities which the inspectors could not find.
</P>
<P>
   Or are we? For there is a very serious question that is not
being asked: if the inspectors couldn't find the weapons, how come
we know where to fire the Cruise missiles?
</P>
<P>
   And all the while, we continue to impose genocidal sanctions on
Iraq, sanctions that are killing innocent Iraqis and _ by the
admission of Cook and Mrs. Albright _ are not harming Saddam at
all.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Albright rages at Saddam's ability to go on building
palaces and Cook is obsessed with the regime's purchase of
liposuction equipment which, if true, merely proves that sanctions
are a total failure.
</P>
<P>
   Cook prattles on about how Iraq can sell over $10 billion of oil
a year to pay for food, medicine and other humanitarian goods. But
since more than 30 percent of these oil revenues are diverted to
the U.N. compensation fund and U.N. expenses in Iraq, his statement
is totally untrue.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Halliday, the man who ran the U.N. oil-for-food program
in Baghdad until he realized that thousands of Iraqi children were
dying every month because of sanctions, resigned his post with the
declaration that ``we are in the process of destroying an entire
society...it is illegal and immoral.''
</P>
<P>
   So either Halliday is a pathological liar _ which I do not
believe _ or Cook has a serious problem with the truth _ which I do
believe.
</P>
<P>
   Now we are bombing the people who are suffering under our
sanctions. Not to mention the small matter of the explosion of
child cancer in southern Iraq, most probably as a result of the
Allied use of depleted uranium shells during the 1991 war.
</P>
<P>
   Gulf War veterans may be afflicted with the same sickness,
although the British government refuses to contemplate the
possibility. And what, in this latest missile strike, are some of
our warheads made of? Depleted uranium, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe there really is a plan afoot for a coup d'etat, though
hopefully more ambitious than our call to the Iraqi people to rise
up against their dictator in 1991, when they were abandoned by the
Allies they thought would speed to their rescue.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton says he wants a democracy in Iraq _ as fanciful a
suggestion as any made recently. He is demanding an Iraqi
government that ``represents its people'' and ``respects'' its
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   What hollow laughter greets such an utterance when not a single
Arab regime _ especially Washington's friends in Saudi Arabia _
offers such luxuries to its people?
</P>
<P>
   We are supposed to believe, it seems, that Washington and London
are really terribly keen to favor the Iraqi people with a
fully-fledged democracy.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, what we want in Iraq is another bullying dictator in
the Saddam mold _ but one who will do as he is told, invade the
countries we wish to see invaded (Iran) and respect the integrity
of those countries we do not wish to see invaded (Kuwait).
</P>
<P>
   Yet no questions are being asked, no lies uncovered. Ritter, the
Marine Corps inspector who worked with Israeli intelligence,
claimed that Richard Butler _ the man whose report triggered this
week's new war _ was aware of his visits to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Is that true? Has anyone asked Butler? Indeed, dare we ask? He
may well have avoided such contacts _ but it would be nice to have
an answer.
</P>
<P>
   So what to do with Saddam? Well first, we could abandon the
wicked sanctions regime against Iraq. We have taken enough innocent
lives. We have killed enough children.
</P>
<P>
   Then we could back the real supporters of democracy in Iraq _
not the ghouls and spooks who make up the so-called Iraqi National
Congress but the genuine dissidents who gathered in Beirut in 1991
to demand freedom for their country but who were swiftly ignored by
the Americans once it became clear that they didn't want a
pro-western strongman to lead them.
</P>
<P>
   And we could stop believing in Washington. Vice President Al
Gore told Americans this week that it was a time for ``national
resolve and unity.'' You might have thought the Japanese had just
bombed Pearl Harbor or that General Douglas MacArthur had just
abandoned Bataan.
</P>
<P>
   When President Clinton faced the worst of the Monica Lewinsky
scandal, he bombed Afghanistan and Sudan. Faced with impeachment,
he now bombs Iraq. How far can a coincidence go?
</P>
<P>
   This week, two Christian armies _ America's and Britain's _ went
to war with a Muslim nation, Iraq. With no goals but with an army
of platitudes, they have abandoned the U.N.'s weapons control
system, closed the door forever on arms inspections and opened the
door to an unlimited military offensive against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   And nobody has asked the obvious question: what happens next? &QL;

   LONDON _ British government fears that the television coverage
of bombing Iraq could turn public opinion against the war were
highlighted Friday with a Downing Street warning to ``place a
health warning'' on some of the coverage from Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   As reports came in of an Iraqi hospital being damaged by a blast
from a cruise missile in Baghdad, the Prime Minister's official
spokesman urged journalists not to be taken in by the Iraqi
propaganda machine.
</P>
<P>
   He claimed Western television film crews had been duped in the
Gulf War over the highly publicized bombing of a Iraqi plant making
baby's milk.
</P>
<P>
   The Downing Street spokesman said on another occasion, workmen
had been seen shortly before the television crews arrived, removing
slates from another building to make it appear it had been hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``There should be a health warning attached to what the media is
allowed to see,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Downing Street spokesman said that much of the bombing was
being directed at military targets outside Baghdad, believed to
include the barracks of the Republican Guard. This was not being
shown because film crews were being tightly controlled.
</P>
<P>
   Television reporters in the Iraqi capital are being escorted to
sites chosen by Saddam Hussein's regime. So far these have been
sites the Iraqis claim are civilian buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Most pictures are coming from crews on the roof of the
Information Ministry. Some other pictures are also coming from the
roof of the Al-Rashid Hotel where most journalists are staying.
When the bombing begins, all foreign journalists have been ordered
to stay either at the ministry or their hotel. &QL;

   PARIS _ The far-right National Front symbolically and publicly
divided into two parties Friday, confirming a 10-day-old schism
which now seems irreparable.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Marie Le Pen, the party's founder president, and his
internal rival Bruno Megret, ``met'' for the first time since the
NF imploded. They each took their seats in the regional assembly
for Provence, the Alps and the Cote d'Azur in Marseilles.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, they had sat side by side. Friday, they sat apart,
proudly avoiding one another's gaze, and surrounded by their
respective supporters.
</P>
<P>
   At Le Pen's insistence, Megret and 10 of the 37 NF regional
councillors were made to sit apart from the rest of the group. Also
at Le Pen's insistence, they sat to the far right of the assembly,
even further to the right than the NF president and his loyalists.
</P>
<P>
   The battle between the two wings of the NF _ the Le Pen
loyalists and purists and the Megret modernizers _ has been fought,
in part, with infantile pique of this kind. But it has also
developed into a legal struggle for the party's money and the
party's name.
</P>
<P>
   As Megret put it: ``The historic Front is them. The real Front
is us. The problem now is to decide which of us is the legal
Front.''
</P>
<P>
   Megret's supporters say they have more than the 20 percent of
signatures of NF members they need to call an emergency conference
to decide the party's future. Le Pen refuses to countenance such a
meeting. The Megretistes will go ahead anyway and hold their
congress at Marignane, north of Marseilles, on Jan. 24.
</P>
<P>
   This meeting will almost certainly declare Le Pen deposed and
elect Megret as head of his ``real'' NF. First indications from
around the country are that the party has been carved down the
middle.
</P>
<P>
   Although Le Pen took the majority of NF regional councillors in
the south, Megret has the overwhelming majority in Lorraine and
exactly half in the Paris region. He also has two of the four NF
mayors (including his own wife) and more than half the NF national
council. &QL;

   There is never a good time to impeach a U.S. president, since
the so-called head of the free world is always busy striving to
pacify some world trouble-spot.
</P>
<P>
   It must seem particularly cruel to Bill Clinton that he faces
trial at exactly the same time as he is ordering troops into
battle; but to be realistic, when has he been free of such
troubles? When he was ordering Marines into Somalia? When he was
making peace in Northern Ireland? Or on the previous occasions when
he has bombed Iraq?
</P>
<P>
   National leaders have always been assailed without regard to the
crises their nations face.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Johnson, the only other president to be impeached, was
struggling with the challenge of reconstruction after the American
Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats showed no mercy to Richard Nixon, embroiled in
Vietnam, opening up Western policy to China, and attempting detente
with the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, Margaret Thatcher was preparing for the Gulf war
when she was politically assassinated.
</P>
<P>
   Bombing in the Gulf makes no difference to the issues facing
Congress. Either the President has perjured himself, and committed
the ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' of which the Constitution
speaks, or he has not.
</P>
<P>
   The world's cynicism about the President's motives in ordering
military action should encourage a decision. The impeachment vote
may bring the crisis to a head, and renew America's
self-confidence.
</P>
<P>
   If Congress decides to allow President Clinton to escape, he can
face the world with his mandate renewed. But if he is impeached,
his authority will be irreparably damaged. Then, for all our sakes,
he should resign, and allow a successor to govern with authority. &QL;

   PARIS _ The smell of the Metro _ something between burned air
and rotting bananas _ is a characteristic Parisian experience: as
much a part of the city for generations of visitors as the Eiffel
Tower or the Champs Elysees.
</P>
<P>
   The magic formula is, or used to be, a delicate blend of
scorched rubber, sweat and sewers. It also included the heavy scent
of Gauloises and Gitanes, until cigarettes were banned from the
Paris underground a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, that trademark aroma has deteriorated for other
reasons. Some of the homeless people who spend their days in Metro
stations treat the corridors and, even the platforms, as
lavatories.
</P>
<P>
   The Regie Autonome des Transports Parisiens (RATP), the
state-owned company which runs all public transport in the French
capital, commissioned an opinion poll to discover why Parisians
were using the Metro less. One of the most common replies was: ``ca
pue.'' (It stinks).
</P>
<P>
   The company decided to put things right in time for the
centenary of the Metro in 12 months' time.
</P>
<P>
   In an experiment which will probably be extended to the whole
system the RATP began Friday to suffuse one Metro station with a
scent, especially designed by one of the big French perfume
workshops.
</P>
<P>
   The perfume, called ``Madeleine,'' was created by Quest
International France, a laboratory which normally works for the
fashion designer and parfumeur, Thierry Mugler.
</P>
<P>
   The fragrance, described as having a ``hint of spring flowers,''
will be mixed with the existing cleaning agents and applied daily
to the platforms, corridors and floors of the Invalides station.
</P>
<P>
   If the experiment is a success, it will be applied to all 366
stations on the Metro system, and all 64 on its sister regional
network, the RER, in the course of next year.
</P>
<P>
   The RATP is also working on a more technologically advanced
solution: the use of ultraviolet light to smash the molecules
hanging in the air which create bad odors.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the old Metro smell seems likely to go the way of
berets and yellow car-headlights. Another ``exception francaise''
is about to disappear. &QL;

REPUBLICAN SENATORS SAY IMPEACHMENT TRIAL WILL BE HELD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Top Republican senators insisted Sunday that
President Clinton will stand trial on two articles of impeachment,
as the White House stepped up its quest for a censure alternative
and senators in both parties faced the prospect that a lurid trial
on the sex-related charges could shatter the dignity of all three
branches of government.
</P>
<P>
   Amid new polls that show growing support for Clinton despite his
impeachment, Senate GOP leaders said they will not shirk what they
consider their constitutional duty to begin only the second trial
of a president since the nation's founding.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Senate leaders left no doubt they recognize the
potentially explosive impact of a nationally televised trial on the
perjury and obstruction of justice charges stemming from Clinton's
consensual sexual affair in the White House with a young former
intern, Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Presided over by William Rehnquist, chief justice of the Supreme
Court, the trial could unfold largely as a ``he said, she said''
saga.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican who is expected
to play a pivotal role in the proceedings as chairman of the Senate
Rules Committee, echoed other GOP leaders in asserting the Senate
is obligated to try Clinton on the impeachment charges.
</P>
<P>
   But McConnell said the Senate, which has been embarrassed by
episodes such as the confirmation hearings of Supreme Court Justice
Clarence Thomas, could prevent further distress by taking private
testimony from the most controversial witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will not be a spectacle,'' McConnell said. ``It will not
demean the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the process may be thorny in the Senate, as advocates for
removing Clinton from office now lack the 67 votes required to
convict him and the president's supporters have yet to secure the
51 votes they would need to dismiss the charges. Republicans
outnumber Democrats in the Senate, 55 to 45.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton endured his first full day Sunday as the first
impeached president in 130 years, an angry parishioner shouted at
him as he left church services in Washington with his daughter,
Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Damn you, for what you've done to the nation!'' the man said.
``Please resign for the good of the world!''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Chelsea did not acknowledge the protest, waving
instead to dozens of supporters who cheered and raised signs that
said, ``God Bless Our Prez'' and ``Complete Your Term.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said Clinton had no intention of
resigning, despite fresh appeals from Republican senators for him
to step down. The senators appeared on news shows on several
television networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think it would be honorable for the president to
resign,'' said Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, a Texas Republican.
``From the things that he has admitted doing, he has degraded the
office of the presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   An NBC poll conducted immediately after Clinton's impeachment
showed his approval rating rising to 72 percent from 68 percent,
with 62 percent saying he should not relinquish his office. A poll
taken the same day by CBS and the New York Times found that 66
percent believed Clinton should not resign.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, a poll released by CNN and USA Today showed that only 29
percent want the Senate to remove Clinton from office, with 68
percent opposed to his ouster.
</P>
<P>
   However, Senator Jon Kyl, an Arizona Republican, cited a
separate poll showing that 45 percent thought Clinton should
resign. Kyl suggested the percentage may increase as GOP senators
continue to call for Clinton to step down. ``I believe the
president wants to avoid that number getting to 50 percent at all
costs,'' Kyl said.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides cited Clinton's pledge on Saturday to serve
his term ``until the final hour,'' which evoked memories of his
1992 vow in New Hampshire to persevere ``until the last dog dies.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, White House lawyers already were preparing Clinton's
defense, as the president's political aides worked behind the
scenes to forge support for a censure. The political team was
building on recent phone calls from Clinton to several influential
Democratic senators, including Edward M. Kennedy, and John B.
Breaux of Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   Breaux is a close friend of the Senate majority leader, Trent
Lott of Mississippi, and often plays a key role in creating
bipartisan coalitions, often with GOP senators from New England.
``I think the appropriate and proper penalty is a strong censure
resolution,'' Breaux said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But persuading at least six Republicans and all 45 Democrats to
short-circuit a formal trial may be problematic. Several Democrats,
particularly Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, are strict
adherents to constitutional standards, and they consider some form
of trial necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Some potential Republican allies also are far from open to a
censure plan. Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania expressed no
interest in an alternative to a trial and said ``resignation might
be a possibility'' later in the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``A censure is really not worth a tinker's damn,'' Specter said.
``When this trial starts, anything can happen. We've already seen
so many turns and twists in the road, and I think we're going to
see a lot more.''
</P>
<P>
   Morever, GOP leaders are not expected to tolerate moderate
Republicans quickly breaking ranks to stave off a trial, although
the leaders indicated they will try to satisfy the bipartisan
desire to complete the ordeal relatively quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Constitution says if you receive these articles, you'll
have a trial,'' said Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the assistant
majority leader. ``I think it can be done very quickly. Trent Lott
has said originally maybe three days to three weeks. I think he has
it about right. I think it could be done in three weeks if the
White House wanted to.''
</P>
<P>
   The most prominent Republican senator who has expressed
willingness to consider a censure is Orrin G. Hatch of Utah,
chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. If Republicans cannot
muster more than 55 votes against Clinton, Hatch said Sunday,
``then there has to be some consideration to what do you do that is
the best under the circumstances to resolve this matter and in the
best interests of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments after the House impeached Clinton, Lott sent all 100
senators a 26-page document outlining historical precedents for a
Senate trial. The memo is based largely on the last presidential
impeachment trial, when the Senate acquitted Andrew Johnson by a
single vote in 1868 amid the bitter partisanship of the
Reconstruction era after the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   No president has been convicted in a Senate trial. But the
Senate has voted for conviction on 30 articles of impeachment for
lower-ranking public figures, from US District Judge John Pickering
in 1804 to US District Judge Walter Nixon in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the House approved 13 members of the Judiciary
Committee to prosecute the Senate trial, led by the chairman, Henry
J. Hyde. Clinton's defense team will be spearheaded by the White
House counsel, Charles F.C. Ruff.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Ruff's failure to prevent the Judiciary Committee from
approving four impeachment charges against Clinton, two Democrats
on the panel said his job will be easier in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts representatives Barney Frank and William D.
Delahunt said the charge that Clinton lied to a federal grand jury
relates almost entirely to details of his sexual relationship with
Lewinsky and will be hard to prove because the president
acknowledged to the grand jury that he had engaged in
``inappropriate intimate contact'' with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Frank and Delahunt also predicted the obstruction charge would
be hard to prosecute because witnesses largely support the
president's testimony, particularly his personal secretary, Betty
Currie, and his close friend Vernon E. Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   The toughest charge for Clinton to overcome, according to Frank
and Delahunt, would have been the allegation that he repeatedly
lied under oath about a number of issues in the sexual harassment
case that Paula Corbin Jones filed against him and settled last
month for $850,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guts of the case have been ripped out,'' Delahunt said.
``The evidence on these two articles will never meet the higher
standard of the US Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Several senators said the case is as critical to the Senate's
image as it is for Clinton. ``In many ways, the Senate's on trial
here, too,'' said Senator Christopher J. Dodd, a Connecticut
Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Criticizing the nearly party-line impeachment vote in the House,
Senator Patrick J. Leahy, a Vermont Democrat said, ``I think we can
restore political sanity in the Senate.''

<P>
   A sense of desperation attends the decision to launch the latest
wave of air strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The man who took the decision, Bill Clinton, was facing an
imminent vote in the House of Representatives on his impeachment;
what better way to show that he was worthy of the office of
President of the United States than to exercise, in a statesmanlike
way, the authority it gives him as commander-in-chief of his
country's armed forces?
</P>
<P>
   The man against whom the decision was taken, Saddam Hussein, is
desperate too, constrained by sanctions, dogged by arms inspectors,
hated by everyone and, eight years after the end of the Gulf war,
still without hope of shaking off his pursuers.
</P>
<P>
   As for the wider world _ in different degrees frightened of
Hussein, worried about the spread of weapons of mass destruction,
apprehensive about the use of force against a sovereign country _
it too has grown exasperated, ever more conscious that the Iraqi
dictator presents problems that never seem to go away and that have
no straightforward solution.
</P>
<P>
   If all this is unsatisfactory, so too perhaps was the trigger
for Operation Desert Fox, a report by Richard Butler, the head of
the team of U.N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   This showed that Hussein had not fully cooperated with the
UNSCOM inspectors, as he had promised to, but it was not
unambiguously clear that his lack of cooperation had in fact been
designed to prevent UNSCOM from doing its job.
</P>
<P>
   Another, awkwardly plausible interpretation is that Hussein's
obstructiveness may have been designed to stop the inspectors, and
the Israelis to whom he assumes they pass all the information they
gather, from learning about all sorts of secrets not directly
related to weapons-making.
</P>
<P>
   Still, America _ and Britain, which has also joined the
operation _ had always said that any failure by Hussein to keep his
word would bring an attack, without further ado, and the Iraqi
therefore commands little real sympathy, whatever the public
denunciations of the decision to launch the air strikes by China,
Russia, some Arabs and, to a lesser extent, France.
</P>
<P>
   Even Arab sympathizers lost patience with Hussein on the last
occasion, in November, when he stopped cooperating with the U.N.,
and most people, whether friend or foe of Iraq, must have felt that
there was an inevitability about these strikes.
</P>
<P>
   That they should have come now, at Clinton's hour of need _ just
as an earlier strike, in August, against an apparently innocent
factory in Sudan came at another hour of need for the American
president _ is unfortunate, to say the least. Yet they should be
judged, in the end, on their effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   If they succeed in achieving their stated aim, that will be
welcome. But merely to ``degrade Saddam's capacity to develop and
deliver weapons of mass destruction and to degrade his ability to
threaten his neighbors,'' is not ambitious, and will not solve the
long-run problem.
</P>
<P>
   This, as Clinton and other American officials have been making
ever more explicitly clear, is Hussein himself.
</P>
<P>
   No one can be sure how, or when, Hussein will leave office. He
could be thrown out tomorrow, or hang on, as Fidel Castro has in
Cuba, to infuriate American presidents for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   But if this round of air strikes should prove to be the lever
that prises him from power, the world will surely judge them a
success. It may even swallow some of its cynicism about the man who
ordered them at such a fortuitous time. &QL;

that prises him from power, the world will surely judge them a
success. It may even swallow some of its cynicism about the man who
ordered them at such a fortuitous time. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Can anything, after the turbulence of 1998, still be considered
unthinkable? Ostriches everywhere have had to pull their heads from
the sand.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, many people would have counted an East Asian
economic collapse as unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, before the sudden fame of a woman called Monica, so
too would have been a vote to impeach President Bill Clinton, or,
indeed, widespread calls for his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Oil at $10 a barrel? Bill Gates on the defensive? The overthrow
of President Suharto of Indonesia? The fall and then private-sector
rescue of Long-Term Capital Management? George Soros arguing that
speculators should be restrained?
</P>
<P>
   The conclusion seems inescapable: if you are taking something
for granted, don't.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of things are, nevertheless, still taken for granted. Is
it really right to assume, as many do, that nuclear weapons will
never be used by states, that democracy will continue to spread,
that China will not break up, that shares are always the best
long-term investment?
</P>
<P>
   Those unthinkables are likely to be challenged over a period of
years or even decades. As soon as 1999, however, a different but
just as widespread assumption will face its stiffest challenge yet:
the idea that globalization is irreversible.
</P>
<P>
   That ugly, 13-letter word has become a mantra of business, of
politics, even of culture.
</P>
<P>
   This decade has seen a remarkable increase in the openness to
trade and investment flows of country after country: partly because
of the demise of Soviet communism and of old ideas of socialist
self-sufficiency; partly because of liberalizations agreed upon
during the Uruguay round of what was then the GATT and is now the
World Trade Organization; and partly because of the rapid,
world-shrinking spread of new information technology.
</P>
<P>
   Like it or not, foreign businesses, foreign investors and
foreign (especially American) culture have penetrated deeply into
most countries' domestic lives.
</P>
<P>
   Some countries have tried to slow this penetration down. But few
have resisted it altogether. The mix of unstoppable technological
change with the apparently unanswerable intellectual defeat of
central planning has made globalization appear inevitable: only its
speed and its consequences seem open to debate.
</P>
<P>
   Would that it were so. The effort to reverse this movement has
already begun. Next year, most probably, that effort will move into
a higher gear.
</P>
<P>
   The reason, at least, is plain to all, save possibly investors
in American shares: world recession. No one can be sure about the
future course of the world economy, even a few months ahead let
alone a year.
</P>
<P>
   But it does look likely that next year, economic growth for the
world as a whole is going to be even slower than for 1998, perhaps
a lot slower.
</P>
<P>
   For a Japanese, a South Korean, an Indonesian or even,
increasingly, a Brazilian, that will be no surprise. Those parts of
the world are already in a real recession, and there is little
reason to expect much of a recovery before 1999's second half, at
the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's financial troubles continue to mount, despite government
package after government package. The pace of economic shrinkage
seems to have been slowed in Korea and Thailand, but neither there
nor in Indonesia or Malaysia has much progress been made on
structural reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil, recently rescued by a $41 billion IMF-led consortium,
looks shaky: with public-spending cuts blocked by Congress, capital
flight has resumed and the real again looks a candidate for
devaluation.
</P>
<P>
   China, too, long East Asia's gravity-defying hero, looks likely
to slow and quite possibly to devalue.
</P>
<P>
   That is all bad, but there is nothing unthinkable there. Nor
does this yet threaten globalization. A cause for optimism during
the past two years has been the fact that, so far, none of the
recession-hit emerging markets has raised its formal trade
barriers, and (excepting small, maverick Malaysia and large,
lunatic Russia) none has revived barriers to capital flows.
</P>
<P>
   Governments may really believe that globalization is inevitable.
Or they may be so desperate for capital, from the IMF, from western
governments or from private investors, that they think they have no
short-term alternative to openness.
</P>
<P>
   So and far are two important words. The most important test will
come not in the vulnerable economies of the developing world, nor
in Japan, but in the rich, developed world that provides most of
that capital and sets the tone on trade and investment rules.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 1 the European Union will launch its single currency to
much acclaim but not, alas, amid the strengthening economic
recovery that looked likely earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment may well start to rise again in the euro countries,
posing immediately a clash between national politics and the
collective, EU interest.
</P>
<P>
   If so, the risk is either of a political dust-up between the
main euro countries, most notably France and Germany, or of a
deflection of that pressure on to the outside world, through an
increase in the EU's already strong protectionist tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   The United States will offer the biggest test of all. This year,
buoyed by consumers, its economy has been remarkably strong. A
modest slowdown in 1999 is widely expected.
</P>
<P>
   A nastier time looks possible, however, as companies cut their
capital investment and as (or if) Wall Street's stock market bubble
bursts, making consumers feel poorer and companies more worried.
</P>
<P>
   Further interest-rate cuts might limit the damage; an
expansionary fiscal policy might also help; but neither is likely
to avert a slowdown altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Already, even with American unemployment at record postwar lows
and the economy steaming ahead, industries such as steel and memory
chips have resorted to anti-dumping suits to protect themselves
against imports.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has berated Europeans for not importing more
goods from Asia and thus taking the heat out of America's growing
current-account deficit. Slower growth or a full recession can only
boost the protectionist voice.
</P>
<P>
   The real question is how strong it will get. With a wounded
presidency and the 2000 election-campaign getting under way, the
defenses against it will be weakened.
</P>
<P>
   And if protectionism breaks through in the United States? Then,
the likelihood is that other, smaller, more genuinely vulnerable
countries would turn protectionist too, partly in retaliation but
partly also out of opportunism.
</P>
<P>
   Such a verdict is, in truth, a rather gloomy thing to write at
Christmas. But it offers a realistic way to think about 1999.
</P>
<P>
   This will be the first proper test of globalization. If the test
is passed, this slowdown could prove short, the subsequent recovery
strong and fruitful. If it is failed, and markets are closed, the
recession could prove long and painful.
</P>
<P>
   That is the choice. It would take an ostrich to pretend
otherwise. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton has adopted a two-track approach
to his pending impeachment trial in the Senate, preparing to mount
a vigorous legal defense while seeking to reach a compromise on a
resolution of condemnation that would allow him to keep his job,
White House officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But the strategy may founder in the Senate for the same reason
it failed so spectacularly in the House, which on Saturday passed
two articles of impeachment accusing Clinton of lying under oath
before a federal grand jury and obstructing justice. Clinton is not
prepared to confess to those charges, a senior Clinton legal
adviser said Sunday, because he does not believe he committed them.
</P>
<P>
   Former Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter on Monday will
propose a swift end to the impeachment crisis through a bipartisan
censure resolution voted by the Senate and accepted by Clinton. The
proposal, to appear as an Op-Ed article in Monday's New York Times,
would require Clinton to publicly acknowledge that he lied under
oath.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials welcomed the proposal from Ford and
Carter, one of several offered by senior figures of both parties in
recent weeks, as evidence of a bipartisan desire to end the
impeachment ordeal. But they cautioned that Clinton remains
adamantly opposed to any admission of perjury.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion that he's going to come forward and say he lied is
not going to happen,'' said Gregory Craig, the White House
coordinator of the president's defense. ``He's not going to concede
he lied to the grand jury, because he did not.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's legal team is ready for a Senate proceeding that
will begin shortly after the body convenes on Jan. 6, officials
said. White House lawyers are preparing a series of motions
questioning the legitimacy of impeachment articles voted by a
lame-duck Congress and demanding that the charges against Clinton
be spelled out in detail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going forward to prepare for trial,'' said Craig.
``We're getting ready the legal arguments. We're getting ready the
motions practice. We're getting ready to present evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig and Charles Ruff, the White House counsel, will lead the
president's defense in the Senate, as they did in the House. They
intend to rely on the same factual and constitutional arguments
that were not persuasive in the House, with one important
rhetorical difference. They can no longer claim that the
accusations against Clinton do not warrant impeachment; a narrow
majority in the House declared on Saturday that they do.
</P>
<P>
   Now the president's lawyers have begun to put forward the
argument that they do not form sufficient grounds to warrant
Clinton's removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have the burden of making the case that even if the
evidence and all the allegations are true, it rises to the level,
constitutional level, that this man should be removed from
office,'' Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   But even as they prepare an aggressive legal defense, White
House officials are openly pleading for senators to find a means to
punish Clinton with a measure short of removal from office. They
are hoping that it will be easier to reach an accommodation in the
Senate, which is less sharply divided on factional lines and which
by tradition is more attuned to compromise than is the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where there's a will, there's a way,'' John Podesta, the White
House chief of staff, said in an appearance on the Cable News
Network. ``If a majority of the Senate wants to do that, they will
find a way to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another White House official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said that the president's defenders will continue to
call attention to the sharply partisan vote in the House to impeach
Clinton. They are heartened by polls that show a rise in Clinton's
popularity after the impeachment vote and a continuing decline in
public approval of the way Congress conducts its business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The House showed that a partisan majority can do whatever it
wants,'' this official said. ``The Senate, by nature, by custom, by
rule, is a different place. A partisan majority cannot ramrod
something, because of the filibuster rule and the two-thirds
requirement for impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   While White House aides expressed confidence that the Senate
would not vote to convict and remove the president, they appeared
in no hurry to begin the actual trial. One senior presidential
adviser said that the more time passes, the less popular Congress
becomes and the stronger public sentiment for an end to the crisis
grows.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more you delay it, the more angry the public becomes,''
this adviser said.
</P>
<P>
   The president's lawyers will work through the holidays preparing
his Senate defense, while hoping that it will not be needed.
</P>
<P>
   One White House legal adviser said he believed that any censure
compromise would come only after a formal trial has opened.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good number of senators believe this cannot be resolved
without at least beginning a trial,'' the lawyer said, on condition
of anonymity. ``We have to be ready to do that, and we have to be
deferential to their view of what is required by the
Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   In remarks at the White House after the impeachment vote,
Clinton pleaded for an end to the partisanship that he described as
poisoning Washington. He said that meeting the nation's challenges
required an atmosphere of ``decency and civility, some presumption
of good faith, some sense of proportionality and balance in
bringing judgment against those who are in different parties.''
</P>
<P>
   But on Sunday morning on television, James Carville, the
president's most hard-edged adviser, put Republicans on notice that
he and other Clinton partisans would continue to attack them for
the near party-line vote to impeach the president.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``There's going to be retribution,'' Carville warned darkly on
the holiday-decorated set of NBC's ``Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
   Most senior White House officials took the day off, their first
respite in weeks of building tension.
</P>
<P>
   The president attended church in the morning with his daughter,
Chelsea, and his stepfather, Dick Kelley.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Walter Shropshire of the Foundry United Methodist
Church began the service by noting the events of the past turbulent
week, which included not only the impeachment of the president but
a furious four-day bombardment of Iraq and the resignation of Rep.
Bob Livingston, the speaker-elect. He led a silent prayer for the
nation and its leaders, U.S. forces overseas and the people of
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton left the church hand in hand with Chelsea, he was met
by a heckler who demanded his resignation, and applause from a
handful of supporters.
</P>
<P>
   One carried a placard reading, ``God Bless our Prez.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, when Japan's economy first slowed, there was
a popular explanation for its refusal to speed up again. Japanese
consumers, this theory went, had bought so many gadgets during the
go-go years that they now declined to spend a single yen on new
ones.
</P>
<P>
   Late-1990s America presents a gleaming contrast. Despite the
long boom, Americans are pursuing material happiness during this
holiday season with unwavering zeal.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, the notion that they may run out of things to
buy seems laughable _ especially when you visit the mother of 1990s
consumer temples, just off a freeway in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The temple in question is the flagship store of REI, a
camping/sporting/outdoor retailer. You can buy kayaks and snowshoes
and anti-sting kits, indeed everything you might require to master
nature's various elements.
</P>
<P>
   You can buy clips and ropes and ingenious spring-loaded clamps,
all essential for turning sheer rocks into climbing frames for
adults. Upstairs, you may test a hundred types of shoe on a
convenient indoor hiking path. You may choose a waterproof jacket,
and check to see if it really keeps the moisture out by stepping
into a rain room.
</P>
<P>
   The choosing is no simple matter. The clothing at REI features a
bewildering variety of fabrics, lightweight or heavy-duty,
odor-eating or moisture-wicking, Gore-Tex, Spandex and Cordura.
</P>
<P>
   Over in the camping section, even the humble water filter
assumes an intimidating mien. Should you choose the ceramic
micro-strainer or the carbon-core membrane, the iodine resin or the
pleated glass fiber?
</P>
<P>
   To grapple with these issues, you must read a pamphlet, prepared
by REI's thoughtful staff. This describes which microorganisms are
caught by which filtration technology; no single device can be
relied upon to trap all of them.
</P>
<P>
   The prudent course, it seems, is to buy 11 filters and drain
water through each one. But what if a key filter cracks? ``Always
carry spare elements, parts and backup water treatment method,''
intones the pamphlet.
</P>
<P>
   Across America, there are now 51 REI stores, up from 26 in 1990;
and each year 1.5 million visitors flock to the mother temple in
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Some no doubt come to gawp: at the world's highest artificial
climbing spire, laid on for shoppers to test climbing shoes; or at
the cafeteria's bewildering variety of ethnic foods (which come
with another set of instructions, naturally).
</P>
<P>
   But other visitors go to REI with more serious intent. They know
that ambling through the countryside on a weekend afternoon carries
an intolerable opportunity cost: the time could be so much better
spent on greater things, such as whitewater canoeing or off-road
biking.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you choose deliberately not to live life to the full, you
will want to try these sports. Therefore, you realize, you will
need REI's equipment.
</P>
<P>
   And so, for opportunity maximizers at least, shopping at REI
becomes an existential duty.
</P>
<P>
   You must read the medical notes printed on REI's walls,
explaining the risks of exercising without a hydration pack
strapped on to your back, so that you can sip water regularly.
</P>
<P>
   You must master REI's high-tech gadgets, using one computer to
track your whereabouts and another to keep tabs on the weather.
</P>
<P>
   You must feed yourself with intensively nutritious vacuum-packed
objects. After all, with 11 water filters in your bag, there won't
be room for sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   Some people fret over this ingenious fuelling of materialism.
They see it as evidence of America's darker sides. Americans fret
that, for all their prosperity, life is increasingly stressful; if
buying a water filter has come to involve a chemistry lesson,
perhaps this is not surprising.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Americans worry about a growing class divide; and the
REI attitude to life is spreading mainly among a select group of
richly-compensated high achievers. One in two Americans, after all,
is nowadays classified as overweight; and one in four admits to
being wholly sedentary.
</P>
<P>
   You feel this class divide most sharply in the West, where the
REI way bumps up against a more traditional outdoorsiness.
</P>
<P>
   In the old mining towns of southern Utah, the locals load the
gun racks on their pickups, and rumble off into the wilderness to
hunt; but the taste for shooting at wildlife is being rapidly
displaced by the tourist taste for photographing it.
</P>
<P>
   The locals' pickups are rusting and gnarled; but the tourists
haul themselves up rocks with clips and clamps made out of
aerospace-grade metal.
</P>
<P>
   The locals see no virtue in unnecessary strain. But the tourists
bike up mountains undeterred by desert sun, trusting in health
insurance and helmets to save them from the consequences of their
bravado.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the rich have always sought out nature in ways that
others found bizarre. On a trip out West a century ago, Theodore
Roosevelt was bitten by a snake and pitched from a wagon on to his
head; he declared, in a rehearsal of today's mountain-bike
machismo, that this was ``very good fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, REI does represent a change. For one thing, Roosevelt
did not care what he wore. ``We are dressed about as badly as
mortals could be,'' he wrote of one youthful adventure: ``unshaven
faces, dirty gray shirts, still dirtier yellow trousers.''
</P>
<P>
   And, despite some interest in conservation, Roosevelt was an
environmental lout by modern standards. On a trip to Africa, he
killed nine lions, eight elephants and 13 rhinoceroses.
</P>
<P>
   The patricians of yesteryear resembled, in their approach to
nature at least, today's rougher members of the National Rifle
Association.
</P>
<P>
   The new masters of the information age are different. They want
to preserve the wilderness, but also to look smart in it; they have
taken the fastidious dressing and equipment fetishism of suburban
sports such as golf, and transported them to the great open spaces.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this makes for new social divisions, and occasionally
for stress; but it is fun, and it fuels the economy.
</P>
<P>
   So long as the boom lasts, America's mild economic anxieties
will pale next to Japan's. As it happens, REI aims to open its
first overseas store in Tokyo, in 2000. &QL;

<P>
   So Iraq is now under western bombardment. On Dec. 16, a month
after a previous raid was aborted at the last minute, Bill Clinton,
with Britain's Tony Blair in faithful tow, decided to punish Iraq
with missiles and bombs.
</P>
<P>
   The prompt for the current attack is a report by Richard Butler,
the chief of the U.N. inspection team (UNSCOM), that showed Saddam
Hussein had not complied with his pledge on Nov. 14 to allow UNSCOM
full access to all suspect sites.
</P>
<P>
   The response, in the Middle East and beyond, and the
consequences within Iraq itself, can only be guessed at.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been more straightforward if the attack had taken
place in November, when Hussein's behavior, in ending all
cooperation with UNSCOM's inspectors, was unequivocally condemned.
Few voices, at that time, were raised in the Iraqi dictator's
defense.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, the issues are cloudier, and feelings more
ambivalent: Russia, China and France, the three other permanent
members of the Security Council, are strongly against the attack;
the Arab world's first response was to express sorrow, cynicism and
outrage.
</P>
<P>
   Butler was reporting on Iraqi compliance in the four weeks since
Iraq averted air strikes by promising to cooperate fully with
UNSCOM's demands. The report said the promise had been broken: Iraq
was helpful in many routine ways but unhelpful in other ways and
those are the ways that matter.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's main transgression was to refuse to allow the inspectors,
who were testing Iraqi compliance with a series of unannounced
visits to sensitive sites, access to the ruling Baath Party's
offices unless they first said what they were looking for.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq had supposedly been hoping that Butler's report would open
the way for a comprehensive review by the Security Council of the
whole policy of sanctions and disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   But it plainly has things _ not necessarily of the
weapons-making kind _ that it would like to conceal from inspectors
it has come to regard as spies of America and/or Israel.
</P>
<P>
   From a military viewpoint, the American attack will test the
claim of military planners that missiles have become ``smarter''
and more accurate since the 1991 Gulf war: at least half the
explosives now being dropped on Iraq are supposed to be
precision-guided, compared with about 10 percent in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise missiles have been fitted with satellite-based guidance
systems making it possible to readjust their course in mid-flight
and, in theory, to achieve pinpoint accuracy. But even the planners
agree that they cannot avoid civilian casualties _ or hope, by air
power alone, to destroy Iraq's capacity to make lethal weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The political consequences are even more twisted. The response
of cynics, who include many Arabs, is to question the timing. The
House of Representatives' decision to delay Clinton's impeachment
debate, which had been due to start on Dec. 17, will add force to
the widely held view that attacking Iraq was a classic diversionary
tactic.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of Butler's report surely cannot have been under
Clinton's control. But Clinton's explanation that the bombing had
to start immediately because it would have been ``profoundly
offensive'' to strike Iraq during the holy month of Ramadan, which
begins on Dec. 20, is unlikely to win him Muslim friends.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech explaining why the action had to be taken, Clinton
said that ``we will pursue a long-term strategy to contain
Iraq...and work toward the day when Iraq has a government worthy of
its people.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, that looks like two aims. America's public aim, until now,
has been to contain Hussein _ with sanctions, inspections and arms
control. But a campaign of sustained bombing could move matters to
a different plane. Forget inspection and arms control, the aim then
would be to rid Iraq of its dictator and his entourage.
</P>
<P>
   Few, including few Iraqis, would object to that _ if it could be
done, and done without causing chaos. But could it?
</P>
<P>
   The great fear among Iraq's neighbors is that America may be
militarily successful in destroying much of Iraq, but that the
eventual political success will still be Saddam's. &QL;

   So Iraq is now under western bombardment. On Dec. 16, a month

STEAM-ENGINE TRAINS: A BLAST FROM THE PAST

<P>
   Once revolutionary, the steam engine is now the epitome of
old-fashioned technology. But the motors of the industrial
revolution have not run out of steam just yet.
</P>
<P>
   This week, in Winterthur, Switzerland, the most advanced large
steam locomotive ever built is being tested at the Swiss Locomotive
and Machine Works (SLM) _ a division of a conglomerate called
Sulzer.
</P>
<P>
   Although it looks like a conventional steam locomotive, SLM's
engine incorporates a host of technological improvements that make
it cleaner and more efficient than the Puffing Billies of old. As a
result, it could give diesel engines a run for their money.
</P>
<P>
   The godfather of the modern steam-engine movement is Livio Dante
Porta, an Argentine engineer who realized, when steam engines
started to be replaced by diesels in the 1950s, that there was
still plenty of room for improvement in steam-engine design.
</P>
<P>
   He spent his career finding new ways to refine the performance
of steam engines. He and his followers, who include Roger Waller,
chief designer of the SLM locomotive, have travelled the world,
restoring and modernizing old engines, and trying to rekindle
support for steam power.
</P>
<P>
   The engine now being tested by SLM was originally built in
Germany in 1942. It has been upgraded according to Porta's
principles, which improve performance in a number of ways.
</P>
<P>
   For a start, unlike conventional coal-fired steam engines, the
new engine burns light oil. It also has an improved draft mechanism
to supply the air for combustion. With coal-fired engines as much
as half the coal is carried away by the air as it passes over the
fuel, so the new engine is far more fuel-efficient.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there is no need for a stoker to shovel the coal,
and no danger of burning embers causing track-side fires.
</P>
<P>
   Another improvement is the use of modern materials to insulate
the boiler and the steam pipes. One result of this is that the
boiler stays warm overnight and the engine can be brought to its
operating temperature within 15 minutes in the morning, compared
with three hours for a conventional steam engine.
</P>
<P>
   Combined with other improvements, including weight reductions
made possible by the use of welded rather than cast-iron
components, and the replacement of oil-lubricated bearings by
modern roller bearings, the result is an engine 25 percent lighter,
36 percent more powerful, and consuming 41 percent less fuel than
old-fashioned coal-fired engines.
</P>
<P>
   But as well as outperforming conventional steam engines, the new
one compares favorably with diesels, both economically and
environmentally.
</P>
<P>
   According to SLM, modern steam locomotives cost around SFr2
million ($1.5 million) each to build from scratch _ about the same
as a diesel locomotive. Although they consume slightly more fuel,
they are simpler to maintain and repair, making them especially
suitable for use in poor countries. They last longer, too.
</P>
<P>
   And they are also less smelly. Because they rely on external
combustion (the burning of fuel at a constant rate outside the
engine's cylinders, rather than explosively inside them), they
produce only a fifth of the noxious emissions of diesels of
comparable power.
</P>
<P>
   That is especially desirable in such applications as shunting,
when locomotives spend 70 percent of their time idling, often in
built-up areas in which pollution is particularly unwelcome.
</P>
<P>
   The current tests involve measuring the power of a modernized
locomotive by pitting it against two electric engines in a
tug-of-war. Once testing is complete the engine, which belongs to a
German railway company, will be used on the Orient Express.
</P>
<P>
   But according to SLM, tourism is by no means the only market for
new steam locomotives. The company also has its eye on developing
countries with extensive railway networks, such as India and China.
Once the figures from this week's tests are in to prove its case,
SLM hopes it will be full steam ahead. &QL;

   KIEV _ In the shabby turn-of-the-century synagogue in Kiev's
Shchekavitska Street, a service is in rumbustious progress. Little
boys somersault on the pews and old men, leather phylacteries
strapped to their foreheads and fringed shawls over their
shoulders, debate vociferously as prayers are read from a
velvet-wrapped Torah scroll.
</P>
<P>
   In a country where KGB men once stood outside the few working
synagogues on Sabbath mornings, this scene should lift hearts.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is poignant: every year, about one in ten of Ukraine's
300,000 Jews leaves to go to Israel, Germany or America. At the
current rate of emigration, in a decade's time Kiev's synagogues
will be empty.
</P>
<P>
   Ukrainian Jewry dates back to the ancient Greek colonies of the
Black Sea coast, predating the rise of the Slav principality out of
which ancient Rus grew.
</P>
<P>
   And Ukrainian Jewry later produced a host of famous names, from
Golda Meir and Leon Trotsky to the writers Isaac Babel and Sholem
Aleichem, whose bittersweet stories inspired ``Fiddler on the
Roof.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, that grand tradition is coming to an end. Since the late
1980s, when Soviet Jews started to get exit visas in large numbers,
Ukraine's Jewish population has fallen by half, reckons Leonid
Finberg, head of Kiev's Institute of Jewish Studies.
</P>
<P>
   And most of the emigrants are young, including all Finberg's
best researchers, while those who stay behind are dying off fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``For every child born of a Jewish mother,'' he says, ``there
are nine deaths. If the over-50s make up 25 percent of the general
population, in the Jewish community it's over 50 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   The more people leave, the less likely it is that the remainder
will stay: ``Most of us now have close relations abroad. So
emigration isn't seen as such a tragedy as it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Chiefly to blame for the exodus is Ukraine's dreadful economy,
which has shrunk every year since independence. Another cause is a
lack of help for those who want to rebuild Judaism at home.
</P>
<P>
   None of the five big foreign-financed Jewish businesses working
in Ukraine specifically encourages people to stay, while the
country's 16 newly opened Jewish schools teach Hebrew, to prepare
for life in Israel, rather than Yiddish, the historic
Jewish-Ukrainian tongue.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Ukraine's two dozen or so rabbis are American Hasidim:
none admits regret that the congregations, choirs and youth groups,
painstakingly rebuilt after years of oppression, are being lost to
emigration.
</P>
<P>
   As Yaakov Bleich, an Orthodox rabbi from Brooklyn, puts it:
``Our goal is neither to rebuild the community, nor to get them to
leave. It's to educate them, to give them as much Jewish life as
possible while they're here.''
</P>
<P>
   Kiev's Reform rabbi, David Wilfond, is as unsentimental. His job
is not, he says, ``to keep one last fiddler on the roof while the
house burns.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A day after the House impeached President Clinton,
senators from both parties pledged on Sunday to restore civility to
the proceedings even as they quickly divided largely along party
lines over whether the president must face a Senate trial or could
be subject to censure.
</P>
<P>
   Senators on Sunday promised a different tone than in the House.
``Take politics out of it completely,'' said Sen. Arlen Specter,
R-Pa., in a televised appearance on the CBS news program ``Face the
Nation.''
</P>
<P>
   But some prominent Republicans and Democrats were already
staking out the same kinds of party-line positions familiar from
the House proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who will be the chairman of the
Rules Committee, which will preside over the impeachment trial,
insisted that the Senate is obliged to proceed to a trial. On the
Democratic side, Sen. Christopher Dodd called for a quick agreement
on censure.
</P>
<P>
   Strategists and political power-brokers all across Washington
struggled to assess the changed landscape. On Saturday, a bitter
House of Representatives voted closely along partisan lines to
impeach Clinton for perjury and obstruction of justice in his
attempts to conceal his affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton remained as popular as he has ever been, according to
the latest New York Times/CBS News poll, taken after the House
voted on Saturday and continued on Sunday. Less than a third of
those polled thought it would be better for the nation if Clinton
resigned, while two-thirds of respondents thought it would be
better if he completed his term.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, only 36 percent expressed a favorable view of the
Republican Party, while 58 percent expressed an unfavorable view.
That put the Republican Party at a lower level of popularity than
it reached after the government shutdown three years ago. Indeed,
it was the worst standing recorded for the party in the 14 years
that the New York Times and CBS News have been asking the question.
</P>
<P>
   Despite public sentiment, the road ahead is far from clear for
Clinton, the only elected president ever to be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has conducted an impeachment trial of a president
only once before, making this a matter with little precedent. The
trial of Andrew Johnson in 1868 left the Senate with 26 impeachment
rules _ from an age before television _ which were updated after
the Watergate scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Under the direction of Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader from
Mississippi, the Senate legal counsel has been studying those
rules.
</P>
<P>
   McConnell, in an appearance on the NBC' program ``Meet the
Press,'' said he did not think a trial had to run for very long,
and he set the stage for blaming the president's lawyers if it
becomes a drawn-out affair. ``I think if the president's lawyers
were cooperative this could be a very short trial because it's not
a complicated case,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Kentucky Republican also said that if the Senate does end up
having to hear from witnesses, it could do so in closed session.
``This will not be a spectacle,'' he said. ``It will not demean the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   McConnell was joined in his insistence on a trial by Sen. Don
Nickles of Oklahoma, the second-ranking Republican in the Senate
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Constitution does not provide for censure,'' Nickles said
in an appearance on ``Fox News Sunday.'' ``It also doesn't preclude
it. But I just don't see circumventing the Constitution with some
extra-constitutional authority.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats made clear that just like their House counterparts,
they would prefer a quick censure deal. Dodd, who appeared with
McConnell on ``Meet the Press,'' called for negotiations to begin
immediately, without waiting for the 106th Congress to convene on
Jan. 6. ``I think it's in everyone's interest here to try and find
some resolution of this matter,'' he said.

   KIEV _ In the shabby turn-of-the-century synagogue in Kiev's
Shchekavitska Street, a service is in rumbustious progress. Little
boys somersault on the pews and old men, leather phylacteries
strapped to their foreheads and fringed shawls over their
shoulders, debate vociferously as prayers are read from a
velvet-wrapped Torah scroll.
</P>
<P>
   In a country where KGB men once stood outside the few working
synagogues on Sabbath mornings, this scene should lift hearts.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is poignant: every year, about one in ten of Ukraine's
300,000 Jews leaves to go to Israel, Germany or America. At the
current rate of emigration, in a decade's time Kiev's synagogues
will be empty.
</P>
<P>
   Ukrainian Jewry dates back to the ancient Greek colonies of the
Black Sea coast, predating the rise of the Slav principality out of
which ancient Rus grew.
</P>
<P>
   And Ukrainian Jewry later produced a host of famous names, from
Golda Meir and Leon Trotsky to the writers Isaac Babel and Sholem
Aleichem, whose bittersweet stories inspired ``Fiddler on the
Roof.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, that grand tradition is coming to an end. Since the late
1980s, when Soviet Jews started to get exit visas in large numbers,
Ukraine's Jewish population has fallen by half, reckons Leonid
Finberg, head of Kiev's Institute of Jewish Studies.
</P>
<P>
   And most of the emigrants are young, including all Finberg's
best researchers, while those who stay behind are dying off fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``For every child born of a Jewish mother,'' he says, ``there
are nine deaths. If the over-50s make up 25 percent of the general
population, in the Jewish community it's over 50 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   The more people leave, the less likely it is that the remainder
will stay: ``Most of us now have close relations abroad. So
emigration isn't seen as such a tragedy as it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Chiefly to blame for the exodus is Ukraine's dreadful economy,
which has shrunk every year since independence. Another cause is a
lack of help for those who want to rebuild Judaism at home.
</P>
<P>
   None of the five big foreign-financed Jewish businesses working
in Ukraine specifically encourages people to stay, while the
country's 16 newly opened Jewish schools teach Hebrew, to prepare
for life in Israel, rather than Yiddish, the historic
Jewish-Ukrainian tongue.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Ukraine's two dozen or so rabbis are American Hasidim:
none admits regret that the congregations, choirs and youth groups,
painstakingly rebuilt after years of oppression, are being lost to
emigration.
</P>
<P>
   As Yaakov Bleich, an Orthodox rabbi from Brooklyn, puts it:
``Our goal is neither to rebuild the community, nor to get them to
leave. It's to educate them, to give them as much Jewish life as
possible while they're here.''
</P>
<P>
   Kiev's Reform rabbi, David Wilfond, is as unsentimental. His job
is not, he says, ``to keep one last fiddler on the roof while the
house burns.'' &QL;

<P>
   The resignation of Cal State Northridge men's soccer coach
Marwan Ass'ad caught the athletic administration by such surprise
that no one was around when it happened Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Not even an interim coach was named.
</P>
<P>
   But the departure of Ass'ad leaves the men's and women's
programs in tenuous positions.
</P>
<P>
   Women's coach Brian Wiesner's resignation takes effect Dec. 31,
the same day as Ass'ad's resignation, which will leave both
programs without a head coach heading into the recruiting season.
</P>
<P>
   And permanent replacements won't be hired soon, since interim
athletic director Sam Jankovich isn't scheduled to be back in the
office until Jan. 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``One good thing, at least with Marwan, is a lot of former
players are in the area and they think highly of the program,''
CSUN assistant athletic director Brian Swanson said. ``And I have
confidence that (women's interim coach) Allison Lee will continue
to recruit and do well.''
</P>
<P>
   It's unlikely for recruits to commit to a program without a head
coach in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of those programs are young so there's not a lot of
people needed,'' Swanson said. ``There's always an opportunity for
a transfer or someone coming in late.''
</P>
<P>
   Swanson said he didn't know of any candidates for either
position.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking support: The only way CSUN basketball games will be
broadcast on the radio is if a corporate sponsor is secured because
the budget is dry.
</P>
<P>
   ``After reviewing the budget situation, there really isn't money
to broadcast games now,'' said media relations director Ryan
Finney. ``We have to find a corporate sponsor to pick up the costs,
and there's a good chance that will happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to have it down for our first (Big Sky
Conference) road game. Right now we're just looking at road games
and not doing home games.''
</P>
<P>
   The men's team opens its Big Sky season at Northern Arizona on
Jan. 2.
</P>
<P>
   No midnight sun: The Matadors men's basketball team was hoping
it would receive a late invitation to next season's Great Alaska
Shootout, but associate head coach Mike Johnson said the deal was
dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said the field was full and no one was pulling out so
we're going to look elsewhere,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Ponciano to get another raise: One of the first things Jankovich
did upon being appointed interim athletic director was look at the
salary structure of the coaches. And he's working on giving
football coach Ron Ponciano a raise.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things you look at is in his first year he went 7-4
and was named the coach of the year in the conference,'' Jankovich
said. ``It really goes above and beyond what was expected. It's a
reward.''
</P>
<P>
   Ponciano, who received a performance-based raise from CSUN
president Blenda Wilson a month ago, makes $79,128 annually.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As part of his preparation to become speaker, Bob
Livingston was reading a book by the master, former Speaker Tip
O'Neill's ``All Politics Is Local.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's full of good, common-sense stuff,'' Livingston was saying
the other day. ``It's good preparation for being speaker and a good
primer for any politician.''
</P>
<P>
   But nothing could have prepared Livingston for the whirligig of
recent events. His tenure as speaker-elect lasted just 32 days,
from his nomination by his party on Nov. 18 to his breathtaking
resignation on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Having confessed two days earlier to ``having strayed outside my
marriage,'' he stood in the well of the House during the
impeachment debate against President Clinton and said he would not
stand for election as speaker on Jan. 6 and would quit the House
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing in his career like the leaving of it. As
Livingston recently said at a college graduation ceremony in his
home district in Louisiana, his was a relatively undistinguished
life.
</P>
<P>
   He spent 16 years as a backbencher in the minority in the House,
and then was plucked from obscurity by Speaker Newt Gingrich to be
chairman of the Appropriations Committee. He loved it. But it
didn't pay enough, and earlier this year, Livingston was ready to
leave Congress and work as a lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich convinced him to stay, on the theory that some day
Gingrich might vacate the speakership and Livingston could take
over. His chance materialized after the Nov. 3 midterm elections,
when the Republicans barely held their majority. Livingston
announced his candidacy on Nov. 6, and Gingrich quit the same day.
</P>
<P>
   In all of his public pronouncements, there was nothing grandiose
in Livingston's view of the speakership. He struggled to give
rhetorical altitude to his fairly earthbound view of his task,
which was to make the trains run on time. The most memorable phrase
from his announcement of his candidacy was his promise to be ``a
stay-at-home type of speaker.''
</P>
<P>
   In his resignation speech on Saturday on the House floor,
Livingston lamented the destructiveness of the impeachment process.
``The debate has done nothing to bring us together, and I greatly
regret that it has become quite literally the opening gambit of the
intended Livingston speakership,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And in perhaps one of his most revealing sentences, he seemed
near despair: ``We are all pawns on the chessboard, and we are
playing our parts in a drama.''
</P>
<P>
   Livingston's friends were trying on Sunday to make sense of the
abrupt end to his political career, especially on a day when it was
President Clinton who was impeached but was still standing.
</P>
<P>
   One cited the confluence of overwhelming events _ a fear that
more damaging details of his private life might come out, the
declaration by some conservatives that he had lost their support,
the bruises he had caused within his own family, the recognition
that whatever followed, he was being introduced to the public as an
adulterer who voted to impeach the president.
</P>
<P>
   Another said that Livingston's taste for power was more than
satisfied. In recent days, before he was swept up in impeachment,
he told audiences that he was a little nervous about becoming
speaker, that from the outside it looked like an incredibly
difficult job, and he talked about getting hit with a ``firehose''
of information.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, he was slowly building up the confidence that ``a
kid from nowhere'' was up to the task. He called himself the Little
Engine That Could.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can do this,'' he said as recently as the weekend before
last, sounding as if he still needed some convincing.

COMMENTARY: NO SORE WINNERS  
(RL)
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``Your representative owes you, not his industry
only, but his judgment; and he betrays, instead of serving you, if
he sacrifices it to your opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Edmund Burke to the voters of Bristol, 1774
</P>
<P>
   In the teeth of polls showing a strong national majority
disfavoring impeachment, House Republicans and a handful of
Democrats carved their own profile in history by indicting the
president.
</P>
<P>
   On the same day, in the face of polls showing a rising tide of
scandal-weary Americans favoring his resignation _ and despite an
invitation by an embarrassed speaker-designate to lead him out the
door _ President Clinton reiterated his determination to serve
until the last hour of his term.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the House's action nor Clinton's shows contempt for
public opinion. Representative democracy, as expressed by Burke,
requires elected officials to exercise their judgment in the best
interest of the nation. The people choose leaders, not agents.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton learned the hard way that polls are no substitute for
judgment. After his Lewinsky testimony in the Jones lawsuit became
public a year ago, he commissioned a poll from Dick Morris to tell
him if he should confess or continue to lie. The $2,000 poll (never
billed) reported that the public would accept adultery but not
perjury. That's when he decided to try to ``win.''
</P>
<P>
   But the poll's prediction was disastrously mistaken. Perjury
about adultery, as we now see, turned out to be surprisingly
tolerable to most people. Had Clinton ignored Morris' poll and
erased his perjury with the truth, he would have been embarrassed
then but unimpeached today. What nailed him was not the sex but the
unnecessary cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   Where to from here? The pursuers of the president have won their
battle of principle against lock-step partisan opposition and shown
that no president is above the law. That huge black headline _
``Clinton Impeached'' _ is his claim to infamy. That is the
indelible censure, and its inherent punishment fits the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Churchill's advice to winners now comes to mind: ``In victory,
magnanimity.'' Here is where a representative's decent respect for
the opinion of the electorate comes in. With no overwhelming
support for removal apparent, impeachment should almost be censure
enough.
</P>
<P>
   In a ``Meet the Press'' greenroom a couple of weeks ago, the
Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, told me that a Senate trial
need take no longer than a few days to three weeks, and repeated as
much on the air. From that I deduced and wrote that the leadership
had in mind a short trial _ not a fight to the finish that would
lead to the ``horror'' and ``national paralysis'' for six months or
more with which the Clinton defenders were scaring House members.
</P>
<P>
   Having put out that assurance before impeachment, Senate leaders
now have the obligation to bring about that closure with all
convenient speed.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Clinton is not helping. He apparently recalls
another part of the Churchill quote _ ``in defeat, defiance'' _ and
in his post-impeachment pep rally showed no sense of the
constitutional occasion. Instead he staged a Democratic love-in to
signal that he considered this vote (1) was merely the act of rabid
partisans engaged in ``personal destruction'' and (2) was not
bothering him a bit.
</P>
<P>
   Senators should set aside this self-deluding reaction and start
the trial promptly. After a week of opening arguments and
submission of briefs (and barring any New Year bombshells from the
Cox Chinagate committee or elsewhere), a majority of senators
should move to direct the chief justice to halt the proceedings,
which the Constitution expressly permits.
</P>
<P>
   That's the proper moment for a joint resolution of censure. A
simple condemnation for lying under oath and tampering with
witnesses would suffice. As a sweetener, Congress could express its
wish that the signed resolution not be entered as evidence in any
criminal trial.
</P>
<P>
   It would go to the president for signature. If he balks, the
Senate trial resumes. But he'll sign and get to keep the pen. Its
auction price will pay his staff's legal debts.
</P>
<P>
   From then to the end of his term, no humiliation imposed nor
contrition expected. At the State of the Union address, which can
await this resolution, those who voted for impeachment should rise
with those who voted against to applaud the office if not the man.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Even before Rep. Rick Lazio, a Republican from
Suffolk County, N.Y., had a chance to announce last week that he
would vote for impeachment, the first threats against his political
future were already thundering out of state Democratic
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no escaping accountability on the impeachment
issue,'' Judith Hope, the state Democratic chairwoman, said in a
statement on Tuesday that singled out Lazio. ``Any representative
who casts a vote in support of impeaching the president will be
forced to defend their decision in 2000 and beyond.''
</P>
<P>
   The near party-line vote to impeach President Clinton on
Saturday may have left a cloud over the president, but it has also,
in the minds of many Democrats, handed their party a powerful
political cudgel that could win them back the majority in Congress
two years from now. They are buoyed by public opinion polls showing
that the president, or at least his policies, remain in favor,
particularly in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that this is such an important issue that people
will remember in two years,'' said Robert Ives, executive director
of the Connecticut State Democratic Committee. He said the party
will hammer Rep. Nancy Johnson, a moderate Republican from New
Britain, for voting for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``She followed the Newt Gingrich line of, `Let's get the
president,' '' Ives said. ``She has proven once again that her vote
is not her own.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many Republicans who supported impeachment, Mrs. Johnson
predicted that her constituents would not punish her at the polls
for casting a vote that was based on her moral convictions and
legal concerns. ``I don't think people are thinking about this as
Republican and Democrat,'' she said. ``They are thinking about it
as citizens of this country.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Clinton won handily in New York, New Jersey and
Connecticut, and Democratic leaders are convinced that the majority
of the electorate in those states are bitterly opposed to his
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats also contend that anti-impeachment fervor helped
bring down two Republican incumbents from the region last month:
Rep. Michael Pappas of New Jersey, who had lavishly praised
independent counsel Kenneth Starr, and Sen. Alfonse D'Amato of New
York, who had spearheaded the Senate Republicans' Whitewater
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   After his defeat, D'Amato declared that impeachment would be
damaging to the Republican Party, a message echoed by two other
prominent state Republicans, New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and
Gov. George Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   But the central question for Democrats is whether voters really
care deeply enough about the issue to let it color their decisions
two years from now. Republican leaders and consultants contend that
Clinton's popularity is wide but thin, and could dissipate quickly
if the economy turns downward or he is implicated in new scandals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Impeachment is almost certain to be overtaken by events in the
next 22 months,'' said Kieran Mahoney, a political adviser to both
D'Amato and Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   Mahoney acknowledged that impeachment could be a serious
political problem for Republicans, but more likely in a primary
election, where conservative voters tend to dominate and a
candidate's vote against impeachment might prompt a challenge from
the right.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear whether Republicans from New York, New Jersey
and Connecticut who voted for impeachment heeded the advice of
consultants like Mahoney, or bent to pressure from their
conservative leadership, as Democrats asserted, or simply followed
their consciences.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, only three of the 21 House Republicans from the
region voted against impeachment: Christopher Shays of Connecticut,
and Peter King and Amo Houghton of New York. All three said
Clinton's behavior had not met their definitions of an impeachable
offense.
</P>
<P>
   None of the three seems to be in imminent political danger. King
has a strongly conservative voting record and would remain
difficult to beat in a primary. Houghton is a respected figure in
his district, where his family runs Corning Industries. And Shays
comes from a proudly centrist Republican district where he
generally wins going away every two years.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Shays rejected the idea that voters would forget about
impeachment quickly. ``Voters will remember,'' he said. ``That's
unavoidable. And frankly, it's called the democratic system.
Controversy is generally thought of as the enemy of the incumbent,
and there was lots of controversy.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Gerald Solomon, a New York Republican who voted for
impeachment, disagreed. ``I think most all of the members win by
substantial margins,'' he said. ``That means they have considerable
trust placed in them by their voters, and the voters are going to
take their word for what they do, even if they don't agree.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a number of Republicans who voted for impeachment come
from districts that are safely enough Republican to make an
electoral backlash in 2000 seem unlikely. They included Sherwood
Boehlert and Vito Fossella from New York, and Marge Roukema and
Rodney Frelinghuysen from New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   But a few come from politically volatile districts. New York's
1st District on the east end of Long Island, for instance, had a
Democratic representative for many years before Michael Forbes won
in an upset in the Republican tide of 1994. Forbes has never been
comfortable with the conservative Republicans who run Congress and
has had a friendly relationship with Clinton. But he still voted
for impeachment, and Democrats say they will make him pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   Voting for impeachment may cause bigger problems for Republicans
who want to run for statewide office. Lazio, for instance, is
interested in filling Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan's seat when he
retires in 2000. His vote for impeachment might help him in a
Republican primary, particularly against someone like Giuliani, who
opposed impeachment. But Lazio's vote is also likely to turn at
least some Democrats against him in a general election, where
Democrats outnumber Republicans 3 to 2 in New York.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration warned Sunday that Iraq
may quickly try to rebuild its programs to develop chemical and
biological weapons after last week's furious air strikes, and that
additional U.S. strikes may be needed soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously it is very hard to say that everything that he has
in weapons of mass destruction has been destroyed,'' Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright said on the NBC News program ``Meet the
Press,'' referring to Iraqi president Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have said very clearly that we reserve the right to use
force again, and I think we've proven our ability to deliver a very
tough blow.''
</P>
<P>
   Although preliminary damage assessments from the Pentagon showed
that fewer than a third of the 100 Iraqi targets attacked last week
had been severely damaged or destroyed, military commanders
continued to insist that the attack had crippled elements of the
Iraqi military and had seriously hampered Saddam's ability to
communicate with his most loyal troops.
</P>
<P>
   Senior administration officials said Sunday that if additional
air strikes were required, they would almost certainly not take
place until early next year, after the completion of the Islamic
holy month of Ramadan, which began this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that
with the completion of the attack on Saturday, the Pentagon was
reconsidering plans announced last week to send thousands of
additional U.S. troops to the region to prevent a possible Iraqi
ground strike against Kuwait or Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   Such an attack, they said, now seemed unlikely, although they
said that U.S. warplanes were expected to remain on high alert in
the Persian Gulf region for several more weeks.
</P>
<P>
   As the smoke cleared from the most punishing U.S. air strikes
against Iraq since the 1991 gulf war, the battle of words between
Washington and Baghdad continued, and may even have intensified.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Clinton administration officials took to the Sunday
television talk shows to declare that the mission of the air
strikes was accomplished, while Saddam told his people in a
televised speech that they wore ``the crown of victory'' against
U.S. and British forces involved in the air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Both had a point. The United States could justifiably claim that
it had met its limited goal of ``degrading'' Iraq's ability to make
chemical or biological weapons and the ballistic missiles needed to
deliver them.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi leader could claim at least a partial victory simply
by surviving another round of intense U.S.-led bombardment, with
little sign that his domestic opponents were any closer to ousting
him, which the Clinton administration openly desires.
</P>
<P>
   ``We consider this a very successful attack,'' said Gen. Henry
Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, appearing on the
CBS News program ``Face the Nation.'' ``Looking at the targets, I
would tell you that our success goes up almost daily as we have a
chance to make a more complete assessment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon did not issue an updated assessment Sunday of its
overall bomb damage from the air strikes, which on Saturday
revealed that U.S. and British forces had struck 100 targets with
more than 400 sea- and air-launched cruise missiles and had flown
650 sorties by fighters, bombers and support aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the preliminary assessment of the first three days of
the four-day attack, the Defense Department was able to confirm
that air strikes had done some degree of damage to 70 of the 100
targets attacked, although only 28 targets were described as having
been either destroyed or severely damaged.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials cautioned that it could often take weeks for
such assessments to be completed, and that a target may have been
rendered inoperable even when the damage was assessed as light.
Damage to 23 of the targets has yet to be assessed.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The assessment provided little specific detail on the targets or
their location in Iraq but did break them down by categories.
According to the report:
</P>
<P>
   _ Of the 11 targets that involved production or storage of
weapons of mass destruction, none was destroyed, one was severely
damaged, five were moderately damaged and four were lightly
damaged.
</P>
<P>
   _ Of the 18 targets described as facilities involved in
``security'' for the Iraqi program to develop chemical and
biological weapons, two were destroyed, five were severely damaged,
six were moderately damaged and five were lightly damaged. Among
the targets that suffered severe or moderate damage were the
barracks of soldiers assigned to guard the facilities.
</P>
<P>
   _ Of the nine targets that were command centers or other
facilities for the Republican Guard, the elite military unit that
was singled out for attack in the air strikes, none was destroyed,
three were severely damaged, five were moderately damaged and one
was lightly damaged.
</P>
<P>
   _ Of the 20 targets described as ``command and control'' centers
for the Iraqi government, including television and radio
transmitters, seven were destroyed, four were severely damaged,
four were moderately damaged and two were lightly damaged.
</P>
<P>
   _ Of the 32 targets that were sites for surface-to-air missiles
or air-defense systems, one was destroyed, five were severely
damaged, four were moderately damaged and four were lightly
damaged.
</P>
<P>
   _ Of the six airfields attacked, none was destroyed, none was
severely damaged, four were moderately damaged and one was lightly
damaged. The Pentagon said its one ``economic'' target _ a refinery
in southern Iraq that has been linked to oil exports in violation
of U.N. sanctions _ was lightly damaged.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton said the Defense Department was especially pleased with
the results of air strikes on nine Iraqi facilities for research
and development of ballistic missiles that could be used by the
Iraqis to deliver chemical or biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think he'll be doing any more research and
development with his missiles for at least over a year,'' the
general said, referring to Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   In London, military aides to Prime Minister Tony Blair were even
more optimistic in describing the results of the American and
British air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Charles Guthrie, chief of the British defense staff, told
reporters there that he believed Iraq's capacity to deliver
chemical or biological weapons by missiles or drone aircraft had
been set back ``by several years.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the attack strikes on the Republican Guard, which was
largely kept out of harm's way by Saddam during the gulf war, had
sent ``a powerful message: They now know that their cozy existence
has been shattered.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen, also appearing on CBS, said the
United States believed that Iraq might move quickly to rebuild its
program for the production of chemical and biological weapons and
that American and British forces would be ready to strike again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand that he may try to undertake to repair these
facilities or rebuild then,'' he said. ``We're going to maintain
our military capability. We're going to continue the sanctions and
watch to make sure he doesn't pose a threat to his neighbors or try
to reconstitute these weapons of mass destruction.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A day after the House impeached President Clinton,
senators from both parties pledged on Sunday to restore civility to
the proceedings even as they quickly divided largely along party
lines over whether the president must face a Senate trial or could
be subject to censure.
</P>
<P>
   Senators on Sunday promised a different tone than in the House.
``Take politics out of it completely,'' said Sen. Arlen Specter,
R-Pa., in a televised appearance on the CBS news program ``Face the
Nation.''
</P>
<P>
   But some prominent Republicans and Democrats were already
staking out the same kinds of party-line positions familiar from
the House proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who will be the chairman of the
Rules Committee, which will preside over the impeachment trial,
insisted that the Senate is obliged to proceed to a trial. On the
Democratic side, Sen. Christopher Dodd called for a quick agreement
on censure.
</P>
<P>
   Strategists and political power-brokers all across Washington
struggled to assess the changed landscape. On Saturday, a bitter
House of Representatives voted closely along partisan lines to
impeach Clinton for perjury and obstruction of justice in his
attempts to conceal his affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton remained as popular as he has ever been, according to
the latest New York Times/CBS News poll, taken after the House
voted on Saturday and continued on Sunday. Less than a third of
those polled thought it would be better for the nation if Clinton
resigned, while two-thirds of respondents thought it would be
better if he completed his term.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, only 36 percent expressed a favorable view of the
Republican Party, while 58 percent expressed an unfavorable view.
That put the Republican Party at a lower level of popularity than
it reached after the government shutdown three years ago. Indeed,
it was the worst standing recorded for the party in the 14 years
that the New York Times and CBS News have been asking the question.
</P>
<P>
   Despite public sentiment, the road ahead is far from clear for
Clinton, the only elected president ever to be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has conducted an impeachment trial of a president
only once before, making this a matter with little precedent. The
trial of Andrew Johnson in 1868 left the Senate with 26 impeachment
rules _ from an age before television _ which were updated after
the Watergate scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Under the direction of Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader from
Mississippi, the Senate legal counsel has been studying those
rules.
</P>
<P>
   McConnell, in an appearance on the NBC' program ``Meet the
Press,'' said he did not think a trial had to run for very long,
and he set the stage for blaming the president's lawyers if it
becomes a drawn-out affair. ``I think if the president's lawyers
were cooperative this could be a very short trial because it's not
a complicated case,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Kentucky Republican also said that if the Senate does end up
having to hear from witnesses, it could do so in closed session.
``This will not be a spectacle,'' he said. ``It will not demean the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   McConnell was joined in his insistence on a trial by Sen. Don
Nickles of Oklahoma, the second-ranking Republican in the Senate
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Constitution does not provide for censure,'' Nickles said
in an appearance on ``Fox News Sunday.'' ``It also doesn't preclude
it. But I just don't see circumventing the Constitution with some
extra-constitutional authority.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats made clear that just like their House counterparts,
they would prefer a quick censure deal. Dodd, who appeared with
McConnell on ``Meet the Press,'' called for negotiations to begin
immediately, without waiting for the 106th Congress to convene on
Jan. 6. ``I think it's in everyone's interest here to try and find
some resolution of this matter,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Entering the debate, two former presidents issued a joint plea
for censure: Gerald Ford, who pardoned Richard M. Nixon in 1974
after he resigned on the verge of impeachment, and Jimmy Carter,
the Democrat who defeated Ford two years later.
</P>
<P>
   In an op-ed article in Monday's edition of The New York Times,
the one-time political opponents said that ``the time has come to
put aside political differences and plant seeds of justice and
reconciliation.'' They called for the Senate to craft a bipartisan
censure resolution that would require Clinton to acknowledge that
he did not tell the truth under oath, but would also stipulate that
his admission could not be used against him in any future criminal
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Some ad hoc behind-the-scene negotiations have gone on already
on censure. Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., and one of Clinton's
earliest critics, has been quietly holding discussions with Sen.
Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who is chairman of the Senate Judiciary
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But even many senior Democrats say they believe that with the
Senate scattered for the holidays, serious discussions will only
begin when the new Congress returns on Jan. 6 _ and only after the
Senate at least nominally moves into early trial proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   The conventional wisdom is that the Senate will not be able to
muster the 67 votes necessary to convict Clinton, but until just a
few weeks ago the conventional wisdom was that the House would
never impeach the president.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch said on Sunday that Senate leaders should take a vote
count of members in order to decide how to proceed. If there is
little support beyond the 55 Republicans in the Senate for
convicting Clinton, Hatch said, the Senate should weigh what is
``best under the circumstances to resolve this matter and in the
best interests of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch has already been criticized by fellow Republicans for
being too willing to make a deal with Clinton. A critical question
is whether senior conservatives with credibility in their party
will step forward to lead negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   On CBS' ``Face the Nation,'' Sen. Robert G. Torricelli, D-N.J.,,
named several Republicans to watch _ Sens. Ted Stevens of Alaska,
John Warner of Virginia and John McCain of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are clearly enough moderate Republicans prepared to join
in the censure effort and avoid a protracted legal struggle in the
Senate,'' Torricelli said in an interview after the show. ``What is
required is a senior conservative Republican who recognizes the
electoral danger to the Republican Party and will respond to the
enormous national need to negotiate an end to this process.''
</P>
<P>
   Another conservative Republican, Thad Cochran of Mississippi,
said on ``CNN Morning News'' that there was a ''possibility'' that
the Senate would decide on an alternative to removing Clinton from
office.
</P>
<P>
   Aware that their party suffered during the prolonged government
shutdown of 1995, Republicans took pains this weekend to say that a
Senate trial would not lead to legislative paralysis. McConnell
said the Senate could ''double-track'' a trial so that it did not
consume entire days and the Senate could consider legislation at
the same time.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement on Saturday, Lott said the Senate ``will address
issues of great concern to the American people'' from education to
Social Security policy to reducing taxes and protecting the
long-term solvency of Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats raised the specter of a government that continues
to be consumed by the scandal. Dodd said he backed censure because
a trial would ``tie up three branches of government for the next
four months.''

BACKUPS FILL IN FOR STARS AS PATRIOTS GAIN THE PLAYOFFS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBORO, Mass. _ So many New England Patriots have spent nearly
as much time in the training room on ice as on the field this
season. Sunday against the San Francisco 49ers the Patriots entered
with more players ailing and out, chief among them quarterback Drew
Bledsoe (broken finger), receiver Terry Glenn (fractured ankle) and
linebacker Willie McGinest (pulled groin). That is three starters
contributing zilch, two of them Pro Bowlers. Glenn, too, is Pro
Bowl caliber, the Patriots' best deep pass-catching threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``With those guys out and all our starters basically here, the
odds are that you would expect us to win,'' 49ers linebacker Lee
Woodall said. ``We just played a Monday night game at home where we
stopped Barry Sanders, and then we come here a let a rookie get a
lot of yards on us. What's that all about?''
</P>
<P>
   Good question.
</P>
<P>
   What is it about the 49ers that makes them unbeaten (7-0) at
home and just average (4-4) on the road? What was it Sunday about
their offense, which produced 21 first-half points and then nothing
in the second half? The Patriots think they have the answers after
beating San Francisco, 24-21, before 59,153 fans at Foxboro
Stadium, and joining the Buffalo Bills in gaining wild-card playoff
spots Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys have won a lot in the past,'' Patriots cornerback
Tebucky Jones said of the 49ers, ``but they ran into a team today
that knows in the NFL that backups have to perform like the
starters _ and we did. In the fourth quarter our defense, our whole
team, was amped up. We took the momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   Patriots linebacker Chris Slade, who had nine tackles and a
sack, said: ``They're the 49ers _ they expect to win. But we have
goals, too. We went to the Super Bowl two years ago. We made the
playoffs last year. We've become accustomed to winning, and this
game meant as much to us as it did to them. And that's how we
played.''
</P>
<P>
   It meant making the playoffs for the third consecutive season, a
franchise record. The Patriots are 9-6, with their regular-season
finale at the Jets next Sunday. San Francisco slipped to 11-4 and
will finish vs. St. Louis at home.
</P>
<P>
   The game was won on Adam Vinatieri's 35-yard field goal with
three seconds remaining. Down by 21-14 at halftime, New England
scored 10 points in the final quarter to swipe the victory.
</P>
<P>
   It was a steady second-half showing by the Patriots' defense. It
was a heroic effort by backup quarterback Scott Zolak and rookie
running back Robert Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   Zolak, an eight-year veteran, was making his first pro start in
three years. Bledsoe had started the last 58 Patriot games, but
Zolak was asked to replace the injured Bledsoe and guide the
Patriots with the best he could produce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early, he was struggling some, rushing things,'' Patriots
receiver Shawn Jefferson said. ``He was saying that the game was a
lot faster than in practice. But he had confidence in himself. He
got the game going for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Zolak finished with 205 passing yards, completing 14 of 30
passes. He threw two touchdowns and two interceptions. He was
comparable to 49ers mainstay Steve Young, who had a 267-yard
passing day with two touchdowns and two interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Zolak tossed a 19-yard swing pass to Edwards for a touchdown
that opened the scoring with 2 minutes 56 seconds left in the first
quarter. After San Francisco tied it in the second quarter with a
Young-to-Jerry Rice score of 75 yards, Zolak showed a strong arm
and nice touch with a 61-yard scoring strike to Jefferson. The
49ers blitzed, the Patriots provided maximum protection and Zolak
stood tall in the pocket, throwing the football deep down the right
sideline and hitting Jefferson in stride.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody doubts this team a lot,'' Zolak said. ``There are
injuries all over the place. People just keep stepping in, and now
we're in it again.''
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers' second touchdown of the second quarter was followed
by a third, an unusual, aborted field-goal attempt that turned into
holder Ty Detmer's 25-yard scoring toss into the end zone to tight
end Irv Smith as time expired in the half.
</P>
<P>
   It looked as if the 49ers would have the edge in spirit in the
second half. But after gaining 14 first downs in the first half,
they had only seven in the second. They punted only once in the
first half but three times in the second. And though Garrison
Hearst rushed for 107 yards and has 1,549 for the season, eclipsing
Roger Craig's 49ers single-season rushing mark of 1,502 yards set
in 1988, Hearst gained only 45 second-half rushing yards.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots shut the 49ers down in the final 30 minutes, with
Patriots safety Willie Clay intercepting Young early in the fourth
quarter at the San Francisco 49. That set up a drive that Edwards
finished with a powerful 5-yard scoring run up the middle. The game
was tied at 21-21 with 7:34 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers' offense sagged to three plays and a punt on their
next two drives. New England got the ball at the San Francisco 41
with 1:48 left and Edwards ran for 10, 3, 1, and 5 yards to set up
the winning field goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm starting to know what to do, to see my blocking well,''
Edwards said. ``I'm growing up as a football player.'' He rushed
for 101 yards and has 1,068 for the season, only the third Patriots
rookie back to reach the 1,000 mark. Another Patriots rookie,
receiver Tony Simmons, led the team in catches Sunday with five.
Rookie Damon Denson started at left guard and was effective.
</P>
<P>
   Rookies and substitutes mixing with old hats. The Patriots won
it that way, with pure resolve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeing people hanging together and stay with the coaches and
believe in the game plan and put it to work and make it come
through, I just can't say enough,'' said the elated Patriots head
coach, Pete Carroll. ``It was a collective effort by so many people
to get this thing done.''

 &HT;    Divisions get 6 new champs; 2 wild-card spots open
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Not even the late commissioner Pete Rozelle, who
introduced the concept of parity to the NFL, had these kinds of
results in mind when he decided to even the playing field.
</P>
<P>
   Three more teams _ the Atlanta Falcons, Jacksonville Jaguars and
Dallas Cowboys _ claimed championships on Sunday, completing a rare
overhaul for the six divisions. For only the second time since the
NFL adopted the 16-game schedule in 1978, all six of the division
winners are different than last season. The only other time there
were wholesale first-place changes was in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's reflective of a situation in which the talent disparity
has narrowed even further,'' said Green Bay coach Mike Holmgren,
whose Packers probably will enter the playoffs as the No. 2
wild-card qualifier from the NFC. ``The upheaval isn't all that
surprising.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL's weekend results leave two playoff vacancies, the final
wild-card spots in both conferences. The Miami Dolphins can fill
out the AFC side of the bracket with a victory against the Denver
Broncos tonight.
</P>
<P>
   In the NFC, the last wild-card spot will not be determined until
next Sunday. Three teams _ Arizona, Tampa Bay and the New York
Giants _ remain in contention. Arizona can claim its first playoff
spot since the strike-shortened 1982 season with a victory against
San Diego. A loss by the Cardinals would leave the league with its
first non-winning playoff team since 1990 and only the third in two
decades.
</P>
<P>
   The league already is assured a marquee matchup in the wild-card
round. Green Bay and San Francisco, which met in the NFC title game
a year ago, will play on Jan. 2 or 3 at a site to be determined
next week. At least one of the teams has appeared in each of the
past six conference finals.

 &HT;    Falcons felt Reeves' presence
 &HT;    By Terence Moore
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PONTIAC, Mich. _ He was gone, but he was there. ``We just had
this constant feeling that we didn't want to let Dan Reeves down,''
said Atlanta Falcons quarterback Chris Chandler, referring to the
man who used his healing heart to will his team to a 24-17 victory
Sunday from his home in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how loudly the Detroit Lions roared with their
following during the crucial stages of Sunday's action inside the
Silverdome, Reeves, in spirit, was everywhere for the Falcons to
calm their nerves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Didn't you see him?'' said Falcons offensive tackle Bob
Whitfield, wide-eyed, explaining that it was Reeves leading the
blocks for Jamal Anderson, who rushed for 147 yards. It was Reeves
helping the Falcons' defense keep Barry Sanders ordinary for a day.
It was Reeves shouting toward his players to keep their minds
focused in a glorious ending against the Lions, despite a woeful
beginning.
</P>
<P>
   This was an example of the Falcons showing that they were as
potent with Reeves' system as they were with the man himself.
</P>
<P>
   Well, sort of. Even in victory, there was a mighty problem for
these soaring Dirty Birds, who spent the afternoon officially
becoming better than even San Francisco in the NFC West for a
season.
</P>
<P>
   The problem? Reeves' spirit remains slightly less powerful than
Reeves' presence. In fact, Falcons wide receiver Terance Mathis
likes to say that you can see the confidence of the man in just his
walk. Falcons President Taylor Smith agreed with misty eyes, and
then he sighed while thinking about his head coach recovering from
heart surgery this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just something special about seeing him out there on
the sideline,'' Smith said. ``That's why it was totally different
without him on the flight here. It was totally different in the
locker room. He has that way of looking at you and making you feel
good about yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   So the spirit was willing, but the flesh definitely was weak for
the Falcons as they struggled against a group of Lions who have
been toothless for most of the season. Then came that surge for the
Falcons near the end that featured many of their wonderful
attributes.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 17-10 in the fourth quarter, the relentless Chris
Chandler found the equally relentless Mathis in the end zone to
signal a comeback. Actually, the Falcons flashed signs of their
rally with a defense that kept Sanders in low gear along the way to
rushing for 95 yards.
</P>
<P>
   There also was Anderson, twisting, bursting and dancing his way
through defenders with the greatest of ease.
</P>
<P>
   Among Anderson's runs was a 26-yard gem that led to his 1-yard
plunge giving the Falcons a first-week bye in the playoffs. No, it
was Reeves' system that accomplished all of the above, and
everybody in the Falcons' locker room knew it and acknowledged it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan is such a high character person that he challenges
himself, and that makes us challenge ourselves,'' Falcons
linebacker Cornelius Bennett said. ``I had a little speech prepared
that I was going to give to the team before the game, but when I
came into the locker room and saw the look in their eyes, I just
threw it away.''
</P>
<P>
   That look in their eyes was Dan Reeves.

 &HT;    Falcons soar to victory over Lions
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PONTIAC, Mich. _ When the moment finally came, and it seemed
like it took forever to arrive, the Atlanta Falcons' defensive end
Chuck Smith dropped to his knees at about the 30-yard line, his
arms thrust roofward in the Silverdome.
</P>
<P>
   All around him teammates were jumping up and down, rookie
linebacker Keith Brooking forgetting for the moment he had a
sprained knee. On the sidelines, reserve quarterback Steve DeBerg
hugged offensive coordinator/running backs coach George Sefcik.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Atlanta, presumably, Dan Reeves pumped his fists, and
his heart pumped as perhaps never before, and somewhere, perhaps,
Rankin Smith Sr. smiled bigger than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the words on the hats handed out on the Falcons
sideline moments after free safety Eugene Robinson intercepted a
pass with 1:39 left to play Sunday to seal Atlanta's
eighth-straight victory, a 24-17 comeback victory over the Detroit
Lions, and it all makes sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Champions,'' the first line read.
</P>
<P>
   ``1998 NFC West Division.''
</P>
<P>
   It's happened only once before, in 1980. And Smith has been
around the last six times in didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just had this incredible burst of energy,'' said Smith, who
was frozen for nearly a minute like a statue while chaos reigned
around him. ``And when I got up, I felt like running around the
stadium forever. I'm so tired, but I could run for days. I don't
know what to say. I'm just shaking.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons (13-2) likely left their coach numb back in Atlanta,
where Reeves watched on TV while recuperating from heart bypass
surgery on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves watched his team fall behind 14-10 just before halftime
and 17-10 with 1:43 left in the third quarter. But moments later,
Chris Chandler threw a perfect 27-yard touchdown pass to Terance
Mathis to force a tie.
</P>
<P>
   After that, a defense that tightened up in the second half,
allowing just 105 yards after halftime (of a total of 258), held on
two possessions. The scene was set, and the Falcons, who looked so
out of sync offensively in the first half against the 5-10 Lions,
went to a familiar script.
</P>
<P>
   Running back Jamal Anderson (30 carries, 147 yards, one rushing
touchdown, one receiving touchdown) took over. Atlanta went 56
yards in eight plays, the keys being a 26-yard run by Anderson when
he went right, cut inside defensive end Robert Porcher, angled
toward the middle of the field, and dragged at least one tackler
the final 7 or 8 yards to the 1.
</P>
<P>
   He scored from the 1 on the next play, giving Atlanta a 24-17
lead with 6:57 left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit did nothing on two more possessions, the end coming when
Robinson jumped in front of a poor Frank Reich pass at the Lions'
30 and dropped to the turf to protect the ball.
</P>
<P>
   The Lions had no timeouts.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons had the time of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Team president Taylor Smith paused in the locker room, thinking
of his father, Rankin Sr., who died in the middle of last season of
a heart attack. For years, the Smith family has been derided, as
has been this franchise.
</P>
<P>
   So much of that was forgettable on Sunday night in the Motor
City.
</P>
<P>
   Was Smith thinking of his father, who brought the NFL to Atlanta
in 1966, only to watch his team flail away year after year, with
just seven winning seasons in the first 32?
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' he said, not quite misty-eyed, but able briefly
to look only at the cold concrete floor. ``I wish he was here to
share this. I'm sure he knows.''
</P>
<P>
   Watching the Falcons in the first half, it was impossible to
tell they came in with a seven-game winning streak while the Lions
had lost back-to-back blowouts, including 35-13 last Monday when
players were accused of quitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their game against the 49ers was the worst thing that could
have happened for us,'' defensive end Lester Archambeau said. ``We
knew they were going to come after us, and they did. But we showed
character.''
</P>
<P>
   That the Falcons did, with defensive coordinator Rich Brooks
standing in as interim head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to get (Reeves) on the speaker phone in here, but
apparently they shut the phone off at his house,'' Brooks said.
``Dan Reeves is responsible for where we all are right now. I want
to congratulate Dan back home. He's really put a lot into this the
last two years to get us where we are.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably the best feeling I've ever had except for the
birth of my children,'' Chandler said. ``It was as important or
more important to have coach Reeves have the extra week off to get
himself feeling good. I wondered what he was doing at game time.
Those kind of feelings kind of permeated the whole team.''
</P>
<P>
   Not long before the team left for its charter flight home,
quarterback coach Jack Burns was in a hallway near the locker room,
smoking a cigar as he usually does after a victory. But this was
different. He called the plays Sunday without the usual input from
Reeves, relaying them through reserve quarterback Steve DeBerg to
Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a special cigar,'' he said, looking resplendent in a
suit and tie. ``This is an Arturo Fuentes. This is special. We
showed poise. This was beautiful.''

REVIVED GIANTS REMAIN IN PLAYOFF CONTENTION
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ In the penultimate week of their regular
season, these Giants behaved and played like a new team, as if
confidence and know-how had slipped through the transom of the
locker-room door and drifted from player to player.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Giants find themselves giddy from the unforeseen playoff
drama that has percolated in their midst. Last week's stunning
upset of the Denver Broncos and Sunday's wire-to-wire 28-7
thrashing of the Kansas City Chiefs have emboldened the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Their playoff hopes, though still remote, grow less remote with
each victory, and it has the players feasting in the whimsy of
their situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a funny feeling about this year,'' Corey Widmer, the
middle linebacker, said with a wily smile. ``There's a vibe going
on. Strange things happen in sports. People might just see
something special this year.''
</P>
<P>
   One wonders if the rest of the National Football League would
call an 8-8 playoff team special, but the Giants are coming from
the perspective of a team that was 3-7 five weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   With Kent Graham at quarterback, the Giants have won four of
their last five games and three in a row. Sunday's domination of
Kansas City has turned optimism to conviction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this thing could happen just the way we want it to,''
said Graham, who had his second consecutive strong effort Sunday,
guiding the Giants to a 28-0 lead by the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   This is the way the Giants (7-8) want it: First, Tampa Bay (7-8)
must lose at Cincinnati early next Sunday afternoon, and later that
same day, the Giants must win at Philadelphia and Arizona (8-7)
must lose at home to San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Because of various tie-breaking procedures, any other
combination of results in those three games means the Giants do not
make the playoffs. If the Giants win and Tampa Bay and Arizona
lose, the Giants will play in the first round of the playoffs at
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   That the Giants are still involved in the high drama of a
playoff chase at this late stage of the season had Coach Jim Fassel
marveling at the team's turnabout.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is amazing, it really is,'' he said after Sunday's victory,
which came in the franchise's 1,000th regular-season game. All we
can do is take care of our last game. If it works, it works. If it
doesn't, it doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   The team the Giants most resembled Sunday was last year's
Giants, whose ferocious pass rush and opportunistic secondary. On
the first play of the game, Kansas City quarterback Rich Gannon was
sacked and had to leave the game with a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   Two plays later, Gannon's replacement, former starter Elvis
Grbac, threw behind wide receiver Derrick Alexander, the ball
deflecting off Alexander and ricocheting to safety Percy Ellsworth,
who caught the ball at the Chiefs' 43-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   Ellsworth returned the interception virtually untouched for a
touchdown. It was the second interception return for a touchdown
this year by Ellsworth, who add an interception in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' first possession was 12 plays and covered 83 yards,
concluding with a 12-yard touchdown pass from Graham to Amani
Toomer, the same combination that won game against Denver.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants added to their 14-0 lead in the second quarter on a
one-yard touchdown run by Gary Brown, who rushed for 103 yards on
25 attempts.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants also benefited from nine penalties against the
Chiefs, who are the most penalized team in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody gave us a shot,'' said Graham. ``People said our
schedule was too tough. And it has been tough. But we've won these
games. And right now, the playoffs could happen for us.''

IN A VENEZUELA PRISON, EVERY CRANNY HOLDS A CLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CIUDAD BOLIVAR, Venezuela _ The prison here is called a center
for rehabilitation, but perhaps nowhere in Venezuela do the words
have less meaning than inside its gate.
</P>
<P>
   Even the prison administration dares not cross the portal, to
the area inside where 1,200 men and 32 women have blasted holes
through walls, taken over a schoolroom and thrown up cardboard
shacks, cramming themselves into a space built for 400. The
prison's corridors and yards, carrying names like ``The Ranch'' and
``The Tank'' are like neighborhoods, but with armed borders.
</P>
<P>
   A new neighborhood may begin at a stairwell or a bend in the
corner, where groups of inmates _ their makeshift guns, knives and
sabers flashing from their belts _ stand guard. Virtually every
inmate is scarred and many are bandaged. With antibiotics scarce,
wounds fester.
</P>
<P>
   But within the miniature worlds the prison contains, there also
are surprising visions of grace: healthier inmates nursing those
who are sick, one carving figures and jewelry from black stone, two
groups that have devised ovens to bake cakes.
</P>
<P>
   With street crime surging, along with popular frustrations that
have led to lynchings of crime suspects, Venezuela has been sending
growing numbers of people to prison. Its 33 prisons, built to house
15,000 inmates, now hold more than 24,000. The system largely
ignores minimum standards of hygiene, medical care and security.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the most violent, most dangerous prisons in the
world,'' said Joanne Mariner, counsel for Human Rights Watch in New
York. ``Every aspect of the system is overloaded and not
functioning.''
</P>
<P>
   At Ciudad Bolivar prison one night, a turf war broke out, and
stones and bullets flew. The tension eased briefly through the
visiting hours the next day, but exploded again in gunfire as
relatives and friends left for home.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't respect anything in there, not even visiting day,''
said Zaida Salazar, 40, who had just visited a brother who was
serving 18 years.
</P>
<P>
   The prisons mix inmates charged with armed robbery and murder
with university graduates who have been convicted of white-collar
crimes. Prisoners with 15-year sentences share cells with those
awaiting trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, you either find God or you lose all hope,'' said Sister
Socorro Quintana, 53, a Roman Catholic nun from Spain who ministers
to the inmates here. ``And there are many who are completely
without hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Violence, mostly among inmates, has skyrocketed. Last year, 336
prisoners were killed, up from 207 in 1996. By comparison, of the
1.7 million convicts in U.S. prisons, 67 were killed by other
inmates last year.
</P>
<P>
   About three out of four people in Venezuelan prisons have not
been convicted. Some, like Adan Toledo, 40, a former bank employee
charged with fraud, have waited more than a year for trial, unable
to scrape together bail.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like America Carmen Bustillo, 42, are here apparently
for no reason. Ms. Bustillo was accused of selling drugs but said
the case against her was dropped in April. In September, she was
still there, waiting for another bureaucratic step to regain her
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the government blew up Catia prison in the
capital, Caracas, which had been a symbol of the violence and chaos
in the criminal justice system. Optimists saw that action as
heralding a new era of reform. But there have been few signs of
improvement since then. And outrage over mounting crime has thrown
prison conditions off the list of voter concerns.
</P>
<P>
   At the prison in Ciudad Bolivar, 370 miles southeast of Caracas,
the authority of the state ends at the door. The National Guard,
responsible for security outside the prison, searches visitors. The
prison administration, with a handful of guards for the entire
prison, restricts itself to two offices at the entrance.
</P>
<P>
   The other offices house ``refugiados,'' prisoners without allies
inside, who huddle near the administration offices for safety. They
include white-collar suspects like Toledo, and, earlier this year,
a group of convicts sent here from the prison in El Dorado. The
newcomers had been involved in a fight that killed 29 men, many
with friends in Ciudad Bolivar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Practically speaking, they sent us to the guillotine to die,''
said Jorge Luis Rey, 26. When the group arrived last August, one of
them was killed almost immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The consequences of being cut or shot are serious here, too,
given the virtual absence of medical care. Raul Millan, 30, was
shot in his left leg three years ago by an inmate with a homemade
gun. With no treatment for the infection, his leg had to be
amputated.
</P>
<P>
   Seizing weapons does little good, said Eulice Villamonte, the
weekend prison director. Within days the weapons reappear. ``Where
they're coming from, I don't know,'' she said. ``I won't say my
guards are saints, but I don't believe they're bringing in
weapons.'' She acknowledged, however, that she has no control over
the National Guard stationed outside.
</P>
<P>
   Within the fiercely protected borders of their fiefdoms,
prisoners seem to strive for something near normal lives. In El
Reyo pavilion, the inmates have opened a bakery, fashioning an oven
from an old metal cabinet, with a hot plate on the ground to heat
the chamber. One prisoner gently lifted a towel and untied the
cloth scraps that shut the door. A cake was baking on the metal
shelf.
</P>
<P>
   Most women sent here quickly choose common-law husbands among
the inmates, but men at Ciudad Bolivar are also allowed weekly
conjugal visits. The women say a kind of chivalry prevails, with
the men largely respecting the few female prisoners among them.
Until recently, babies were born and raised at Ciudad Bolivar.
</P>
<P>
   Meals come in vast tubs left by the authorities at the prison
gate, with inmates dividing the food among themselves. On one
recent day, it was seasoned rice and a few chunks of sausage.
</P>
<P>
   Budget cutbacks have ended rehabilitative programs, and the
inmates have taken over the building that had been used for
classes. They have strung up bed sheets to hang like translucent
walls from the ceilings. In a neighboring yard, a shantytown has
gone up, with electrical wires running in every direction. Some
huts have walls of cinderblock, others of wood or bed sheets.
</P>
<P>
   The roof of one shack, built by Luis Beltran, a 37-year-old
inmate nicknamed ``the architect,'' is a collage of tar paper and
cardboard, the holes plugged with anything that can be scavenged:
an egg carton, a beach thong, a battered thermos laid on its side.
Most of the shacks do not have mattresses, and all leak in the
rain.
</P>
<P>
   But allies are more important than mattresses. Antonio Gomez,
24, said that upon entering Ciudad Bolivar prison five years ago
for murder he first sought friends, crucial for safety, and then
decent living space.
</P>
<P>
   Now he lives with two of them in a section that used to be the
women's annex, before the male prisoners ripped out the bars that
once separated them from the women.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez carves a black stone, azaballe, that he makes into
pendants, bracelets and watchbands. One pendant shows a woman
astride a leopard. Many show Jesus. ``Here you lose your family,
your wife, your children,'' he said. ``I live through my work.''

DEATHS OF HOMELESS INCREASE IN SAN FRANCISCO 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ More homeless people died in San Francisco in
the last 12 months than in any year since tracking began in 1985,
an increase that has alarmed and frustrated advocates for the
homeless and city health workers.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths numbered 157. They were detailed in the Homeless
Death Review, issued last week by the San Francisco Department of
Public Health and covering the period from December 1997 to Nov.
30. Last year's report counted 104 deaths. The previous record was
154 deaths in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The review, the third such analysis since the city took over the
annual project from a neighborhood newspaper, is compiled from data
released by the medical examiner's office. The figures indicate how
risky life on the streets has become in San Francisco, where the
mayor's office estimates that 4,000 people are homeless on any
night. There are at most 2,000 emergency shelter beds, meaning that
2,000 people are without a place to stay on any night.
</P>
<P>
   The causes of death include drowning and asthma, but substance
abuse is the leading killer.
</P>
<P>
   Drug overdoses were responsible in 62 cases, either from heroin
alone or in combination with other drugs. Ten people died from
alcohol-related problems. Seven had heart disease, and two died
from AIDS. Seven committed suicide, six were murdered and five died
after being struck by cars. The average age at death was 42.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials and advocacy groups say they cannot explain
exactly why the increase occurred. But many pointed to the rigors
of the intense El Nino winter, and others blamed police sweeps that
displaced many homeless people from places like Golden Gate Park.
</P>
<P>
   Housing is scarce, too, said Marian Pena, director of the health
department's homeless program.
</P>
<P>
   ``People just can't find housing,'' Ms. Pena said. ``Hundreds of
units have been lost to fires or to tourism, with a room with no
bath renting for $600 and more.''
</P>
<P>
   Heroin also played a part.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen a huge increase in the number of heroin-related
deaths in the past two years,'' Ms. Pena said. ``It has been more
pure, cheaper and in some cases contaminated.''
</P>
<P>
   The contamination, both bacterial and viral, can come from
shared needles or from the heroin itself.
</P>
<P>
   Kandace Bender, press secretary to Mayor Willie Brown Jr., said
she agreed that drugs and alcohol were significant factors in the
number of deaths, and said the mayor was addressing the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last three years,'' Ms. Bender said, ``the mayor has
provided $11 million for substance abuse programs and mobile
outreach programs. The mayor is very concerned about this problem,
and continues to work on a continuum of care that combines shelter,
outreach, counseling, jobs and transitional housing.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Boden, director of the San Francisco Coalition on
Homelessness, who helped prepare the reports, said he would like to
see city officials find a way to better use the information that
agencies gather on the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all these folks that they are finding dead in the city,''
Boden said, ``there is a lot of information available about them.
They have been through intake programs, screenings, for substance
abuse, for housing. All that information is centralized. But the
information is simply not being used.''
</P>
<P>
   In a modest effort at intervention, the health department last
year began a death prevention program made up of three health care
workers and a nurse. The program, operated on a slim budget, does
not even have a vehicle for its rounds of the city's poorest areas.
The team tries to identify high-risk cases and get individuals into
treatment quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some resources,'' Ms. Pena said, ``but we don't have
enough. We need to stop pretending that we do have enough. And it's
absolutely futile to talk about substance abuse without dealing
with the housing issue.''

SOME N.B.A. PLAYERS AT CHARITY GAME ARE OPTIMISTIC
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By MIKE WISE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY _ As if the season were nearing the halfway point,
Karl Malone has been running hills, lifting weights and playing
pickup games with his Utah Jazz teammates. He said his feelings
about the labor dispute resemble those of most of his locked-out
peers _ he thinks the owners' offer is a fair one, and he believes
there will be a season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not even something I'm thinking about, that there might
not be a season,'' Malone said before he and a group of National
Basketball Association all-stars played a game for charity here on
Saturday night. ``This isn't one of those games where you say,
`This might be the only game we play.'''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Hardaway, whose 19 fourth-quarter points led his red team to
victory, said: ``Come on, you know we're going to be playing. It's
just a matter of time for them to work things out and take care of
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Either 430 players are not taking seriously N.B.A. Commissioner
David Stern's comments about losing the season, or they know
something the rest of America does not, and perhaps a settlement is
close.
</P>
<P>
   Stern and Billy Hunter, the union executive director, waged an
express mail war last week. After Stern forwarded the league's most
recent proposals to the players on Wednesday and Hunter issued a
point-by-point response on Friday, both sides said they were still
far apart on many key economic issues.
</P>
<P>
   Yet most of the players who competed in ``The Game on Showtime''
Saturday sounded as if training camps would open at the latest in
mid-January. To have between a 40- and 50-game season, the league
would have to begin its season by the first week of February.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, a deal is just about in place,'' Malone said. ``I was
looking at what Stern sent to us in the mail. It's a fair deal, but
some things still need to happen for us to accept it.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone went so far as to say that the majority of the players
would probably accept the owners' current proposal, a statement
that could only hurt the union's leverage as it heads for what
could be construed as the final stages of negotiations. To which
Hunter replied, ``Karl has his own opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   An agreement would not be voted on by the union's general body
until the players negotiating committee approved of the deal. And
it should be noted that Malone's public musings have been more
provocative than substantive. He said that he would not play in
Utah again, but he recanted a few days later.
</P>
<P>
   But his comments reflect a feeling among the players that
somehow, some way, the owners and players will solve their
differences and figure out how to amicably divide the league's $2
billion in annual revenue before the season is lost.
</P>
<P>
   Stern has left for Aspen, Colo., and plans to spend at least a
few days at his vacation home. Hunter is expected to leave for his
home in Oakland, Calif., early this week. Neither union nor league
attorneys expected there to be more talks before Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   During a Dec. 12 negotiation, the players made a major
concession by suggesting an absolute limit of $10 million on the
amount paid to players with less than seven years of experience _
Kevin Garnett, who was the fifth pick in the 1995 draft, is
scheduled to make about $14 million this season. But the owners are
still trying to limit the high-end salaries on every player in the
league. While both sides are close on other issues, the league and
the union cannot agree to the percentage at which an escrow system
would be triggered. The players' lowest offer is believed to be 56
percent, and the owners are currently at 53.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a group of current and former all-stars played in one
of the few organized games that has been held since last season. It
was sloppy at times, but also entertaining. Some, like Shawn Kemp
and Patrick Ewing, appeared a month away from NBA-game shape.
Others, like Hardaway, Malone and Reggie Miller, looked as if they
could play 48 minutes today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nice to finally get up and down the court and see some
fans in the stands again,'' Tim Hardaway said. ``No question, it
will take a while to get all them back after this is over. But
we'll do what we have to do to get it done.'' &QL;

ISLANDERS TO PRACTICE FOR FIRST TIME WITH PLAFFY
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By TARIK EL-BASHIR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The New York Islanders lost 4-2 to the sizzling
Coyotes Sunday, but they will return from their trip with something
they have been without for weeks: hope. For the Islanders, hope is
spelled Z-I-G-G-Y.
</P>
<P>
   Zigmund Palffy, the Islanders' top scorer the past three
seasons, will join the team for Monday's practice, which will be
his first appearance on Long Island since ending a three-month
holdout last week by signing a five-year deal averaging $5.5
million a season.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Palffy, who scored 45 goals and had 42 assists last
season, will make his season debut against the St. Louis Blues at
Nassau Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to add a spark to our team just having him at
practice tomorrow,'' said Trevor Linden, the Islanders' captain.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders (12-19) turned in another dogged performance
Sunday, taking the Coyotes, one of the league's best teams
(18-5-4), late into the third period tied at 2-2. But with 5
minutes 20 seconds left, Keith Tkachuk, the Coyotes' bruising left
wing who had missed the two previous games with a strained groin,
redirected a shot between Tommy Salo's pads on a power play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their top player did what he does best,'' Mike Milbury, the
Islanders' coach and general manager, said of Tkachuk, who got his
16th goal this season. ``He drove a stake through our heart. That
is why he's a star player.''
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders had a chance to tie the score with 38 seconds left
in the third period when Claude Lapointe nearly slapped the puck
between the pads of Nikolai Khabibulin, the Coyotes' goalie. It was
the last chance the Islanders would have because Phoenix locked up
the victory at the sold-out America West Arena seconds later with
an empty-net goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``A tie or a win would have been icing on the cake,'' Milbury
said. ``I told the guys this was a pretty good road trip, and maybe
we can build on that.'' The Isles were 2-1-1 on their Western
swing.
</P>
<P>
   In the first period, Salo, who made 30 saves, stopped every shot
he could, and even some he should not have, but the Coyotes still
managed to score once, taking a 1-0 lead at 16:37. Greg Adams
tapped in a rebound as Salo lay sprawled on the ice after making an
eye-popping toe-strap save on Jyrki Lumme.
</P>
<P>
   New York came back on a goal by the journeyman Mark Lawrence,
who beat Khabibulin between the pads at 17:41, his first goal of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   Juha Ylonen put Phoenix ahead again with a goal at 2:10 of the
second period, but the Islanders tied it once more when Eric Brewer
scored midway through the final period.
</P>
<P>
   When the Islanders left for San Jose last week, they were losers
of seven straight games. But they will return to Long Island having
beaten the Sharks and Kings and tied the Mighty Ducks before losing
Sunday. It seems the Islanders have rediscovered the game _ gritty
with a strong defensive presence _that made them successful in
October. And, they will have Palffy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what kind of shape Ziggy is in,'' Milbury said.
``But whatever shape he is in, he's going to bring an added
dimension.''

PRESIDENT HOLDS PUBLIC'S SUPPORT, 2 POLLS INDICATE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)
<TEXT>
<P>
   By JOHN C. HENRY
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
c. 1998
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
WASHINGTON _ In the wake of his impeachment by the House, public
support for President Clinton appeared unshaken Sunday as members
of the Senate mulled how to bring the constitutional crisis to a
quick, just end.
</P>
<P>
   While no consensus has emerged on how best to proceed _ whether
with a full trial or a plea-agreement for censuring the president _
Republican and Democratic senators agreed they will have to rise
above the partisan rancor that marked much of the House
deliberations over Clinton's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many ways, the Senate's on trial here in a way, too,'' said
Sen. Christopher Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat. ``We're the court of
last resort, of trying to restore some civility here.''
</P>
<P>
   Voting along party lines, the House on Saturday impeached
Clinton on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice stemming
from his effort to conceal an illicit affair with former White
House intern Monica Lewinsky. Another perjury charge and an
abuse-of-office charge were rejected by the House.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, only the second president in history to face a Senate
trial after being impeached by the House, vowed to fight to remain
in office until his term ends in January 2001.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Clinton and daughter Chelsea went to church, and as
they emerged from Foundry United Methodist in downtown Washington
they were confronted by an angry parishioner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Damn you, for what you've done to the nation!'' the man
barked. ``Please resign for the good of the world!''
</P>
<P>
   Initially taken aback, Clinton turned with Chelsea and began
waving to about 100 people who were cheering and holding up signs
saying: ``Complete Your Term'' and ``God Bless Our Prez.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's determination to remain on the job was endorsed
by a substantial majority of Americans in two separate polls taken
after Saturday's impeachment vote by the House. One of the surveys
found Clinton's job-approval rating at an all-time high.
</P>
<P>
   An NBC poll found 62 percent of adult Americans saying Clinton
should serve out his term, up from 51 percent earlier in the week
before the House impeachment debate began.
</P>
<P>
   A CBS/New York Times poll released Sunday found 66 percent of
adults saying Clinton should remain in office, compared to 69
percent before the House vote.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Americans favor by a 2-to-1 margin censuring the
president rather than putting him through a Senate trial for his
behavior in the Lewinsky matter, according to the CBS/New York
Times survey.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's approval rating rose after the vote to 72 percent,
according to the NBC poll, which earlier in the week showed him
with a 68 percent job approval rating.
</P>
<P>
   White House Chief of Staff John Podesta said Sunday it would be
wrong for Clinton to step down, given the partisan nature of the
House debate and the impeachment vote against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the president were to resign under these circumstances it
would weaken the presidency. It would weaken the Constitution,''
Podesta said on CNN television's Late Edition.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing on the same program, Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, a
Texas Republican, said Clinton's admission of a long-running White
House affair with Lewinsky and his lies to his family, aides and
the public have ``degraded the office of the presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   Calling Speaker-elect Bob Livingston ``courageous'' for
announcing that he will quit the House over his own marital
infidelities, Hutchison said Clinton should do the same. ``It would
be honorable for the president to resign,'' the senator said.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders in the Senate said they expect to begin
Clinton's trial on the perjury and obstruction-of-justice charges
when the new Congress convenes Jan. 6. If convicted on either of
the articles of impeachment, Clinton would be removed from office
immediately, and Vice President Al Gore would move into the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   While most, but not all, Republicans favor a formal trial,
Democrats argue that a trial will prolong the public agony over the
sex-and-perjury scandal. Democrats favor censure as the quickest
out.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, called on Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott to take a quick survey of the 55 Republican and 45 Democrats
in the Senate and determine whether there is anything near the 67
votes required to convict Clinton and remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
   If neither of the impeachment articles are favored by 55
senators, the question facing Republicans is whether to go to trial
``knowing that... the result may be acquittal, or do you find
something like censure, like most of the members of the public say
they want,'' Hatch said on NBC's Meet the Press.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., counseled against short-circuiting a
trial by trying to reach a censure agreement with Democrats and the
White House. ``Censure is really not worth a tinker's damn,''
Specter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When this trial starts, anything can happen. Already we've
seen so many turns and twists in the road, and I think we're going
to see a lot more,'' Specter predicted on CBS's Face the Nation.
``While (Clinton's) resignation is not realistic today, a plea
bargain where he'd leave office is not in the cards today... stay
tuned.``
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said the Senate was obligated to
hold a trial, but predicted it would be tamed somewhat by requiring
some witnesses to testify behind closed doors. ``This will not be a
spectacle,'' McConnell said. ``It will not demean the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodd, appearing on Meet the Press, said censure is preferable
because a trial would ``tie up three branches of government for the
next four months.'' In addition to occupying much of the
president's and the Senate's time, a trial would require the daily
presence of Chief Justice William Rehnquist and 13 of the 21
Republican members of the House Judiciary Committee selected as
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Lending support to an agreed censure resolution is the lack of
support in the Senate for ending Clinton's presidency, said Sen.
Robert Torricelli, D-N.J. ``There is extraordinary solidarity among
Democrats in the Senate and increasingly a desire among some
Republicans in the Senate to have this matter ended,'' Torricelli
said.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Senate held a trial for the nation's chief
executive was in 1868, when President Andrew Johnson was acquitted
by a single vote after a 74-day trial.

PARCELLS PLANS TO KEEP THE PRESSURE ON HIS CHAMPIONS
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Parcells, that old softie, wiped his eyes, celebrated with
a chicken pot pie for a late-night supper and then went to bed
Saturday, having taken his third National Football League team to a
division title.
</P>
<P>
   And why not allow a bit of a smile _ even tears _ in the locker
room where the Jets were celebrating their 17-10 victory over the
Buffalo Bills, having become American Football Conference East
champions after having won only one game only two seasons ago.
</P>
<P>
   And they did it in Parcells' second season with memories
remaining among the players of the 1996 team that went 1-15, a
season when fans who spelled out J-E-T-S claimed it stood for
``Just End the Season.''
</P>
<P>
   Equally impressive, the Jets had a chance to secure a
first-round bye Sunday night if Jacksonville lost at Minnesota. In
any event, Parcells said, it would not alter his decision on his
starters in the regular-season finale next Sunday against the New
England Patriots at Giants Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want your team to be playing well as you go,'' Parcells
said Sunday, after having had only about four hours' sleep, his
norm for the night after a game. ``I've noticed with a lot of teams
trying to rest their players at the end of the year, it never seems
to work out. I've seen teams do that and get eliminated.''
</P>
<P>
   But Parcells was not all business Sunday. He was
uncharacteristically reflective.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, this is a team that initially I was a little more
distant from because a lot of the players weren't sure how to take
me and didn't want to cross my path, just be inconspicuous,'' he
said. ``Now I think it's different. They've been around me, the
guys I inherited and some of the new ones; they know what to
expect.''
</P>
<P>
   He thought about the holdovers from 1996, when the Jets
completed a two-season run of 4-28 with Rich Kotite as the coach.
Not many are left _ less than a third of the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 1-15 guys, those are the guys that said, `OK, we're just
going to blindly follow and hope we'll just get there,' '' Parcells
said. ``There's a lot of days in the weight room when you say: `Why
are we doing this? Isn't there a better way or an easier way?' ''
</P>
<P>
   But, as with the Giants and with New England, there is only the
Parcells way. And on the Jets, he has the total control and
unquestionable authority handed down from the owner, Leon Hess.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there's only one way to do it,'' Parcells said. ``Now I
think I've become a little more flexible as I've gotten older, but
I don't think I've ever been a guy to take pressure off my team.
Pepper said you've got to be a certain kind of guy to take it and
that's what I believe. It's what I've been taught; it's the way I
know.''
</P>
<P>
   Pepper Johnson is one of his Giants guys, like Curtis Martin is
one of his Patriots guys. But now, somehow, they are all his Jets
guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to Victor Green: `So what do you like better, Vic?
Which way is better?' '' Green, a Jet since 1993, did not have to
answer.
</P>
<P>
   It was, of course, a rhetorical question.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you saw those players,'' Parcells said of the emotional
locker-room scene, ``you know the game isn't about money. It's
about achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets have done what he believes good teams are supposed to
do. Indeed, the Jets now fit his definition of a good team. They
have won in the clutch, on the road.
</P>
<P>
   In getting to this point, the Jets won three road games against
their leading division rivals and had to produce second-half surges
to win. They were tied going into the third quarter against the
Bills, they trailed the Dolphins the Sunday before in Miami and
earlier this season they had fallen behind at New England in a
Monday night game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel pretty good about being able to win on the road,''
Parcells said. ``A team has to have those attributes before being
any good. What makes me feel good is going to Miami, a real big
game, a national game, their crowd in it and the Jets do well. Now
another national game, we've got to go to Buffalo. That's a good
sign for a team. We didn't play great football Saturday, but we
played just to do enough. That's why you win the division.''
</P>
<P>
   These are among the accomplishments that have eluded so many
other Jets teams:
</P>
<P>
   Three straight victories in December for the first time since
1979.
</P>
<P>
   A winning record on the road for only the second time in the
1990's.
</P>
<P>
   A five-game winning streak in the second half of the season for
the first time since 1981.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I go on the field now without worrying about what's
being said,'' Parcells said. ``I think we laugh a little more now.
I think they understand my personality, which can be volatile.''
</P>
<P>
   He spent the rest of Sunday worrying about Christmas, what time
the players will get off on Christmas Eve. He gave them off Sunday
and Monday, and will hold practice tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   The 57-year-old coach repeated another favorite motto: ``I keep
saying I'm too old to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not too many players understand that,'' Parcells said. ``But
some of my players understand it. I understand it. It takes too
much out of me. When you win, it makes it all worthwhile.''
</P>
<P>
   So he is hardly worried that his team _ finally, his team _ gets
what he is driving at. He was asked if is concerned about how hard
they will play against the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think I'll have to stress it that much,'' he said. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One message from the House for President Clinton on
Saturday was that he was blessed with the stalwart loyalty of his
fellow Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Only five Democrats broke ranks and voted for any of the
articles of impeachment. Afterward, in a striking display, two
busloads of Democratic lawmakers rallied behind the president on
the South Lawn of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   But many Democrats did not rally around their president out of
heartfelt fealty. Instead, in opposing impeachment and standing,
literally, with Clinton many were registering their disapproval of
how Republicans have handled the inquiry _ as well as their belief
that impeachment is not warranted. A number of House Democrats
expressed that view in interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you'd find a whole lot of loyalty to Bill
Clinton around here,'' said Rep. Louise M. Slaughter of upstate New
York. ``He's not the best Democrat any of us have seen. Most of us
are scared to death of the constitutional'' implications.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland said he, too, was ``not
rallying around the president.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A large number of us,'' he said, ``are saying, `We don't have
to cross the line of personal loyalty.' There are some who are so
outraged by how the president was treated, the whole process, the
Starr investigation. The other half of our caucus is somewhat in
bewilderment that this even elevates to an impeachable offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David E. Skaggs of Colorado said: ``If you accumulated the
credit balance on the loyalty account with all Democratic members
of the House, it's in the black, but not by a lot because there's
been this general sense over there that there's not a lot of
loyalty shown in the other direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Skaggs, who is retiring, added: ``We all have this running
love-hate relationship with the president. On one hand he's a
charming and good leader. On the other hand, he's absolutely
infuriating and alienating.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he was rallying around the president out of
loyalty, Rep. Rick Boucher of Virginia, a member of the Judiciary
Committee, said: ``Absolutely not. Every one here has a deep
disdain for his conduct. It is deplorable. He has dishonored his
office.''
</P>
<P>
   But, in opposing impeachment, Boucher said, ``I see myself
defending the public interest, the constitutional standard for
impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Rep. Robert Wexler of Florida, who was one of the most
vociferous defenders of Clinton on the Judiciary Committee,
conceded that his fervency was not borne of affection for the
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm rallying around the Constitution,'' he said. ``I'm
rallying around the American presidency. This has become far bigger
than Bill Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   The notion of an outpouring of devotion to Clinton may be
particularly misplaced because many Democrats are still bitter at
the president on a number of counts, from accusations that he shut
them out of numerous policy deliberations _ preferring to do
business with Republicans _ to blaming him for costing them control
of the House in the 1994 election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even as recently as last fall we were pretty much shut out,''
Mrs. Slaughter said. ``The difficulty I've got in my district is
people perceive that I'm protecting him. My problem is I do believe
he is being railroaded.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the lingering tensions between Democratic lawmakers and
the president, one House Democratic leadership aide said he was
surprised that members of his party had stood behind the president
so solidly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The don't like the president,'' the aide said, speaking on the
condition of anonymity. ``But the Republicans have done a good job
at uniting us _ and driving us into his arms.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster, said he believed that it
was easier for Republicans to be more passionate because even many
Democrats who oppose impeachment feel a conflict between their
anger at the Republicans and their rage at Clinton for his
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the cause looks completely holy, you're going to give it
your all,'' Mellman said. ``If Democrats thought the president did
the right thing in having this relationship _ and did nothing wrong
_ it would be easier to be a 100 percenter. It's hard to summon the
same level of fervency when you think that what the Republicans are
doing is reprehensible, but you also think what the president did
was reprehensible _ but not impeachable.''

BIBBY BEMOANS CHANGING ATTITUDE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When USC point guard Kevin Augustine suddenly quit
the team last week, it once again underscored to coach Henry Bibby
the attitude differences that have taken place since he played at
UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a totally different basketball player today,'' Bibby
said. ``I dared not question Coach (John) Wooden, (assistant
coaches) Denny Crum or Gary Cunningham about my playing time. I was
afraid of Coach Wooden.''
</P>
<P>
   Bibby feels the biggest problem today is that players are
constantly influenced by advisers, sometimes a club coach, who feel
their player is not receiving enough playing time.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many people in the background that push these
kids,'' Bibby said. ``We have so many outside factors playing into
these guys, telling them they are the greatest players.''
</P>
<P>
   Bibby's also noticing the difference between college basketball
and his stints coaching in the Continental Basketball Association,
where he could deal with problem players.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the CBA, I got rid of them,'' he said. ``(In college) the
kids can leave anytime they want, but we can't do anything. I think
we should give both sides the same option.''
</P>
<P>
   Not necessarily a point guard: Although Augustine's departure
leaves USC with two point guards _ freshman Brandon Granville and
junior Quincy Wilder _ Bibby said he will not feel compelled to
sign another point guard with Augustine's scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking for the best guy available,'' Bibby said. ``The
best possible player we can get. It opens a whole new ballgame for
us. It gives us another opportunity, maybe to get something we're
lacking.''
</P>
<P>
   Bibby is also confident that Wilder, who has been unhappy with
his playing time, will emerge now that he is clearly the No. 2
point guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``He brings a lot to the team if he's focused and accepting,''
Bibby said. ``I like Quincy's size, his athleticism and strength.
He's a bigger version of Kevin Augustine for us. He can play
against bigger guards.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner at the point? Bibby is also considering moving 6-foot-8
forward Jarvis Turner to point guard, much like he converted small
forward Rodrick Rhodes two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some things I'm knocking around,'' Bibby said. ``My
assistants think I'm crazy. If I have to go with Brandon, Quincy
and Jarvis next year, we can do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Lesson from loss: Forward Brian Scalabrine said there was at
least one positive aspect of the Trojans' blowout 107-78 loss to
Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still scored 78 points even though we shot the ball
terribly and had 29 turnovers,'' Scalabrine said. ``That's a lot of
points for the number of times we turned the ball over against
Kansas, which is a good team.''
</P>
<P>
   Iron woman: Point guard Kristin Clark is back in a familiar role
for the USC women's basketball team. Clark leads the Women of Troy
in minutes played now that Erica Mashia (knee) and Kiyoko Miller
(shoulder) are out for the season with injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Clark is playing 36 minutes per game and no longer playing
shooting guard, which is her natural position.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something I'm used to,'' Clark said. ``Now, it's back to
the same old, same old.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark also averaged 36 minutes per game last season. Clark is
averaging 17.0 points, 2.86 steals and 3.4 assists per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our last game we dressed eight people,'' Clark said. ``It's
just devastating to me. We were supposed to have a great year.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As part of his preparation to become speaker, Bob
Livingston was reading a book by the master, former Speaker Tip
O'Neill's ``All Politics Is Local.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's full of good, common-sense stuff,'' Livingston was saying
the other day. ``It's good preparation for being speaker and a good
primer for any politician.''
</P>
<P>
   But nothing could have prepared Livingston for the whirligig of
recent events. His tenure as speaker-elect lasted just 32 days,
from his nomination by his party on Nov. 18 to his breathtaking
resignation on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Having confessed two days earlier to ``having strayed outside my
marriage,'' he stood in the well of the House during the
impeachment debate against President Clinton and said he would not
stand for election as speaker on Jan. 6 and would quit the House
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing in his career like the leaving of it. As
Livingston recently said at a college graduation ceremony in his
home district in Louisiana, his was a relatively undistinguished
life.
</P>
<P>
   He spent 16 years as a backbencher in the minority in the House,
and then was plucked from obscurity by Speaker Newt Gingrich to be
chairman of the Appropriations Committee. He loved it. But it
didn't pay enough, and earlier this year, Livingston was ready to
leave Congress and work as a lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich convinced him to stay, on the theory that some day
Gingrich might vacate the speakership and Livingston could take
over. His chance materialized after the Nov. 3 midterm elections,
when the Republicans barely held their majority. Livingston
announced his candidacy on Nov. 6, and Gingrich quit the same day.
</P>
<P>
   In all of his public pronouncements, there was nothing grandiose
in Livingston's view of the speakership. He struggled to give
rhetorical altitude to his fairly earthbound view of his task,
which was to make the trains run on time. The most memorable phrase
from his announcement of his candidacy was his promise to be ``a
stay-at-home type of speaker.''
</P>
<P>
   In his resignation speech on Saturday on the House floor,
Livingston lamented the destructiveness of the impeachment process.
``The debate has done nothing to bring us together, and I greatly
regret that it has become quite literally the opening gambit of the
intended Livingston speakership,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And in perhaps one of his most revealing sentences, he seemed
near despair: ``We are all pawns on the chessboard, and we are
playing our parts in a drama.''
</P>
<P>
   Livingston's friends were trying on Sunday to make sense of the
abrupt end to his political career, especially on a day when it was
President Clinton who was impeached but was still standing.
</P>
<P>
   One cited the confluence of overwhelming events _ a fear that
more damaging details of his private life might come out, the
declaration by some conservatives that he had lost their support,
the bruises he had caused within his own family, the recognition
that whatever followed, he was being introduced to the public as an
adulterer who voted to impeach the president.
</P>
<P>
   Another said that Livingston's taste for power was more than
satisfied. In recent days, before he was swept up in impeachment,
he told audiences that he was a little nervous about becoming
speaker, that from the outside it looked like an incredibly
difficult job, and he talked about getting hit with a ``firehose''
of information.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, he was slowly building up the confidence that ``a
kid from nowhere'' was up to the task. He called himself the Little
Engine That Could.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can do this,'' he said as recently as the weekend before
last, sounding as if he still needed some convincing.

 &HT;    Guiding Falcons to title win adds `more to the mix' for Brooks
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PONTIAC, Mich. _ The Fox TV Network caught two glimpses of Rich
Brooks at work on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Its cameras focused in on Brooks up in the Silverdome coaching
box, deep in thought during the first half, rubbing a furrowed
brow.
</P>
<P>
   And again with 1:39 to play, when Eugene Robinson's interception
wrapped up the Falcons' victory. Same Rich Brooks, interim head
coach, stoic and low-key. A division championship in the books, and
Brooks was calmly packing up his headset and binoculars.
</P>
<P>
   The smiles would come later for Brooks, who was sitting in for
Dan Reeves. The Falcons head coach, who underwent bypass surgery
last week, was remembered in a banner behind the Atlanta bench:
``Get Well Soon Coach Reeves.''
</P>
<P>
   The activity on the sidelines appeared to be business as usual.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure was on Brooks, the team's assistant head coach and
defensive coordinator, to keep the Falcons' on track. He would do
what he normally does, call the defensive plays from the press box,
with the added burden of filtering the offensive play-calling.
</P>
<P>
   It was supposed to work like this: quarterbacks coach Jack
Burns, sitting with a headset on in the pressbox, would confer with
running backs coach George Sefcik and then relay the play to backup
quarterback Steve DeBerg on the sideline. DeBerg would then call
the play into his headset, transmitting it to Chris Chandler's
helmet.
</P>
<P>
   Even a casual observer could sense that something was amiss.
During an early series of plays, DeBerg gestured with his arm as if
tossing salt over his right shoulder. The secret signal? Jim
Hewitt, who does Grounds Maintenance at Suwanee and keeps track of
the headsets, walked over and pushed a button on DeBerg's controls.
They smiled grimly.
</P>
<P>
   The headsets were dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our headsets went out after the first drive,'' Chandler said.
``Steve would push the button and start talking, but I couldn't
hear him. So we'd have to signal plays in. One thing we do all week
is signal plays, just in case something like this happens. Bergie
sending them into me went just as smooth as practice goes. Once the
headset came back on the second half, it was a little bit better,
just 'cause you could talk a little better about changing
signals.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They were on and off in the first half. Then just before the
half they went totally out,'' DeBerg said. ``An antenna came apart
or something somewhere in the stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   In the coaching box, you could have fooled Brooks by telling him
the technology was causing a glitch. He's a defensive coach who
usually never eavesdrops on the offensive chats. That's Reeves
department under normal circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time I've been on the headset with the
offense in two years here,'' Brooks said. ``I don't know how many
plays Dan influences or changes, but the system worked as it has
worked, with Jack calling the plays down to the sideline and
relayed into the quarterback. I think it worked well enough,
obviously.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks said he knew enough about the offense, with the amazing
Jamal Anderson running 147-yards strong, to leave it in Burns'
hands. ``I didn't overrule any of the offensive plays,'' Brooks
said. ``I just told them late in the game let's run it a little
more.''
</P>
<P>
   The game plan he'd hoped to pull off was supposed to dominate
the lowly Lions and give Reeves a stress-free TV experience from
home. But the Falcons didn't take control until late in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure it wasn't a stress-free experience for Dan watching
from home and I apologize for that,'' Brooks said. ``We just didn't
start out playing the type of defense we've been playing for the
last 6-7 weeks. We got around to it about the middle of the third
quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   By then, the Falcons' plan to call Reeves at home and pipe the
call into the locker room seemed like nice idea. But technology, or
perhaps not enough planning by Brooks, did that one in, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We set up a speaker phone system here to try to have him talk
to the team in case we won the division, but we didn't tell him, so
the phone's ringing at his house but nothing's going through,''
Brooks said. ``That's a real bad call by the old, interim head
coach.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he would carry home one of the new Falcons caps, the one
embroidered, ``Champions,'' to Reeves. And he would file this game
away in his book of memories.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose it was a little added pressure (on me) this week,
but it would have meant a tremendous amount to me, anyway,'' said
Brooks, once the head coach of the Rams.
</P>
<P>
   ``To win a division championship in the NFL is not an easy thing
to do; to get a first round bye going into the playoffs is not an
easy thing to do. The fact that I was the interim head coach this
week doesn't make it any sweeter to me; it really doesn't. It just
added a little more to the mix.''

HOUSTON WOMAN DELIVERS ONLY KNOWN LIVING OCTUPLETS
</HEADLINE>

   By T.J. MILLING &QL;
</P>
<P>
   c. 1998 &QL; 
Houston Chronicle &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A 27-year-old Houston woman on Sunday became the
mother of the only known set of living octuplets.
</P>
<P>
   Nkem Chukwu gave birth to five girls and two boys by Caesarean
section about 9 a.m. at St. Luke's Episcopal Hospital. The eighth
child, a girl, was born naturally 13 days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The newborns _ who weighed between 11 ounces and 1 pound, 11
ounces _ were in critical condition and put on ventilators.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're doing as well as could be expected,'' said Dr. Patti
Savrick, a pediatrician at Texas Children's Hospital, where the
newborns were taken. ``She is a remarkable woman. She's very
serene, a very spiritual woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Chukwu and her husband, Iyke, a respiratory therapist, had been
trying to have children for some time, Dr. Brian Kirshon, a St.
Luke's high risk obstetrician/gynecologist. She miscarried a set of
triplets at 21 weeks of pregnancy earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   She was given a combination of hormones that induced multiple
ovulation, the same treatment that led to sextuplets here a month
ago and septuplets for an Iowa couple a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   When it was determined that she was carrying six or more
fetuses, she was referred to Kirshon, who specializes in dangerous
births. Chukwu had been in the hospital for 2{ months and on strict
bed rest for six weeks, the last two of which she was positioned on
an incline with her head down to take pressure off her cervix.
</P>
<P>
   Kirshon said a reduction, a procedure to remove some of the
fetuses to give the others a better chance of surviving, was
offered but declined. Doctors believed she was carrying at most
seven fetuses until Dec. 8, when she gave birth to the first girl.
An ultrasound view of the womb then showed there were seven more, a
fact kept under wraps for the rest of her pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, powerful drugs administered to stop uterine
contractions helped her cervix close back up so the other fetuses
could mature further, which increased their chances of survival,
Kirshon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That in and of itself is a tremendous accomplishment,''
Kirshon said.
</P>
<P>
   But doctors began to worry about the smallest fetus being able
to live much longer in the crowded womb. Kirshon said Chukwu showed
tremendous dedication to her unborn children, never complaining,
even offering to stop eating if it would provide more room for the
fetuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a model patient,'' he said. ``I think she is
remarkable in that she was able to tolerate such conditions. She
kept a positive attitude and was willing to do whatever it took.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday morning, Chukwu went into labor, and a crew of about 25
health-care workers became a baby brigade with Kirshon and two
other doctors performing the 45-minute operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a parade of people walking out of the delivery
room,'' Savrick said.
</P>
<P>
   The seven newborns ended up being 2{ months premature, a period
at which statistics show an 85 percent survival rate, said Dr.
Leonard Weisman, chief of neonatology at Texas Children's. They
face the problems typical of premature birth. Their lungs are
lacking in a liquid called surfactant, produced by fully developed
lungs to aid in breathing, and their hearts are weak.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a remarkable feat if all the babies survive,''
Kirshon said.
</P>
<P>
   Weisman said the infants may have digestive problems and have an
increased risk of infection and organ failure. Chukwu, who lives in
a modest southwest Houston neighborhood, may be allowed to go home
by the end of the week, but the babies probably will stay
hospitalized for two months.
</P>
<P>
   The five surviving infants from a set of sextuplets, born Nov.
11 to Chris Collins of Kingwood, are still at Texas Children's.
</P>
<P>
   In Carlisle, Iowa, Bobbi and Kenny McCaughey, parents of the
world's first surviving set of septuplets, were celebrating
Christmas with their church family when they heard the news of the
Chukwu octuplets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wish them the Lord's blessing and a merry Christmas,'' the
couple told the Associated Press through their Tennessee-based
agent, Wes Yoder.

<P>
   The McCaughey septuplets were about nine weeks premature when
they were born on Nov. 19, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Guinness Book of World Records, the largest
multiple birth was nine babies in Sydney, Australia, in 1971. Six
of those children survived.
</P>
<P>
   Three other octuplet births have been recorded in the past 13
years.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, Rosario Clavijo, 31, of Huelva, Spain, became
pregnant with the aid of fertility drugs and gave birth Dec. 5,
1996, to six healthy babies _ four boys and two girls. Two children
died.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1996, a 32-year-old British woman, Mandy Allwood,
conceived eight fetuses and rejected medical advice to abort some
of them. Her pregnancy and her decision to have all the babies
aroused controversy after she hired a publicist to a tabloid
newspaper, which bought her story for a high sum based on how many
live births she produced. Four months into pregnancy, she lost all
the fetuses.
</P>
<P>
   A 25-year-old woman from Imzir, Turkey, gave birth to octuplets
on Dec. 20, 1985, but six died within 12 hours. The five boys and
three girls were delivered by Caesarean section, 12 weeks
premature. The mother, Sevil Capan, had been taking fertility
drugs. The remaining two babies died within three days of their
birth.

HOUSE DELIVERY OF ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT BEGINS IMPEACHMENT TRIAL
<TEXT>

</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
WASHINGTON _ The trial will begin with a simple oath: ``I do
solemnly swear that in all things appertaining to the trial of the
impeachment of William Jefferson Clinton, president of the United
States, I will do impartial justice according to the Constitution
and laws. So help me God.''
</P>
<P>
   After making this pledge, Chief Justice William H Rehnquist will
perform his constitutional duty to preside over just the second
presidential impeachment trial in U.S. history. The first, which
Rehnquist himself chronicled in a 1992 book, resulted in the
acquittal of Andrew Johnson 130 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate trial of Clinton will be unlike any proceeding the
public has ever seen or will likely witness again. Many protections
afforded to criminal defendants at the local courthouse _ the
constitutional bar against being tried twice, the privilege against
self-incrimination, rules limiting trial evidence, proof beyond a
reasonable doubt and the right to appeal _ will generally not apply
to the president.
</P>
<P>
   The process was begun Saturday afternoon, when the 13 trial
managers selected by the House, led by House Judiciary Committee
Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill, delivered the two articles of
impeachment to the Senate. Formal notice was then sent by the
Senate to Rehnquist and Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Acting as prosecutors, or ``managers'' in impeachment parlance,
the team led by Hyde will argue that Clinton should be removed from
office for committing perjury and obstructing justice in an attempt
to conceal his extramarital affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Defending the president will be his legal team, which tried in
vain this month to persuade the House not to impeach him. The team
will be led by White House Counsel Charles F.C. Ruff, Special
Counsel Greg Craig and Clinton's private attorney, David Kendall.
In addition, the White House has recruited former Sen. George
Mitchell to aid in the president's defense.
</P>
<P>
   If two-thirds of the Senate _ 67 of the 100 senators _ vote to
convict, Clinton's penalty will be expulsion from office. And even
if acquitted, the president could still face criminal indictment
after his term expires.
</P>
<P>
   The potential legal jeopardy after leaving office confronts
Clinton and his attorneys with a difficult choice of whether to let
the president testify before the Senate. If Clinton chooses to
testify, anything he says could and would be used against him at a
criminal trial.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to a criminal trial, the senators sitting in
judgment of the president will be free to interpret his silence as
an admission of guilt. The Fifth Amendment of the Constitution,
which does not apply to impeachment trials, prohibits judges and
juries from drawing a conclusion of guilt from a criminal
defendant's refusal to testify.
</P>
<P>
   In another stark departure from criminal proceedings, the chief
justice's status as presiding judge will afford him little
practical control over the proceedings. Nevertheless, Clinton's
prosecutors and defenders should be prepared for the 74-year-old
Rehnquist _ who regularly stops long-winded lawyers in midsentence
at the Supreme Court _ to use his gavel to prevent them from making
verbose arguments.
</P>
<P>
   This most political of American trials will bear some
resemblance to a criminal proceeding: The prosecution and the
defense will make opening statements, and witnesses may be called.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike a criminal trial, the jurors _ 100 senators _ will be
able to question witnesses, albeit indirectly. Senate rules require
lawmakers to submit their inquiries in writing to Rehnquist.
</P>
<P>
   The chief justice will rule on procedural motions and the
admissibility of evidence. However, the Senate can override these
rulings with a majority vote taken at the request of any senator.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Clinton's defense attorneys could make a motion to
dismiss the impeachment charges altogether. If Rehnquist granted
the motion, the Republican-led Senate could, and presumably would,
overrule his decision.
</P>
<P>
   Further complicating Rehnquist's judicial role is the absence of
rules defining the scope of what evidence may be admitted at the
impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   Civil and criminal proceedings have extensive restrictions on
the types of admissible evidence. For example, hearsay testimony _
in which a witness quotes what a person said outside the courtroom
_ is generally excluded from trials as being unreliable.
</P>
<P>
   However, such controversial statements might not only be allowed
but could comprise a large part of the Senate proceeding.
Independent counsel Kenneth Starr's report, which formed the basis
for the House's impeachment of Clinton, relies heavily on hearsay
testimony regarding what the president allegedly said to Lewinsky
and aides about his relationship with her.
</P>
<P>
   In a criminal proceeding the state must prove guilt beyond a
reasonable doubt. The Constitution does not define the level of
proof required to convict a president of an impeachable offense,
leaving it to each senator to decide how much evidence is needed.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, Clinton would become the first U.S. president
expelled from office. He would have no avenue for appeal, based on
a 1993 Supreme Court decision that impeachments are political, not
legal, proceedings and, therefore, not reviewable by courts.
</P>
<P>
   The high court upheld the 1989 Senate conviction and expulsion
of former U.S. District Judge Walter L. Nixon Jr. of Southern
Mississippi for making false statements to a federal grand jury.
Rehnquist, writing for the court, said the nation's leadership
would be in dangerous limbo if a Senate conviction and removal of a
president could be appealed to the judiciary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legitimacy of any successor, and hence his effectiveness,
would be impaired severely, not merely while the judicial process
was running its course, but during any retrial that a differently
constituted Senate might conduct if its first judgment of
conviction were invalidated,'' Rehnquist wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said the chief justice's additional
duty in the Senate will not interfere with the Supreme Court's
work. The court hears arguments in the morning, making it possible
for the chief justice to preside over a Senate trial in the
afternoon, O'Connor said.
</P>
<P>
   A presidential impeachment trial is the only constitutionally
defined instance in which all three branches of the federal
government are working simultaneously. The head of the judicial
branch, the chief justice, presides; the legislative branch,
represented by the Senate, acts as jury; and the executive branch,
as embodied by the president, is the defendant.
</P>
<P>
   The only other times the American people see leaders of the
three branches at once are at the president's annual State of the
Union address and at presidential inaugurations.
</P>
<P>
   During the address, the president speaks to Congress from the
House chamber, but lawmakers and Supreme Court justices are merely
spectators. At an inauguration, the chief justice administers the
oath of office to the president, often on the steps of the Capitol,
but members of Congress do not participate in the event. &QL;

PUERTO MADERO WINS IMPRESSIVELY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ Puerto Madero might not be a perfect Gentlemen. The
two horses have different strides and personalities.
</P>
<P>
   But Puerto Madero looks like a worthy replacement for the
retired Gentlemen in the stable of owner R.D. Hubbard and trainer
Richard Mandella.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Madero, who twice ran second to likely Horse of the Year
Skip Away earlier in the season, came back from a four-month layoff
Sunday to win impressively under Kent Desormeaux in the $100,000
Native Diver Handicap at Hollywood Park.
</P>
<P>
   The victory, by 2{ lengths over Musical Gambler with River Keen
third, will send Puerto Madero into the Santa Anita meet as one of
the circuit's most feared older horses.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can go forward from this... we've got big dreams,'' said
Mandella, who expects to run the Chile-bred 4-year-old next in the
Feb. 7 San Antonio Handicap.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the Native Diver served as a springboard for
Gentlemen, who went on to earn $3.6 million before retiring
recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't really think of them as the same,'' said
Mandella, who has won the Native Diver a record six times,
including three in a row. ``Gentlemen was one tough customer. He'd
kick, bite, paw you, but only just playing. (Puerto Madero) has a
lot of character, but just in a little different way.''
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Madero paid $3.40.
</P>
<P>
   The 31-day Hollywood Park meet ends this afternoon with the
jockey and trainer titles up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   Jockey Garrett Gomez holds a 22-21 lead over Eddie Delahoussaye
and Alex Solis, who won twice Sunday. Gomez has the edge on closing
day in quantity and quality of mounts.
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Neil Drysdale has a precarious 10-9 lead over Paddy
Gallagher, Mel Stute and Paul Aguirre, who saddled one winner
Sunday. Drysdale and Gallagher have no horses in today's races and
Stute only has one long shot. Aguirre has the edge with two
favorites among his five entrants.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Hollywood Park will finish with an average of $9 million
in daily wagering, the highest for the autumn meet except for 1997,
when the track's business got a bump from hosting the Breeders'
Cup. On-site wagering and attendance have shown little change....
Santa Anita opens Saturday.... A $54.40 upset by Top Contender in
the nightcap set up a $151,798 carryover in today's pick six....
Edward Allred's Kingman Kid, ridden by Joe Badilla Jr., won the Los
Alamitos Million Futurity late Saturday night and paid $37.30. The
$1,173,605 purse for the race for 2-year-old quarterhorses was the
largest in California this season.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton has adopted a two-track approach
to his pending impeachment trial in the Senate, preparing to mount
a vigorous legal defense while seeking to reach a compromise on a
resolution of condemnation that would allow him to keep his job,
White House officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But the strategy may founder in the Senate for the same reason
it failed so spectacularly in the House, which on Saturday passed
two articles of impeachment accusing Clinton of lying under oath
before a federal grand jury and obstructing justice. Clinton is not
prepared to confess to those charges, a senior Clinton legal
adviser said Sunday, because he does not believe he committed them.
</P>
<P>
   Former Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter on Monday will
propose a swift end to the impeachment crisis through a bipartisan
censure resolution voted by the Senate and accepted by Clinton. The
proposal, to appear as an Op-Ed article in Monday's New York Times,
would require Clinton to publicly acknowledge that he lied under
oath.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials welcomed the proposal from Ford and
Carter, one of several offered by senior figures of both parties in
recent weeks, as evidence of a bipartisan desire to end the
impeachment ordeal. But they cautioned that Clinton remains
adamantly opposed to any admission of perjury.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion that he's going to come forward and say he lied is
not going to happen,'' said Gregory Craig, the White House
coordinator of the president's defense. ``He's not going to concede
he lied to the grand jury, because he did not.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's legal team is ready for a Senate proceeding that
will begin shortly after the body convenes on Jan. 6, officials
said. White House lawyers are preparing a series of motions
questioning the legitimacy of impeachment articles voted by a
lame-duck Congress and demanding that the charges against Clinton
be spelled out in detail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going forward to prepare for trial,'' said Craig.
``We're getting ready the legal arguments. We're getting ready the
motions practice. We're getting ready to present evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig and Charles Ruff, the White House counsel, will lead the
president's defense in the Senate, as they did in the House. They
intend to rely on the same factual and constitutional arguments
that were not persuasive in the House, with one important
rhetorical difference. They can no longer claim that the
accusations against Clinton do not warrant impeachment; a narrow
majority in the House declared on Saturday that they do.
</P>
<P>
   Now the president's lawyers have begun to put forward the
argument that they do not form sufficient grounds to warrant
Clinton's removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have the burden of making the case that even if the
evidence and all the allegations are true, it rises to the level,
constitutional level, that this man should be removed from
office,'' Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   But even as they prepare an aggressive legal defense, White
House officials are openly pleading for senators to find a means to
punish Clinton with a measure short of removal from office. They
are hoping that it will be easier to reach an accommodation in the
Senate, which is less sharply divided on factional lines and which
by tradition is more attuned to compromise than is the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where there's a will, there's a way,'' John Podesta, the White
House chief of staff, said in an appearance on the Cable News
Network. ``If a majority of the Senate wants to do that, they will
find a way to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another White House official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said that the president's defenders will continue to
call attention to the sharply partisan vote in the House to impeach
Clinton. They are heartened by polls that show a rise in Clinton's
popularity after the impeachment vote and a continuing decline in
public approval of the way Congress conducts its business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The House showed that a partisan majority can do whatever it
wants,'' this official said. ``The Senate, by nature, by custom, by
rule, is a different place. A partisan majority cannot ramrod
something, because of the filibuster rule and the two-thirds
requirement for impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   While White House aides expressed confidence that the Senate
would not vote to convict and remove the president, they appeared
in no hurry to begin the actual trial. One senior presidential
adviser said that the more time passes, the less popular Congress
becomes and the stronger public sentiment for an end to the crisis
grows.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more you delay it, the more angry the public becomes,''
this adviser said.
</P>
<P>
   The president's lawyers will work through the holidays preparing
his Senate defense, while hoping that it will not be needed.
</P>
<P>
   One White House legal adviser said he believed that any censure
compromise would come only after a formal trial has opened.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good number of senators believe this cannot be resolved
without at least beginning a trial,'' the lawyer said, on condition
of anonymity. ``We have to be ready to do that, and we have to be
deferential to their view of what is required by the
Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   In remarks at the White House after the impeachment vote,
Clinton pleaded for an end to the partisanship that he described as
poisoning Washington. He said that meeting the nation's challenges
required an atmosphere of ``decency and civility, some presumption
of good faith, some sense of proportionality and balance in
bringing judgment against those who are in different parties.''
</P>
<P>
   But on Sunday morning on television, James Carville, the
president's most hard-edged adviser, put Republicans on notice that
he and other Clinton partisans would continue to attack them for
the near party-line vote to impeach the president.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``There's going to be retribution,'' Carville warned darkly on
the holiday-decorated set of NBC's ``Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
   Most senior White House officials took the day off, their first
respite in weeks of building tension.
</P>
<P>
   The president attended church in the morning with his daughter,
Chelsea, and his stepfather, Dick Kelley.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Walter Shropshire of the Foundry United Methodist
Church began the service by noting the events of the past turbulent
week, which included not only the impeachment of the president but
a furious four-day bombardment of Iraq and the resignation of Rep.
Bob Livingston, the speaker-elect. He led a silent prayer for the
nation and its leaders, U.S. forces overseas and the people of
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton left the church hand in hand with Chelsea, he was met
by a heckler who demanded his resignation, and applause from a
handful of supporters.
</P>
<P>
   One carried a placard reading, ``God Bless our Prez.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A day after the House impeached President Clinton,
senators from both parties pledged on Sunday to restore civility to
the proceedings even as they quickly divided largely along party
lines over whether the president must face a Senate trial or could
be subject to censure.
</P>
<P>
   Senators on Sunday promised a different tone than in the House.
``Take politics out of it completely,'' said Sen. Arlen Specter,
R-Pa., in a televised appearance on the CBS news program ``Face the
Nation.''
</P>
<P>
   But some prominent Republicans and Democrats were already
staking out the same kinds of party-line positions familiar from
the House proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who will be the chairman of the
Rules Committee, which will preside over the impeachment trial,
insisted that the Senate is obliged to proceed to a trial. On the
Democratic side, Sen. Christopher Dodd called for a quick agreement
on censure.
</P>
<P>
   Strategists and political power-brokers all across Washington
struggled to assess the changed landscape. On Saturday, a bitter
House of Representatives voted closely along partisan lines to
impeach Clinton for perjury and obstruction of justice in his
attempts to conceal his affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton remained as popular as he has ever been, according to
the latest New York Times/CBS News poll, taken after the House
voted on Saturday and continued on Sunday. Less than a third of
those polled thought it would be better for the nation if Clinton
resigned, while two-thirds of respondents thought it would be
better if he completed his term.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, only 36 percent expressed a favorable view of the
Republican Party, while 58 percent expressed an unfavorable view.
That put the Republican Party at a lower level of popularity than
it reached after the government shutdown three years ago. Indeed,
it was the worst standing recorded for the party in the 14 years
that the New York Times and CBS News have been asking the question.
</P>
<P>
   Despite public sentiment, the road ahead is far from clear for
Clinton, the only elected president ever to be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has conducted an impeachment trial of a president
only once before, making this a matter with little precedent. The
trial of Andrew Johnson in 1868 left the Senate with 26 impeachment
rules _ from an age before television _ which were updated after
the Watergate scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Under the direction of Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader from
Mississippi, the Senate legal counsel has been studying those
rules.
</P>
<P>
   McConnell, in an appearance on the NBC' program ``Meet the
Press,'' said he did not think a trial had to run for very long,
and he set the stage for blaming the president's lawyers if it
becomes a drawn-out affair. ``I think if the president's lawyers
were cooperative this could be a very short trial because it's not
a complicated case,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Kentucky Republican also said that if the Senate does end up
having to hear from witnesses, it could do so in closed session.
``This will not be a spectacle,'' he said. ``It will not demean the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   McConnell was joined in his insistence on a trial by Sen. Don
Nickles of Oklahoma, the second-ranking Republican in the Senate
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Constitution does not provide for censure,'' Nickles said
in an appearance on ``Fox News Sunday.'' ``It also doesn't preclude
it. But I just don't see circumventing the Constitution with some
extra-constitutional authority.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats made clear that just like their House counterparts,
they would prefer a quick censure deal. Dodd, who appeared with
McConnell on ``Meet the Press,'' called for negotiations to begin
immediately, without waiting for the 106th Congress to convene on
Jan. 6. ``I think it's in everyone's interest here to try and find
some resolution of this matter,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Entering the debate, two former presidents issued a joint plea
for censure: Gerald Ford, who pardoned Richard M. Nixon in 1974
after he resigned on the verge of impeachment, and Jimmy Carter,
the Democrat who defeated Ford two years later.
</P>
<P>
   In an op-ed article in Monday's edition of The New York Times,
the one-time political opponents said that ``the time has come to
put aside political differences and plant seeds of justice and
reconciliation.'' They called for the Senate to craft a bipartisan
censure resolution that would require Clinton to acknowledge that
he did not tell the truth under oath, but would also stipulate that
his admission could not be used against him in any future criminal
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Some ad hoc behind-the-scene negotiations have gone on already
on censure. Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., and one of Clinton's
earliest critics, has been quietly holding discussions with Sen.
Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who is chairman of the Senate Judiciary
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But even many senior Democrats say they believe that with the
Senate scattered for the holidays, serious discussions will only
begin when the new Congress returns on Jan. 6 _ and only after the
Senate at least nominally moves into early trial proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   The conventional wisdom is that the Senate will not be able to
muster the 67 votes necessary to convict Clinton, but until just a
few weeks ago the conventional wisdom was that the House would
never impeach the president.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch said on Sunday that Senate leaders should take a vote
count of members in order to decide how to proceed. If there is
little support beyond the 55 Republicans in the Senate for
convicting Clinton, Hatch said, the Senate should weigh what is
``best under the circumstances to resolve this matter and in the
best interests of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch has already been criticized by fellow Republicans for
being too willing to make a deal with Clinton. A critical question
is whether senior conservatives with credibility in their party
will step forward to lead negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   On CBS' ``Face the Nation,'' Sen. Robert G. Torricelli, D-N.J.,,
named several Republicans to watch _ Sens. Ted Stevens of Alaska,
John Warner of Virginia and John McCain of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are clearly enough moderate Republicans prepared to join
in the censure effort and avoid a protracted legal struggle in the
Senate,'' Torricelli said in an interview after the show. ``What is
required is a senior conservative Republican who recognizes the
electoral danger to the Republican Party and will respond to the
enormous national need to negotiate an end to this process.''
</P>
<P>
   Another conservative Republican, Thad Cochran of Mississippi,
said on ``CNN Morning News'' that there was a ''possibility'' that
the Senate would decide on an alternative to removing Clinton from
office.
</P>
<P>
   Aware that their party suffered during the prolonged government
shutdown of 1995, Republicans took pains this weekend to say that a
Senate trial would not lead to legislative paralysis. McConnell
said the Senate could ''double-track'' a trial so that it did not
consume entire days and the Senate could consider legislation at
the same time.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement on Saturday, Lott said the Senate ``will address
issues of great concern to the American people'' from education to
Social Security policy to reducing taxes and protecting the
long-term solvency of Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats raised the specter of a government that continues
to be consumed by the scandal. Dodd said he backed censure because
a trial would ``tie up three branches of government for the next
four months.'' nn

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton has adopted a two-track approach
to his pending impeachment trial in the Senate, preparing to mount
a vigorous legal defense while seeking to reach a compromise on a
resolution of condemnation that would allow him to keep his job,
White House officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But the strategy may founder in the Senate for the same reason
it failed so spectacularly in the House, which on Saturday passed
two articles of impeachment accusing Clinton of lying under oath
before a federal grand jury and obstructing justice. Clinton is not
prepared to confess to those charges, a senior Clinton legal
adviser said Sunday, because he does not believe he committed them.
</P>
<P>
   Former Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter on Monday will
propose a swift end to the impeachment crisis through a bipartisan
censure resolution voted by the Senate and accepted by Clinton. The
proposal, to appear as an Op-Ed article in Monday's New York Times,
would require Clinton to publicly acknowledge that he lied under
oath.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials welcomed the proposal from Ford and
Carter, one of several offered by senior figures of both parties in
recent weeks, as evidence of a bipartisan desire to end the
impeachment ordeal. But they cautioned that Clinton remains
adamantly opposed to any admission of perjury.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion that he's going to come forward and say he lied is
not going to happen,'' said Gregory Craig, the White House
coordinator of the president's defense. ``He's not going to concede
he lied to the grand jury, because he did not.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's legal team is ready for a Senate proceeding that
will begin shortly after the body convenes on Jan. 6, officials
said. White House lawyers are preparing a series of motions
questioning the legitimacy of impeachment articles voted by a
lame-duck Congress and demanding that the charges against Clinton
be spelled out in detail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going forward to prepare for trial,'' said Craig.
``We're getting ready the legal arguments. We're getting ready the
motions practice. We're getting ready to present evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig and Charles Ruff, the White House counsel, will lead the
president's defense in the Senate, as they did in the House. They
intend to rely on the same factual and constitutional arguments
that were not persuasive in the House, with one important
rhetorical difference. They can no longer claim that the
accusations against Clinton do not warrant impeachment; a narrow
majority in the House declared on Saturday that they do.
</P>
<P>
   Now the president's lawyers have begun to put forward the
argument that they do not form sufficient grounds to warrant
Clinton's removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have the burden of making the case that even if the
evidence and all the allegations are true, it rises to the level,
constitutional level, that this man should be removed from
office,'' Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   But even as they prepare an aggressive legal defense, White
House officials are openly pleading for senators to find a means to
punish Clinton with a measure short of removal from office. They
are hoping that it will be easier to reach an accommodation in the
Senate, which is less sharply divided on factional lines and which
by tradition is more attuned to compromise than is the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where there's a will, there's a way,'' John Podesta, the White
House chief of staff, said in an appearance on the Cable News
Network. ``If a majority of the Senate wants to do that, they will
find a way to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another White House official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said that the president's defenders will continue to
call attention to the sharply partisan vote in the House to impeach
Clinton. They are heartened by polls that show a rise in Clinton's
popularity after the impeachment vote and a continuing decline in
public approval of the way Congress conducts its business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The House showed that a partisan majority can do whatever it
wants,'' this official said. ``The Senate, by nature, by custom, by
rule, is a different place. A partisan majority cannot ramrod
something, because of the filibuster rule and the two-thirds
requirement for impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   While White House aides expressed confidence that the Senate
would not vote to convict and remove the president, they appeared
in no hurry to begin the actual trial. One senior presidential
adviser said that the more time passes, the less popular Congress
becomes and the stronger public sentiment for an end to the crisis
grows.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more you delay it, the more angry the public becomes,''
this adviser said.
</P>
<P>
   The president's lawyers will work through the holidays preparing
his Senate defense, while hoping that it will not be needed.
</P>
<P>
   One White House legal adviser said he believed that any censure
compromise would come only after a formal trial has opened.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good number of senators believe this cannot be resolved
without at least beginning a trial,'' the lawyer said, on condition
of anonymity. ``We have to be ready to do that, and we have to be
deferential to their view of what is required by the
Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   In remarks at the White House after the impeachment vote,
Clinton pleaded for an end to the partisanship that he described as
poisoning Washington. He said that meeting the nation's challenges
required an atmosphere of ``decency and civility, some presumption
of good faith, some sense of proportionality and balance in
bringing judgment against those who are in different parties.''
</P>
<P>
   But on Sunday morning on television, James Carville, the
president's most hard-edged adviser, put Republicans on notice that
he and other Clinton partisans would continue to attack them for
the near party-line vote to impeach the president.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``There's going to be retribution,'' Carville warned darkly on
the holiday-decorated set of NBC's ``Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
   Most senior White House officials took the day off, their first
respite in weeks of building tension.
</P>
<P>
   The president attended church in the morning with his daughter,
Chelsea, and his stepfather, Dick Kelley.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Walter Shropshire of the Foundry United Methodist
Church began the service by noting the events of the past turbulent
week, which included not only the impeachment of the president but
a furious four-day bombardment of Iraq and the resignation of Rep.
Bob Livingston, the speaker-elect. He led a silent prayer for the
nation and its leaders, U.S. forces overseas and the people of
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton left the church hand in hand with Chelsea, he was met
by a heckler who demanded his resignation, and applause from a
handful of supporters.
</P>
<P>
   One carried a placard reading, ``God Bless our Prez.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As President Clinton stood in the Rose Garden on
Saturday afternoon, denouncing the ``poisonous venom'' of
Washington and declaring that ``we have a lot to do before we enter
the 21st century,'' a few downcast members of his staff clustered
together just beyond the circle of cameras and reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may have a lot to do, but that's different from saying
anything can get done,'' one staff member said in a low tone.
Immediate crises like Iraq will always get the president's
attention, he added. But the test of whether Clinton's power is
ebbing, he said, will come as the president tries to remake Social
Security or choke off another bout of global economic turmoil of
the kind that, only three months ago, seemed to be taking the U.S.
economy over the edge.
</P>
<P>
   As the Senate heads into little-charted terrain in which the
president is expected to stand trial, both the economy and
Clinton's powers of persuasion at home and abroad also enter new
territory.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the markets have shrugged off Washington's bitter
season, rising even as the House of Representatives lurched toward
the impeachment vote on Saturday. And Asian markets showed little
reaction in the first trading after the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign diplomats here have shown similar lack of alarm. Several
said this weekend that they had cabled their capitals advising that
Clinton's impeachment is a particular form of Washington madness, a
nasty partisan battle that is likely to distract the United States
but not derail its policies.
</P>
<P>
   But market confidence, much like perceptions of American power,
is quirky and subject to quick reversal. It was only 19 months ago
that investors were still pouring money into Asia, convinced that
its astounding growth could not be stopped by an economic bubble or
political weakness. It was only a decade ago that Japan was
regarded as the world's greatest rising power, despite a fractious
government that seemed forever incapable of decisions or action.
</P>
<P>
   Now, all over Washington, there are murmured questions about how
a prolonged Senate trial might unnerve markets, affect the economy
and undercut belief in America's ability to lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who tells you that they understand how all this is
going to play out in the next few months is kidding themselves,''
Commerce Secretary William M. Daley said the other day. Another
Cabinet official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, noted that
Clinton had been ``wrongly written off many times before,'' and
then added that a prolonged trial, ``sooner or later _ whether it's
dealing with the budget, or the markets, or the Russians _ is going
to have a cost. The question is whether it's a big cost.''
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the cost may be fairly evident. The common
wisdom, which has often been wrong this year, is that the president
has about six months to forge the outlines of a deal to overhaul
Social Security. After next summer, the tradeoffs may become so
politically difficult that neither party will want to touch it.
</P>
<P>
   A long trial would suck the oxygen out of that debate. ``Very
little else would go on,'' Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt., said on
CNN. ``The president would be completely consumed.''
</P>
<P>
   Just how much will be accomplished depends on the strategies the
White House and congressional Republicans pursue as they try to
weather the impeachment process.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the handling of the global financial crisis and its
permutations _ dealing with a collapsing Russian economy, an
increasingly recalcitrant China and a new European currency, now
only weeks away _ could pose the true test of Clinton's credibility
in both the markets and the world.
</P>
<P>
   Even a weakened president has extraordinary powers in a military
challenge of the kind posed during the Iraq crisis over the last
week. Bipartisan support is expected, even though several
Republican leaders questioned whether Clinton was using the
cruise-missile attacks for political advantage.
</P>
<P>
   But in the far more complicated and subtle realm of trying to
shape international economic strategies to restore growth and
prevent more social explosions of the kind that rocked Indonesia,
there is no such expectation of bipartisan cooperation. Such
slow-burn crises require the president to convince both investors
and other leaders that his authority is undiminished.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sense is that the global markets haven't clicked in on
this,'' Daniel Yergin, the chairman of the consulting group
Cambridge Energy Research Associates and author of a recent book on
national economic power, said this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the impeachment had happened in October, when even the most
senior people in government were talking about the end of modern
capitalism as we know it,'' he said, ``we might be looking at a
very different global economic situation today. The requirement at
that time was to restore confidence _ and the fact that the world
is shrugging off impeachment is evidence that confidence was
restored. But the next time, it could be playing with fire.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Clinton will soon face the question of whether to
resume economic aid to Russia. Even for a president at the peak of
his game, it would be a difficult choice: Failure to provide aid
could lead to charges that he ``lost Russia'' politically, while
providing aid could open him to contentions that he lost billions
of dollars propping up a nonfunctioning economy.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will also have to decide whether to change tactics with
China, which is jailing dissidents and closing markets, just at a
time when he had hoped to say that his management of economic and
diplomatic relations with the Chinese was his greatest foreign
policy achievement.
</P>
<P>
   None of these problems, of course, were relevant in the last
impeachment trial, involving the president of a rising power in
1868.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Johnson impeachment created no real rumblings about the
American scene, except to confirm the European view that American
are barbarous and uncouth,'' said David Donald, the Harvard
historian, who has spent a lifetime studying the Civil War and
Reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have to worry about world markets then, or really
foreign policy, because there wasn't much foreign policy,'' Donald
concluded. ``In almost every sense, it was exactly the reverse of
the Clinton impeachment.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Mel Fisher, a former chicken farmer who became a Horatio Alger
figure among undersea treasure hunters, died on Saturday at his
home in Key West, Fla. He was 76.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications from cancer, the Mel Fisher museum
in Key West announced.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher found hundreds of thousands of gold and silver coins,
jewelry and bars from old-time Spanish shipwrecks in the waters off
Florida. He hunted doggedly for years for the cargo of a single
treasure-packed galleon, the Nuestra Senora de Atocha, which sank
in 1622 near the Florida Keys. Eventually his son Kane located the
underwater bounty in 1985, and treasure worth roughly $400 million
was recovered. As a result, a handful of people, including Fisher
family members, investors, and a lawyer for Fisher, David Paul
Horan, became millionaires.
</P>
<P>
   When asked why he had chosen his risky and uncertain trade,
Fisher often said, ``For the fun, the romance and the adventure.''
While he searched for treasure he liked to say hopefully, and
repeatedly, ``Today is the day.'' Another, brisker, motto was
``Finders keepers.''
</P>
<P>
   He was known for his optimism despite skeptical investors, mixed
luck in the law courts, a leaky houseboat-home, debts and far
greater sorrows: a son and daughter-in-law died when their boat
tipped in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher's success in discovering treasure and in winning title
under traditional admiralty law led environmentalists, historians
and archeologists to persuade Congress and states to control
salvage. In 1987 Congress approved the Abandoned Shipwreck Act,
which put an end to admiralty law and conveyed to states the title
to wrecks within three miles of the coastline.
</P>
<P>
   By last summer, new regulations were putting shipwrecks off
limits, or making them hard to retrieve, along the American
coastline, where laissez-faire had traditionally prevailed. By June
1998, of thousands of known wrecks, fewer than 20 were under
salvage permit _ and half were Fisher's.
</P>
<P>
   Last month Fisher admitted selling several counterfeit gold
coins at his gift shop in Key West, and agreed to repay to
purchasers the prices of the coins _ $2,500 to $10,000. It had been
asserted that they were from a 1733 Spanish fleet that went aground
off the Florida Keys.
</P>
<P>
   In a negotiated plea, Crystals of Delaware, a sales subsidiary
of a company owned by Fisher, pledged that it would put on sale
only coins that had been recovered from shipwrecks to which it had
federal salvage rights.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the counterfeits were said to have been bought from
a longtime colleague who asserted they were genuine. Michael
Halpern, a lawyer who negotiated the plea for Fisher's side, said
last month that Fisher was near death at the time, and that he
thought Fisher's ill health contributed to the fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was taking immense amounts of medicine,'' Halpern said.
``He is very, very vulnerable.'' The company pleaded no contest and
agreed to pay more than $67,000 to identified claimants.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher was born in Gary, Ind., was trained as a hydraulic
engineer at Purdue University and at the University of Alabama, but
turned to chicken-farming in California. Then he opened a diving
shop and began diving for treasure; he soon moved his family to
Florida and became a serious treasure-hunter and salvager.
</P>
<P>
   He is said to have been heartened by his finding of a doubloon
under water at the Florida coast in the 1960s, in an era when
salvage was based on Britain's admiralty law, which held salvagers'
work to be in the public interest.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his son Kane, of Sebastian, Fla., Fisher is survived by
his wife of 48 years, Dolores, known as Deo; two other sons, Kim
and Terry of Key West; a daughter, Taffi Fisher-Abt of Sebastian,
and 14 grandchildren. &QL;

COMMENTARY: CAPITAL'S ADULTERY RULES DON'T WORK IN NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOHN TIERNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jerrold Nadler knew where duty lay Saturday when his
colleague, Bob Livingston, resigned from the House of
Representatives after confessing to adultery. Nadler, a Democrat
from Manhattan, promptly rose on the House floor to denounce ``a
developing sexual McCarthyism.''
</P>
<P>
   His horrified reaction was a faithful representation of his
constituents' sentiments _ or at least those of the older male
ones. Nadler was standing up for an island whose economy would be
in shambles if every adulterous male executive had to resign. The
only place with a greater need for disaster relief would be
Hollywood (where Jack Nicholson has been spearheading the
president's defense).
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his counterpart in Washington, the New York adulterer is
not even required to feign shame. The prototypical image of the
Washington alpha male these days is a grim-faced President Clinton
contemplating his shoes while his wife stands awkwardly at his
side. The New York equivalent is a smiling Donald Trump, sans any
of his ex-wives, waving at the cameras as he walks into a party
with a 21-year-old model.
</P>
<P>
   The city's modern male ethos was summed up in a drawing by Tom
Wolfe in the 1970s titled ``The Birds and the Bees.'' It's a Norman
Rockwell kind of scene, a puzzled boy sitting in a duck blind
listening to his father, a square-jawed fellow who looks to be a
corporate titan.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no, son, that's not how it works,'' the father says.
``When you're 45 or 50, you'll get a new wife, a young one, a girl
in her 20s.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens to the old one?'' the son asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, she opens up a needlepoint shop and sells yarn to her
friends and joins a discussion group.''
</P>
<P>
   New York, like Washington and Hollywood, is an adultery capital
because it has so many attractive young women and so many
successful older men. The New York males who win the struggles for
money, power and fame have a sense of entitlement: If you can make
it here, you can trade it for sex here.
</P>
<P>
   They have reacted to the Clinton scandal by arguing that
adultery should be a private matter, which is reasonable if that
means it's not something to be legislated or prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   But there's no use pretending that adultery is not a social
problem, or that the press has been fixated on a ``trivial'' sex
scandal. President Clinton's libido exemplifies what is perhaps the
most profound problem facing any society. The male instinct to
philander has been a perpetual source of misery for women, children
and non-alpha males.
</P>
<P>
   Some groups have avoided hypocrisy by allowing rich older men to
acquire young new wives _ polygamy, the free-market approach _ but
that can lead to unhappy older wives and neglected children. It
also leaves what anthropologists call bachelor herds: lots of
young, poor men without mates, who are prone to working out their
frustrations through violence and crime.
</P>
<P>
   Monogamy, the socialist approach, has never worked either. As
long as men have run societies, they've generally allowed one
another to discreetly break the rules. More recently, men like
Donald Trump and Ronald Perelman have adopted a new form of
marriage, serial polygamy _ many wives, one at a time _ which is
possibly the worst system of all.
</P>
<P>
   To New York's alpha males, Livingston's resignation may seem a
mysterious Washington ritual, as exotic as a samurai warrior
killing himself over an imperceptible grievance. New York men may
think such a thing can't happen here. But I would remind them once
again of Tom Arnold's words.
</P>
<P>
   I quoted Arnold's philosophy in a column in January, trying to
make sense of some local sex scandals in which male philanderers
received New York's version of censure: humiliation by tabloid. I
wondered if the men's punishment was a result of the emerging power
of women in society and the media, and of women's superior skills
at using gossip to enforce moral standards.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after that column went to press, the Drudge Report
broke the news about the president and an intern, a scandal brought
to public attention by two middle-aged women, Linda Tripp and
Lucianne Goldberg. Since then, the president has been impeached,
and the words of other women have apparently stopped Livingston
from becoming speaker of the House.
</P>
<P>
   Before New Yorkers dismiss him as an aberration, they might
remember what Tom Arnold said last year about Frank Gifford. Arnold
was on ``The Late Show With David Letterman,'' and he refused to
join Letterman in chortling over the tabloid revelations of
Gifford's infidelities. Arnold recognized the perils of the new
moral order.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frank took a bullet for a lot of us,'' he said.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As he sat in the House listening to Rep. Robert
Livingston say he would never be speaker, even ``the Hammer''
cried.
</P>
<P>
   Tom DeLay of Texas, the House majority whip, who considers his
aggressive nickname a compliment, had to stop several times and
take a breath to keep from weeping again during a floor speech on
Saturday as he said, ``There is no greater American in my mind, at
least today, than Bob Livingston,'' the Louisianan and the
designated House speaker who abruptly bowed out on Saturday over a
sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of a week in which Iraq was bombed, the president was
impeached and the designated speaker sidelined before he could even
take office, House Republicans were finding their hard-won victory
even more joyless than they had always promised it would be.
</P>
<P>
   All over the Capitol _ in the foyer off the House floor, in
members' private offices and Livingston's office, where members
gathered to offer their sympathy and support _ Republicans were
tearful and overwrought.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tillie Fowler of Florida said she and Livingston both cried
as she hugged him and ``told him he's one of the finest men I
know.'' Rep. Richard Baker of Louisiana, who proclaimed himself
``not a boo-hooer'' said he was upset, too. Rep. James Greenwood of
Pennsylvania became emotional in an interview. ``This is an
incredible day,'' he said, looking down. ``You have tears in your
eyes about the process'' of impeachment, and then along comes
another good reason to cry.
</P>
<P>
   It was not only Livingston's surprise announcement that was
distressing, members said. If any Republican was delighting in the
desired outcome _ the impeachment of President Clinton _ they were
not showing it. No, they felt only sadness for the country, they
said, even if the Democrats doubted their sincerity. There was also
some anxiety about the next Congress, and about the political
future. And certainly plain exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans had begun the week with a sense of unease as
they traveled back to Washington for what they thought would be a
week completely focused on impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Most just seemed to want to do their duty and leave for the
holidays. Even DeLay, who led the impeachment drive and professed
to have no qualms about the vote, said he felt sick last Tuesday,
though it was becoming clear that Republicans did have the votes to
impeach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tragedy,'' he said in his office on Tuesday evening,
and seemed very sorry indeed, though without remorse.
</P>
<P>
   Then, one day before the House was set to debate impeachment,
Clinton announced the bombing of Iraq. As Republicans filed into
Wednesday's caucus meeting to decide if and when to proceed with
impeachment, many were beside themselves. A few seemed too angry to
speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's manipulated our military and his advisers for his own
preservation,'' said Rep. Michael Oxley of Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the meeting room, some had the sense of being trapped in
a horrible, recurring dream where Bill Clinton, once again a few
inches from the edge of a cliff, gets a steadying hand from . . .
Saddam Hussein?
</P>
<P>
   Some members not only suspected the president was trying to buy
time, to figure some way out _ but worried that it might work. ``It
was unanimous that we should worry,'' said Rep. Todd Tiahrt of
Kansas, about whether support for impeachment would erode.
</P>
<P>
   And so, even after the group cooled off and decided, with near
unanimity, to allow Livingston to postpone the impeachment debate,
the majority decided they could wait no more than a day or two.
Rep. George Gekas of Pennsylvania said the options discussed on
Wednesday ranged only from ``full speed ahead to wait till
Monday.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Steve Largent of Oklahoma rose in the meeting to pray,
calming some and apparently annoying others. Rep. Wayne Gilchrest
of Maryland, a Vietnam veteran, said they should wait to show
respect for military families. And Rep. Herbert Bateman of Virginia
suggested that moving too fast could have political consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, members said, they wanted to spare Livingston the
embarrassment of a runaway conference. They wanted to help him
weather his first crisis, so they waited a day. But by then,
Livingston had other problems, and so did they.
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday, Livingston issued a statement, saying, ``During
my 33-year marriage to my wife, Bonnie, I have on occasion strayed
from my marriage.'' The words ``on occasion'' struck fear in some
colleagues. He was using the plural in referring to the affairs,
and after all they had been through with the careful language used
to describe improper behavior, that could not be a good sign.
Still, most members absorbed this new shock pretty quickly. They
wanted to support their friend _ and what is more, felt they had
to.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, after the Monica Lewinsky scandal _ and revelations
about affairs involving several other congressional Republicans,
some conservative members thought Livingston had been arrogant and
plain wrong not to have told them about his infidelities before
they chose him to replace Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   ``It probably would have changed the outcome'' of the leadership
race, said Rep. Zach Wamp of Tennessee. ``Bob should have told
us.''
</P>
<P>
   When the impeachment debate began on Friday, Republicans again
dared to hope that surely the worst was over. But by the time Wamp
told Livingston on Saturday morning that he might no longer have
the votes to be elected speaker, Livingston had already decided not
to stand for the post. Friends described Livingston's wife as
devastated.
</P>
<P>
   And so were House Republicans. After Livingston's announcement,
they gasped. Some buried their heads in their hands. A few followed
him, literally running off the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   Almost unanimously, they drew a distinction between the private
matter of an affair and the public act of perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Some were also spitting mad that he had been booed by some
colleagues across the aisle in the moments just before his
announcement. ``The Democrats were shameless,'' fumed Rep. Peter
Hoekstra of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   In House speeches before the impeachment vote, members on both
sides of the aisle were uncharacteristically humble, speaking of
their own frailty.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming, as member after member suggested, that there are
affairs as yet unrevealed, some of their speeches seemed to have an
element of ``Who's next?'' nervousness.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Peter King of New York, one of handful of moderates who
voted against impeachment, pleaded that the body count was too high
on both sides of the aisle. And those who disagreed with King on
impeachment seemed to find the landscape no less depressing.
</P>
<P>
   While still numb, they impeached the president in the least
surprising development of the day, then moved quickly to line up a
new Speaker, turning to Rep. Dennis Hastert of Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after one final bit of wrangling over whether to elect him
this week or next month, they chose the latter and got out of town
before anything else could happen.

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: THE BRAVE NEW WORLD OF SEX-DRENCHED POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By GAIL COLLINS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When a young radio talk-show host in Georgia interviewed me
about a book I wrote on the history of political gossip, I was
befuddled by his repeated requests that I compare ``Richard Nixon's
sexual indiscretions with Bill Clinton's.''
</P>
<P>
   It took me a while to realize that he thought Watergate had been
about sex. When the anti-impeachment camp said that nothing Clinton
did compared to the evils of Watergate, he concluded it meant that
Nixon had been a much more active adulterer.
</P>
<P>
   People with a shaky sense of history could be forgiven for
presuming that lust is the only instinct that can lead a politician
into trouble, as they watched Rep. Henry Hyde (recently outed for a
midlife ``youthful sexual indiscretion'') lead the drive to impeach
Clinton for lying about his sex life.
</P>
<P>
   When speaker-designate Bob Livingston quit over revelations
about his past infidelities, House members, who have barely been
able to muster enough civility to get through the daily prayer,
joined hands to bemoan what Democrats are now calling ``the
politics of personal destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   They seemed convinced that the business of digging up old
stories about sexual misbehavior was a new phenomenon, but that is
far from true. The election of 1828 was fought over a 35-year-old
affair Andrew Jackson had with the married woman who later became
his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Skip ahead through a century and a half of sporadic scandal
outbursts, and you get to The Detroit News' revelations about a
long-dead 7-year-old romance between Rep. Donald Riegle and a woman
who was not his wife. ``My personal life in the distant past was my
personal life,'' cried Riegle, who had changed both wives and
political parties in the intervening years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, when Sen. Charles Robb was running for re-election in
Virginia, his constituents were treated to a long-running debate
about Robb's indiscretions during Virginia Beach parties he
attended while he was governor. Historians may remember that
campaign as the first in which a politician offered the
now-familiar defense that oral sex does not count.
</P>
<P>
   Voters do not, in general, punish their elected officials for
private misconduct. None of the Republican House members whose
sexual affairs were publicized before last year's election seemed
to suffer at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Robb is still in the Senate. Riegle won a Senate seat shortly
after the tapes of his pillow talk were made public, even though,
as his opponents indignantly pointed out, he was quoted as telling
his girlfriend that he preferred talking to her to attending ``a
lousy subcommittee hearing.''
</P>
<P>
   In terms of public support, Clinton is the most successful
peacetime Democratic president since Grover Cleveland, a man who
was elected despite a national furor over his alleged illegitimate
child. This lack of dismay over what politicians do behind closed
doors (which is not to be confused with a lack of interest) goes
back to the Founding Fathers. Despite the lack of DNA tests,
American voters knew plenty about Thomas Jefferson and Sally
Hemings.
</P>
<P>
   But popular impressions notwithstanding, politicians have
concerns beyond getting re-elected. Livingston was under fire by
religious conservatives in Congress who no longer wanted him to be
speaker, and he apparently did not have the stomach for a long
public debate about his private misbehavior. ``I can't put my wife
and children through this anymore,'' a friend quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Shame and embarrassment have claimed far more American
politicians caught up in sex scandals than voter rage. It is
possible that Bill Clinton will go down in history less for his
impeachment than as the American official who set new standards
when it came to the ability to continue functioning under public
humiliation.
</P>
<P>
   The list of images that evoke a planetwide response, previously
pretty much limited to Coke and Muhammad Ali, now includes the
presidential cigar. Czech reporters questioning President Vaclav
Havel during his recent visit wanted to know how he felt about the
sex scandal. Sudanese protesters held up ``Monica Lewinsky'' signs
after anti-terrorist strikes by American bombers.
</P>
<P>
   The frightening thing about the sexualization of political
discourse is not its effect on public morality but the possibility
that only a new breed of Clintonesque politicians can swim in these
turbid waters.
</P>
<P>
   Our current president can tough out situations that would leave
most human beings quivering in the corner. But the characteristics
that allow him to survive this kind of pounding _ a genius for
compartmentalization, an ability to forgive himself for inflicting
enormous damage on the people around him _ might be the same ones
that got him into this mess in the first place.

EDITORIAL: CENSURE STIRRINGS IN THE SENATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial Monday, Dec. 21:
</P>
<P>
   After the polarizing impeachment proceedings of the House, it is
heartening to see the Senate already taking a more measured, less
partisan approach to Bill Clinton's serious misconduct. An early
and partial sampling of Senate sentiment Sunday suggests there are
the makings of a bipartisan deal that would bring this matter to a
just and speedy resolution by severely censuring Clinton while
allowing him to complete his term. For the first time since
impeachment barreled out of control in the House, there may
actually be some leaders in Congress willing to negotiate an
endgame agreement with the White House.
</P>
<P>
   As the House amply demonstrated, bringing the Clinton case to a
fair denouement is exceedingly difficult in the politically
supercharged atmosphere of Washington. The Senate should have a
better chance of success for several reasons, including the wise
constitutional arithmetic that requires 67 votes to convict Clinton
and evict him from office. With that outcome considered highly
unlikely in the absence of compelling new evidence against Clinton,
alternative solutions will get the serious consideration they never
received in the House. Former Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy
Carter outline a plausible blueprint for censuring Clinton on
Monday's Op-Ed page.
</P>
<P>
   It was fairly music to the ears of a pained nation Sunday to
hear four senators _ Orrin Hatch and Mitch McConnell, both
Republicans, and Christopher Dodd and Patrick Leahy, Democrats _
talk about the Senate's obligations in a judicious, thoughtful way.
In a joint appearance on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' the four men
spoke of the need to place the national interest above party
interests, and none of them, including the usually partisan
McConnell, excluded the possibility of censure.
</P>
<P>
   Translating that constructive spirit into action will require a
number of statesmanlike decisions by Clinton and the Senate. As the
four senators, as well as Ford and Carter, suggest, Clinton must
finally give up the concoction that he did not lie under oath in
his August grand-jury appearance. All settlement possibilities flow
from that confession, and without it Clinton will force the Senate
and the country to endure an extended trial that will not serve the
national interest and will further weaken an already shriveled
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   With it, Clinton can unlock the door to a censure package. As
Sen. Robert Byrd has noted, the Constitution leaves little doubt
that the Senate must open a trial when presented with articles of
impeachment by the House. But there is no requirement that a case
be carried to conviction or acquittal. By a simple majority vote, a
trial can be suspended or ended at any time. As Ford and Carter
properly propose, a censure deal would likely require a pledge from
Kenneth Starr to refrain from prosecuting Clinton once he left the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   While the White House must prepare to defend Clinton in a Senate
trial, it should initiate early, serious discussions with Senate
leaders about the potential shape of a censure deal. Clinton would
do well to select former Sen. George Mitchell to handle this work
and to direct his defense. The Senate, for its part, must move
energetically to engage Clinton's representatives. The
indispensable element in all this is the commodity most lacking in
Washington at this troubled time _ seasoned leadership at both ends
of Pennsylvania Avenue. It is time for Clinton to end both his
yearlong estrangement from the law and his refusal to help settle
the mess created by his recklessness, and for Congress to bring
this case to a close.

<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Kent Graham and Conrad Hamilton work on
opposite sides of the football and sit at opposite ends of the
Giants' locker room. Their careers lie at opposite poles.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday the veteran quarterback and the young cornerback
nudged the Giants a step closer to a playoff berth _ a berth as
improbable as the roles Graham and Hamilton have played in getting
them there.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, who turned 30 on Nov. 1, has emerged as the fiery leader
the Giants' offense has sorely needed. Hamilton, who turned 24 on
Nov. 5, has quietly become one of the most dependable members of an
inconsistent defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've struggled as a team,'' said John Fox, the Giants'
defensive coordinator, ``but Conrad never has been one of the guys
who's struggled. He had to fill some big shoes and all eyes were on
him. But he hung in and stepped up. I've always had strong feelings
about Conrad.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham has been a quarterback in search of a home throughout his
career. He began his college career at Notre Dame and transferred
to Ohio State to get more playing time, though he did not start
until his senior season.
</P>
<P>
   With the Giants, Graham was regarded as a cast-away quarterback
at the beginning of the season. The perception was from the residue
of his original tour of duty with the Giants, which ended with his
release in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Graham went through an emotional wringer in his first tour of
duty with the Giants, who drafted him in the eighth round in 1992.
He played sparingly in 1994 and was released before the 1995
season. Graham was quickly signed by the Detroit Lions but was
inactive for most of the 1995 season. He was granted unconditional
free agency afterward and was signed by the Arizona Cardinals for
1996. That is where he met Coach Jim Fassel and earned the starting
job in 1997 until he injured his ankle _ against the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   ``There weren't a whole lot of people out there that thought I
was anything of a quarterback to be reckoned with,'' Graham said.
``Coach Fassel was really the only guy that I think had the
confidence in me from Day One. I never wanted to leave there.''
</P>
<P>
   A week after leading the Giants to a remarkable upset victory
over the Denver Broncos with a last-gasp pass, Graham came back
with a less dramatic but solid performance Sunday as the Giants
beat the Kansas City Chiefs, 28-7. He threw 33 passes, completed 16
and even caught one for 16 yards. He threw a 32-yard touchdown pass
and ran three times for 17 yards and another touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   When he finally left the game with 6 minutes 30 seconds to play,
fans stood and applauded. Graham said he felt a rush. ``Guys who
were here with me when I first came to New York know how I felt,''
he said. ``They know how important it was for me to come back here
and do well. That's why hearing the fans, seeing them standing, was
so emotional.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton's tenure has not been so dramatic, his three-year
career with the Giants has not been punctuated by sharp ups and
downs or the politics of N.F.L. life. That may soon change.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton's odyssey started during the exhibition season this
summer when Jason Sehorn, the Giants' all-pro cornerback, suffered
a season-ending knee injury. Hamilton became a starter and for the
first six games felt that he was simply house-sitting. Now that the
season is almost over and he has gained experience, Hamilton said
he liked being a starter. In fact, that he cannot envision himself
in any other role.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going into this last game, I know it's my job,'' Hamilton
said. ``But it's not set in stone yet. I guess I've still got to
earn my stripes.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton is a restricted free agent after this season, which
means the Giants have the right of first refusal on any offer he
receives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to come back here as a nickel back,'' he said.
``What kind of man would I be to come back and settle? I don't want
to settle. I see myself differently now. I feel comfortable and
confident of my skills; all I ever asked for is the opportunity to
compete.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox, the defensive coordinator, concedes that he has thought
about the impending traffic jam at cornerback. ``It does cross your
mind,'' he said. ``Jason will come back, he'll have his job back
and we'll have tremendous competition. It'll make us a better
team.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, the Giants' season has come down to mathematics, hopes,
prayers and miracles. Their only hope of reaching the playoffs is
defeating Philadelphia next Sunday and having Arizona and Tampa Bay
lose.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants play in a late game next Sunday, as does Arizona.
Tampa Bay plays in an early game, and the outcome of that one could
make the Giants brace for a dramatic victory and a possible playoff
berth or prepare them for a miserable anticlimax.
</P>
<P>
   Graham does not want the season to end. He's enjoying a
once-in-a-lifetime run. ``I just want the season to keep going,''
he said, ``and we have a shot to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Opportunity knocks, miracles happen, careers are resurrected.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Hamilton. Ask Graham. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ As Troy Masters sat in a hospital exam room the other
day _ poked, pricked and interrogated by doctors on the most
intimate details of his life _ his eyes reddened and his voice
broke as researchers asked if he was sure of what he was doing.
</P>
<P>
   Masters is an affable 37-year-old with a sly sense of humor and
a soft Tennessee drawl. He is also gay, HIV-negative and sexually
active, a profile that makes him a fitting candidate for the
world's first full-scale test of a vaccine to prevent AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Masters became one of the first volunteers in New
York City to qualify for the experiment, which is to be conducted
by a California company in 50 clinics across the nation, including
three in Manhattan. The vaccine trial will involve 5,000 volunteers
in the United States and 2,500 in Thailand. Masters' first shot is
scheduled for Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's anxiety-producing and exciting at the same time, but I'm
going to have to live with this crisis one way or the other,'' he
told doctors from the New York University School of Medicine, which
runs one clinic at Bellevue Hospital Center. ``I don't feel scared
away from the study, if that's what you mean. I want to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Masters has agreed to be inoculated seven times over the next
three years with a genetically engineered vaccine, known as
Aidsvax, to find out whether it works. Researchers say he cannot
contract HIV from the vaccine because it contains a fragment that
is not capable of reproducing. But he may appear to be HIV-positive
on a standard blood test because of the presence of vaccine-induced
antibodies.
</P>
<P>
   In return, Masters gets only a $3 Metrocard and $10 for each
visit to the AIDS Clinical Trials Unit at Bellevue. He may also get
a sore arm, headaches, a rash, a fever and other side effects that
are not yet known. And if he is discriminated against because of a
false-positive test result, and wants to seek legal redress, he
will have to pay for a lawyer himself.
</P>
<P>
   Masters, publisher of a biweekly newspaper called Lesbian &AMP; Gay
New York, took all this in on a recent morning. Then, with a
flourish, he signed the consent forms to be screened for the study
and to be tested again for the human immunodeficiency virus, the
final hurdle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The virus needs a vaccine,'' he said. ``If there is a front of
activism that needs to be developed, that's it. To that end, I'm
giving my behavior over to science. This is like signing for
permission to end the AIDS crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the vaccine to be injected into Masters has any promise
is a matter of heated debate. Some scientists and advocates for
people with AIDS are skeptical, and fear that the experiment will
drain the pool of people willing to participate in future trials of
AIDS vaccines. They also worry that volunteers will get a false
sense of security about the vaccine, which could expose them to
infection.
</P>
<P>
   But the vaccine, produced by Vaxgen Inc. of San Francisco, has
drawn attention to an area of AIDS research that until recently has
been overshadowed by the success of another treatment, drug
cocktails that include protease inhibitors.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, HIV vaccines have emerged as a major
priority of AIDS research efforts. The federal government spends
$200 million annually in search of a vaccine, and devotes more
money to vaccine research every year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is now the favored direction of endeavor,'' said Dr.
Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of vaccine candidates, including a federally supported
one involving a weakened canary pox virus, are at various stages of
development. But none are as far along as the Vaxgen vaccine. In
June, the Food and Drug Administration authorized full-scale
testing, which is bankrolled by Vaxgen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up until this vaccine was moved forward, no vaccine was tested
for efficacy anywhere else in the world,'' said Dr. Seth Berkley,
president of the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative, a nonprofit
group based in Manhattan. ``We're now moving into trials, which is
what we have to do. It's the only way to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   The major question the new tests aim to answer is how effective
the experimental vaccine will be among people who are exposed to
HIV because of high-risk sexual practices in the United States and
intravenous-drug use in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, Vaxgen hopes to recruit 600 healthy,
uninfected volunteers. Nationwide, the 5,000 participants will
include gay men as well as women who engage in risky heterosexual
behavior. A randomly selected two-thirds will receive the vaccine
and the rest will receive a placebo.
</P>
<P>
   The initial recruitment focuses on gay men, but the plan is to
branch out and aggressively recruit women. Counselors have
contacted half a dozen community groups concerned with women's
health, and are setting up meetings with their directors.
</P>
<P>
   However, the study's administrative coordinator at the Bellevue
clinic, Robert Hagerty, acknowledges that recruitment is difficult.
``We haven't had huge numbers of people calling,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the main obstacles will be to convince people that the
vaccine is safe. ``Every person who comes in raises that fear,''
Hagerty said. ``We answer their questions directly and honestly.
You can't get HIV from this vaccine.'' Previous studies of the
vaccine, on animals and humans, have demonstrated its safety,
researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Bellevue clinic has seen 11 men who were determined
to be eligible for the study. Two have received vaccinations.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving at the clinic for his first visit last week, Masters
said he had put himself forward after losing nearly all of his
friends in the last two decades.
</P>
<P>
   For hours, Masters answered a blizzard of questions. Would his
participation in the study cause him subconsciously to have
unprotected sex? Masters shook his head. What situations might
tempt him to do so? How many sexual partners has he had in the last
six months? Did he know that he might not be able to take part in
future HIV vaccine trials? Did he know that he might not be able to
serve in the military? ``Oh, as if I could,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Masters sees himself as a crusader. ``People are terrified of
vaccines,'' he said. ``The word that keeps coming up is, `You're
going to let yourself be a guinea pig.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I know we can create a culture where going to vaccine trials
is something that people want to do. It's OK for people to do and
it's safe. It's the right thing we should be doing if we are
HIV-negative.''

SHUSTER PROBE MAY HAVE FIZZLED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Boston federal probe into US Representative Bud
Shuster, the powerful transportation committee chairman from
Pennsylvania, has all but ground to a halt with little prospect
that it will produce any charges, individuals familiar with the
probe said.
</P>
<P>
   Those sources said the investigation could be revived if
Shuster's former top aide and close friend, Ann Eppard, who has
been charged in the investigation, were to decide to cooperate with
investigators and offer new evidence. But short of that or the
cooperation of another key witness, sources say, the probe is dead.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, there have been indications that the Shuster
case had become increasingly inactive. For example, the lead
prosecutor in the investigation, Alexandra Leake, resigned
recently, a move that confirmed for many who know her work that the
investigation is all but over.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the grand jury probing the case apparently has not
subpoenaed documents or witnesses since early in the year.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the US House Committee on Standards of Official
Conduct, which had suspended its inquiry into Shuster last June at
the request of the Justice Department, announced early this month
that it was resuming its own probe. The department had in June
expressed concern that the committee's work would ``pose certainly
unavoidable risks to the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Shuster's lawyer, Boston attorney Stephen R. Delinsky, last week
said he sees no evidence that the investigation is active.
</P>
<P>
   ``To my knowledge there's no ongoing investigation of
congressman Shuster by the US Attorney's Office,'' Delinsky said.
``I'm aware of the allegations that the US Attorney's Office looked
into, but it is my understanding that none of those allegations
concerned any impropriety by Congressman Shuster.''
</P>
<P>
   The US Attorney's Office in Boston said its policy is not to
comment on investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Eppard, who served until 1994 as Shuster's top aide and
political adviser, was indicted by a Boston federal grand jury last
spring on charges that she received $230,000 in illegal payments
from a Washington lobbyist and his client, including Boston
businessman Richard Goldberg. She and the lobbyist, Vernon Clark,
are awaiting trial this winter.
</P>
<P>
   The indication that Shuster has survived the investigation
unscathed is significant in Washington, where the Republican
lawmaker wields considerable power through his committee,
particularly with his ability to control the flow of funds for
local transportation projects.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the congressman has been a key player in helping
Massachusetts obtain the funding for the Big Dig. The investigation
into his activities had at times raised serious concerns among
state transportation officials over the future funding of the
project.
</P>
<P>
   According to the case against Eppard, Goldberg allegedly paid
her $10,000 in 1990 to protect his Park 'N Fly lot near Logan
Airport during construction of the Ted Williams Tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   The Shuster probe grew out of the federal investigation into
former Massachusetts House Speaker Charles Flaherty in the early
1990s. That inquiry focused in part on Flaherty's relationship with
Goldberg, but no charges were ever filed. In a plea agreement, the
former speaker pled guilty to an unrelated tax fraud felony charge
in 1996 and resigned.
</P>
<P>
   The Shuster investigation probed the complex professional and
personal relationship between the congressman and Eppard, who is
now a Washington lobbyist for transportation interests.
</P>
<P>
   Eppard resigned her congressional post in 1994 to lobby
Congress, but continued to be a political adviser and fund-raiser
for the veteran congressman as well as close personal friend. He
often stays at her Virginia home in an arrangement that was part of
the federal investigation, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The federal probe also looked at evidence that Shuster and
Eppard may have used tens of thousands of dollars in campaign funds
for personal use. Eppard is charged with embezzling $27,000 from
the campaign committee.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Goldberg, the Shuster probe focused on another Boston
businessman, Nicholas Contos, who had, sources said, loaned
Eppard's son, Ralph, money to start a car dealership. That loan and
Goldberg's payments were made at a time they were asking Eppard and
Shuster to intervene on their behalf in disputes with state
transportation officials.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said Goldberg's payment was given under the guise of a
consulting fee but the funds ended up in a bank account the younger
Eppard held with his mother, who reportedly signed the checks for
the accounts. Just last week, Goldberg's bid for a land swap with
the state to save his business was completed.
</P>
<P>
   Contos, owner of No Name Restaurant, has been granted immunity
by the US Attorney's Office in Boston and will testify at Eppard's
trial about his loan to the younger Eppard to buy a car dealership
in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   According to sources, Contos advanced the loan in late 1991 or
early 1992 at the urging of Clark, his Washington lobbyist and a
close friend of Ann Eppard. Just months earlier, Contos had settled
with state and federal officials in a longstanding dispute he had
over the Big Dig's taking of his land in South Boston.

 NEW YORK: are HIV-negative.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   An experimental AIDS vaccine may be a particularly tough sell to
some of the hardest-hit populations, including young gay men and
blacks. Health officials have long contended with the belief,
popular among some blacks, that HIV is a man-made virus and that
acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a genocidal plot.
</P>
<P>
   In an exam room at Bellevue the other day, Masters stared at a
needle as it was pressed slowly into a vein to draw blood for an
HIV test.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the room was Michael Marmor, one of the principal
investigators for the NYU trial. Marmor, an epidemiologist, said
the Vaxgen trial is similar to Jonas Salk's polio vaccine trials.
He pointed out that the Salk vaccine was not 100 percent effective,
but it still saved many people before a better vaccine came along.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exactly at the same stage of testing, the last stage,
when they do efficacy and evaluate what percentage of infections
are prevented,'' said Marmor, who also conducted some of the
earliest epidemiological work on Kaposi's sarcoma, an AIDS-related
cancer, in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   The Vaxgen vaccine is an updated version of one that an advisory
panel of experts rejected four years ago for federally financed
large-scale testing in the United States. The experts had expressed
doubts about its effectiveness, questioning its benefit to a
significant proportion of recipients.
</P>
<P>
   The original vaccine was developed from only one strain of HIV,
the one most commonly found in the United States. The new version
will provide broader coverage to patients because it is derived
from two strains of HIV that are prevalent in the nation, according
to Dr. Donald P. Francis, a virologist who is leading the
international vaccine research effort and is president of Vaxgen.
</P>
<P>
   But some scientists doubt the vaccine's efficacy, saying earlier
tests show that it boosted only one part of the immune system
involving antibodies, and consequently is unlikely to protect large
numbers of recipients. Antibodies are proteins formed to destroy
invading germs in the blood.
</P>
<P>
   Many scientists believe that an effective HIV vaccine will need
to boost another element of the immune system, killer T-cells that
destroy virus-infected cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we will learn anything that we don't already
know,'' said John Moore, a staff investigator at the Aaron Diamond
AIDS Research Center in Manhattan. ``I think it's a great shame
they are testing in New York. It's a travesty they are doing it
anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   More than half of the clinics that will participate have been
selected. But not every clinic that has been approached is rushing
to take part. In Houston, one community research organization
turned Vaxgen down a few months ago. An ethics board at the Houston
Clinical Research Network decided that participating in the study
would prevent its patients from enrolling in more promising vaccine
studies.
</P>
<P>
   Masters shrugs off the naysayers. Sitting in the exam room, he
said the Vaxgen experiment is a beginning and a big deal. He also
senses a circle closing for him. He is memorializing the pain that
the epidemic has caused him, the dozens of friends who have died of
AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a way of trying to shut the door on this whole thing,''
he said. ``It is empowering.''

EDITORIAL: AFTER THE ATTACK ON IRAQ 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial Monday, Dec. 21:
</P>
<P>
   Initial Pentagon assessments of the four-day air campaign
against Iraq suggest that Saddam Hussein suffered heavy but not
irretrievable losses. It may take Iraq as long as a year to restore
its ability to deliver biological and chemical weapons against
potential targets in the Middle East. If that estimate holds up,
the time should be used to reinforce diplomatic support for
sanctions and future military action, if needed. It should also be
used, if possible, to reconstitute an effective program of
inspections and monitoring of weapons facilities inside Iraq.
Baghdad's declaration that United Nations inspections are now ended
forever may not be the last word on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Britain should maintain sufficient forces
in the area to attack Iraq again if it threatens its neighbors,
expands its arsenal of mass destruction weapons or rebuilds the
missiles used to carry them. But new air strikes should not be
launched absent clear justification and careful diplomatic
preparation. As President Clinton noted Saturday, American strategy
is built around maintaining U.N. Security Council support for
effective economic sanctions to retard Iraqi rebuilding efforts.
That will require demonstrating to countries like Russia and China,
which protested the latest air strikes, that America continues to
rely chiefly on diplomatic and economic pressures.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition from Arab countries was relatively subdued. But that
response should not be taken for granted. Saddam has largely
isolated himself in the Arab world through his provocative
behavior. But Washington cannot afford to be reckless in the use of
military power or indifferent to the loss of Arab lives. The
Clinton administration must press Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin
Netanyahu, to honor his commitments to make additional West Bank
withdrawals and take other steps toward completing a negotiated
peace with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The air strikes were aimed not just at Iraqi weapons programs
but also at weakening Saddam's rule. Allied missiles and aircraft
attacked presidential palaces, the headquarters of the ruling Baath
Party and the barracks of elite security forces like the Republican
Guard. These were legitimate targets since they have all been
involved in Iraqi attempts to conceal biological and chemical
weapons or missile production. But Washington should not delude
itself into thinking that such attacks will pave the way for a
revolt that topples Saddam. His rule is too well entrenched and
opposition forces are too weak and divided for that to be a
realistic possibility anytime soon. Diplomatic and economic
pressure, backed by the continuing threat of American military
force, is the most effective way to manage the Iraqi weapons
threat.

ANTONIO ORDONEZ, 66, MATADOR IN HEMINGWAY BOOK 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain _ Antonio Ordonez, a leading bullfighter in the
1950s and the last survivor of the dueling matadors chronicled by
Ernest Hemingway in ``The Dangerous Summer,'' died on Saturday in a
Seville hospital. He was 66.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, the Spanish news media reported.
</P>
<P>
   Ordonez, who was widely considered the top bullfighter of his
day for his impeccable and daring capework, was the son of another
famous matador, Cayetano Ordonez, whose exploits Hemingway depicted
in his 1926 novel ``The Sun Also Rises.''
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Ordonez, who also became a close friend of Orson Welles,
married Carmen Dominguin, the sister of his chief rival, Luis
Miguel Dominguin, in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   Ordonez and Dominguin traveled together from one Spanish ring to
the next in the summer of 1959, with Hemingway in tow, fighting
bulls before rapt audiences. Hemingway's book seemed to favor
Ordonez over Dominguin, who died in 1996 at age 69.
</P>
<P>
   ``Antonio's first bull came out and he took him with the cape as
though he were inventing bullfighting and it was going to be
absolutely perfect from the start,'' Hemingway wrote about a fight
in the southern city of Malaga in 1959. ``It was how he fought all
summer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That day in Malaga, he surpassed himself again and he made
poetry of movement with the hunting, seeking, pressing mass of the
bull.''
</P>
<P>
   Ordonez's style also captivated Welles, and their friendship was
so close that after Welles' death in 1985, his ashes were scattered
in 1987 at Ordonez's ranch in Ronda.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Ordonez was born in Ronda, a southern town with deep
bullfighting roots. His family moved to Seville when he was 6. He
began fighting bulls in 1948. In 1951, he took the ``alternativa,''
the test in the bull ring to become a full-fledged matador, who
would face the oldest, largest and fiercest bulls.
</P>
<P>
   By his retirement in 1971, he had appeared in more than 1,000
bullfights, killing more than 2,000 bulls. He was gored in the ring
at least eight times during the 1950s. That was his peak decade,
although his fame and deft technique kept him as a top-billed
fighter through the first half of the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Ordonez also fought in Peru, Colombia, Venezuela and Mexico, but
perhaps the warmest praise came from his fellow Spaniards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Antonio Ordonez is a natural bullfighter,'' wrote Jose Maria
de Cossio in his 1967 edition of ``The Bulls, a Technical and
Historical Treatment,'' considered the authoritative encyclopedia
on bullfighting. ``Nothing violent, forced or superfluous in his
style. He practices bullfighting with a perfection, a charm or
severity _ his art is at once joyful and deep _ that touches on the
miraculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Ordonez's marriage to Carmen Dominguin expanded their
bullfighting dynasty. They had two daughters, Carmen and Belen,
each of whom married a bullfighter, and who survive him.
</P>
<P>
   Ordonez's grandson, Francisco Rivera Ordonez, is currently one
of the leading matadors in Spain.
</P>
<P>
   After the death of his first wife, Ordonez in 1983 married Pilar
Lezcano, a civil servant, who also survives him.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, he briefly toyed with the idea of a comeback to the
ring but did not go beyond some initial training sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Even before his retirement, Ordonez laid the groundwork to stay
deeply involved in bullfighting. He owned a home in Seville next to
that city's bull ring. He also bred fighting bulls on his ranch and
later become the owner and promoter of the ring in Ronda, where his
ashes were to be scattered on Monday.

PAUL GITLIN, 83, PIONEERING LITERARY AGENT TO STARS
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Paul Gitlin, a lawyer and literary agent who brokered
multimillion-dollar deals for authors in the early 1970s, died Dec.
16. He was 83.
</P>
<P>
   Gitlin came to prominence by negotiating innovative deals in the
1960s and early 1970s, when literary auctions were a relatively new
phenomenon and authors' lawyers and agents were becoming stars in
their own right.
</P>
<P>
   Gruff and charming, Gitlin was credited by novelist Irving
Wallace with winning the author a $2.3 million, four-book contract
in 1972. But his role in reshaping the economics of the book
industry began at least as early as 1960, when he designed the
first combined hardcover-paperback deal by selling Pocket Books
``The Carpetbaggers,'' by Harold Robbins.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Wallace and Robbins, Gitlin's clients included
Bill Bradley, Sidney Sheldon, Barbara Taylor Bradford, Cornelius
Ryan and William Saroyan. He also represented the estates of such
prominent American authors as Thomas Wolfe, Upton Sinclair,
Sinclair Lewis, Ayn Rand and Raymond Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   Born June 17, 1915, in Brooklyn, Gitlin was a specialist in
copyright law. In 1938, in his last year at Harvard Law School, he
was the first winner of the ASCAP Nathan Burkan Memorial award for
his essay on how copyright law should apply to radio broadcasts. He
was a past president of the Copyright Society of the U.S.A. and a
partner in the publishing law firm of Ernst, Cane, Berner &AMP; Gitlin,
which represented, among other clients, the novelist Mario Puzo. He
also helped found the Walter Derenberg Copyright Library at the New
York University Law School.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his son, Jonathan, of Manhattan, and a sister,
Claire Gnessin, of Syosset, N.Y.

ENRIQUE MARTINEZ, 72, BALLET DANCER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Ga., Colo., Wis., Mich.)  (lb) 
 By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Enrique Martinez, a ballet dancer and rehearsal
director at American Ballet Theater who staged the classics for
ballet troupes in North and South America and Europe, died on Nov.
17 at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan. He was 72
and lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was hepatitis, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez was born in Havana, where he received his ballet
training. His teachers included Alicia Alonso and Igor Schwezoff.
He was offered a contract with Ballet Theater after Lucia Chase,
director of the troupe, saw him performing with a Cuban company. He
joined the New York troupe in 1947 and remained with it until 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez started as a corps dancer and moved up to soloist
before becoming a ballet master, ballet director and assistant
director of Ballet Theater. He was known for a serenity that did
not fail him even when tested by the most volatile of ballet stars.
In 1968, Martinez created a sunny, good-natured production of
``Coppelia'' for Ballet Theater and became associated with that
ballet.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez choreographed and staged the classics for companies
including the National Ballet of Cuba; the Duesseldorf Ballet;
troupes associated with La Scala in Milan, Italy, and the opera
houses of Rome and Helsinki, Finland; the Milwaukee Ballet; and
companies in Denver, Atlanta, Detroit and Norfolk, Va.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1980s and early '90s he directed and helped organize
ballet companies in Mexico; Caracas, Venezuela; and Rio de Janeiro,
Brazil. His most recent productions, created in the late 1990s,
were stagings of ``Coppelia'' for the Atlanta Ballet and companies
in Canada and France.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by two brothers, Jose and Rodolfo, and a sister,
Teresa, all of Virginia Beach, Va.

GAY SYNAGOGUE ROBUST AT 25 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In 1973, Jacob Gubbay, a Jew from India, placed a
tiny classified advertisement in The Village Voice that read ``Gay
Synagogue: Friday Night Service.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten people turned up at the Church of the Holy Apostles at Ninth
Avenue and West 28th Street. A year later, Gubbay moved to
Australia, but what he left behind _ the foundation of Congregation
Beth Simchat Torah, the first and still the only synagogue for gay
people in New York _ has expanded and thrived against a backdrop of
social change.
</P>
<P>
   As it celebrates its 25th anniversary this year, the
congregation has grown so large that for Friday evening services _
the most heavily attended of the week _ it has had to move out of
its new quarters nearby and back to its original site at the
church. Last week, in a joyous ceremony, members carried Torahs
into the church to celebrate their return to a former home.
</P>
<P>
   The move is not intended to be permanent. The congregation's
leadership is beginning discussions this month on a capital
campaign so it can buy or build its own synagogue.
</P>
<P>
   The congregation has about 800 dues-paying members and hundreds
more who regularly attend services, classes and concerts. For the
High Holidays, it moves to the Javits Convention Center to
accommodate the 3,000 or more people who come to pray.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is interesting to think of what the world was like 25 years
ago,'' said the congregation's rabbi, Sharon Kleinbaum, who was
hired in 1992 after 19 years of lay leadership. ``There were no gay
rights organizations, no lesbian or gay community services, no Gay
Men's Health Crisis. AIDS was not recognized until 1981. Not one
national Jewish organization supported gay rights nor did any
synagogue welcome gay people on an official basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a time when religion was often the place where people were
most deeply rejected, a small group came together with the radical
idea that it was possible to live both openly gay and proudly
Jewish,'' she continued. ``There was no model for that and what
those people did was as heroic as immigrants leaving the old
country.''
</P>
<P>
   One sign of mainstream Jewry's increasing acceptance of the
synagogue came this year when the Jewish Continuity Foundation of
the UJA-Federation of New York gave it a four-year, $168,000 grant
to expand its educational efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The first year's funds were used to establish a Lehrhaus (House
of Learning), which has 18 faculty members and offers courses for
adults in topics from Talmud and Hebrew to ``Biblical Perspectives
on Coming Out.'' A children's program is planned for next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the big changes since 1973,'' Kleinbaum said.
``No one in the original group could have imagined that we would be
exploring the question of Sunday school, but there is a baby boom
going on now among gays and lesbians. People are giving birth to
children, they are adopting or they have children from previous
heterosexual relationships.'' Kleinbaum herself is bringing up two
daughters with her partner.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the synagogue's growing stature, its leaders have
steadfastly resisted applying for formal affiliation with any of
the branches of Judaism, preferring to attract worshippers with
Reform, Reconstructionist, Conservative and even Orthodox
backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   The response to the synagogue within Judaism falls along
predictable lines _ the Orthodox branch rejects it outright, the
Conservative accepts gay worshippers but not gay rabbis, and the
Reform and Reconstructionist offer unqualified approval.
</P>
<P>
   Though many gay people attend mainstream synagogues, members of
Congregation Beth Simchat Torah say they could not duplicate in
other congregations the bonds they have with their fellow
worshippers and their rabbi.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, the case of Mark Janover, whose partner,
Clinton Wilding Smith, bought him a membership before dying of AIDS
three years ago. Janover found Kleinbaum to be a source of
steadfast support.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was at my house the night he died, and the next morning
showed up to get things set up and determined what I wanted to
do,'' he said. ``She called my father and my aunt and told my
sisters to come to Friday services with me to say Kaddish,'' the
Jewish mourning prayer, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In his loss, Janover said, his connections deepened. ``There are
not a lot of other places to get validation as an AIDS widow,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks after Smith died, Kleinbaum gave Janover an
assignment: ``Somebody's partner just died, and she wanted me to
give him comfort,'' he recalled. ``I said, `Rabbi, my Clinton is
barely cold,' to which she responded: `Mark, you know a week's
worth more about grief. You could help him and lead the way.'''
</P>
<P>
   Now Janover, who has AIDS himself, leads a committee of 75
people who visit the sick. When he was hospitalized with dementia,
he said: ``I would call people at 3 a.m. and they came. I wouldn't
be alive today if not for the love and support of that community.''
</P>
<P>
   Rita Fisher, who was stunned when her son Jay announced 14 years
ago that he was gay, found herself marching up the aisle for a
double ceremony in 1993: renewal of her vows with her husband,
Alex, who has since died, and a commitment ceremony for her son and
his partner, Michael Lehrman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever dreamed, in my wildest dreams, that I would walk my
child down that aisle,'' she said. Now she is a maternal pillar of
the community, commonly known as Mamacita Rita.

GIANTS' ELLSWORTH TRYING TO INTERCEPT A STARTING JOB
</HEADLINE>
  (ms)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>

</P>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD _ On the field, Percy Ellsworth spent much of
Sunday with his teammates celebrating around him, high-fiving and
hugging after his two interceptions and nearly another one. And in
the locker room afterward, he was the center of attention, too. But
for every happy comment from the third-year safety, there seemed to
be a bit of frustration seeping through.
</P>
<P>
   It took only until the third play of the game for Ellsworth to
find his way onto the field, and even less time to find his way to
the ball and the end zone. But still, sitting on the bench for even
one play has made Ellsworth wonder about his future in New York.
Another solid performance in the Giants' 28-7 victory over the
Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday only reinforced the thoughts that have
plagued him, that he believes he must get his chance, whether it is
here or somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the Giants and I'd love to do it here,'' Ellsworth
said. ``But I refuse, if I can help it, to sit on the bench another
year. I just feel like, once I start a year, maybe if I mess up,
then I can accept, `Percy, you're not a starter in the NFL.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Ellsworth may not be able to do a lot about it, since he will be
only a restricted free agent at the end of the season, meaning the
Giants will have the right to match any offer another team makes
for his services.
</P>
<P>
   With the Giants, the 24-year-old Ellsworth finds himself wedged
into the nickel packages, playing behind Tito Wooten at free safety
and Sam Garnes at strong safety. Injuries have put Ellsworth on the
field often this season, though, and he has responded with a
career-best five interceptions. His two Sunday came with Wooten
spending much of the game on the sideline with a hamstring injury.
</P>
<P>
   In three seasons of part-time duty, Ellsworth has 12
interceptions, while Wooten, who has played erratically after
signing a four-year, $2.9 million contract in the off season, has
seven interceptions in his five seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Wooten's struggles on the field this year may represent
Ellsworth's best opportunity to start. The Giants could release
Wooten and leave Ellsworth and rookie Shaun Williams competing for
the free-safety job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that next year I'm starting for somebody,'' Ellsworth
said. ``Somebody's going to think I'm not just a part-time player.
This year I think I've shown people that when I'm given the
minutes, I just produce. I think I've done it for three years now.
Hopefully, next year somebody will allow me to start.''
</P>
<P>
   On the third play from scrimmage Sunday, Ellsworth picked off an
Elvis Grbac pass at the Chiefs' 43-yard line and raced untouched up
the left sideline to put the Giants in front by 7-0 just 1 minute
14 seconds into the game. The ball tipped off the fingers of
receiver Derrick Alexander before Ellsworth turned it into his
second touchdown by interception this season.
</P>
<P>
   Ellsworth added a second interception in the third quarter,
although replays showed that he was out of bounds when he came down
with it. After initially claiming, ``I was in, I was in,''
Ellsworth said, ``I got a gift.''
</P>
<P>
   He grabbed another Grbac pass in the fourth quarter, but was
ruled out of bounds. As he argued his case on that one, he said,
the official told him, ``Not this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellsworth has shown a knack for finding his way to the ball in
his career, something that even he is at a loss to explain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to give a great speech and say it's this or that,''
he said. ``But it's just something I've been blessed with my whole
career. I've been doing it since high school, even in little
league. I see what happens before it happens. I can just anticipate
what's going to happen and I've been able to get interceptions.''
</P>
<P>
   The defensive coordinator, John Fox, said: ``Every time we've
called on Percy, he's done an excellent job. No question, there is
an instinctive part to that position. Whether it's anticipation,
film studies, or just the ability to judge the ball, he does an
exceptional job.''
</P>
<P>
   And he believes he will do it in a starting role next season,
somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've thought that from Day One, when I came in as a rookie
free agent and told everybody I wanted to be a starter and they
thought I was crazy,'' Ellsworth said. ``But my first game I got an
interception off of Warren Moon. It got called back, but I make
plays.'' &QL;

   Interpublic Group Announces 3 Deals
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition spree by the Interpublic Group of Companies in
New York is continuing with the purchases of an agency, an agency
office and a corporate communications company.
</P>
<P>
   The agency being acquired is Austin Kelley Advertising in
Atlanta, which has estimated billings of $85 million from clients
like the Georgia Lottery and the Mercedes-Benz Credit Corp. Austin
Kelley will maintain a separate identity, reporting to the
McCann-Erickson World Group unit of Interpublic.
</P>
<P>
   Geoffrey Nixon, 52, president and chief executive at Austin
Kelley, will stay on in those posts along with the rest of the
management team.
</P>
<P>
   The other two acquisitions involved Carmichael Lynch in
Minneapolis, which Interpublic bought in February. In one deal,
Carmichael Lynch acquired the Minneapolis office of
Valentine-McCormick-Ligibel, an agency based in Kansas City, Kan.
Craig Ligibel, 50, Scott McCormick, 52, and John Valentine, 47, the
partners who shared responsibility for the Minneapolis office, will
serve as consultants for three years.
</P>
<P>
   The office and its 38 employees, handling accounts with billings
estimated at $38 million to $40 million, will be merged into
Carmichael Lynch. That adds Carmichael Lynch to the agency roster
of Northwest Airlines as it assumes assignments the office had
handled in areas like domestic advertising and projects.
</P>
<P>
   And Carmichael Lynch Spong, the public relations division of
Carmichael Lynch, acquired another Minneapolis-based agency,
McGrath Buckley Consulting Group.
</P>
<P>
   Carmichael Lynch Spong will form a division, McGrath Buckley
Group, to specialize in services like investor relations and
employee communications. Douglas Spong, 39, managing partner of
Carmichael Lynch Spong, will head the division in that role. Dennis
B. McGrath, 61, and Betsy Buckley, 51, principals at McGrath
Buckley Consulting, will become senior partners.
</P>
<P>
   2 Big Media Accounts Placed in Review
</P>
<P>
   Two large media accounts have been placed in review. One is for
the Sprint Corp., with billings estimated at $200 million to $250
million, while the other is for Glaxo Wellcome Inc., with billings
estimated at $150 million.
</P>
<P>
   At Sprint, Mark Bonavia, a spokesman in Westwood, Kan.,
confirmed reports of the review in Advertising Age and Adweek. Most
of the media duties for Sprint have been handled by J. Walter
Thompson USA in New York, part of the J. Walter Thompson Company
unit of WPP Group PLC.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson has been invited to take part in the review, Bonavia
said, along with other agencies that he declined to identify. A
decision is expected by mid-February.
</P>
<P>
   At Glaxo Wellcome, the media portion of its account had been
divided into buying and planning segments. Media buying had been
handled for 18 months by the Media Edge in New York. The
media-planning duties had been divided among four agencies
including Media Edge.
</P>
<P>
   Media Edge, owned by Young &AMP; Rubicam Inc., was asked to
participate in the review, said Ramona DuBose, a spokeswoman for
Glaxo Wellcome in Research Triangle Park, N.C., along with the
other three planning agencies: the Mediacom unit of Grey; Rockett
Burkhead Lewis &AMP; Winslow in Raleigh, N.C., and Wilson Media in New
York. Agencies not on the Glaxo Wellcome roster have also been
invited to compete, Ms. DuBose said. A decision is expected at the
end of March.
</P>
<P>
   Grey Advertising And Lexmark Split Up
</P>
<P>
   Grey Advertising in New York and Lexmark International, the
maker and marketer of laser and ink jet printers, are mutually
parting ways after three and a half years, citing creative
differences. As a result, the company's corporate and product
advertising account has been placed in review.
</P>
<P>
   Lexmark has drawn up a list of agencies to take part in the
review, said Roger Rydell, a spokesman for Lexmark in Lexington,
Ky., but he declined to identify them. The list will be narrowed
next month to two or three agencies, he added, with a decision
expected by March. Rydell estimated the billings at more than $20
million; spending this year was estimated at $9 million.
</P>
<P>
   Micron Spot Goes To Internet First
</P>
<P>
   Micron Electronics Inc. in Nampa, Idaho, is introducing a
commercial that is to appear first on the Internet and then on
television. The spot, created by Bam in Austin, Texas, will feature
Jeri Ryan, who plays the character Seven-of-Nine on the series
``Star Trek Voyager.''
</P>
<P>
   The spot, part of a campaign carrying the theme ``New rules, new
tools,'' is to be introduced Dec. 28 on the Micron Web site
(www.micronpc.com), then run the next day on TV during the coverage
of the Micron PC Bowl college football game.
</P>
<P>
   Accounts
</P>
<P>
   Midas Inc., Chicago, to Carat New York, part of the Carat North
America unit of Aegis Group PLC, to handle the media buying portion
of its account, which had been handled by TN Media, New York, a
unit of True North Communications. Billings were estimated at $55
million to $60 million. The creative and strategic duties were
assigned last week to Euro RSCG Tatham, Chicago, part of Havas
Advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Home Shark Inc., San Francisco, to Citron Haligman Bedecarre,
San Francisco, as the first agency to handle national advertising
for the Internet-based mortgage broker. Billings were estimated at
$10 million to $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   Cox Communications, Atlanta, a division of Cox Enterprises, to
BBDO South, Atlanta, a unit of Omnicom Group, to handle its image
and branding account, which had most recently been handled by
Bigelow &AMP; Eigel, Atlanta. Billings were estimated at $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Entercitement LLC, Mooresville, Ind., to Young &AMP; Laramore,
Indianapolis, as the first agency to handle creative advertising
for the theme park. Billings were estimated at $3 million.
Echopoint Media, Indianapolis, a subsidiary of Young &AMP; Laramore,
will handle media services.

DECLINING STANDARDS ARE A CALLING FOR A BOLD SUNY TRUSTEE
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By KAREN W. ARENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Candace de Russy taught a course called ``America and
Historical Decline'' a few years ago at the New School for Social
Research, her favorite author was the Spanish philosopher Jose
Ortega y Gasset. She was taken with his lament over the decline of
European civilization, the decline of standards and the lack of
leadership by the passive elite.
</P>
<P>
   She, too, is preoccupied with the decline of standards, but she
is anything but passive. She was an architect of the core
curriculum that the State University of New York adopted last week.
And as a SUNY trustee, she has become one of the most outspoken and
powerful voices nationally in reshaping higher education.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is willing to walk through fire and take hectoring and
ridicule that most people don't have the stomach for,'' said Thomas
W. Carroll, president of Change New York, a conservative advocacy
group. ``I really can't think of any comparable person around the
country, and I've looked.''
</P>
<P>
   To the dismay of critics, who accuse Dr. de Russy (her name is
pronounced duh-RUE-see) of micromanaging SUNY and trampling on
academic freedom, there is little on SUNY's 64 campuses that
escapes her attention.
</P>
<P>
   When she found out that a women's studies conference at SUNY New
Paltz last year included sessions on sadomasochism and sex toys,
for example, she drew national attention to the meeting, calling it
``academically beyond the pale and an irresponsible use of public
funds.''
</P>
<P>
   And she has been pressing for a variety of changes at SUNY _
from the adoption of a core curriculum to stronger accountability
for college presidents.
</P>
<P>
   Not content just to shape SUNY, Dr. de Russy, 55, has reached
beyond New York by writing a stream of newspaper articles and
delivering speeches at national conferences.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not, to say the least, perceive myself to be the font of
all wisdom,'' she said. ``But I was appointed and explicitly
exhorted by the governor to exercise my best judgment in those
fiscal and academic matters entrusted to me. I believe that broad,
essentially discipline-based general education serves the best
interest of students and society.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe this to be right,'' she added. ``And I am obliged in
my heart and mind to do what is right.''
</P>
<P>
   Such activism is unusual for a college trustee, said Jerry L.
Martin, president of the American Council of Trustees and Alumni, a
conservative interest group of which Dr. de Russy is a member.
</P>
<P>
   ``The typical higher education maxim is, `Don't rock the boat,'
'' he said. ``But she's making waves.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is cheering.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Edward C. Sullivan, a Democrat of Manhattan who is
chairman of the Assembly's higher education committee, said such
heavy oversight may hurt SUNY.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot run a modern university with political appointees
harassing the professors as to what and how they teach,'' he said,
alluding to her actions against SUNY New Paltz. ``Good professors
and administrators will not come if that is allowed.''
</P>
<P>
   Arnold B. Gardner, another SUNY trustee, said Dr. de Russy has
provoked discussion, ``but she's done some injury to the reputation
of the university by suggesting they never heard of standards
before.''
</P>
<P>
   With some 370,000 students on 64 campuses, SUNY is one of the
largest public university systems in the country, but none of its
campuses has ever had the cachet of the University of Michigan at
Ann Arbor or the University of California at Berkeley. And under
Gov. George E. Pataki, it was ripe for change.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Dr. de Russy's fellow board members, also appointed by
the governor, share her views on education, and together they
control the 15-member board. While she offers passion and an
agenda, Thomas F. Egan, the board chairman, and other trustees
provide the political skills to turn ideas into policy.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most of the other trustees whose jobs limit their time,
Dr. de Russy has virtually made SUNY a full-time career. She is a
Westchester County resident married to Cortes de Russy, a banking
executive, and although she said she had considered running for
office, she concluded that her family life was more important and
said that she was ``more interested in issues than politics.''
</P>
<P>
   She devotes hours to writing articles, book reviews and memos.
She is frequently in touch with others focused on education,
including reporters, not hesitating to call again and again to make
sure she explains her positions thoroughly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Others might work 60 to 80 hours a week at a job _ she has
this,'' said Carroll of Change New York. ``This is her passion, and
she also has the luxury of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. de Russy is an elegant woman, with a deep, melodious voice,
carefully trimmed blond hair and a love for silk scarves and other
rich fabrics (she wore a red velvet smoking jacket to last week's
board meeting). But she is willing to act tough.
</P>
<P>
   When SUNY's provost, Peter D. Salins, failed to complete a
survey on core courses last month, she lashed out at him during a
meeting. It did not matter that he was usually her ally, or that
she supported him for the job. She was impatient to move ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peeeterrrr,'' she said, drawing out his name slowly and
reprovingly, ``you said you would report to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. de Russy's vision grew out of her own upbringing in Baton
Rouge, La. Her father, a city judge, passed on to her his love for
the classics. Dr. de Russy recalled listening to the Socratic
dialogues on the phonograph. And at St. Mary's Dominican College in
New Orleans, her studies were filled with the classics, religion
and philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will be forever grateful for the strong liberal arts
foundation I was given,'' she said, ``and I want to bring that
great advantage to students today.''
</P>
<P>
   After studying Jean Genet at the Sorbonne and earning a
doctorate in French literature at Tulane University, she headed
north with her husband and began teaching European languages and
literature at small Catholic colleges.
</P>
<P>
   But she always has been interested in public affairs and causes,
from efforts on behalf of Vietnamese boat people and Cuban
prisoners to the Westchester branch of Change New York, an anti-tax
group. She was an early supporter of Pataki for governor.
</P>
<P>
   As her two children entered school, Dr. de Russy also began
writing and speaking on education. She was distressed by what she
saw as a lack of educational standards. And she believed that a
critical solution was to require rigorous courses that would give
students basic knowledge about subjects like history and literature
and skills like writing and thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, she was named to the board of Westchester
Community College, and in 1995, Governor Pataki promoted her to
SUNY's board, where she quickly offered her own agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, she delightedly declared victory when the core
curriculum was approved by her fellow trustees, and said she hoped
that governing boards across the country would take similar action.
She also expressed excitement on Friday about the state's new
provisions that would allow SUNY to issue charters for autonomous
public schools, which she said ``will present SUNY with an exciting
opportunity to contribute at the cutting edge to the improvement of
K-through-12 education in the state.''
</P>
<P>
   And she was already turning her attention to the issues she said
she wants to press next: grading policies, teacher education,
admissions standards and measuring what students have learned.

   All interviews took place after the House of Representatives

</P>
<P>
   This survey was organized as a tracking poll, with individual
daily samples, which was intended to capture any day-to-day shifts
in public opinion as the public absorbed the events concerning
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   All respondents had been interviewed last week.
</P>
<P>
   The original sample of telephone exchanges called was randomly
selected by a computer from a complete list of more than 42,000
active residential exchanges across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Within each exchange, random digits were added to form a
complete telephone number, thus permitting access to both listed
and unlisted numbers. Within each household, one adult was
designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the
survey.
</P>
<P>
   The results have been weighted to take account of household size
and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for
variations in the sample relating to geographic region, sex, race,
age and education.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such
samples (combining both days) will differ by no more than 3
percentage points in either direction from what would have been
obtained by seeking out all American adults.
</P>
<P>
   For smaller subgroups, the margin of sampling error is larger.
For example, for either Saturday's or Sunday's results taken alone
it is plus or minus 4 to 5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of
conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources
of error into the poll. Variations in the wording and order of
questions, for example, may lead to somewhat different results.

   (NYT10) NEW YORK -- Dec. 20, 1998 -- AIDS-VOLUNTEER, 12-20 --
Troy Masters, 37, at Bellevue Hospital Center, has volunteered to
test an experimental AIDS vaccine. Masters, who is gay,
HIV-negative and sexually active, is one of the first volunteers in
New York City to qualify for the world's first full-scale test of
the vaccine known as Aidsvax. ``The virus needs a vaccine,'' he
says. ``If there is a front of activism that needs to be developed,
that's it. I'm giving my behavior over to science. This is like
signing for permission to end the AIDS crisis.'' (Suzanne

Mel Fisher, a former chicken farmer who became a Horatio Alger
figure among undersea treasure hunters, died on Saturday at his
home in Key West. The cause was complications from cancer. He was
76. Fisher found gold and silver coins, jewelry and bars worth
millions from old-time Spanish shipwrecks in the waters off
Florida. He hunted doggedly for years for the cargo of a single

his son Kane located the underwater bounty in 1985, and the

says Fager. (Marilynn K. Yee/New York Times Photo)

   NEW YORK _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   Ten minutes before curtain on a sold-out Saturday night, I stood
outside ``The Lion King'' and flashed a small scribbled sign that
read ``Need one ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   Instantly, a couple approached, saying: ``Our friend has an
extra ticket. And he paid $225 for it.'' They held out a bona fide
ticket for orchestra center. We quickly negotiated a very modest
price, and in minutes I was happily seated next to the man who was
stuck with the extra ticket and the financial loss. Feeling that I
at least owed him pleasant company, I said, ``Gee, this is lucky
for me, but what happened to the person who was supposed to have
this ticket?''
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife and I had to buy these so far in advance that while we
were waiting, we got a divorce,'' he said. ``The show ran longer
than the marriage.''

   The painless New York way to do Christmas cards: The woman sat
at a table by the window in a Rockefeller Center cafe, with a
perfect view of the tree about 30 yards away. On the table in front
of her were four boxes of Museum of Modern Art cards, two sheets of
self-adhesive stamps, her address book and a large coffee.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Hollenberg was strolling along Second Avenue with a
friend who is a lawyer. A boy of about 14 on a bicycle was trying
to hitch a ride by grabbing on to the rear of a moving truck. The
friend whipped out his card and handed it to the boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to do that, you may need this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Five-year-old Adam finished eating his chocolate cake at dinner.
His mother, Susan Kushner, told him she was proud of him. ``Why are
you proud of me?'' he asked. ``It isn't even healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   The class at Marymount College was discussing aesthetics, and
Lewis Burke Frumkes, who teaches critical thinking, asked the
students to write about how important they thought appearance was.
</P>
<P>
   Meredith Long, a freshman, wrote: ``Would Prince Charming have
saved Sleeping Beauty if her name had been Sleeping Great
Personality?''

</P>
<P>
   It seems my dear
</P>
<P>
   That year by year
</P>
<P>
   You're more like me
</P>
<P>
   And I like thee.
</P>
<P>
   I finish sentences you start
</P>
<P>
   You speak my mind, and for your part
</P>
<P>
   You conjure up the missing phrase
</P>
<P>
   My tongue can't form, my brain can't raise.
</P>
<P>
   We always lie the same at night
</P>
<P>
   I on the left, you on the right.
</P>
<P>
   One evening in our double bed
</P>
<P>
   We'll roll together head to head
</P>
<P>
   And pass the spirits right on through
</P>
<P>
   Then you'll be me, and I'll be you.

   Marvin Heffner and his wife, Anita, of Manakin-Sabot, Va., were
recently on a Shop Till You Drop bus trip to Manhattan. After doing
all the stores, Mrs. Heffner and a friend strolled on Fifth Avenue
and stopped in front of a Tiffany's window, where they stood beside
a ``very young thing arm in arm with an older gentleman.'' Mrs.
Heffner was delighted with the exchange she overheard.
</P>
<P>
   ``That bracelet is what I've always wanted,'' said the very
young thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Try something not so expensive,'' the older gentleman said.
``We just met last week.''
</P>
<P>
   It was late afternoon before the tree-lighting ceremony at
Rockefeller Center when the real NYPD Blue merged with the
fictional.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd was large and good-natured, the weather was balmy, and
Stanley Adelman was standing next to a large policeman, stern of
visage. A tall, gray-haired man came up to the officer and held out
his hand. ``I'm sorry for your loss,'' he said. ``We all cared for
Bobby Simone,'' he added, referring to the character that had been
played by Jimmy Smits on the television show.
</P>
<P>
   The officer broke up laughing as he shook the man's hand. The
older man went on to repeat his condolences to another officer,
with the same results.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   We had been waiting a long time, several of us lamenting the
dearth of M14 crosstown buses. When one finally arrived, it was
crowded. We settled into available seats, lowered our eyes and kept
our once talkative mouths shut. An eerie silence fell.
</P>
<P>
   After a few minutes, an announcement came over the loudspeaker:
``This is your bus driver. I apologize for the tardiness. This bus
has made 46 runs today, and now it only seems to make red lights.
Most of you are going home to your wives, husbands, children, pets
or other loved ones. I know you must be tired, frustrated, annoyed,
angry, hungry or thirsty. Let me offer you a suggestion. When you
leave the bus, hand me your bad feelings. When I get to the Hudson
River, I'll throw them in the water. Have a pleasant evening and a
nice ride.''
</P>
<P>
   People were reanimated. Talk among us resumed and passengers
left the bus smiling.
</P>
<P>
   _ MARELEYN SCHNEIDER
</P>
<P>
   Don Dellair was on an M104 bus seated next to two young Asian
women. One was telling the other a long story in Japanese. The
second woman continued nodding as her companion droned on,
seemingly interminably. After five or six minutes, she looked up.
``Whatever,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The box-office personnel at the 47th Street Theater Development
Fund TKTS booth were flummoxed recently when a woman asked for a
ticket to ``the Princess Di show.'' It took a minute for them to
decipher the request. She had seen an advertisement for ``Dinah
Was,'' the musical about Dinah Washington, and immediately made the
broad jump to British royalty. Diana/Dinah _ whatever.

   (NYT10) NEW YORK -- Dec. 20, 1998 -- AIDS-VOLUNTEER, 12-20 --
Troy Masters, 37, at Bellevue Hospital Center, has volunteered to
test an experimental AIDS vaccine. Masters, who is gay,
HIV-negative and sexually active, is one of the first volunteers in
New York City to qualify for the world's first full-scale test of
the vaccine known as Aidsvax. ``The virus needs a vaccine,'' he
says. ``If there is a front of activism that needs to be developed,
that's it. I'm giving my behavior over to science. This is like
signing for permission to end the AIDS crisis.'' (Suzanne

   (NYT9) KEY WEST, Fla. -- Dec. 20, 1998 -- OBIT-FISHER, 12-20 --
Mel Fisher, a former chicken farmer who became a Horatio Alger
figure among undersea treasure hunters, died on Saturday at his
home in Key West. The cause was complications from cancer. He was
76. Fisher found gold and silver coins, jewelry and bars worth
millions from old-time Spanish shipwrecks in the waters off
Florida. He hunted doggedly for years for the cargo of a single
treasure-packed galleon, the Nuestra Senora de Atocha. Eventually
his son Kane located the underwater bounty in 1985, and the
treasure was recovered. (Susan Greenwood/New York Times Photo)

Roger Daltrey, the former lead singer of the Who, as Scrooge in ``A
Christmas Carol,'' at the Theater at Madison Square Garden. ``A
Christmas Carol'' is such a favorite, such a guaranteed revenue

umbrella organization for nonprofit theaters, there are 33 member
theaters producing it this season around the United States. (Sara

Rep. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., left, conferring with his fellow
Republican Rep. John A. Boehner in June, is likely to be the next
Speaker of the House. Hastert, a six-term conservative who is the
No. 2 vote counter in the House Republican hierarchy, has a
reputation among his GOP colleagues as a conciliator, someone who
can reach out to Democrats. (Stephen Crowley/New York Times Photo)

   (NYT6) WASHINGTON -- Dec. 20, 1998 -- IMPEACH-SPEAKER, 12-20 --
With a brief tenure as Speaker-elect, Rep. Robert Livingston, shown
in his office after the impeachment vote on Saturday, rocked the
House on Thursday with his revelation that he had had adulterous
affairs. Livingston stunned the Capitol once again Saturday by
saying that he would not serve as speaker and would quit Congress
in six months. (Justin Lane/New York Times Photo)

Rep. Jose E. Serrano, who represents the South Bronx, was among the
Democratic Congressmen who appeared with President Clinton at the
White House after the impeachment vote on Saturday. But many
Democrats did not rally around their president out of heartfelt
fealty. Instead, they were registering their disapproval of how
Republicans have handled the inquiry -- as well as their belief
that impeachment is not warranted. (Stephen Crowley/New York Times

   (NYT4) ALLAHABAD -- Dec. 20, 1998 -- INDIA-UNIVERSITY-2, 12-20
-- Masses of students at a recent student election at Allahabad
University. In its heyday, Allahabad was known as the Oxford of
India. Allahabad's decline is sadly symptomatic of a university
system overstuffed with students and undernourished with resources.
A campus built for 5,000 students now has 60,000. While only 3
percent of Indians ages 17 to 23 attend college, that still amounts
to 7 million students. (Barry Bearak/New York Times Photo)

   (NYT3) ALLAHABAD -- Dec. 20, 1998 -- INDIA-UNIVERSITY-1, 12-20
-- Once known as the Oxford of India, Allahabad University is now
part of a university system overstuffed with students and
undernourished with resources. The main building, pictured, is a
graceful reminder of its golden age. A tidal wave of poor students
from the lower reaches of India's caste system has brought serious
decline to the university. A campus built for 5,000 students now
has 60,000. (Barry Bearak/New York Times Photo)

12-20 -- Author Rosemary Mahoney's latest book, ``A Likely Story:
One Summer With Lillian Hellman'' is about her unhappy two months
working with Ms. Hellman, ``the great lady of American letters.''
Mahoney, 37, whose ``Whoredom in Kimmage: The World of Irish
Women'' was nominated for the National Book Critics Circle Award in
1993, spent time before her senior year in high school working for
Hellman. (Chester Higgins Jr./New York Times Photo)

   (NYT1) NEW YORK -- Dec. 20, 1998 -- 60-MINUTES-II, 12-20 -- Jeff
Fager, 44, the executive producer of ``60 Minutes II,'' and Dan
Rather helped sell the new program inside CBS. Fager's ``60 II,''
as it is nicknamed, must walk a fine line, living up to the
standards of the original ``60 Minutes'' while not imitating it.
With staff in place, Fager's greatest worry is replicating the
journalistic caliber of most ``60 Minutes'' pieces. ``That's what's
daunting about it, to look at that program, that kind of legacy,''
says Fager. (Marilynn K. Yee/New York Times Photo)

<P>
   ALLAHABAD, India _ In its celebrated, brainy heyday, Allahabad
University was known as the Oxford of India. Among its graduates
are three former prime ministers, one former president and the
current minister of education _ an illustrious alumni roster that
now seems ironic for a college majoring in stagnation with a strong
minor in chaos.
</P>
<P>
   A campus built for 5,000 students now has 60,000. The academic
calendar has lost its logic, with so many postponed sessions that
years can go by without required courses being offered. The law
school is currently selecting its first new class since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Buildings are decrepit. The library not only lacks up-to-date
journals, but there is also no librarian. Laboratories are of
little aid to science. ``I did an experiment with hydrochloric
acid, and when it didn't work, my teacher told me that's because
the chemicals are watered down to make them last longer,'' said a
chemistry student, Manish Kumar Verma.
</P>
<P>
   Allahabad's decline, while an extreme case, is sadly symptomatic
of a university system overstuffed with students and undernourished
with resources. Higher education was once the pride of a new nation
that declared learning to be its route to greatness. But while the
words were inspiring, they have gone unfortified by willpower and
money.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the university system's problems were usually
relegated to the dry reports of obscure committees, but now one
horrific incident has drawn India's attention. Last month, a young
man at Rajasthan University fatally immolated himself during a
student protest. He was overwrought because the results of crucial
exams were three months late, creating a state of limbo that kept
students from continuing in school or applying for jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Long delays in grading such exams have become commonplace, and
they have much to do with the long delays in paying the people who
do the grading. ``Where there are areas of crisis, the crisis is
usually in the finances,'' said Armaity S. Desai, chairwoman of the
University Grants Commission, which disburses federal funds for
higher education.
</P>
<P>
   India has about 10,000 universities and colleges _ virtually all
public _ double the number of 20 years ago. Some remain first-rate,
but a large portion of the rest _ especially in the poorest of the
nation's 27 states _ are the overwhelmed creations of haphazard
growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``State colleges are often built by local bigwigs who use them
as a source of political patronage,'' said Kuldeep Mathur, the
former director of the National Institute of Educational Planning
and Administration. ``The buildings are built and staff are hired,
but there is no thought as to how the infrastructure will be kept
up and the salaries paid.''
</P>
<P>
   India has nearly a billion people _ largely-impoverished masses
who increasingly view a college diploma as the admission ticket to
the middle class. While only 3 percent of Indians ages 17 to 23
attend college, that still amounts to 7 million students.
</P>
<P>
   High school graduates have little to hold them back. Entrance
requirements are not rigorous. Subsidized tuition amounts to about
$10 a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``With colleges open to anyone who wants to attend, merit
becomes the casualty,'' said V.R. Mehta, the vice chancellor of
highly-regarded Delhi University. ``Universities have become picnic
places with students whiling away their time.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite government subsidies for tuition _ and habitual promises
to spend more _ India allocates only 3.7 percent of its gross
domestic product on education. That exceeds most other nations in
South Asia, but lags far behind much of the developing world, a
fact many scholars attribute to the anti-egalitarian impulses of a
caste-based society.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, caste is mentioned often enough among senior members
of the Allahabad faculty as they bemoan the decay of their beloved
citadel, although theirs is a different perspective. India's
version of affirmative action reserves about 50 percent of
admissions for traditionally disadvantaged castes. Most of these
students come from small villages with poor schools. Their fluency
is in Hindi, though the texts they are required to read are in
English.
</P>
<P>
   With such students present in great numbers, the bottom brings
the top down, many professors contend.
</P>
<P>
   ``A university should exist for the pursuit of academic
excellence, but this is now an idea that plays second fiddle to
casteism,'' said Professor S.P. Singh, dean of the commerce
faculty. ``Merit should rule the roost, not what caste you are born
into.''
</P>
<P>
   Allahabad is in Uttar Pradesh, a state where lower caste
politicians have come to wield great power. They are often blamed
for the university's unchecked growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite my faith in democracy, I have to ask: by giving poor
students a bad education, do you improve their lot or merely make
contagious their disadvantage?'' asked S.C. Bhattacharya, a
recently-retired professor of ancient history.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, an education is something hard to come by at Allahabad.
Students very often skip class, which gives them something in
common with their instructors. Ignobly, some professors then charge
fees to ``coach'' their students privately, explaining what their
lectures would have said had they actually come to campus to
deliver them.
</P>
<P>
   But is the blame for this chaos to be placed on the multitude of
unprepared students _ or on the lagging priority placed on
education?
</P>
<P>
   Miss Desai, of the grants commission, says all the complaining
about merit is a luxury for the elite. ``In a country like this,
how can you make an issue out of merit?'' she said. ``When you say
quality is going down, well, yes it is, but that is because we are
massifying education. In a country where the great majority of
students are first-generation learners, they need to be nurtured.
And nurturing will cost money.''
</P>
<P>
   At dawn in Allahabad, as a winter chill chews at the bone,
students line up to get kerosene. Some will wait as long as two
hours. The fuel is needed to heat the hovels where they live _ and
where they struggle over their books after the day gives in to
darkness.

   NEW YORK _ If Zolton Williams had been typical of last spring's
graduates at Columbia University Law School, he would now be
applying for admission to the bar. But Williams is not typical.
</P>
<P>
   He is behind bars, his once promising legal career in ashes. He
waits in a federal jail in Brooklyn to be sentenced to up to 12
years in prison for smuggling tens of thousands of dollars' worth
of cocaine from Jamaica to the United States while he was a student
at one of the nation's leading law schools.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors say Williams, a 29-year-old Brooklyn man who
emigrated from Jamaica as a child, began contriving his smuggling
schemes almost as soon as he entered Columbia three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   His arrest in July, two months after his graduation, and
conviction two weeks ago have dismayed and bewildered those who
knew him at Columbia, including classmates and professors who
recalled him as a bright, energetic and intellectually curious
student who participated vigorously in class discussions and did
well with legal intricacies.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were shocked, stunned, distressed,'' said Professor
Richard Briffault, who gave Williams an A-minus in a course on
state and local government law. ``He asked good questions and wrote
a very good final exam,'' Briffault recalled. ``It's a terrible
thing, like hearing a relative died.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who is to be sentenced Feb. 12, declined to be
interviewed or to comment about the case, said his wife, Kele
Williams, who is a lawyer. She, too, declined to talk about the
case or about her husband, and there was a similar refusal from
Williams' mother, a housekeeper who lives in Brooklyn and who also
emigrated from Jamaica. Williams' father, a firefighter, remained
in Jamaica and lives in Kingston.
</P>
<P>
   The case has exposed the double life of the budding lawyer, a
life that court records indicate went beyond smuggling drugs. An
admitted confederate of Williams in the drug case has also told
investigators that he and Williams had engaged in credit card fraud
during Williams' law school years. And the authorities say that
Williams, also while in law school, filed false criminal charges
that led to the arrest of a man with whom he was involved in a
dispute. No charges have been filed against Williams regarding
these accusations.
</P>
<P>
   These followed earlier run-ins with the law, according to state
and local court records that cited a half-dozen arrests when
Williams was a teen-ager and in his early 20s. Most involved cases
in which charges like possession of stolen property or a weapon
were dismissed or, in one instance, ended in a conviction for a
noncriminal violation. But in one case, in 1988, Williams
participated with a gun-wielding companion in a street robbery.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who at the time of the robbery was 18 and at the end
of his freshman year at Brooklyn College _ he graduated magna cum
laude from the State University of New York at Stony Brook in 1994
_ was given five years' probation and youthful offender status, a
break that meant the records in the matter were sealed, and he was
officially deemed to have no criminal record as a result of the
case. The records of that case and those dismissed were ordered
unsealed after his arrest in the federal drug case.
</P>
<P>
   The law enforcement authorities say that in moonlighting as a
cocaine trafficker while in law school, Williams used his legal
skills in an effort to avoid detection, by showing another
conspirator how to do research in a computerized legal data base to
determine the ``profiles'' customs agents use to stop and search
airline passengers suspected of carrying drugs. And prosecutors
also say he nearly succeeded in escaping conviction by inducing a
friend to commit perjury to provide him with an alibi.
</P>
<P>
   The first of Williams' two trials in the drug case ended in
October with a hung jury; the panel deadlocked 11 to 1 for
acquittal. But after the alibi testimony was exposed as a
fabrication, the second jury convicted Williams after deliberating
barely an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The drug smuggling enterprise was exposed when Williams'
associate in the plot, who carried the two pounds of cocaine into
the United States in 1997 in about 100 swallowed condoms, became
ill after some of the cocaine leaked into his stomach and the
condoms had to be surgically removed at a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The associate, Anthony Fleurancois, pleaded guilty to drug
charges in a deal that involved cooperating with the prosecution,
and he also told of other unsuccessful attempts by him and Williams
to smuggle cocaine from Jamaica that began about two months after
Williams started at Columbia Law in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   One of the prosecutors in the retrial, Andrew Weissmann, himself
graduated from Columbia Law School in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's smart, but he's a criminal,'' said Weissmann, referring
to Williams. ``As a lawyer and a graduate of the law school, I was
offended. It was an improper use of his education to commit
crimes.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Louis Sher, a movie exhibitor who pioneered the showing of
foreign films, died on Nov. 25 in Phoenix, Ariz. He was 84.
</P>
<P>
   Sher opened his first movie theater in 1954 in Columbus, Ohio,
and made foreign films his specialty. He eventually built a
national chain called the Art Theater Guild, which at one time
included more than 50 theaters.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to foreign films, Sher showed the work of Andy
Warhol and Shirley Clark as well as the early films of George
Lucas, Francis Ford Coppola and Martin Scorsese. He was a key
figure in the obscenity trial involving Louis Malle's 1958 film
``The Lovers,'' which brought a ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court
that the film was not pornographic.
</P>
<P>
   He was also the producer or co-producer of shows for Broadway,
including the musical ``Shenandoah'' in 1975 and a play, ``The Trip
Back Down,'' in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Born and raised in Columbus, Sher attended Ohio State
University. He served in the U.S. Army during World War II and was
awarded the Bronze Star.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Helen; four children from his first
marriage, Larry of Los Gatos, Calif., Robert of Phoenix, Linda Dunn
of Chicago and Nancy Beigel Sher of New York; a stepdaughter, Cathy
Smith Sapin; a stepson, Michael Tash; 10 grandchildren and six
great-grandchildren.

PARCELLS PLANS TO KEEP THE PRESSURE ON HIS CHAMPIONS
</HEADLINE>
 
(Subs 4th graf for updating concerning first-round bye in
playoffs)  (ms) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Parcells, that old softie, wiped his eyes, celebrated with
a chicken pot pie for a late-night supper and then went to bed
Saturday, having taken his third National Football League team to a
division title.
</P>
<P>
   And why not allow a bit of a smile _ even tears _ in the locker
room where the New York Jets were celebrating their 17-10 victory
over the Buffalo Bills, having become American Football Conference
East champions after having won only one game only two seasons ago.
</P>
<P>
   And they did it in Parcells' second season with memories
remaining among the players of the 1996 team that went 1-15, a
season when fans who spelled out J-E-T-S claimed it stood for
``Just End the Season.''
</P>
<P>
   Equally impressive, the Jets secured a first-round bye Sunday
night when Jacksonville lost at Minnesota. In any event, Parcells
said, it would not alter his decision on his starters in the
regular-season finale next Sunday against the New England Patriots
at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want your team to be playing well as you go,'' Parcells
said Sunday, after having had only about four hours' sleep, his
norm for the night after a game. ``I've noticed with a lot of teams
trying to rest their players at the end of the year, it never seems
to work out. I've seen teams do that and get eliminated.''
</P>
<P>
   But Parcells was not all business Sunday. He was
uncharacteristically reflective.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, this is a team that initially I was a little more
distant from because a lot of the players weren't sure how to take
me and didn't want to cross my path, just be inconspicuous,'' he
said. ``Now I think it's different. They've been around me, the
guys I inherited and some of the new ones; they know what to
expect.''
</P>
<P>
   He thought about the holdovers from 1996, when the Jets
completed a two-season run of 4-28 with Rich Kotite as the coach.
Not many are left _ less than a third of the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 1-15 guys, those are the guys that said, `OK, we're just
going to blindly follow and hope we'll just get there,' '' Parcells
said. ``There's a lot of days in the weight room when you say: `Why
are we doing this? Isn't there a better way or an easier way?' ''
</P>
<P>
   But, as with the Giants and with New England, there is only the
Parcells way. And on the Jets, he has the total control and
unquestionable authority handed down from the owner, Leon Hess.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there's only one way to do it,'' Parcells said. ``Now I
think I've become a little more flexible as I've gotten older, but
I don't think I've ever been a guy to take pressure off my team.
Pepper said you've got to be a certain kind of guy to take it and
that's what I believe. It's what I've been taught; it's the way I
know.''
</P>
<P>
   Pepper Johnson is one of his Giants guys, like Curtis Martin is
one of his Patriots guys. But now, somehow, they are all his Jets
guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to Victor Green: `So what do you like better, Vic?
Which way is better?' '' Green, a Jet since 1993, did not have to
answer.
</P>
<P>
   It was, of course, a rhetorical question.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you saw those players,'' Parcells said of the emotional
locker-room scene, ``you know the game isn't about money. It's
about achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets have done what he believes good teams are supposed to
do. Indeed, the Jets now fit his definition of a good team. They
have won in the clutch, on the road.
</P>
<P>
   In getting to this point, the Jets won three road games against
their leading division rivals and had to produce second-half surges
to win. They were tied going into the third quarter against the
Bills, they trailed the Dolphins the Sunday before in Miami and
earlier this season they had fallen behind at New England in a
Monday night game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel pretty good about being able to win on the road,''
Parcells said. ``A team has to have those attributes before being
any good. What makes me feel good is going to Miami, a real big
game, a national game, their crowd in it and the Jets do well. Now
another national game, we've got to go to Buffalo. That's a good
sign for a team. We didn't play great football Saturday, but we
played just to do enough. That's why you win the division.''
</P>
<P>
   These are among the accomplishments that have eluded so many
other Jets teams:
</P>
<P>
   Three straight victories in December for the first time since
1979.
</P>
<P>
   A winning record on the road for only the second time in the
1990's.
</P>
<P>
   A five-game winning streak in the second half of the season for
the first time since 1981.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I go on the field now without worrying about what's
being said,'' Parcells said. ``I think we laugh a little more now.
I think they understand my personality, which can be volatile.''
</P>
<P>
   He spent the rest of Sunday worrying about Christmas, what time
the players will get off on Christmas Eve. He gave them off Sunday
and Monday, and will hold practice tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   The 57-year-old coach repeated another favorite motto: ``I keep
saying I'm too old to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not too many players understand that,'' Parcells said. ``But
some of my players understand it. I understand it. It takes too
much out of me. When you win, it makes it all worthwhile.''
</P>
<P>
   So he is hardly worried that his team _ finally, his team _ gets
what he is driving at. He was asked if is concerned about how hard
they will play against the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think I'll have to stress it that much,'' he said. &QL;

WOMAN HELD ON SUSPICION OF KILLING GIRL WITH CAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHARLES BOSTWICK AND LEE CONDON  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALMDALE, Calif. _ Neighbors and witnesses expressed shock and
disgust as they recounted how an 8-year-old girl was rammed to
death by car driven by a woman who fended off would-be rescuers.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was screaming. She just went right after us. She wouldn't
stop fighting,'' said Ben Chavez, a tow truck driver who lives a
few doors from where the crash occurred at 11:30 p.m. Saturday.
``She wanted everybody to go away. That's all she kept saying.''
</P>
<P>
   When neighbors and passing motorists arrived, 8-year-old Sara
Criado was pinned to a block wall by a 1974 Oldsmobile Cutlass and
34-year-old Doreen Gutierrez was in the driver's seat, the Los
Angeles County Sheriff's Department reported.
</P>
<P>
   The driver wouldn't listen to the good Samaritans' pleas to
shift the car's transmission from park into neutral so they could
push it out of the way, one witness said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Instead she took the key, got out and began fighting with the
people trying to help the dying girl, Chavez said. She yanked on
the hair of a man trying to push her car and tried to punch others.
</P>
<P>
   Deputies said Gutierrez ran Sara down after getting into an
argument with the girl's mother, Teresa Gutierrez. The two women
are not related, but they are roommates.
</P>
<P>
   Teresa Gutierrez decided to walk home from a party with her son
and daughter rather than ride with Doreen Gutierrez, who she
thought was too drunk too drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they refused to accept a ride, Doreen became enraged and
drove away at a high rate of speed,'' Sheriff's Department
spokesman Deputy Michael Irving said. ``After driving a couple
blocks, Doreen put her car in reverse and drove back to where
Teresa and her children were walking. Doreen put her car in drive,
aimed it at the three victims and attempted to run them over.''
</P>
<P>
   Walking along 30th Street East in the community 62 miles north
of downtown Los Angeles, Teresa Gutierrez and the boy jumped out of
the way, but the car hit Sara, pinning her and smashing a
four-foot-wide hole through the wall.
</P>
<P>
   After fighting with the people trying to help the girl, the
driver was finally tackled by the men, Chavez said. They held her
on the ground until firefighters arrived. Another woman drove up
and said she was the suspect's sister and would take care of her,
Chavez said.
</P>
<P>
   But after the men let her up, the suspect got into a Jeep that
had pulled up and rode away with the driver, who deputies said was
a friend.
</P>
<P>
   One bystander started yelling, ``That's her,'' and another man
ran after the Jeep. He spotted a patrol car that had just arrived
and told the deputy the motorist involved in the crash was leaving,
said neighbor Tony Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   The deputy sped off after the Jeep, and officials said Doreen
Gutierrez was taken into custody a few blocks away. Gutierrez was
arrested on suspicion of murder and held without bail.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the firefighters pronounced the little girl dead
when they arrived. Neither Teresa Gutierrez nor her son were
injured, but witnesses described the mother as frantic.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was ... (walking) around the car, around the car, looking
at her daughter. There wasn't anything anybody could do,'' Chavez
said. ``Everybody wanted to help because they heard it was a little
girl. There was nothing really anybody could do.''
