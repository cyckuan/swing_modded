<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- The Turkish government has decided to stimulate export
with the aim to earn 28.25 billion U.S. dollars from export,
reported Turkish Daily News on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet ruled after a lengthy debate Friday that the
country's export should be bolstered by all means.
</P>
<P>
A commission of three ministers will be set up to apply a set of
measures relating to state aid, export returns and bank loans.
</P>
<P>
Turkey failed to take in 26 billion dollars in its 1999 exports,
as it had expected.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkey will hold its third grain export auction on
January 24 and envisages selling 695,000 tons of grain, reported
Turkish Daily News on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Bids will be made on a cash payment, free on board (FOB) basis.
The Turkish Grain Board (TMO) will offer 275,000 tons of red
milling wheat, 145,000 tons of white milling wheat, 200,000 tons of
pasta wheat and 75,000 tons of white feed barley.
</P>
<P>
Bidding specifications are available at the TMO headquarters,
regional offices, export unions and Turkish commercial offices
abroad.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Indian Ambassador to Turkey Merkulangara Bhadrakumar
disclosed earlier this week that the Indian government would invest
300 billion U.S. dollars in infrastructure in the new century and
that Turkish companies should get a share of this ambitious
project.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador suggested that as India will build a total of 13,
000 kilometers of roads in the next three years, Turkish companies
should take part in these projects.
</P>
<P>
He complained that the Turkish construction sector has focused
only on the European market, turning its back on Asia, adding that
India's trade with Turkey is only valued at 360-370 million dollars
annually.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Meetings of the 15th session of the Iranian-Turkish
Committees on Economic and Trade Cooperation will begin in Ankara
on January 24, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Tehran Radio said the five-day session will discuss means to
step up economic cooperation between the two countries, cross
border trade as well as matters related to a proposed project to
transit Iranian natural gas to Europe via Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Russia's Yabloko Bloc Nominates Yavlinsky for Presidency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Russia's liberal Yabloko bloc
Saturday decided to officially nominate its leader Grigory
Yavlinsky for next Russian president.
</P>
<P>
At its meeting outside Moscow, the governing body of the
Yabloko unanimously approved a proposal for party leader Yavlinsky
to run for Russian president in the March 26 elections and
discussed his election campaign.
</P>
<P>
Yavlinsky was among the 36 members of the Yabloko Central
Council who backed the proposal at a meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Council decided to have Yavlinsky formally nominated as
candidate by an action committee to meet next week.
</P>
<P>
"I'm a candidate for Russian president. That means (acting
Russian President) Vladimir Putin is my opponent," Yavlinsky said
after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Lukin, one of Yabloko's leaders, told reporters that
Yavlinsky's choice is principled and not formal.
</P>
<P>
"We should make it so that the coming elections won't be formal.
But this does not mean we will not cooperate with Putin after the
first or second round of voting," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that Yabloko is ready to cooperate with Putin if his
major positions coincide with its stands.
</P>
<P>
Being nominated, Yavlinsky said his principles are "open and
free economics, human rights, effective modern armed forces and an
end to the war in Chechnya."
</P>
<P>
Much is still "unclear" about what Putin will do if he becomes
president, Yavlinsky said.
</P>
<P>
This, the Yabloko leader said, is one of the reasons why he
decided to rival Putin. "We (Yabloko) have decided to take part in
the presidential elections and struggle for being understood in
our country," he said.
</P>
<P>
Talking about Chechnya, he said: "We suggest to stop the wide-
scale hostilities and go over to special operations and to
political negotiations."
</P>
<P>
Yavlinsky, outstanding Russian economist, was a candidate for
president in the second Russian general elections in 1996, when he
won 5.55 million or 7.45 percent of the votes, ranking fourth
after ex-President Boris Yeltsin, Communist Party chairman Gennady
Zyuganov and retired General Alexander Lyebedy.

<TEXT>
<P>
"There are still too many barriers and examples of too many
Americans facing discrimination in their daily lives," even though
the country is doing better in treating all citizens equally,
Clinton said his weekly radio address.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the 71st birthday of Martin Luther King Jr.,
Clinton said he will also ask Congress for swift passage of
legislation that would expand federal hate crime laws to include
crimes committed because of the victim's sexual orientation,
gender or disability.
</P>
<P>
King, who was killed on April 4, 1968, would have been 71 years
old Saturday. The nation's official observance of his birthday is
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he will seek 695 million U.S. dollars for civil
rights enforcement, a 13 percent increase from last year.
</P>
<P>
He said he will also seek 322 million dollars for the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission, 14 percent more than last year'
s budget.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people across the United States have started
celebrations in honor of King with events imploring Americans to
press toward achieving the slain civil rights leader's dream in
the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
Officials in Washington held the first of several events Friday
at the Lincoln Memorial, the site where King gave his "I Have a
Dream Speech" some 36 years ago.
</P>
<P>
In Atlanta, King's former home, Housing and Urban Development
Secretary Andrew Cuomo is scheduled to join King's widow, Coretta,

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia to Train More Eye Care Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Vice Health
Minister Lamesso Hayisso said here Saturday that the government
will make effort to set up more ophthalmologic institutions in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the graduation ceremony of 21 ophthalmic nurses,
Lamesso said there is very much shortage of ophthalmologic
institutions and professionals in Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
He said there are only 116 eye care workers and 25
ophthalmologic wards in all health institutions across the
country.
</P>
<P>
The number of visually impaired people in Ethiopia accounted
for 1.5 percent of 60 million population in the country.
</P>
<P>
An ophthalmologist to population ratio in Ethiopia currently
stands at one to five million people, according to Lamesso.
</P>
<P>
The senior health official also inaugurated a plant that
manufactures six kinds of eye-drops in the precinct of the All
African Leopresy Eradication and Rehabilitation Training (ALERT)
Center where the 21 ophthalmic nurses were trained.
</P>
<P>
The plant reportedly has the capacity to manufacture up to 250
tubes of eye-drops per day.

<HEADLINE> mee011516 hke -- Oman Links Ties With Israel to Israeli-Syrian Rapprochement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MUSCAT, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Oman will not enhance its ties
with Israel until remarkable progress is made in the Israeli-Syrian
talks, a Foreign Ministry official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Oman will not reopen its trade office in Israel until there is
tangible and substantial progress in the Israeli-Syrian talks," the
official said on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Syrian negotiators have held two rounds of talks
since December in their first peace negotiations since early 1996.
A third round is due to begin Wednesday in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Oman established commercial ties with Israel in 1995, opening a
trade mission in Tel Aviv. But it froze relations with the Jewish
state after the peace process stalled over Israel's decision to
build a Jewish neighborhood in the traditionally Arab sector of
Jerusalem in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The official said the visit by two Omani Foreign Ministry
officials to Tel Aviv this month did not indicate a warming of
relations.
</P>
<P>
"Those diplomats went to tell Israel that ties would resume, and
even be upgraded, if there was progress in peace talks between
Israel and its Arab neighbors, including Syria," the official said.
He did not elaborate.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's Ministerial Committee on

investment.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was chaired by Prime Minister Atef Obeid and was
attended by members of the ministerial economic group and a number
of investors, businessmen and representatives of various sectors
concerned, the official Middle East News Agency (MENA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The government is concerned with removing obstacles that affect
the flow of investments through an integrated plan based on
evaluating investment policies and legislations, said Information
Minister Muhammad el-Sharif, quoting the Prime Minister.
</P>
<P>
The plan gives priority to a number of issues including the
legislative amendments to boost flow of investments, relationship

investment domain and trained cadres necessary for various
specialized industrial sectors, el-Sharif said.
</P>
<P>
The Federation of Industries and Tourism, representatives of the
Chambers of Commerce and various investment sectors will be
entrusted with forming working groups to present papers and
proposals on legislation amendments, he said.

<HEADLINE> mee011518 hke -- Saudi Arabia, Japan Resume Talks on Oil Concession Renewal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia and Japan
resumed talks in Riyadh on Saturday on the renewal of an oil
concession held by the Tokyo-based Arabian Oil Company (AOC) in a
neutral zone Saudi Arabia shares with Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources Ali Bin
Ibrahim al-N'aimi and Japanese Minister of International Trade and
Industry Takashi Fukaya, who arrived in Riyadh on Friday, attended
the meeting on behalf of their countries.
</P>
<P>
The two sides were trying to remove obstacles to the renewal of
the 40-year concession, which is expiring on February 27, according
to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia once suggested that Japan should meet certain
conditions for the renewal of the rights, such as increasing crude
oil purchases and stepping up investment in Saudi non-oil projects,
including a mining railroad. Tokyo previously rejected the Saudi
demand.
</P>
<P>
Several rounds of negotiations on the AOC issue were held in the
past two years, but no agreement has been reached.
</P>
<P>
Al-N'aimi expressed hope following Saturday's meeting that the
two countries would work out an agreement soon on the extension of
the concession agreement.
</P>
<P>
Japanese companies hold 78 percent of AOC's shares, while Saudi
Arabia and Kuwait each own 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
AOC's production in the fields on the Saudi-Kuwaiti border was
estimated at 280,000 barrels per day.
</P>
<P>
Japan imports some 1 million barrels of Saudi oil daily,
accounting for 22 percent of its needs. Trade between the two
countries stood at 31 billion Saudi Riyals (around 8.2 billion U.S.
dollars) in 1998.

<HEADLINE> mee011519 hke -- Jordanian Cabinet Reshuffle Brings in 7 New Ministers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 15 Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister Abdel Rauf
Rawabdeh reshuffled his 24-member cabinet Saturday, bringing in
seven new ministers to his 10-month-old government, but kept key
portfolios untouched.
</P>
<P>
King Abdullah Bin Hussein approved the reshuffle, appointing
Saleh Qallab as minister of information and culture, Abdullah
Toukan telecommunications and post, Wael Sabri energy and mineral
resources, Mohammad Halaykah trade and industry, Khalaf Masaadeh
justice, Mousleh Tarawneh health and Issa Ayoub transport minister.
</P>
<P>
The new ministers were sworn in Saturday in a nationally
televised ceremony which was also attended by King Abdullah, who
has the constitutional rights of appointing or dismissing
governments.
</P>
<P>
As widely anticipated, key portfolios pertaining to the ministry
of foreign affairs, interior and defense remained unchanged to
ensure the continuity of foreign and defense policies of the
government.
</P>
<P>
Rawabdeh, who was also holding the defense portfolio, had been
rumored to lose his job in the reshuffle, but apparently saved his
premiership as Jordan is emerging from a chronic economic
stagnation and achieved a 1.5-2 percent growth in 1999, though
official figures have not been released.
</P>
<P>
Though politically conservative, virtually all of the new
ministers are known as technocrats who are expected to win more
support for economic and social reforms by the government.
</P>
<P>
The shuffle was also in line with traditional government
shakeups in Jordan around the turn of the year. Rawabdeh was the
80th prime minister of the country since the year 1921.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts said the fact that Rawabdeh is becoming one
of the longest-serving prime minister indicated that he had won
support from 37-year-old King Abdullah, who acceded to the throne
last February after his father, late King Hussein, died of cancer.
</P>
<P>
However, Rawabdeh had been under fire from parliamentary members
and opposition parties for his tough handling of home affairs,
including his crackdown on Muslim dissidents, privatization of non-
profitable key state enterprises and a decision to levy a 10
percent consumption tax which triggered a price hike.
</P>
<P>
He is also hit by a scandal that his son had asked for some 20
million U.S. dollars from potential investors from a Gulf state to
help them win a contract to build a tourist village in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
The lower house of the Jordanian parliament decided this week to
set up a special committee to look up into the scandal.
</P>
<P>
Rawabdeh has denied such charges but said he would resign if his
son was proved of wrong doings.

<HEADLINE> 5 Namibians Killed Near Namibia-Angola Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Namibian police confirmed
on Saturday that five Namibians were killed in an attack on a
vehicle travelling along Namibia's border with Angola.
</P>
<P>
The police said the assault took place at 5 p.m. local time on
Friday in Namibia's Caprivi Strip region.
</P>
<P>
Namibian police spokesman Hophni Hamufungu said a contingent of
police officers had been sent to the scene to investigate the
attack.
</P>
<P>
He said that the latest incident looked like the same as the
attack on January 3 in which three French tourists were killed and
two others wounded by the rebels of the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
The Namibian government gave its approval to Angola last
December, allowing the Angolan army to use Namibia's north
territory as a springboard to launch attack against the UNITA
rebels in southern Angola.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese security forces beefed
up security measures around the Russian Embassy and other Russian
interests in Beirut on Saturday amid threats of attacks.
</P>
<P>
The police received an anonymous phone call Saturday morning,
threatening of imminent attack against the embassy.
</P>
<P>
The troops surrounded the diplomatic compound, located in the
traditionally Muslim sector in western Beirut, and remained outside
the embassy throughout the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The police also boosted security measures around the buildings
containing the Russian cultural centre and the Russian news agency
Novosti.
</P>
<P>
The threats came one day after a new Russian ambassador, Boris
Bolotin, arrived in Beirut and two weeks after an attack against
the embassy.
</P>
<P>
On January 3, a Palestinian extremist, protesting Russia's
military campaign in the breakaway republic of Chechnya, fired hand
grenades and bullets at the Russian Embassy, killing one Lebanese
policeman and injuring several passers-by. The attacker was killed
by the Lebanese security forces later. No staff in the embassy was
hurt.

<HEADLINE> Conference of S.Asian Stock Exchanges Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of stock exchanges in
South Asia began a two-day conference in southeastern Bangladesh's
port city Chittagong on Saturday aimed at reaching a common ground
for launching a regional forum of capital market operators.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Chittagong said representatives from stock
exchanges of Bhutan, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and host
Bangladesh are attending the meeting which is expected to form the
South Asian Stock Exchanges' Federation on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the conference, Amir Khosru M Chowdhury, president
of the Chittagong Stock Exchange which is hosting the first such
event in the region, emphasized the need for reaching a consensus
on establishing the regional forum, and the participants pledged
their support for the initiative, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Chowdhury told reporters on Friday that federations of stock
exchanges were being formed in other parts of the world, but there
was no such federation in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
There were four basic objectives of the proposed federation: to
encourage cooperation among the members to promote the development
of their respective securities markets, to represent the members
in international forums, to encourage development of an integrated
international stock trading system in the region, and to offer
listing and trading opportunities for security issues in the
region, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also listed areas of cooperation among the members of the
proposed federation, which included business research, information
dissemination, and development of human resources through mutual
cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Russian Communists Nominate Zyuganov for Presidency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 15 (Xinhua) -- A Russian Communist Party
congress on Saturday unanimously nominated party leader Gennady
Zyuganov for next Russian president, who will be elected on March
26.
</P>
<P>
Zyuganov, who will represent so-called "People's Patriotic
Forces" at the coming polls, was the only candidate proposed at
the congress.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Communist Party said the party was giving
Zyuganov "a chance to work independently within a corridor that
would increase support for us."
</P>
<P>
After the congress, Zyuganov said his election program will be
based on the Communist program for last December's parliamentary
elections.
</P>
<P>
But "it is impossible to get out of the crisis without social
consolidation," he told reporters. "The war of everyone against
everyone will bring about a disintegration of Russia."
</P>
<P>
Speaking about his main electoral rival, Zyuganov said acting
President Vladimir Putin "has so far openly stated his position
only on the war in Chechnya," where the situation "is extremely
complicated and largely dramatic."
</P>
<P>
His party supports the military operation in Chechnya but "a
proper way of life must begin on liberated territory," Zyuganov
said.
</P>
<P>
If Putin fails to solve Russia's burning economic and social
problems, his government would "flop," the Communist leader warned.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party had formulated eight problems that "will
demand answers from the government," he said.
</P>
<P>
Russia "has so far remained on its former course" after Putin
became prime minister, Zyuganov said.

<HEADLINE> Georgian, Turkish Presidents Discuss Caucasus Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Georgian President Eduard
Shevardnadze and his Turkish counterpart Suleyman Demirel
discussed Caucasus security in the Georgian capital of Tbilisi
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Itar-Tass news agency, the two leaders said in
a joint statement released after their meeting that to maintain
political and economic stability of the Caucasus region is a "
priority direction in the policy of Georgia and Turkey."
</P>
<P>
They agreed that political stability in the Caucasus largely
depends on the economic situation.
</P>
<P>
"Stability in the Caucasus is impossible without the
cooperation with Russia," stressed Shevardnadze at a joint press
conference with Demirel.
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze said he planned to "seriously discuss" the 1996
agreements with Russian acting President Vladimir Putin at the
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) summit in Moscow in late
January.
</P>
<P>
The presidents of Georgia, Russia, Azerbaijan and Armenia
pledged to maintain peace and stability in the Caucasus at their
1996 summit in Kislovodsk.
</P>
<P>
Economic projects in the region "are of European and
international importance," therefore, the international community
"won't remain indifferent to problems in the Caucasus," said
Shevardnadze.
</P>
<P>
On the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil and gas pipeline project, he
stated that Georgia "would not create any troubles in this issue,"
and the project was "completely clarified," he said.
</P>
<P>
Regarding Turkey's position on the Chechen issue, Demirel said,
"Chechnya is part of Russia."
</P>
<P>
He also expressed confidence that the sovereign countries of
Georgia and Azerbaijan would not be drawn into the military action
in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Demirel, who is in a two-day official visit to Georgia,
proposed a Caucasian pact be concluded to boost regional peace and
stability. But he did not elaborate on the proposal. Shevardnadze
called this initiative "historically important."
</P>
<P>
The two presidents signed four bilateral documents including
agreements on technical cooperation and agricultural cooperation
and a protocol on cooperation between the air forces of the two
countries.

<HEADLINE> Last Notes of German Mark to Be Printed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The day when the German mark
withdraws from the historical stage is nearing.
</P>
<P>
President of the German Federal Bank Ernst Welteke turned over
the last series of banknotes of the German mark to print Friday in
Munich.
</P>
<P>
Welteke signed his name to the last series of 300 million ten-
mark notes in the printing house Giesecke &AMP; Devrient in Munich.
</P>
<P>
There will be only 717 days left for the German mark to be used.
From 2002, the euro will be put into circulation in Germany and 10
other countries of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Since 1961 the German Federal Bank had turned over 26.6
milliard banknotes worth 1.8 billion marks to print. It weighed
out 23,885 tons in total.
</P>
<P>
The German mark began its history in the U.S.A. in 1948 because
the first notes were printed there, stressed Welteke. The Bank of
German States, the predecessor of the German Federal Bank was then
allowed to print notes also in Great Britain and France. During a
long time the German mark was regarded as a symbol for the wonder
of the German economy.

KUNMING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The two earthquakes that jolted
southwest China's Yunnan Province this morning did not damage the
nearby tourist destinations.

<P>
LEBANON, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Two Israeli jets bombed
suspected Hezbollah guerrillas' hideouts in southern Lebanon on
Saturday in the fifth such raid in a week, but no casualties were
reported so far.
</P>
<P>
The afternoon airstrike came shortly after two guerrilla groups
claimed to have attacked Israeli troops and their militia allies,
Lebanese security officials said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli jets fired four missiles at targets in Iqlim al-
Tuffah, a stronghold of Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas that
faces an Israeli-occupied border zone, the officials said on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
The district is a frequent target of Israeli warplanes as it is
used by Hezbollah guerrillas to attack Israeli troops and allied
militiamen in the occupied zone.
</P>
<P>
In Jerusalem, the Israeli military said its air force attacked
targets in the south Lebanon and all planes returned to base.
</P>
<P>
Earlier the Hezbollah group and the Syrian-backed Amal movement
said their forces had fired rockets and mortars at Israeli and
allied positions in the occupied zone.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese guerrillas, primarily Hezbollah, are fighting to oust
1,500 Israeli soldiers and the 2,500 Israeli-backed South Lebanon
Army militiamen from the occupied zone.
</P>

Israel contends that the zone, set up in 1985, is necessary to
protect its northern towns from cross-border guerrilla attacks.

<HEADLINE> mee011513 hke -- French Businessman Defends Cash Gifts to Israeli President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Cash gifts to Israeli
President Ezer Weizman were merely an act of friendship and beyond
reproach, a lawyer for the French millionaire at the heart of the
financial scandal said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Lawyer Pinhas Rubin said his client Edouard Seroussi had merely
given cash gifts to a "friend with money troubles."
</P>
<P>
"We are talking about friends that are very, very close and very
intimate," Rubin told the Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
"He lent a shoulder in a totally natural, totally regular,
totally friendly way, on a totally personal basis and suddenly this
personal basis is the subject of rumors," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
This was the first statement issued on behalf of Seroussi over
the money scandal which was exposed by an Israeli reporter two
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Rubin did not mention how much money Seroussi gave to Weizman,
but local media put the figure at about 450,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
As asked by Attorney-General Elyakim Rubinstein and State
Attorney Edna Arbel, an Israeli police team was formed to help
examine the case.
</P>
<P>
The police is scheduled to start its investigation on Sunday
under the supervision of Arbel and police chief Yehuda Wilk.
</P>
<P>
Both Rubinstein and Arbel said Thursday that the police
involvement is part of their examination of the case, not a
criminal investigation against the president.
</P>
<P>
After going over the material evidence for several days, they
said they have reached the conclusion that the material requires
additional clarification, for which they do not have the tools.
</P>
<P>
On learning the decision, Weizman issued a statement saying he
welcomes the decision to hand over the investigation to the police.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
In keeping with what Weizman has reiterated over the past few
days, the statement reiterated that Weizman has no intention of
stepping down at this juncture. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli reporter Yoav Yitzhak broke the story at the end of 1999
that Weizman received a total of 453,000 U.S. dollars from Seroussi
and Weizman used this money from 1988 to 1995 when he was member of
the Knesset (parliament), minister and president. 
</P>
<P>
Weizman said he used the money for medical treatment of his son,
Shaul, who was badly wounded in the 1970 War of Attrition and died
in a car accident in 1991.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Army Destroys Ganja Plants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi Army on Saturday
destroyed standing ganja plants on about 50 acres of land in the
southeastern Khagrachari Hill district as part of its drive
against clandestine production of drug materials, the BSS news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Acting on a tip, members of the army unearthed the ganja
plantation on Monday on fertile and silted-up lands on both sides
of a canal in the district, Zonal Commander Lt. Col. Feroz was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We have unearthed the largest quantify of ganja in Chittagong
hill tracts from which around five tons of dried ganja could be
produced," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ganja was planted in disguise, and the local people preferred
remote and inaccessible areas in the hill tracts to plant ganja,
opium, hashish and poppy crops as movement of the members of the
security forces were restricted, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that some unscrupulous traders of the Chittagong hill
tracts had been encouraging the poverty-stricken hill people to
cultivate these drug materials alluring them with big money.
</P>
<P>
As part of its social welfare and motivational program, the
army has started to apprise the local people of the harmful
effects of drugs by creating public awareness against production
and use of drug materials, and is assisting the poor people in the
area with money and necessary materials for rehabilitating them by
choosing alternative crop production, the BSS said.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 15 (Xinhua) -- France has pledged to
donate 10 million francs (one U.S. dollar equals 6.4639 francs) to
support projects to be carried out by the revived East African
Community (EAC) in its development plan, media here reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The pledge was included in a joint declaration signed by the
Executive Secretary of the EAC Secretariat Francis Muthaura and
visiting French Minister for International Cooperation Charles
Josselin in Tanzania's northern town of Arusha Friday.
</P>
<P>
Muthaura said that France had also shown interest in assisting
several projects on Lake Victoria such as the rehabilitation of
existing rescue units by supplying modern communications gadgets
and the improvement of navigation on the largest lake in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Josselin said that France is interested in the development of
regional integration for guaranteed peace and stability as well as
economic and cultural development in Africa and in particular in
the three EAC member states of Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The EAC and the French Development Agency last year signed an
agreement of cooperation in matters of economic, social, technical
and cultural issues.
</P>
<P>
The French minister also toured the United Nations
International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) and held talks
with the tribunal Vice- President, Justice Eric Mose, before
flying to Uganda and Rwanda on bilateral and regional issues.

<HEADLINE> German Leftists Hold Rally in Memory of Former Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Germany's leftist Party of
Democratic Socialism (PDS) held a rally here Saturday
commemorating their former leaders Rosa Luxemburg and Karl
Liebknecht, who were murdered 81 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Under the tight protection of 2,000 policemen, the
demonstrators staged a march attended by nearly 100,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht, famous leaders of the
German socialist movement and founders of the German Communist
Party, were killed by the German Free Corps on January 15, 1919,
after an uprising organized by the German communists was
suppressed.
</P>
<P>
Former East Germany held memorial activities for them every
year and after the reunification of Germany, the PDS continued the
annual activity. The memorial ceremony was often held in silence,
with participants laying flowers or wreaths.
</P>
<P>
However, this year's memorial ceremony was threatened by a 39-
year-old man, Olaf Juergen Staps, who was wanted by the Berlin
police for burning down his apartment building and who was
reported to have a hand grenade. The police had banned the
gathering in Friedrichsfelde last Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Orders Defense Minister to Withdraw Army Magazine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 15 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
has ordered Defense Minister Alain Richard to withdraw the latest
issue of the "Armees d'aujourd'hui (Armed Forces of Today),"
because it improperly presented an interview he has given to it.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro reported Saturday that Chirac was not satisfied with
the treatment by the editors of the magazine to the interview, in
which he spoke as the chief of the French armed forces at the New
Year's season.
</P>
<P>
In the interview Chirac talked about the issues of reform of
the armed forces, the military condition and nuclear deterrence.
</P>
<P>
"Neither the general presentation nor the choice of the photos
corresponds to the solemn character of the talks given by the
president of the republic," Le Figaro quoted a source at the
Elysee presidential office as saying.
</P>
<P>
Agence France-Presse quoted Defense Ministry officials as
saying Saturday that 150,000 copies of the December-January issue
of "Armees d'aujourd'hui" have been held due to a "fault" in
editing the interview.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro said the incident also shows that Chirac has not been
happy with the Socialist government of Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin for its way of handling problems linked with the reform of
the armed forces, engaged by Chirac after his election in 1995.

<P>
WASHINGTON, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Across a continent that sees itself as the cradle of Western
science and civilization, many political and business leaders have
reached the alarming conclusion that Europe is rapidly losing
ground to the United States in the growth industries of the future.
</P>
<P>
-- Russia Friday published a revised national security doctrine
that reflects a growing sense of apprehension in the military and
political establishment about Western intentions, especially after
the NATO attack on Yugoslavia last year and amid continuing
disagreements over Chechnya and arms control.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- South Korea plans to develop a rocket capable of ferrying
satellites into orbit within the next five years. U.S. officials
have reservations about South Korea's ambitions, fearing that the
rocket technology could be exported to countries which might use
it for military applications.
</P>
<P>
-- The Panamanian authorities, bowing to renewed concerns about
terrorist attacks, said that they were beefing up security to
protect a British ship carrying radioactive cargo through the
canal this weekend. Environmental groups fear that the ship,
carrying high-level waste from France to Japan, is vulnerable to
terrorists.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Registers 26-Billion-Dollar Current Account Surplus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 15 (Xinhua) -- South Korea registered a current
account surplus of 26 billion U.S. dollars in 1999, exceeding the
targeted 20 billion dollars, said the Finance and Economy Ministry
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry attributed the surplus to increased exports which
hit 144.2 billion dollars, up 9 percent from 1998.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the country's imports reached 119.7 billion dollars,
up 28.3 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Last year, South Korea's trade volume stood at 246 billion U.S.
dollars ranking the 12th in the world.
</P>
<P>
South Korea became a net creditor nation last September for the
first time since 1979 with the rising current account surplus
which helps enhance the foreign currency holdings, said the
ministry.

<HEADLINE> French Minister-Delegate for Cooperation Visits Rwanda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 15 (Xinhua) -- French Minister-Delegate for
Cooperation Charles Josselin paid a brief visit to Rwanda Saturday
in a bid to normalize relations iced by accusation that France
supported the former Hutu regime in the 1994 genocide against
Tutsis.
</P>
<P>
Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported from Kigali that Josselin
held a meeting with Rwanda's strongman, Vice President and Defense
Minister Paul Kagame, for more than one hour.
</P>
<P>
Kagame was quoted as saying that the visit by Josselin, the
first by a French government minister in recent five years, was an
important step toward the normalization of relations between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Kigali government, led by the former Tutsi rebels of
Rwandan Patriotic Front, has repeatedly accused France of
supporting the Hutu regime of President Juvenal Hasbyarimana and
covering the criminals in the 1994 genocide through the
humanitarian-military operation "Turquoise" staged by the French
troops in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Josselin, Kagame also suggested that
France play a role in solving the conflicts in Africa from Burundi
to southern Sudan, and help the countries involved in the conflict
of the Democratic Republic of Congo implement the Lusaka peace
agreement signed last July.
</P>
<P>
"We think that the best way to solve these problems is to treat
them together, as the conflicts have an interactive character,"
Kagame said.
</P>
<P>
The current visit by the French minister in the three eastern
African states -- Tanzania, Rwanda and Uganda -- is aimed at
helping implement the Lusaka agreement which calls for the
withdrawal of foreign troops from Congo, demilitarization of
Congolese rebels and free elections in the country.
</P>
<P>
France has urged the United Nations to send a peacekeeping
force to Democratic Congo as soon as possible and expressed its
willingness to provide logistic support for such a mission.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda and Uganda backed the Congolese rebels, while Zimbabwe,
Angola, Namibia and Chad support the Congolese government headed
by President Laurent-Desire Kabila.

The Luos rushed out. Everyone was standing in the chilly wind,
too frightened to say a single word. When it became calm again,
some bold fellows fetched firewood and quilts to keep warm. And as
a precaution against aftershocks, village heads ran from one
household to another warning them not to stay indoors.
</P>
<P>
Just when the villagers thought the nightmare was over, a
second earthquake struck the mountain town. Several women and
children were frightened to the point of tears, and people were
choked by the flying dust.
</P>
<P>
The village became quiet in the afternoon. Some villagers whose
houses were not seriously damaged cooked outside and invited
others to eat with them.
</P>
<P>
"The disaster brings people closer to each other," said Luo, "
All of us can overcome the difficulties with help of our neighbors.
"
</P>
<P>
At 2:00 in the afternoon, a team led by Yunnan Vice-Governor Li
Hanbai expressed solicitude to Luo and his fellows. Li told Luo
that the Party Central Committee, the central government, and the
Yunnan provincial Party committee and government are all deeply
concerned for the people in the quake-stricken area.
</P>
<P>
"We will surely overcome the difficulties and rebuild our homes,

damaged when two earthquakes struck his village early this morning.
</P>
<P>
"This is most of my property," Luo exclaimed, looking at the TV
set buried in the collapsed walls, the cooking pot cracked, and
tiles scattered around.
</P>
<P>
"We are sure to rebuild a nice house," said Luo, while the
setting sun reddened his frustrated face.
</P>
<P>
Two earthquakes measuring 5.9 and 6.5 on the Richter scale
rocked Yao'an County of the Chuxiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture at
06:09 and 07:37 today. Guantun Village is at an elevation of 2,300
meters and is home to the Yi, Bai, and Han ethnic groups. It was
also at the center of today's earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
The house had trembled violently, the thermos bottles had
fallen making a loud sound, and Luo's heart was still fluttering
with fear as he recalled what had happened in the morning.

<HEADLINE> Rebel Faction Halts Peace Talks In Algeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Algerian Peace talks between the
government and the rebels have broke down after a senior negotiator
of the rebels was shot dead by his fellow militants, local radio
reports said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Three members of a group led by Hassan Hattab, who was
negotiating his surrender with the authorities, shot dead his
senior aide Aoudjid Bourguiba in an ambush on Thursday, in a move
to show their opposition to their movement's peace talks with the
government.
</P>
<P>
Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika had promised to pardon
Islamic militants who will lay down their arms, for a national
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
But the amnesty does not cover the army deserters who joined the
rebels. The exclusion has fanned anti-government sentiments among
former soldiers in Hattab's faction, who had killed aide Mohamed
Dichou last year for supporting similar peace talks.
</P>
<P>
State media had quoted government officials as saying Hattab and
130 followers would surrender on Thursday, the last day of a six-
month offer for amnesty.
</P>
<P>
Algeria has been dogged by violence since early 1992 when the
authorities cancelled a general election in which Muslim militants
had taken a commanding lead.
</P>
<P>
Bouteflika says 100,000 people have been killed since then.

<HEADLINE> Syrian Paper Rules out Barak-Assad Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Syria's state-run newspapers on
Saturday ruled out the possibility of a meeting between Syrian
President Hafez al-Assad and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak to
bridge their gaps in peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
A Barak-Assad meeting is "far-fetched and would never contribute
to pushing the peace process forward," said a front-page editorial
on the Al-Thawra newspaper.
</P>
<P>
However, it did not mention whether Assad would meet Barak after
the two countries reach a peace deal.
</P>
<P>
In an interview published in Israel on Friday, Barak called for
a meeting with Assad by saying that some differences with Syria
cannot be resolved without sitting down with President Assad and U.
S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
During recent Syrian-Israeli peace talks in Shepherdstown, West
Virginia, Barak has been negotiating with the Syrian delegation led
by Syrian Foreign Minister Faruk Shareh. The talks, which were held
on January 3-10, failed to make any substantive progress.
</P>
<P>
The editorial accused Barak of trying to avoid the next round of
talks slated for Wednesday "by submitting such impossible
conditions over the level of negotiations, to kill in advance the
third round of talks."
</P>
<P>
Syria and Israel resumed their peace talks last December after a
nearly four-year suspension.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are scheduled to hold a third round of talks in
the U.S. to continue discussing such tough issues as Israeli
withdrawal from the Golan Heights which was captured by Israel in
the 1967 Mideast war, security arrangements, demarcation of borders
and water sharing.

<HEADLINE> German CDU's Former Regional Leader Admits Secret Account </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The former Hesse State Chairman
of Germany's opposition Christian Democratic Union (CDU) Friday
admitted a secret account of his party, local media reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Manfred Kanther, at a press conference late Friday, said the
CDU's Hesse State branch set an account in a Liechtenstein bank
for depositing donations from inside and outside the party and
invested the money on the stock market in the early 1980's.
</P>
<P>
They deposited the money in preparation for the amendment of
the party's law in 1984. But the law took into effect without
using the money. The then 7 million marks (now 3.7 million U.S.
dollars) of "campaign reserve" have now gained in value to 17
million marks (8.9 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
While not mentioning whether the party paid interest tax for
the money, Kanther admitted it was wrong from the beginning.
</P>
<P>
But, he said, the wrongdoing is none of the business of the
current CDU's Hesse State Premier Roland Koch. Koch knew nothing
about the secret account.
</P>
<P>
According to German law, the CDU may have to pay 39 million
marks (20.4 million dollars) in fine, three times the total
illegal campaign donations, including those which former
chancellor Helmut Khol and CDU Chairman Wolfgang Schaeuble had
admitted.

<HEADLINE> 11 Albanian Drug Traffickers Sentenced to Life Imprisonment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The Albanian Elbasan Court
Saturday sentenced all eleven members of a drug trafficking ring
to life imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
All but one suspect pleaded not guilty in the court, but the
court still passed the verdict on the ground of strong evidence
provided by the procuratorial organs.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for Albania to give such a quick and
severe punishment against criminals involved in drug smuggling.
</P>
<P>
The drug trafficking group was unearthed last weekend while
trafficking 400 kilograms of marijuana to Greece. The marijuana
was found by traffic police on duty last Saturday night from a
military police wagon driven by two Albanian military police and
one official of national security.
</P>
<P>
After a shock action of interrogation, the Albanian police
caught six confederates waiting on the border with Greece to
receive the marijuana. Another two members of the group were
arrested later.
</P>
<P>
Albania has become a major corridor for drug smuggling to the
western countries since its violent change in 1991.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Ministry Renamed to Emphasize Sports  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 15 (Xinhua)-- Singapore's current Community
Development Ministry (CDM) will be renamed the Ministry of
Community and Sports (MCDS) from April 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
The move was announced by CDM Minister Abdullah Tarmugi at the
city-state's Sports 21 Conference held here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said that the rename of his ministry is a sign of the
higher priority the Singapore government has decided to give to
sports.
</P>
<P>
He said that the MCDS will cooperate with its partners in the
sports arena to develop the "software", that is the people,
policies and programs, to match the "hardware" or physical
facilities.
</P>
<P>
He said a special emphasis will be put on sports programs which
will promote the wholesome development of the youth and strengthen
their bond with their fellow Singaporeans from diverse backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
On the question of importing foreign talent for sports,
Abdullah said the country must "take a long term view and be very
selective, particularly for sports talent who are eventually
offered Singapore citizenship."
</P>
<P>
Singapore will bring foreign sports talent into preferred core
and merit sports with a focus on individual rather than team
sports, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Singapore will encourage the import of younger
atheletes who have longer sporting careers ahead of them and who
can integrate better into the Singapore society.
</P>
<P>
"Those recruited must eventually help to elevate the standard
of the sport in Singapore," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Foreign talent, however, is not intended to replace local
talent, he added.
</P>
<P>
As a key objective of Singapore's promotion of sports is to
instill national pride, said the minister, winning would be hollow
if the entire team consists only of foreigns.

<HEADLINE> Earthquakes Wake up Kunming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Residents of Kunming, capital
Yunnan Province neighboring Myanmar, were awakened by two strong
earthquakes early this morning.
</P>
<P>
"I realized that there must be earthquakes hitting some place
not afar," said Wei Dong, a worker with the Kunming
Telecommunication Bureau, "I felt my bed keep shaking."
</P>
<P>
But Wei was not worried, since no extremely strong earthquake
has ever jolted Kunming city. After washing some clothes, Wei lay
on the sofa watching TV, and his calm neighbors discussed the
earthquakes as they greeted each other in the morning.
</P>
<P>
At about six in the morning, an earthquake measuring 5.9 on the
Richter scale struck Yao'an County of Chuxiong Yi Autonomous
Prefecture in this southwestern Province, followed by another
measuring 6.5 about one hour and a half later. Kunming is more
than 100 kilometers away from the damaged area.
</P>
<P>
Many Kunming residents who were asleep at the time were awaked
by the shock waves, and some called the local seismological bureau
or media organizations for confirmed information.
</P>
<P>
So a normal day began with an abnormal beginning. A wedding
ceremony was held as planned in a downtown restaurant. Other local
people swam and played tennis or football at Haigeng, a national
high-altitude sports training base.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan, area comprising four percent of China's territory, is
susceptible to earthquakes. The province has been jolted by 11
earthquakes measuring over 6 on the Richter scale during the past
50 years, with the most violent one measuring 7.7.
</P>
<P>
The capital city of Kunming, however, has been lucky due to its
comparatively more stable geological structure, according to
seismologists.
</P>
<P>
The city, a famous tourist destination, just hosted the '99
World Horticultural Exposition and attracted over nine million
visitors last year.
</P>
<P>
Disaster relief departments in the province were busy sending
the necessary materials to the quake-stricken area, and medical
workers set off early in the morning.
</P>
<P>
Experts at the Provincial Seismological Bureau agree that there
will be no major earthquakes in Kunming in the near future.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Zhang Wannian, vice-chairman of
China's Central Military Commission (CMC), said today that the
military needs to follow Jiang Zemin's speech on fighting
corruption and keeping clean.
</P>
<P>
The military should follow the principle of building the Party
in a strict way and retaining its original nature, Zhang said, at
a meeting of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) on discipline
inspection.
</P>
<P>
This is the guarantee of the Party's absolute leadership over
the PLA, stressed Zhang, who is also member of the Political
Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and of the Secretariat of the
CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Only through anti-corruption efforts can the military increase
its cohesiveness and fighting capabilities, Zhang pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Zhang also noted that the military should step up its education
on ideology and strengthen its confidence in Marxism, communism,
and the great cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
He said that leading PLA officers should be the main target of
anti-corruption efforts, and urged them to improve their internal
self-monitoring mechanism and accept supervision.

<HEADLINE> Sick Giant Panda Out of Danger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The giant panda found semi-
conscious in southwest China's Sichuan Province is now out of
danger thanks to the rescue efforts of the local giant panda
specialists.
</P>
<P>
While watching the female giant panda eating bamboo leaves,
senior veterinarian Tang Chunxiang said that the animal still
needs about six months to completely recover.
</P>
<P>
The giant panda was discovered on the evening of January 12 in
the suburbs of Chengdu, capital city of Sichuan Province, by a
farmer, Zhang Tiancheng, and was taken to the China Giant Panda
Protection and Research Center in Chengdu the following day.
</P>
<P>
The center assigned its most experienced experts with the best
equipment to render emergency treatment, and they noticed many
small fossilized seeds in the animal's feces, the largest nearly
as the size of a table-tennis ball.
</P>
<P>
The giant panda apparently roamed down to an elevation below 1,
100 meters, far from the bamboo forests, and had nothing to eat
but mud and the fossilized fruit seeds.
</P>
<P>
The animal was given transfusions of antibiotics, glucose,
brine, and amino acids at the Center and is now out of danger
after two days of treatment.
</P>
<P>
According to Tang, the giant panda is about 15 or 16 years old,
and has given birth. The weak giant panda was suffering from
malnutrition when she arrived at the Center weighing only 53
kilograms, at least 27 kilograms less than she should be.
</P>
<P>
Tang said the giant panda would have died in the wild in two or
three days if she had not been rescued by the farmer.
</P>
<P>
Giant pandas are one of the world's most endangered species,
and only about 1,000 are known to exist in the wild, most of them
in Sichuan Province.

The stowaways were taken back to China from Nagasaki yesterday.
Most of them from Fujian are between the ages of 17 and 35, and 57
are women. They said they had been detained for three to nine
months before they were repatriated.

<HEADLINE> China's Stock Markets to Hit 13 Trillion Yuan by 2010: Research Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The market value of China's
stock markets will hit 13 trillion yuan and account for 50 percent
of the nation's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 2010, according to
a report released here today by a noted Beijing research institute.
</P>
<P>
A research team headed by Wu Xiaoqiu from the Financial and
Securities Institute of the People's University of China revealed
their predictions for China's capital market in the next 10 years
at a forum held here today.
</P>
<P>
The prediction was based on the assumption that China's GDP
will maintain a nominal growth rate of 10 to 11 percent and an
actual growth rate of seven to eight percent in the next decade.
</P>
<P>
The team also predicted that by 2010, all the stocks of
publicly listed firms in China will be allowed to circulate;
currently, non-circulating stocks held by the state often account
for 60 to 70 percent of the total stocks of China's listed firms.
</P>
<P>
In 10 years, the number of listed firms in China will increase
from the present 1,000-odd to 2,000, while the Composite Stock
Index on the Shanghai Stock Exchange will rise from 1,400 points
to 6,000 points, and the component on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange
from 4,000 points to over 18,000 points.
</P>
<P>
The report predicts that waves of mergers and takeovers in the
securities market will produce five or so international investment
bankers in China, each with assets of 500 billion yuan in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
By then, individual investors with more than 10 billion yuan in
securities assets will also emerge in China, the report said.
</P>
<P>
In 10 years, on-line stock trading will become a transaction
vehicle, greatly changing current practices and leading to the
decay of traditional sales models.
</P>
<P>
Securities investment funds will keep growing in China, and
their market value may account for as high as 25 percent of the
total market value of the stock market by 2010, the report said.
</P>
<P>
In the coming decade, stock index futures and foreign currency
futures will be introduced into China, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
They predicted that China's A-share and B-share markets will
merge in 10 years, and that capital investment in most industries
will be open to foreign investors by then.
</P>
<P>
In 10 years, the rules of the game for China's capital market
will gradually be the same as those for the global market, the
report said, adding that the transparency of the market will
improve remarkably by then.
</P>
<P>
With competition intensifies, the report predicts, the current
wall between securities, insurance, and banking and trusts, will
collapse, both for market participants and for regulators.

<HEADLINE> Syrian Amendments to U.S. Working Document </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The Syrian delegation has
presented amendments and clarifications for the U.S.-drafted
working document during the second round of talks with Israel in
the U.S. early this month.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli daily Ha'aretz on Thursday published the U.S.
document which outlined accords and discords between the Syrian and
Israeli sides in their talks without any reference to those
amendments, said Lebanese daily Al-Safa on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In the amendments, Syria insists on Israel's full withdrawal
from the Golan Heights and back to the June 4, 1967 border line
while removing Israeli settlements from the occupied areas.
</P>
<P>
These two points had already been agreed upon during previous
Syria-Israel peace talks while former Israeli premiers Yitzhak
Rabin and Shimon Peres were in power though the negotiations were
suspended in February 1996, the paper said. But Israel denied the
claim, saying any previous promises are hypothetical and aim to
test what Syria will give in return.
</P>
<P>
Syria stresses that the goal of the current talks is to
demarcate the June 4 border line and then declare it the final
international border between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
While highlighting the unity of the Syrian and Lebanese tracks
in the peace talks with Israel, Syria confirms that the signing of
any peace accord with Israel should go simultaneously with
concluding a peace agreement with Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In this respect, Syria, the power broker in Lebanon, emphasized
on finding a just solution to the issue of Palestinian refugees and
making the Middle East region free of all nuclear weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
Under the Syrian amendments, the U.S., France and a undecided-
yet third country will operate a ground early warning station to be
built on the Golan Heights for five years.
</P>
<P>
And Syria requires a Syrian liaison officer be included in the
staff of the station.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian amendments also stressed that any information got by
U.S. satellites should be delivered simultaneously to Syria and
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the water issue, Syria said that the problem should be
solved in accordance with relevant principles and rules of
international law.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. document emphasized "securing the quantity and quality
of water allocated for Israel from the waters belonging to the
Syrian territories."
</P>
<P>
Observers here said the two sides are still far from reaching
agreement on those long-standing issues which are to be further
discussed in the next round of talks on Wednesday in the U.S., said
the paper.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Calls for Rational Discussion on Charter  Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said Saturday that his decision to temporarily set aside
his proposed economic reforms through charter changes should not
stop the people from pursuing rational debates on the initiative.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the closing ceremonies of the Philippine Millennium
Conference in Clark, the Northern Philippines, Estrada said that
his administration will concentrate first on the passage of
pending priority legislative measures and deal with charter
changes later.
</P>
<P>
"But this should not stop us from talking about it, or debating
rationally about it. I said rationally, not hysterically. It is
hysterics, not reasoned argumentation, that divides our country,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said he has never shelved the charter change proposal,
but has only re-ordered his administration's priorities so that it
can focus on new legislation, policies and organizational reforms
needed to stimulate the economy.
</P>
<P>
"I did stress that my convictions about it had not diminished,
and that my passion to see it through had not cooled," he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that Filipinos, with their passion to
fight for freedom, would apply the same passion in being liberated
from poverty.
</P>
<P>
He said that although the present constitution calls for the
state to initiate measures to free the people from poverty, it,
ironically, contains provisions that prevent the government from
achieving this task.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said his proposed economic reforms in the constitution
do not mean an overhaul but a mere repair of a few provisions of
the charter that impede economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Under the present constitution, foreigners are not allowed to
own land in the Philippines and their shares of investment in some
Philippine industries cannot exceed 40 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said rational debates that focus on the merits and
reasoned counter-arguments about the charter changes should
continue while the Congress tackles the priority measures needed
to sustain the country's economic growth.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania will hold its
second multi-party general elections on October 29 this year, the
National Electoral Commission (NEC) has said.
</P>
<P>
According to a timetable issued by the commission Friday, the
registration of voters will be conducted between August 1 and 21
while nomination of contestants will be made on August 13, and
election campaigns between August 14 and October 28.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first time in the country's post-independence
history for presidential, parliamentary and civic elections to be
held simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
At least 13 fully registered political parties are expected to
start before May the primary elections, which are likely to be
dominated by the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM), or the
Revolutionary Party of Tanzania, at least on the mainland.
</P>
<P>
President Benjamin William Mkapa, who won the 1995 elections,
is expected to run for his second five-year term.
</P>
<P>
Other fully registered political parties are the Civic United
Front (CUF) , which is the main opposition party in Zanzibar, the
National Convention for Construction and Reform (NCCR-Mageuzi),
United Democratic Party (UDP), Chama Cha Demokrasia na Maendeleo
(CHADEMA), Union for Multi-party Democracy (UMD) and Tanzania
People's Party (TPP).
</P>
<P>
Others are the National League for Democracy (NLD), National
Reconstruction Alliance (NRA), Tanzania Democratic Alliance
(TADEA), Tanzania Labor Party (TLP), Popular National Party (PONA)
and United People' s Democratic Party (UPDP).
</P>
<P>
The United Democratic Party has already nominated its national
chairman, John Momose Cheyo, as presidential candidate, while
other parties have not clearly declared their candidacy in the
forthcoming elections.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania had a single political party, the CCM, from 1965 until
1992 when the multi-party system was introduced.

CANBERRA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- South Korea delivered on

<P>
Striker Seol Ki-Hyeon put the visitors ahead with a 14th-minute
shot, which capped an excellent tournament for him, with scores in
all three matches.

when Korean forward Lee Kwan-Woo seized on the ball and beat
several defenders for a brilliant left-foot goal.
</P>
<P>
South Korea did not relax at all as Lee Dong Gook made it 3-0
with his second goal of the tournament from a fierce right-foot
volley in injury time.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll of Trapped Miners Increases to 11 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Underground collapses prevented
rescuers from reaching trapped coal miners through channels they
had dug, and four more trapped miners died, increasing the death
toll to 11 at press time.
</P>
<P>
All the rescuers returned to safe sections as a precaution
against further collapses.
</P>
<P>
The Dahuangshan Coal Mine in Xuzhou City, east China's Jiangsu
Province, was inundated by underground water on January 11,
trapping sixty-three workers at two work sites, 400 and 500 meters
underground. Twenty-three of them were rescued the following day.
</P>
<P>
There are still 29 people trapped, and at present their fate is
unknown. These miners have been underground for more than 100
hours, and have managed to keep in touch with rescuers by knocking
on the steel tubes, but the knocking is much weaker now.
</P>
<P>
Rescue teams have tried to dig two channels in order to get
close to the miners, but continual cave-ins have hampered rescue
operations in the old and worn mine which dates back to 1958.
</P>
<P>
New emergency rescue plans are being discussed at this hour.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Continues Tight Control of Firecracker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Beijing will continue its tight
control of firecrackers during the traditional Chinese Spring
Festival which falls on February 5 this year.
</P>
<P>
Ren Dianhua, who is in charge of this matter, said today that
the city will intensify the control this year, and those violating
the regulations will be punished.
</P>
<P>
Data obtained on the Lunar New Year last year showed that the
noise level in the outskirts of the city was 65.2 decibels on
average, 10.2 decibels higher than that set by the local
government. Some 215 people were injured, five lost their eyesight,
two received fractures, and one required amputation, in
firecracker-related incidents in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Cases of illegal production and transportation of firecrackers
also increased last year, as public security departments
discovered 17 such cases in December 1999.
</P>
<P>
During last year's Spring Festival, many local residents called
related governmental offices, complaining about the noise and air
pollution, and asking for stricter enforcement of the regulations.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Municipal People's Government first banned the use
of firecrackers in the city during the Spring Festival on December
1, 1993.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The State Council, China's
highest governing body, today sent a message expressing its deep
concern and sincere solicitude for the quake victims in Yao'an
County in southwest China's Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
The State Council also expressed heartfelt thanks for those who
are working there to help the quake victims, including the local
officials and people, medical teams, and soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The message expressed the hope that the local residents will
rely on themselves, unite as one, and work hard to keep losses to
a minimum, and restore production and rebuild their homes as soon
as possible.
</P>
<P>
The State Council is confident that the people in the quake-
stricken area will, under the leadership of the local government
and Party Committee and with the help of soldiers stationed there,
surely overcome all the difficulties caused by the tremors.
</P>
<P>
According to China Seismological Bureau, earthquakes measuring
5.9 and 6.5 on the Richter scale rocked Yao'an County of Chuxiong
Yi Autonomous Prefecture at 06:09 and 07:37 today. The epicenter
was located at 25.5 degrees north latitude and 101.1 degrees east
longitude.
</P>
<P>
At press time, the quakes had claimed four lives and injured
more than 370.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan is prone to earthquakes and in the past 50 years since
the founding of New China, it was hit by 11 earthquakes measuring
over 6 on the Tichter scale, and the strongest measuring 7.7 on

<HEADLINE> China to Intensify Inspection of French Meat Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The State Administration for
Entry-Exit Inspection and Quarantine has issued a notice saying
that China will either destroy or return French meat products
containing List bacilli.
</P>
<P>
Officials in the administration said that the bacilli can
destroy the eyesight of those infected, and may cause coma or even
death. They added that patients with serious illnesses, old
people, and pregnant women, are especially susceptible to the
infection.
</P>
<P>
Many specialists, however, say people do not need to worry too
much, as List bacilli can only live half an hour at 55 degrees
Celsius, and will die within 40 seconds at a temperature of 85
degrees.
</P>
<P>
Also, only a small quantity of French meat products such as
pork products are imported to China.
</P>
<P>
French public health departments reported on January 7 that
nine people had been infected with the bacilli, and two had died
from the infection.

<HEADLINE> HK Launches Publicity Campaign for Retirement Schemes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Saturday launched
an education and publicity campaign for the promotion of the
Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) Schemes aimed at providing a formal
system of retirement protection.
</P>
<P>
The MPF would provide for retirement protection for the three-
million strong workforce in Hong Kong, said Lee Yeh-kwong,
chairman of the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority (MPFA)
at the launching ceremony.
</P>
<P>
In the coming months, a series of education and publicity
programs will be unfolded on television, radio stations, in the
print media, as well as over the Internet, said a spokesman for
the MPFA.
</P>
<P>
The MPF schemes, which cover members of the workforce aged 18
or above, require employees to contribute 5 percent of their
monthly salaries and their employers the same amount. All
contributions will be entrusted to privately managed trustees
approved by the MPFA for administration and investment.
</P>
<P>
Employees earning less than 4,000 HK dollars (512.8 U.S.
dollars) per month need not contribute. However, their employers
will still have to contribute 5 percent. For those earning more
than 20,000 HK dollars (2,564 U.S. dollars) a month, the upper
limit of contribution is 1,000 HK dollars (128 U.S. dollars) for
both employers and employees.
</P>
<P>
The schemes are scheduled to be ready for operation by the end
of 2000.
</P>
<P>
As regulator for this scheme, the MPFA has set down stringent
criteria to ensure that contributions from employees and employers
are in good hands.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has a rapidly aging population. People aged 65 and
above currently account for about one-tenth of the population.
This proportion is estimated to increase to 13 percent by 2006,
and to 20 percent by 2036.

<HEADLINE> China Provides Consultation Services For Consumers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Consultations for home
decoration services sponsored by the China National Consumers
Association (CNCA) are now underway in Beijing and the capitals of
all provinces in China.
</P>
<P>
These meetings held today in furniture and building materials
shops are the first in a series of "transparent consumption"
consultations that will be available in a number of fields. They
are taking place at one central office and six branches in Beijing,
with other branches in each capital city.
</P>
<P>
Along with the flourishing of the real estate market, home
decorating has become a rapidly growing market in the country.
</P>
<P>
In these consultations, specialists provide guidance on the
selection of materials and the prevention of problems that may
arise in the course of home decorating, as well as proper
procedures for choosing a decorating company and signing contracts.
</P>
<P>
Yang Shukun, the secretary-general of the CNCA, said that the
purpose of the consultations is to secure the consumer's right to
know.
</P>
<P>
He also said that CNCA will launch a series of such activities
to stimulate domestic demand. The association expects to provide
more information services instead of simply receiving consumer
complaints.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria, Ghana to Be Linked by Rail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria and Ghana had made plan
to link their rail system, according to Nigerian Minister of
Integration and Cooperation in Africa, Jerry Gana.
</P>
<P>
The direct link is expected to boost transnational economic
activities not just between the two countries but in the west
Africa sub-region as well, the Guardian newspaper Saturday quoted
the minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
The plan is a strategic component of a five-point program to
establish a second monetary zone apart from the West African Franc
area or CFA zone, Gana said.
</P>
<P>
The proposed second monetary zone, in which Nigeria and Ghana
are expected to play key roles, will eventually merge with the
existing CFA zone to form a single currency region in west Africa,
said the minister.
</P>
<P>
The line construction of the linked rail between the two
countries would begin as soon as possible in a bid to provide a
facility to enhance free and unimpeded movement of people, goods
and services among some member states of the Economic Community of
West African States (ECOWAS), he said.
</P>
<P>
Gana also disclosed that a technical committee of officials
from Nigeria and Ghana will meet in Abuja Monday to discuss the
ways for stepping up the implementation of ECOWAS integration
programs as decided upon at the organization's 22nd summit in
Togolese capital Lome last December.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo had called on the ECOWAS
countries including Ghana to adopt a "fast track" in regional
integration.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Foreign Minister Leaves for Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan left here on Saturday morning for Mozambique to continue
his five-nation African tour.
</P>
<P>
During his three-day official visit to Zimbabwe, Tang Jiaxuan
met with Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe Friday, discussing
bilateral relations and international issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said both Zimbabwe and China have enjoyed traditional
friendship and cooperation, which will be constantly consolidated
and developed and will continue to benefit the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
Tang, who arrived here Thursday, also held talks with his
Zimbabwean counterpart Stan Mudenge and signed an agreement on
establishing a political consultation mechanism between the
foreign ministries of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, the high-level officials of the two
 countries will hold regular meetings on issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mudenge reaffirmed Zimbabwe's unswerving commitment
to the "One China" policy.
</P>
<P>
"This is a bedrock of our relations with the People's Republic
of China," the minister at a reception in honor of Tang on Friday
evening.
</P>
<P>
Mudenge, who witnessed the return of Hong Kong and Macau to
China, praised China's "One Country, Two Systems" policy.
</P>
<P>
"I look forward to the final fulfillment of this policy when
the province of Taiwan also embraces the motherland," he said.
</P>
<P>
Seeing the Chinese minister off at the Harare International
Airport were Mudenge and some other Zimbabwean officials, and
Chinese Ambassador to Zimbabwe Huang Guifang.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian House Threatens to Indict Executive Over Rising Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 15 (Xinhua) -- A motion to indict Nigerian
federal executive over its inability to halt the rising wave of
violence in the country is in the works, a senior member of the
Nigerian House of Representatives has said.
</P>
<P>
The motion would be moved when the House resumes sitting next
week, Uche Maduako, Chairman of the House Committee on
Information, said in Abuja Friday.
</P>
<P>
He urged Nigerians to disregard Thursday's statement by
Vice-President Atiku Abubakar holding the legislators responsible
for governments inability to attract foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Describing the allegation unfortunate, Maduako upbraided the
government for failing to properly address the upsurge in violent
activities in several parts of the most populous African country.
</P>
<P>
The rising violence was the main reason for the unimpressive
response of foreign investors to the country's calls, the Guardian
newspaper Saturday quoted Maduako as saying.
</P>
<P>
The senior House member also faulted Atiku's claim that the
National Assembly should be responsible for the delays in passing
the urgently- needed bills of Appropriation, Anti-Corruption, and
etc.
</P>
<P>
In spite of many constraints, the representatives had concluded
work on two of the bills, namely Anti-Corruption and Niger Delta
Development Commission, Maduako noted.
</P>
<P>
Reiterating the Assembly's resolve to rebuff any form of
intimidation, he advised the executive to stop indulging in
buck-passing for failure to discharge its constitutional
responsibility of ensuring peace in the west African country.

<HEADLINE> Allied Forces in Congo Release 8 Rwandan POWs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The Allied Forces in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) have released eight
prisoners of war (POWs) to the International Red Cross Society on
health grounds, the Herald newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
All eight from Rwanda were immediately repatriated to their
home country Friday by the International Red Cross Society.
</P>
<P>
Their release leaves the number of POWs being held by the
Allied Forces at Kinshasa's N'djili Airport at 87.
</P>
<P>
The release marked the start of the prisoner-exchange process,
DRC Minister of Human Rights Leonard Okitunda said at the
hand-over ceremony at N'djili International Airport Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Lusaka peace accord signed by all the parties
directly involved in the DRC conflict, "we must exchange prisoners
of war in accordance with the Geneva Convention," the minister
said.
</P>
<P>
"This is just the beginning of the process which will continue
among countries involved in the DRC conflict," he added.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia sent troops to prop up the
government of DRC President Laurent Kabila in August 1998
immediately after the Tutsi-led rebels took up arms against
Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda and Uganda have been accused of backing the DRC rebels,
though both denied the accusations.

<HEADLINE> Official: Blatter still Backs S.Africa World Cup Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 15 (Xinhua) -- FIFA president Sepp
Blatter was still on the side of South Africa in the bid campaign
for 2006 World Cup finals, a top official said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Danny Jordaan, chief executive officer of the South Africa 2006
World Cup Bid Committee, said he believed Blatter was still
backing South Africa despite his assertion in Rio de Janeiro on
Thursday that he was taking a neutral stance in the bid race.
</P>
<P>
"I still believe wholeheartedly that we have Mr Blatter's
support and that we will win the bid for 2006," said Jordaan. "Any
doubt about his attitude to African soccer will be dispelled by
his address to the Confederation of African Football's congress in
Accra next Thursday."
</P>
<P>
Blatter has previously publicly backed South Africa in the bid
race against the other four bidding countries including Brazil,
England, Germany and Morocco.
</P>
<P>
Jordaan also said England had suffered a public relations
disaster following Manchester United's poor performance at the
World Club Championships, thinking that English officials were
trying to deflect attention by highlighting an alleged change in
Blatter's position.
</P>
<P>
This was a reply to the statement by Bobby Charlton who said in
Rio on Thursday the World Cup risked disaster if given to a
country not capable of handling a 32-team event and highlighted
persistent security concerns in South Africa.

VIENNA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Corinne Rey-Bellet of
Switzerland edged Germans Regina Haeusl and Martina Ertl with a
time of one minute 34.47 seconds to clinch her first win of the
season in a World Cup downhill at Altenmarkt, Austria on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Haeusl was 0.02 seconds in front of Rey-Bellet after the
gliding upper section but lost time in the technical middle
section to cross the finish line in 1:34.62. Ertl posted 1:35.11.
</P>
<P>
Rey-Bellet, who last winter won a downhill and super-G staged
on the same day in the Austrian resort of St Anton, is also the
second Swiss woman to win a race this winter after Sonja Nef took
the opening giant slalom in October.
</P>
<P>
Downhill World Cup leader Isolde Kostner of Italy finished with
a disappointing time of 1:35.98 as Austria's overall World Cup
leader Michaela Dorfmeister also had a poor showing with 1:35.82.
</P>
<P>
Dorfmeister, a former speed specialist who has stunned her
rivals with four giant slalom triumphs this season, has been

<HEADLINE> UAE to Raise Oil, Gas Production in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE)
will increase its oil production capacity to around 3 million
barrels per day (bpd) this year, with further plans to boost that
level to 3.6 million bpds in 2005 and 4 million bpds in 2010.
</P>
<P>
However, the country's oil production is limited by quotas
agreed within the framework of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) to 2 million bpds, according to the UAE
Yearbook 1999.
</P>
<P>
The country's gas production is being expanded to meet a
forecast doubled demand of 3.7 billion cubic feet (about 110
million cubic meters) per day this year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The UAE exports 62 percent of its crude oil to Japan, making it
the Gulf country's largest customer. The UAE also supplies almost
one-eighth of Japan's total needs of liquefied gas, according to
the report.
</P>
<P>
Oil and gas production will remain a major revenue earner for
the UAE long into the future, the report added.
</P>
<P>
The country's proven oil reserves are currently placed at 98.2
billion barrels, or 9.5 percent of the world total. Proven
recoverable reserves of natural gas are estimated at 5.8 billion
cubic meters, or 4 percent of the world total.
</P>
<P>
Due to the rise in world oil prices, the UAE's gross domestic
product (GDP) is expected to rise by about 8 percent in 1999 to an
estimated 184 billion dirhams (about 50.1 billion U.S. dollars),
among which oil accounts for 47.5 billion dirhams (about 12.9
billion dollars).

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Cambodia Vows to End Deforestation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Facing the rampant illegal
logging and timber trafficking, the Cambodian government vows to
take even sterner measures to crack down on the illegal activities.
</P>
<P>
At a two-day National workshop on "Strengthening Forest Crime
Monitoring and Reporting" held here on Thursday and Friday, Prime
Minister Hun Sen vowed to put an end to illegal timber cutting. "
If I cannot put an end to the illegal cutting of trees, I will
resign from my position of prime minister in the first quarter of
2001," Hun Sen said.
</P>
<P>
He also assigned a special investigating team to probe local
government, police and military officials accused of involvement
in the business.
</P>
<P>
"Those who illegally cut the trees are the traitors who want to
destroy the government," Hun Sen pointed out, warning "Anybody,
regardless of his position and status, will be punished if he is
involved in deforestation."
</P>
<P>
According to Forestry Minister Chhea Song, larger-scale illegal
forest activities such as logging and transportation of such
forest products are, in general, under strict control. However,
smaller-scale illegalities still exist.
</P>
<P>
The latest case of illegal logging is in the northeastern
province of Mondulkiri where the governor collaborated with the
smugglers by using the armed forces to cut trees illegally and
export at least 380 trucks of timber to Vietnam. Hun Sen has
already summoned Vietnam's ambassador here to discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
Donor countries and agencies, threatening to stop aid, called
for an immediate halt to all logging and for the cancellation of
more than half of the existing logging contracts.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, environmentalists warned that the forests
will be"logged out" within five to seven years if the government
does not take serious measures to stop the illegal logging.
</P>
<P>
The percentage of Cambodian land covered by forest has been
reduced sharply in the past 30 years, with only 10 million
hectares of forest being left.
</P>
<P>
At the seminar, the participants including donor
representatives made useful recommendations and forged common
strategies in order to effectively eradicate all kinds of illegal
activities in the forestry sector and finally result in
sustainable forest management.
</P>
<P>
The meeting called for the closest cooperation between
technical institutions, local authorities, Royal armed forces,
police,international organizations and NGOs in successfully
cracking down on all types of forest crime throughout the country.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Allows No Outside Interference in Its Affairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia said Saturday it
has the right to administer its own laws without the help of
international bodies.
</P>
<P>
"I think the international community must respect that Malaysia
is exercising its rights, its own laws," Foreign Minister Syed
Hamid Albar said here in reaction to a report that the
international human rights group, Amnesty International, has
expressed concern over the arrest and charge of several members of
the opposition in the country.
</P>
<P>
Amnesty International reportedly said in a statement issued
late Friday that it "....expressed grave concern at the Malaysian
government's renewed use of restrictive laws, including the
Sedition Act and the Official Secrets Act."
</P>
<P>
Syed Hamid said that every country has its own domestic laws
and the persons involved were charged under the Sedition Act and
the Official Secrets Act (OSA), and not detained under the
Internal Security Act (ISA).
</P>
<P>
"They are brought to open court. It is up to them to defend
themselves," the foreign minister told reporters at a function at
his office here.
</P>
<P>
Three opposition party leaders were arrested earlier this week
and charged Friday in separate Sessions Courts with Democratic
Action Party (DAP) Deputy Chairman and lawyer Karpal Singh and
National Justice Party (Keadilan) Vice President Marina Yusoff
charged under Sedition Act, while Keadilan Youth Chief Mohamed
Ezam Mohamed Noor under the OSA.
</P>
<P>
All the three pleaded not guilty to the charges and were
released on bail.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said it was up to the courts now to
determine whether they were guilty or not.
</P>
<P>
"If we do not administer our law, then we will be opening up
ourselves to all sorts of abuses of the law. Now, when we take
action according to the law, people should not question us," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Oil Prices Reach Nine-Year High in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Oil prices Friday climbed 5
percent higher to a new nine-year high Friday in the U.S. market,
topping 28 U.S. dollars a barrel for the first time since 1991,
according to reports reaching here late in the day.
</P>
<P>
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil climbed as high
as 28.10 dollars a barrel, the highest since January 16, 1991, one
day before the U.S.-led military strikes on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Intermediate crude oil for February delivery settled up 1.33
dollars at 28.02 dollars a barrel -- jumping 16 percent for the
week and surpassing the previous nine-year high reached in
November.
</P>
<P>
February heating oil rose 4.53 cents to 73.81 cents a gallon.
February unleaded gasoline rose 3.25 cents to 74.52 cents a gallon,
and February natural gas rose 7 cents to 2.322 dollars per 1,000
cubic feet.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts believe the gain came after the Organization of
the Petroleum Exporting Countries removed virtually all doubt it
will extend its agreement on lowered production for several more
months.
</P>
<P>
Frigid weather in the northeastern United States also
contributed to a sharp rise in crude oil as well as gasoline,
heating oil and natural gas futures.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts predict that sharply rising fuel expenses and the
potential for costly labor contracts have raised new speculation
that airlines may soon introduce another fare hike to try to keep
profits from falling.
</P>
<P>
Others, however, said airlines will be cautious about applying
any across-the-board increase immediately when they're still
trying to recover business lost to Y2K jitters and other reasons.

<HEADLINE> 758 Hopefuls Denied Candidacy for Polls in Iran  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Iran's conservative-dominated
supervisory boards disqualified 758 hopefuls, including 162 in
Tehran province, from running in the parliamentary election next
month, local newspaper Iran Daily reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Quoting a report from the elections headquarters at the Interior
Ministry, the daily said that out of the total 758 entrants, 402
were disqualified by the executive boards assigned by the Interior
Ministry at the first stage.
</P>
<P>
Nine incumbent Majlis (parliament) deputies are also among those
disqualified, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The supervisory boards dropped those hopefuls' candidacy under
the election law article relating to candidates' faith and
practical commitment to Islam and Islamic system, and their
organizational status as for membership in political parties or
unlawful camps.
</P>
<P>
A total of 6,860 people have registered to run in the sensitive
parliamentary polling slated for February 18, and 6,459 have got
their candidacy approved.
</P>
<P>
Iran's moderate camp, the main supporters of the reformist
policies advocated by President Mohammad Khatami, lodged protest to
the supervisory boards' decision and accused them of practicing
partiality while screening candidacy.
</P>
<P>
Moderate dailies reported earlier that at least 69 pro-reformist
hopefuls in Tehran constituency, mainly pro-reformist journalists,
clerics, were disqualified.
</P>
<P>
However, the conservatives, who dominate most of the country's
state organs, have refuted the accusation by claiming that most of
the disqualified are from illegal political parties, such as the
opposition Freedom Movement of Iran and the Nationalist Front.
</P>
<P>
Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei also turned down
the complaints by the moderates and called on moderates and
conservatives to solve their disputes according to laws.
</P>
<P>
The two camps have pinned their hope on the coming parliamentary
polling for a change in power balance in the country.
</P>
<P>
The moderates hope to win a majority in the legislature to pave
the way for Khatami's political reforms.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Cracks Down on Quacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 15 (Xinhua) -- A total of 412 illegal clinics,
 laboratories and pharmacies have been closed since a crackdown on
illegal health facilities began three months ago, the East African
Standard newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The government was taking any possible measures to kick quacks
out of the health sector, Minister for Public Health Sam Ongeri
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Some facilities had become a health hazard and could not be
allowed to continue operating, Minister for Medical Service Amukoa
Anangwe also said.
</P>
<P>
Uncontrolled mushrooming of health institutions had led to the
decline in the standards of health care services in the country,
Anangwe said.
</P>
<P>
Unqualified clinics were once rampant in the east African
country, which disrupted the normal performance of the sector.

<HEADLINE> Site of Yuanmou Homo Erectus Survived Yunnan Earthquakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The site of Yuanmou Homo
Erectus, China's oldest fossil man dating back to some 1.7 million
years ago, in Yunnan Province has survived this morning's strong
earthquakes and remained intact.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, the site of the earliest fossil man
was only 50 km away from the epicenter in Yao'an of Chuxiong Yi
Autonomous Prefecture in southwest China.
</P>
<P>
The earthquakes measuring 6.0 and 6.5 on the Richter scale hit
Yao'an at 6:09 and 07:37 and killed three, injured 34 and damaged
some 400 houses.
</P>
<P>
The Yuanmou county government has sent people to check the
relics as soon as the quake was felt, and got the report that no
damage was made there.
</P>
<P>
Chinese archeologists discovered in 1965 the world's oldest
fossils of advanced primates in Yuanmou county. It is one of the
most important evidences to study the origin of human beings. The
site has been developed into a tourist destination.

<HEADLINE> UAE to Host Anti-Drug Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE)
will host an international anti-drug meeting to discuss ways of
dealing with drug smuggling.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting, to be held in Dubai on Monday, was
organized by the UAE Interior Ministry in cooperation with the
United Nations International Organization for Narcotics Control,
the Gulf News daily reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the UAE, the U.N., Britain, Germany, India,
Iran, Turkey and the U.S. will attend the meeting, which will seek
means to handle chemical drugs and curb drug smuggling, said Lt.
Col. Abdullah Rashid Al Bedeiwi, director of the Interior
Ministry's Anti-Narcotics Department.
</P>
<P>
The UAE was chosen as the venue for the meeting because the
government is keen on attending international conferences to update
its expertise in fighting drug-related crimes as the country is
increasingly being targeted by drug dealers, said the official.
</P>
<P>
The Gulf region is viewed as a lucrative market for drug agents
because the purchasing power of consumers here is somewhat higher
than that of other markets, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Gulf states also lie close to regions where drugs are grown,
and their long coastlines make them more vulnerable to the dangers
of drugs, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
In the UAE, the police have seized 23 tons of hashish and 590
kilograms of heroin, 400 kilograms of opium, and 8 million tablets
of various types of drugs over the past five years, accounting for
only 20 percent of the total smuggled into local markets.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Stands Alert to Australian Flu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait is taking
precautionary measures against the dangerous Australian flu by
vaccinating people, although no cases have been discovered here so
far.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has imported a total of 12,000 vials of vaccine and 4,000
vials have already been used against the disease, said Dr. Musab
Al-Saleh, head of the Health Education Department.
</P>
<P>
The vital flu, which has swept the United States, Europe and
many other countries over the past two weeks, has left millions of
people seriously ill to the extent that it has reached an epidemic
stage.
</P>
<P>
In Britain, most hospitals were said to have been filled with
flu patients and officials said one in every 500 Britons is
infected with the disease.
</P>
<P>
"The Ministry of Health has taken all precautions in case the
disease hits Kuwait," and sections vulnerable to the disease are
vaccinated at least once a year, local English daily Arab Times on
Saturday quoted the official as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that the flu is considered as a serious risk because it
may cause serious complications especially to people suffering from
diseases of heart, blood and dietetic cancer.
</P>
<P>
He advised people to take precautions to ward off the disease by
avoiding extreme weather changes, closed places without proper
ventilation and staying three meters away from flu carriers.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Spends $27.2M in Demining Annually </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique is spending an
average of 27.2 million U.S. dollars a year, the Mozambican
National Demining Institute has said.
</P>
<P>
Institute director Artur Verissimo said that since 1995 when
organized mine clearance began, 136 million dollars has been
spent.
</P>
<P>
According to Verissimo, 7,733 kilometers of roads and 1,829
kilometers of electricity transmission lines have been cleared of
mines since 1995.
</P>
<P>
Mines have also been removed from 40,528 hectares of land, in
much favor of population resettlement, agriculture and livestock.
</P>
<P>
So far, 56,176 anti-personnel and anti-group mines and 456
anti-tank mines have been destroyed, the Mozambique News Agency
quoted the demining official as saying.
</P>
<P>
In addition, demining teams have removed 30,432 other explosive
devices, such as bombs, artillery shells, rockets and grenades,
and 446,333 small calibre munitions.
</P>
<P>
However, even one or two mines in a potentially fertile area
can dissuade peasants from farming.
</P>
<P>
The conventional figure of two million mines planted in
Mozambique has been widely challenged. But even if there are tens
of thousands mines, removing them could take many years.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican National Demining Institute has four projects
awaiting funding. They are budgeted at 11.1 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The institute also intends to increase its presence by opening
offices in northern province of Nampula and the central province
of Manica to speed up the demining process.
</P>
<P>
The land mines are mostly the legacy of the civil war which
ended in early 1990s. But some were planted earlier, dating from
the 1960s and early 1970s, when the war for independence from
Portuguese colonial rule was raging.

<HEADLINE> India Cuts Interest on Small Savings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government has
reduced interest rates on small savings schemes and the government-
run Public Provident Fund (PPF) to 11 percent from the previous 12
percent, the local press reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The interest cut, which was announced by the Indian Finance
Ministry on Friday evening and took effect Saturday, was aimed at
containing the robust growth in small savings collections in the
past year and reducing the interest burden of the government, The
Financial Express said.
</P>
<P>
Indian banks and post offices have temporarily suspended the
acceptance of fresh deposits under the PPF and all small savings
schemes due to this interest change, added the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
According to the Hindustan Times, the interest rate on post
office deposits following the cut will be 8 percent for one year,
9 percent for two years, 10 percent for three years and 10.5
percent for five years. The return on post office recurring
deposit has also been reduced to 10.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Describing the interest cut as a "sudden decision" of the
government, the newspaper said the decision has reinforced the
local industry's efforts in seeking a reduction in the bank
lending rates.
</P>
<P>
On January 1, 1999, the Indian government, in an attempt to
ease its fiscal problems, made a major interest rate cut on a host
of small savings, income and time deposit schemes managed by post
offices However, deposits under the PPF and small savings schemes
have continued to grow.
</P>
<P>
Financial analysts say many Indians prefer the PPF and other
government-run savings schemes because their yields are higher
than those of other investment avenues and their interest was also
tax-free.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that small savings collections in India between
April and October 1999 totaled 157.72 billion rupees (3.67 billion
U.S. dollars), up by more than 15 percent over the same period of
the previous fiscal year.

MANILA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
Saturday warned public servants against using government vehicles
for personal purposes and announced some measures to tackle the
problem.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said in a radio interview
here that measures against abuse in the use of official cars
include strict issuance of security plates and limiting the
gasoline supply of government vehicles.
</P>
<P>
"We have bee very restrictive about the issuance of security
plates. Very few people are issued security plates," Zamora said,
adding that law enforcers are now cracking down on those using
fake plates.
</P>
<P>
He said that each government office is now held responsible for
the use of official vehicles, having been instructed to restrict
travel authority and issuance of trip tickets.
</P>
<P>
But he admitted that lack of funds has prevented the government
from hiring people to keep watch over abuses in the use of
official cars and it relies more on "honesty" and "good faith."
</P>
<P>
The government has estimated the amount of gasoline each
official vehicle uses, and public servants found going beyond the
limit lose their privilege, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I think each vehicle is allowed about 10 to 20 liters a day,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Zamora issued the reminder after receiving reports that some
government vehicles are being used outside official route and the
passengers are not officials but their children.

BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- China will retrain farmers and
build up rural labor markets as early as next year, according to "
China Daily".
</P>
<P>
In co-operation with other ministries, we will take new
measures to create employment opportunities for surplus rural
workers," said Lin Yongsan, vice minister of the Ministry of Labor
and Social Security at a social welfare seminar held in Beijing
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Some of these measures may be written into the next Five Year
Plan (2001-1005), the English newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that China now has 490 million potential
workers in rural areas but only 200 million jobs for them.
</P>
<P>
The ministry should strengthen training efforts in rural areas
to help more farmers diversify their skills and make them more
employable, Lin said.
</P>
<P>
The training plan is expected to cover all rural laborers who
have finished high school or worked part-time in cities.
</P>
<P>
"The retraining has proven the most efficient way to make
farmers upgrade their knowledge and skills to compete in the
employment market," Lin said.
</P>
<P>
In co-operation with Ministry of Agriculture, Lin's ministry
would also accelerate the development of rural enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"We want to shape uniform, open and competitive rural labor
markets nationwide," the official added.

ISLAMABAD, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan is expecting to
harvest 2 million tons more of wheat which will help lowering the
import bill by 300 million U.S. dollars during the year 2000.

following a 15-percent overall increase after support price rose
to 300 rupees per 40 kilograms, the local press Saturday quoted

Every year, Pakistan needs 20 million to 21 million tons of
wheat to meet its own needs, provide 600,000 tons to Afghanistan
and store 1 million tons in order to pre-empt its storage due to
smuggling.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Weapon-Grade Plutonium Arrives in Canada  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Fuel samples from the U.S.
weapon-grade plutonium arrived in Canada safely Friday, the Atomic
Energy of Canada said.
</P>
<P>
"The shipment arrived safely by air transport and everything
went according to plan," the agency's spokesman Larry Shewchuk
said.
</P>
<P>
The shipment of the so-called "mixed oxide fuel" (MOX) was
first moved out of New Mexico by truck and later flown by
helicopter to the agency's labs at Chalk River, Ontario.
</P>
<P>
MOX contains 3 percent of plutonium, which Canadian scientists
said could be modified into uranium as fuel for the country's
CANDU reactors.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy has said that there
are no plans for large shipments of plutonium to be brought in
from the United States.
</P>
<P>
"The only commitment we have made is to undertake certain tests
of very small, minute portions to determine the feasibility," he
told parliament last November.
</P>
<P>
Local media reports earlier said that the country, in a
disarmament bid, wants to help the United States and Russia burn
up to 100 tons of plutonium from 40,000 surplus nuclear bombs in
25 years.
</P>
<P>
If a three-year test is successful, Canada could take more
excess military plutonium from Russia, the reports said.

<HEADLINE> Internet Giant Cuban Closer to Mavericks Ownership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The sale of the Dallas
Mavericks need only to be approved by the NBA' Board of Governors
after BroadCast.com co-founder Mark Cuban on Friday signed a
definitive agreement to acquire a controlling interest.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Cuban reached a preliminary agreement to
buy a majority share of the Mavericks for a reported 280 million U.
S. dollars. The Hillwood Development Corporation, led by Ross
Perot Jr., will retain a minority share of the team following
completion of the proposed transaction.
</P>
<P>
"Hillwood and Mark Cuban have signed a definitive agreement for
the sale of the controlling interest in the Dallas Mavericks,"
Hillwood CEO Rick Patterson said. "The saile will be completed
upon formal approval by the National Basketball Association."
</P>
<P>
Cuban already has imposed himself upon the Mavericks, meeting
with team president Terdema Ussery and coach and general manager
Don Nelson. After meeting with Cuban, Nelson announced he would
not coach the team next season and neither would his son, Donn,
who was being groomed as his successor.
</P>
<P>
Since Cuban's arrival, the Mavericks also have entertained the
idea of possibly signing flaky forward Dennis Rodman.
</P>
<P>
Any sale is subject to approval by the NBA Board of Governors.
It is expected to be completed in March or April.
</P>
<P>
The deal also includes the sale of a portion of Hillwood's
interest in the American Airlines Center, which is expected to
open in the fall of 2001. Hillwood will continue to lead the
development and construction of facility.
</P>
<P>
The sale of the Mavericks reportedly will not affect the
development around the arena, consisting of office buildings,
retailing, residential units and an entertainment district.
</P>
<P>
Perot's broad-based ownership group purchased 55 percent of the
Mavericks on May 1, 1996 for 125 million U.S. dollars. During his
term as owner, the team has traded superstar Jason Kidd and hired
Nelson as general manager.
</P>
<P>
The Mavs have not had a winning season since 1989-90, going 218-
529 since. They are fifth in the Midwest Division with an 11-24
record.
</P>
<P>
The New Jersey Nets were sold for an NBA-recird 227 million U.S.
dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
A native of Pittsburgh, Cuban became one of the country's
richest people last year when Yahoo, a California Internet company,
bought the 4-year-old BroadCast.com for a reported six billion U.S.
dollars.

Arie said the council had not set a medal target but the team
should improve on the one gold, one silver and two bronzes which
won in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that we can achieve more than four years ago. I won't
speak of the amount of medals targeted in this event, it will be
decided at the end of the training preparation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Except for a silver medal in archery in 1988, all of Indonesia'
s Olympic medals have been from badminton, which made its debut at
the Olympics in 1992.
</P>
<P>
With 41 athletes competing in 11 sports in the Atlanta Olympics,
Indonesia finished 41st in the medal standings, down from a 25th
finish in Barcelona in 1992, when Indonesian shuttlers won two
golds, two silvers and a bronze.
</P>
<P>
"We hope badminton can earn more golds than it got in Atlanta.
But we expect more medals from the other sports, like
weightlifting and windsurfing," Arie added.

CANBERRA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Sweden's Magnus Norman
overcame a shaky start to beat American Michael Changwin and win
the Auckland Open tennis tournament on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Norman won over Chang 3-6, 6-3, 7-5 in a game that appeared to
remain wide open until the final match point was secured.
</P>
<P>
Norman, ranked 15th in the ATP tour at the end of 1999,
conceded just one set in his five matches in the tournament. The
first set of the final was marred by five double faults from the
normally accurate Swede.
</P>
<P>
He came back strongly to take the third set with authoritative

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Japanese PM's Southeast Asia Tour Improves Ties  by Yuan Li </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi left here Saturday morning for Tokyo, concluding his six-
day visit to Cambodia, Laos and Thailand, which helped improve his
country's ties with the three nations.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi's visit, which began on Monday, was described as "
historic" because it was the first to Cambodia by a Japanese prime
minister in 43 years and the first to Laos in 33 years.
</P>
<P>
The visit drew much attention because Obuchi said part of his
tour was aimed at listening to the views of Asia on the Group of
Eight (G-8)summit, to be hosted by Japan in July, in order to
convey them to the developed nations.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Obuchi held talks with Cambodian Prime
Minister Hun Sen, Lao President Khamtay Siphandone and Prime
Minister Somsavat Lengsavad and Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai,
exchanging views with them on bilateral, regional and
international issues.
</P>
<P>
In Cambodia, the first leg of Obuchi's visit, the two prime
ministers attended the signing ceremony for two exchanges of notes
between the two governments, in which Japan pledges to offer more
than 8 million U.S. dollars to improve the national tuberculosis
center in Phnom Penh and a 17.5-kilometer stretch of the highway
between Siem Reap and Roulo.
</P>
<P>
It was disclosed that Obuchi also promised a grant of 20
billion Japanese yen (19 million dollars) in non-project aid to
Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
In the year ending in April, 2000, Japan has already promised
up to 4.142 billion yen (390 million dollars) in loans to Cambodia
and 7.9 billion yen (752 million dollars) in grants.
</P>
<P>
After Obuchi's departure, Hun Sen praised Japan as "a great
friend" of Cambodia for its help in rebuilding the country's war-
shattered infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
During his two-day visit to Laos, Obuchi pledged Japanese
support for three new aid projects, including 450 million yen (4.
28 million dollars) for food-stock development, 350 million yen (3.
33 million dollars) for various construction projects and 120
million yen (1.14 million dollars) for human resources development.
</P>
<P>
Japan provided Laos with 86.5 million dollars' worth of aid in
1999,making it the largest donor nation to the country, one of the
world's poorest nations.
</P>
<P>
Lao President Khamtay welcomed Obuchi's plan to send a team of
Japanese experts to support Laos in the field of macroeconomic
management.
</P>
<P>
"The dispatch of the team raises the level of Japanese-Lao
economic cooperation to a new stage," the president was quoted by
a Japanese official as saying in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Although failing to promise any specific aid or loans to
Thailand,Obuchi backed a Thai proposal to host a regional human-
resource center to promote expertise in technology and engineering,
agreeing to support the existing Mekong Institute in Khon Kaen
University in Bangkok as the headquarters for the development of
countries in the Mekong region.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi also agreed to send experts to Thailand next month to
help develop its small and medium-sized businesses, particularly
in the areas of agriculture and trade. Its giant industrial
organization,Keidanren, will send a delegation in March to look
for possible big-project investments.
</P>
<P>
Japan is the largest investor in Thailand and the fourth
importer of Thai goods.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Obuchi reiterated again and again that he
wanted to listen to the "candid voice" of Asian countries and
reflect their views to the leaders attending the G-8 summit,
saying Japan will "take it in heart" the expectation of Asian
countries at the summit.
</P>
<P>
This has led to speculation that Japan's determination to take
a leadership role in Asia has been growing.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi said at a press conference in Bangkok on Friday that he
had got "valuable" comments from the host leaders on how
globalization would bring incredible results and on how best to
reduce economic disparity, promising to reflect Asia's voice and
future needs in the G-8 meeting to ensure that everyone could
enjoy a stable life.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi also voiced confidence that Asia will once again become
the "growth center" of the world in the 21st century after full
recovery from the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
He pinpointed financial reforms and human resources development
as the main engine to turn Asia into the world's economic
powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
However, he declined to import more from Asian countries, but
instead expected that Asia will "have greater purchasing power" to
buy more Japanese goods.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said Obuchi' visit shows that Japan is eager to
avoid the past mistake of failing to represent Asia at one of the
world's most important summit meetings and his visit will help
boost his popularity before he calls a general election of the
House of Representatives, which must be held before October.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Impose Extra Duty on Appliances </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government is
planning to impose supplementary duty on appliances that consume
ozone-depleting substances (ODS) like cold storage, air
conditioners and refrigerators while reducing duty on ODS-free
appliances.
</P>
<P>
The Environment and Forest Ministry has already sent a proposal
to the National Board of Revenue to take steps in the next fiscal
budget as part of fulfilling the country's commitment to the
Montreal Protocol, The Bangladesh Observer daily reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"All necessary preparations have already been completed to
place the proposal to the National Board of Revenue for reducing
ODS consumption in the country," the paper quoted official sources
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Chloroflourocarbon (CFC)-free appliances like refrigerators and
air conditioners are already available in many city markets,
market sources said.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1987 Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the
Ozone Layer, developing countries including Bangladesh, whose per
capita ODS consumption is below 300 grams, have been asked to
phase out ODS totally by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
Per capita ODS consummation in Bangladesh is only 6-7 grams,
according to the latest statistics. About 60 percent of the total
ozone depleting substance in the country is used by in the aerosol
sector while 20 percent in the service sector and the rest 20
percent by central air conditioners cold storage, fish processing
and ice cream plants.
</P>
<P>
To implement the Montreal Protocol, a project on institutional
strengthening for the phase-out of ODS has been taken up at a cost
of 150,000 U.S. dollars supplied by the Montreal Protocol
Multilateral Fund. The three-year project, including a baseline
data and awareness campaign, started in March 1996 and completed
in February 1999.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Internet Economy: Is Asia Ready?  by Chen Hegao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The global economy has speeded
up to Internet time and the Internet economy is predicted to be
the world's next growth engine. But is Asia ready for the Internet
economy race?
</P>
<P>
At present, Asia, with an online population of about 39 million,
is lagging behind in the race with the developed nations.
International Data Corp. estimated that online spending in Asia
excluding Japan will double from 2.2 billion U.S. dollars in 1999
to 5.5 billion dollars by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
But the United States is expected to spend 133 billion dollars
on Internet commerce this year, it said.
</P>
<P>
While 28 percent of the U.S. population is connected to the
Internet, connection rates in Asia are still below 1 percent in
many markets.
</P>
<P>
But experts said that within five years, the number of people
in Asia with access to the Internet could match or exceed the
total for North America and Europe combined.
</P>
<P>
With the mass of users online, they said, the Internet economy
will have the potential to provide an extraordinary stimulus to
regional growth and trade.
</P>
<P>
By some estimates, Asia will capture a quarter of the global
Internet commerce revenue of 1.4 trillion dollars in 2003.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Asia is catching up with the industrialized nations in
the development of the Internet economy. Asia already has two-
thirds as many secure Internet-commerce servers as the European
Union and Internet usage across the region is growing at about 50
percent each year,according to Netcraft, a consultancy.
</P>
<P>
However, the development of the Internet economy in Asia is
full of challenges.
</P>
<P>
First, there are big gaps in the development of the information
industry, which is essential for the Internet economy. In
Singapore and South Korea, 40 percent of their population has
access to personal computer, but in India and Indonesia, the ratio
is lower than 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
There are other barriers to Internet economy development in
Asia. Take consumer e-commerce as an example. Very few Asians have
credit cards and they prefer face-to-face buying. And Asian banks
also mistrust online transactions.
</P>
<P>
But as the world has entered the Internet age, if gaps between
Asian countries and the developed nations continue to widen, Asia'
s economic competitiveness in the 21st century will be greatly
affected,experts warned.
</P>
<P>
Many Asian companies are feeling the impact of the Internet
while doing business with their U.S. and European counterparts.
For the U.S.and European companies, e-commerce is becoming
commonplace. If Asian companies cannot offer the online service
their trading partners expect, they risk losing business.
</P>
<P>
Realizing the urgency, Asian countries are trying to catch up
in the race. South Korea's economy will undergo drastic changes
this year to accommodate the Internet and information-based
technology.
</P>
<P>
"For us, 2000 will become a significant year for the
development of a knowledge- and information-based society," said
South Korean President Kim Dae Jung earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
He said the government this year will spend 1 trillion won(879.
2 million dollars) to help create 5,000 computer-oriented venture
companies, generating 100,000 more jobs.
</P>
<P>
Over the next five years, computer information exchanges will
increase at a rate 100 times faster than now, he said.
</P>
<P>
In Southeast Asia, when leaders of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) met in Manila last November, they agreed to
"encourage technical cooperation in information technology and e-
commerce."
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN leaders discussed with representatives of the
information technology sector the development of the
infrastructure of the information industry in the region.
</P>
<P>
To encourage e-commerce, the Philippine government is looking
at the possibility of setting up special zones for companies
specializing in e-commerce that will let them use competitive
international telephone rates.
</P>
<P>
"We want to create virtual freeports... We are looking at it
now,but what we have to do is to make sure that companies aren't
selling these services on (to other telephone users) at standard
rates."
</P>
<P>
Although Asia is still behind the developed world, the Internet
economy in the region has a bright future if both the public and
private sectors make joint and greater efforts, experts said.

<HEADLINE> Higher Bank Lending Expected in Philippines in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Commercial bank loans are
expected to rise by 10 to 20 percent in the Philippines this year
after staying sluggish in 1999, a senior bank official said.
</P>
<P>
In an interview published here Saturday, Central Bank Governor
Rafael Buenaventura said there are already indications of more
lending activities, particularly in the manufacturing sector where
lending grew 0.9 percent at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
This was the second consecutive month that growth was recorded
after a rise of 0.6 percent last September, he said.
</P>
<P>
The central bank reported earlier that the bulk of bank lending
last year was channeled to the productive sectors of the economy,
particularly financial institutions, real estate and business
services which accounted for 27.7 percent of the total loans.
</P>
<P>
The next biggest beneficiary was the manufacturing sector which
accounted for 26.8 percent followed by the wholesale and retail
trade sector with 14.1 percent, it said.
</P>
<P>
Buenaventura also said the level of non-performing loans, which
stood at 13.4 percent of the total loan portfolio of the banking
sector last September, is projected to peak at 15 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that projecting the peak level of non-performing
loans this year will be very difficult.
</P>
<P>
"If loans were to grow 10 percent this year, then the non-
performing loan level will be around 1.5 percentage points less or
at 13.5 percent," he said.
</P>
<P>
Economists here said that if bank lending could grow at such a
speed this year, it will definitely stimulate the economic
recovery process in the Philippines.

<P>
JAKARTA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia would ask the
upcoming ministerial meeting of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) to maintain the present production
level.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Mines and Energy Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono said the
present production level proved to have maintained oil price
stability.
</P>
<P>
"Not only have prices been stable but they've also reached a
good level," Bambang was quoted by The Jakarta Post Saturday as
saying.
</P>
<P>
However, Indonesia would be open to discussions if OPEC members
asked for a slight production increase six months after the
meeting,he added.
</P>
<P>
OPEC ministers are scheduled to hold a meeting in Vienna in
March.The ministers decided in March last year to cut oil output
by more than 2 million barrels per day to boost oil prices which
slumped to a low level.
</P>
<P>
Under the March output quota, Indonesia had to cut its oil
production from 1.5 million barrels per day to 1.187 million
barrels per day.
</P>
<P>
The OPEC members are Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait,
Libya,Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and

<P>
However, he declined to open the Japanese market more to Asian
countries and instead expected greater purchasing power of Asia to
buy more Japanese goods.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Biathlon Champion Sues over Advertisement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Canada's Olympic biathlon
champion Myriam Bedard said Friday in Montreal that she is suing
Wrigley Canada Inc. and an advertising agency over what she claims
is an altered photograph of her in an advertisement.
</P>
<P>
The image appeared in a Wrigley's Spearmint advertisement that
included a timeline emphasizing that the chewing gum's price has
remained the same since 1984.
</P>
<P>
To illustrate 1994, the year Bedard won her two Olympic gold
medals at the Lillehammer Winter Olympics, the company used a
photo of a grimacing cross-country skier.
</P>
<P>
In the 495,000 U.S. dollars lawsuit, the 30-year-old Bedard
alleges that the advertisement throughout Quebec last year
misappropriated her image and "makes a fool" of her. She said the
photo is a computer-altered version of a shot of Bedard competing
at the 1998 Olympics in Nagano, Japan.
</P>
<P>
"Wrigley and its advertising firm have infringed upon what is
dearest to me after my loved ones, namely my integrity as a woman
and the integrity of my image," Bedard told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
"I have always made a point of remaining feminine in a sport
that is very demanding and, especially, very masculine. I have
taken these steps to protect my integrity, not only as a woman but
also as an athlete," she added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, BBDO Canada Inc., the agency that produced
the advertisement, apologized for using the altered image, which
it called an internal mistake.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian Press, supplier of the original photo to BBDO,
also announced Friday it was suing BBDO, William Wrigley Jr. Co.
of Chicago and its Canadian subsidiary, Wrigley Canada Inc.

<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's Corinthians won
the first FIFA Club World Championship in a penalty shootout late
Friday here after playing Vasco to a 0-0 tie.
</P>
<P>
The shootout followed a scoreless sudden-death overtime.
Corinthians eventually took the crown, winning the shootout 4-3
when Vasco's star striker Edmundo put his shot wide.
</P>
<P>
Vasco dominated possession throughout the first half but were
unable to break through Corinthians' tight defense. Despite
creating a number of good opportunities, Vasco just couldn't break
through.
</P>
<P>
In the second half, Corinthians were more aggressive in attacks.
In the 50th minute, Edilson broke through Vasco's defense only to
fire the ball just right of the goal.
</P>
<P>
In the 70th, Marcelinho almost scored for Corinthians with a
corner kick that was headed for goal, but again goalie Helton came
through.
</P>
<P>
In a last gasp attempt in the 89th minute, a wild kick by Raul
from the midfield went just wide left.
</P>
<P>
In the overtime play, Vasco seemed to have a chance after
Luizao fouled Viola just outside the area but the free kick by
Alex Oliveira went high in the 103rd minute.
</P>
<P>
Rincon fired first in the shootout for Corinthians and scored,
as did Romario who lead for Vasco. Fernando Baiano scored next
for Corinthians and Alex Oliveira for Vasco.
</P>
<P>
Luizao scored for Corinthians, but Dida saved Gilberto's kick
putting Vasco behind. Edu scored for Corinthians and Viola scored
for Vasco.
</P>
<P>
When it looked like Corinthians had won, Vasco goalie Helton
saved a kick by Marcelinho. Vasco needed a goal from Edmundo to
stay alive, but he failed, giving the game and the final to
Corinthians.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Friday, the play-off for the third place was also
settled in penalties, when Mexico's Necaxa beat Spain's Real
Madrid in a shootout after a 1-1 tie.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Corinthians: Dida, Indio, Adilson, Vampeta (Gilmar-91), Kleber,

RIO DE JANEIRO, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Mexico's Necaxa stunned
Spain's Real Madrid 4-3 on penalties after a 1-1 draw to claim
third place in the World Club Championship here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Mexican team was again inspired by Ecuadorean captain Alex

Agustin Delgado to score Necaxa's 58th minute goal and give them a
well-earned draw.

<P>
Raul Gonzalez had given Real a 15th minute lead.
</P>
<P>
Etoo fired first for Real Madrid and scored. Sergio Vasquez
then scored for Necaxa. Ivan Helguera scored next for Real Madrid,

</P>
<P>
Then Steve McManaman of Real fired outside the post, and Luis
Perez scored for Necaxa, tying everything back up.
</P>
<P>
Fernando Morientes got his shot in for Real Madrid and Alex
Agunaga also scored for Necaxa. But Dorado firing last for Real
Madrid went wide and when Agustin Delgado scored, Necaxa won the

<P>
PARIS, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Olympic silver medalist Michelle
Kwan from the United States on Friday went into the lead at the
International Skating Union figure skating Grand Prix Final in
Lyon, France, edging Irina Slutskaya of Russia to win the opening
round of the free program.
</P>
<P>
Russia's world champion Maria Butyrskaya came in third.
</P>
<P>
Kwan did six triple jumps and a triple toe loop to scale down
just one point in the free program. She earned marks mostly in
the 5.8 and 5.9 range, with a 5.6 and 5.7.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday the skaters come back with the short program to
determine the placings. A few hours later, the top four skaters
will go against each other in a super final, executing a second
different long program.
</P>
<P>
Slutskaya followed her on the ice and was as perfect as Kwan
with six triple jumps. The Russian nearly quit skating last year
when she failed to make the Russian team after finishing second in
the 1998 world championships. But she came back to take the
Russian title over Butyrskaya.
</P>
<P>
Butyrskaya had five triples but fell once and had bad landings
on two others on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Julia Soldatova, third in last year's world championships,
followed with Elena Liashenko of Ukraine in fifth and Victoria
Volchkova of Russia in sixth.
</P>
<P>
The final brings together the top point scorers in the four
events from a six-meet series between October and December last
year.

<HEADLINE> International Community Urged to Take Actions Against Tutsi Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The international
community has been urged to take stern actions against the Tutsi
rebels in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) for their
persistent violation of the Lusaka peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Congolese are tired of foreign troops' occupation of their
territory, said Kazadi Nyembwe, special envoy to Congolese
President Laurent Kabila, here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
He said the Congolese would like to let the United Nations, the
 Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) know that if the Lusaka accord
continues to be dragging, the people in the DRC will decide the
fate of their country without waiting.
</P>
<P>
The international community pressed the government in Kinshasa
to sign the Lusaka peace agreement in July last year, but on the
rebels' side it's as if there is no such a accord, the visiting
official said.
</P>
<P>
"Since the so called rebels have not shown a mood of being
ready in securing peace in the DRC under the Lusaka agreement, the
international community should go deeper into the root cause of
the rebellion," he said.

<HEADLINE> No Any Y2K Problems Reported in Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Two weeks into the year 2000, no
 difficulties with the millennium bug (or the "Y2K problem") have
been reported from any of the computer systems in the vital
sectors of Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
According to a spokesman for the government's Y2K problem
Support Unit (UTY2K), after the uneventful transition from 1999 to
2000, nothing has been reported to the unit about any failures in
any significant Mozambican computer system.
</P>
<P>
Hilario Sitoe, the UTY2K official in charge of communication
and awareness, was quoted by Mozambique News Agency as saying on
Friday that " the telephones, the power supply, the water, air,
rail and sea transport services are all being supplied to the
public normally."
</P>
<P>
The only complaints the technical unit had received, Sitoe said,
came from private owners of personal computers, whose machines
refuse to recognize the last two digits of the new year.
</P>
<P>
However, Sitoe warned that there are still a few other date
problems for computers, noting that the problem looming on the
horizon is February 29.
</P>
<P>
According to Sitoe, the year 2000 is a leap year, and some
computer systems may not recognize this fact and move straight
from February 28 to March 1.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Ghanaian Minister of
Environment, Science and Technology Cletus Avoka Friday assured
the nation that his ministry is doing everything possible to check
the influx of genetically modified (GM) foods on the market.
</P>
<P>
Avoka, who was answering a parliamentary question, said the GM
food issue has generated a lot of controversy in developed
countries and Ghana, a developing country, would not risk allowing
its use, Ghana News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
On the dreadful terminator seed technology, he said the
government would not tolerate its use since it has the potential
to harm crop management in the country.
</P>
<P>
He said his ministry is participating in the development of a
global biosafety protocol, which, among other things, would
insulate the world biodiversity from possible adverse effects of
GM orgasms.
</P>
<P>
The Minister asked Ghanaians to see environmental management as
a shared responsibility, which needs the collaboration of all.

<HEADLINE> mee011523 hke -- Israel to Postpone Third Stage Troop Redeployment From West Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Israel will postpone the third
troop redeployment from the West Bank scheduled on January 20, a
senior Israeli official said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"It is unlikely a redeployment will take place on Thursday
because the government and the Prime Minister have to make a
decision on it," Israeli chief negotiator Oded Eran was quoted by
local media as saying.
</P>
<P>
Eran and his Palestinian counterpart Saeb Erekat met in
Jerusalem earlier this week to discuss Israel's next troop
redeployment from the West Bank, but no agreement was reached.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the Israeli prime minister's office said
Saturday,"Israel has decided to delay the withdrawal planned for
this week in the West Bank."
</P>
<P>
"Prime Minister Ehud Barak wants first to hear what Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat has to say during his meeting in Washington
with U.S. President Bill Clinton before deciding which zone to pull
out of," the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
The Arafat-Clinton meeting is scheduled for the same day as the
third stage Israeli troop redeployments called for by the Sharm El
Sheikh agreement signed by Barak and Arafat in Egypt last
September.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Israel has to withdraw on January 20 from
another 6.1 percent of West Bank territories, following its much-
delayed second pullout from 5 percent of the West Bank earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
Israel carried out its first withdrawal last September, handing
over 7 percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Concerning the third redeployment, the two sides have some
differences over which areas should be included.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side wants Abu Dis, east of Jerusalem, and
several Arab villages north of the city to be included in the next
redeployment, but the Israeli side has not decided on that.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have promised to meet again before Thursday to
settle the row over the next redeployment.
</P>
<P>
On Arafat's visit to the United States, Arafat's adviser Nabil
Abu Rdainah said Saturday that Arafat will present Clinton with an
outline for a final peace with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Arafat will ask Clinton to press Israel meet an agreed February
13 deadline to achieve a framework agreement on a permanent peace,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"Arafat will make it clear that Jerusalem and (Jewish)
settlements are red lines," he added.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Russia Conclude Y2K Monitoring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"We suffered no incidents and the personnel has accomplished
all its tasks," Russian Air Force Col. Sergey Kaplin said.
</P>
<P>
"This is a great day. Another chapter in the cooperation
between the two great nations, Russia and America," said U.S. Air
Force Major General Tom Goslin, director of operations of the U.S.
Space Command.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Russian experts have been working side by side in
Peterson since December 30, 1999, to ensure that the world's two
largest nuclear powers were in direct contact during the rollover
in case a computer mistakenly indicated a nuclear missile launch.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Russia have the most sophisticated
warning devices, which could have made them vulnerable to mistaken
ballistic missile launches if they had thought in error that a
missile was headed their way.
</P>
<P>
Concerns about a possible Y2K bug stemmed from older computer
systems programmed to read only the last two digits of a year. If
the glitch had been left uncorrected, systems could have misread
2000 as 1900, causing computers to malfunction or even crash.
</P>
<P>
The two countries are planning to set up a full-time joint
missile launch monitoring program to be based in Moscow, but no
timetable has been fixed.

<HEADLINE> Russians Free Key District in South Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Russian Federal forces liberated
key south Chechen district of Sharoi near the neighboring federal
republic of Dagestani late Friday, reported the Interfax news
agency Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Corpses and graves of 61 militants were found after the
fighting, said Alexander Veklich, head of the Russian united
military group press center, cited by the Interfax.
</P>
<P>
Russian soldiers neutralized 21 high-explosive bombs and a mine
field in the district, Veklich said. A large number of arms and
ammunition were found.
</P>
<P>
Eastern group soldiers have fully surrounded the Chechen town
of Sharoi. Federal police and Russian Interior Ministry troops are
preparing to conduct "mopping-up" operations in the town, said the
temporary press center of the Eastern Group of the Russian
Combined Forces in the North Caucasus on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, federal paratroopers in the district of Vedeno(
close to central Chechnya), advancing from the east and west, met
near the village of Dargo. This maneuver split the rebels in the
area into small groups. They will gradually be wiped out, the
press center reported.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Interfax quoted Movladi Saidayev, a top Chechen
rebel commander as saying that Russian forces carried out an
intensive artillery and air strike Saturday against rebel
positions in the Argun gorge and Vedeno district.
</P>
<P>
Saidayev described the attack as "the most powerful strike
since the start of this year."
</P>
<P>
The Russian units had not yet tried to move into the Argun
gorge, Saidayev said, but he thought the shelling might be an
indication that "an attack may start at any moment."
</P>
<P>
Russian Interior Minister Vladimir Rushailo late Saturday
admitted that Russian troops encountered setbacks in Chechnya,
saying that there had been an "aggravation" while the military
operation was proceeding "according to plan."
</P>
<P>
"I can't see any reason to dramatize the situation in
connection with the latest events in the three populated areas(the
towns of Shali, Argun and Gudermes)," said Rushailo.
</P>
<P>
The events in the three towns were forcing law enforcement
agencies to "take more effective and more active measures to
tighten the regime," Rushailo said.

<HEADLINE> Greece Welcomes Drachmas' Revaluation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Greece Saturday welcomed the
decision by the European Union (EU) concerning the drachmas'
revaluation.
</P>
<P>
The EU's Monetary Committee Saturday gave the Greek national
currency a new central parity of 340.750 to the euro in the
exchange rate mechanism (ERM), representing a revaluation of 3.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
Greece is expected to enter the 11-member euro zone on January
1,2001 at the drachma's newly-set ERM parity.
</P>
<P>
In Athens, Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis said that the EU'
s decision had proved the country's economy was stable and healthy.
</P>
<P>
The Greek public had shown through its effort that as a country
they could move at the same pace as other European countries, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Greek National Economy and Finance Minister Yiannos
Papantoniou also said that the parity change meant a stronger
drachma,lower inflation, and more income for employees.
</P>
<P>
Calling the drachma's rise as "a historic moment" for the
country as the national currency had never been revalued, the
minister said that the revaluation would also aid a decline in
interest rates and have a favorable long-term impact on the Athens
Stock Exchange (ASE).
</P>
<P>
But the main opposition New Democracy (ND) criticized the
revaluation, saying that it would bring negative repercussions
that the government-led by Simitis had failed to take into account.

BERLIN, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The German woman student who
had Lassa-fever died on Saturday in Wuerzburg, a city in southwest
of Germany.
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old art student suffered from a named Lassa-fever.
This illness was diagnosed for the first time in 1969 in a
Nigerian city whose name is just Lassa. Its main symptom is
serious internal hemorrhage and has a nearly 20 percent death rate.
There are 100,000 medical records per annum, mainly in Western
Africa.
</P>
<P>
The German woman student took a vacation in Western Africa
last December and became infected with the illness, but she
herself didn't know about it at all. On January 7 this year she
flew back to Frankfurt via Lisbon. At that time she was already
seriously ill. After her return she was sent to a hospital in her
hometown Schwaebisch Hall. On January 11 she was taken into the
section of the tropic medicine of a hospital in Wuerzburg. During
these days she was always in comatose state.

WASHINGTON, January 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Republican presidential
candidates held their final debate Saturday before the first
caucuses in the 2000 campaign in Iowa State on January 24.
</P>
<P>
In the debate, Texas Governor George W. Bush, Republican front-
runner and commanding favorite in the Iowa polls, said that his
main rival John McCain's tax-cut plan would impose a 40 billion
dollars increase on working Americans.
</P>
<P>
Arizona Senator McCain shot back that Bush's proposal doesn't
leave money for Social Security, for Medicare and for paying down
the national debt.
</P>
<P>
McCain, who is debating but not competing in Iowa caucuses,
said his own tax plan would impose taxes on employer benefits for
workers, such as continuing education and transportation.
</P>
<P>
Millionaire publisher Steve Forbes, Bush's closest challenger
in Iowa because of McCain's bypass strategy, also challenged Bush
on taxes.
</P>
<P>
"In Texas, George, your tax cuts are more apparent than real,"
Forbes said. "Most Texans have never seen those tax cuts."
</P>
<P>
Bush, McCain and Forbes all have ads promoting their tax plans,
a major subject in their campaign.
</P>
<P>
The debate was also attended by other three Republican
contenders -- conservative activist Gary Bauer, Senator Orrin
Hatch of Utah and former Ambassador Alan Keyes.
</P>
<P>
The candidates will hold the next debate in Manchester, New
Hampshire on January 26, six days before the first of the
presidential primaries in the state on February 1.

<P>
MAPUTO, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano met here on Saturday with visiting Chinese Foreign
Minister Tang Jiaxuan after he attended Chissano's inauguration as
the special envoy of Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
Chissano thanked President Jiang for sending the special envoy
to attend his inauguration, adding this shows the traditional
friendship between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He hailed Macao's return to China last December and hoped for
the realization of the complete reunification of China.
</P>
<P>
Noting the good relationship and cooperation between Mozambique
and China, he said it is his wish that such cooperation will be
expanded to all the SADC member states.
</P>
<P>
Tang congratulated Chissano on his re-election of the president
on behalf of Jiang.
</P>
<P>
He said Mozambique, under the leadership of Chissano, has
worked hard for national reconciliation and economic growth as
well as for healing war wounds.
</P>
<P>
It has set a good example for African countries in resolving
civil conflicts by political means and gradually advancing toward
peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
Tang gave a definite affirmation of the positive development of
the situation in Africa, stressing that despite of regional war
and armed conflicts on the African continent, its main trend is
developing towards the direction of seeking peace and stability,
with a growing momentum of the development in unity, self-reliance
and regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said that Mozambique, which holds the presidency of both the
Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the Indian Ocean
Rim Association for Regional Cooperation, has been playing an
important role in regional affairs.
</P>
<P>
China is willing to strengthen its exchanges with the regional
blocs through Mozambique and make efforts to expand unity and
cooperation with African countries and other developing countries
in the rest of the world, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tang reaffirmed China's principled stand of supporting the
African countries to seek political solution to the war in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and other regional
conflicts by relying on their own efforts.
</P>
<P>
He said that China has always stood for the settlement of
conflicts through consultations and dialogue and for the
realization of domestic peace and stability through national
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
China, as one of the permanent members of the United Nations
Security Council, will continue to play an active role in
promoting peace and development in Africa, he added.
</P>
<P>
Chissano agreed with Tang's views on the peaceful settlement of
 conflicts in Africa, saying that the international community
should closely follow the situation in the DRC and try its best to
restore peace and stability as soon as possible in the central
African country and the Great Lakes region as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Tang arrived in Maputo on Saturday morning for an official
visit to Mozambique.
