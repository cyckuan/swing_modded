<HEADLINE> German Daimler Expects 50 Percent Rise in Earnings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Germany's largest industrial group
Daimler-Benz today predicted an at-least-50 percent increase in its
operating profits this year.
</P>
<P>
The Stuttgart-based company said that its turnover through
September reached 87.6 billion marks (50.1 billion U.S. dollars), up

<P>
This is compared with the 115 billion marks previously projected.
</P>
<P>
The company expected its second-half operating profits to exceed
first half's figure of 1.85 billion marks. This would bring the
overall result this year to at least 3.7 billion marks, over 50
percent more than the 2.4 billion marks in 1996, which was achieved
on turnover of 106.3 billion marks.
</P>
<P>
The higher profit came from improved result in car division, the
traditional pillar of company earnings, as well as in truck production
sector and in its aerospace unit Dasa, according to Daimler.
</P>
<P>
At Mercedes, private car revenues rose by 13 percent to 38.3
billion marks through September, with car sales up 6.5 percent to

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Scottish champions club Glasgow
Rangers coach Walter Smith was poise to leave his post at the end
of the season, it was reported Tuesday from Glasgow, Sctland.
</P>
<P>
The most possible successor is Finland national coach Richard
Moller-Nielsen, who led Denmark to the 1992 European
Championships, though no official remark has been made, reports
said.
</P>
<P>
Smith, who went into the charge of Rangers in the 1990-91
season, has been pacing an impressive period of the Scottish
league history as Rangers went on to clinch seven league
championships in nine seasons, one title short of the record set
by Celtic in 1966-74.
</P>
<P>
Smith made his decision before the club conceded double
elimination from the Champions' and UEFA Cups.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Shares Close on Largest Point Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong shares crashed
today, with the benchmark Hang Seng Index shedding 1438.31 points
or 13.7 percent to close at 9059.89, the biggest point loss in its
history.
</P>
<P>
It was widely believed that the crash in Hong Kong stock market
was a reaction to the worldwide market sell-off and in particular,
the largest ever point drop in Dow Jones Industries overnight in
New York.
</P>
<P>
The Hang Seng Index opened 8.09 percent lower at 9,649 points
today and then slid to new lows because of the shock waves on Wall
Street which stripped 554 points from the Dow Jones Industries.
</P>
<P>
The index closed at 8876.40 points at the mid-day break, a
massive loss of 1621.80 points or 15.45 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the afternoon trading, the market recovered some of the
loss, representing a technical rebound after sharp falls.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong was not the only one feeling the pain. Nearly all
the other regional markets as well as the major European markets
plunged today as investors were getting out of the market.

<HEADLINE> High Blood Pressure Mishandled in Canada, Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- As many as 3.5 million Canadians
have high blood pressure that isn't being treated, and at least
1.4 million of them even don't know they have it, a new study
says.
</P>
<P>
Canadian doctors are partly to blame for not being more
aggressive at diagnosis and treatment since high blood pressure
raises the risk of death from heart attack and stroke, according
to the study.
</P>
<P>
Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the
country.
</P>
<P>
"To be blunt, physicians haven't come up to speed on the
guidelines. We should be doing much better," said the study's
author, Dr. Michel Joffres at Dalhousie University in Halifax.
</P>
<P>
General guidelines for high blood pressure is a level above 140
over 90, which represents the amount of force the heart must put
on blood to move it through the body.
</P>
<P>
There are 4.1 million people in Canada with hypertension, and
only 600,000 of them are adequately controlling their blood
pressure, the study estimates.
</P>
<P>
Nearly a million have tried to control it and either have
stopped taking medicine or have slipped back into poor diet and
exercise habits.
</P>
<P>
Among those who are treated, many don't receive regular
follow-up, the study found.
</P>
<P>
And few were given advice on lifestyle changes that might
reduce blood pressure, including losing weight, getting more
exercise, eating more fruit and vegetables and reducing sodium
intake.

<HEADLINE> SAARC Speakers' Conference Concludes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 28 (Xinhua) -- A three-day conference of
speakers and parliamentarians of the South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation (SAARC) concluded here today with the
adoption of a number of proposals on cooperation and development.
</P>
<P>
The conference unanimously approved the recommendations made by
participants on "promotion of people-to-people contact and closer
inter-action through parliamentary institutions" and on the "role
of parliaments and parliamentarians in population and
development."
</P>
<P>
At the conference, speakers from the seven SAARC member
countries -- India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, the Maldives, Nepal, Sri
Lanka and the host country Pakistan -- reaffirmed their desire to
address the issues of population and development with the ultimate
aim of improving the quality of life of their people.
</P>
<P>
At a news briefing after the conclusion of the conference,
Illahi Bukhush Soomro, speaker of Pakistan's National Assembly,
expressed his hope that the governments of the South Asian region
will implement the recommendations.
</P>
<P>
The conference recommended that the member countries relax visa
restrictions to allow free movement of their citizens in the
region for closer cooperation, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the promotion of people-to-people contact and
population welfare and development were the focal subjects of the
conference.
</P>
<P>
According to Soomro, the conference also recommended a South
Asian student dialogue for students and youth from universities of
SAARC countries to meet and deliberate on various issues.
</P>
<P>
The conference called for the exchange of data through E-mail
on the Internet, so that parliamentarians in all SAARC countries
are kept posted on the latest developments in each other's
parliaments.
</P>
<P>
It was also recommended that editors, writers and journalists
from the member countries convene annually to discuss
media-related matters, particularly the free flow of information.
</P>
<P>
The conference also called for efforts to ensure easier access
to books, periodicals and newspapers as well as other publications
in SAARC countries.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the conference recommended the exchange of SAARC
TV programs and a weekly TV program called "SAARC Hour" between
SAARC countries.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Ruling Party Begins Breakup, Opposition to Unite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 28 (Xinhua) -- While South Korea's ruling party
today appeared to break up over the nomination of party leader Lee
Hoi-chang as the presidential candidate, two opposition parties
agreed to make leading opposition leader Kim Dae-jung the single
candidate in the presidential election scheduled for December 18.
</P>
<P>
After Lee Hoi-chang, president of the ruling New Korea Party
(NKP), declared his break with President Kim Young-sam, the
party's anti-Lee faction is considering bolting from the party
unless Lee resigns as the NKP presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
NKP advisor Lee Man-sup, a former NKP chairman, resigned as NKP
lawmaker and left the party today.
</P>
<P>
Even some of Lee's supporters in the NKP showed signs of
turning against nominating him as the NKP candidate, doubting
whether Lee's sagging approval rating can able his victory
against 'DJP alliance' in the coming election.
</P>
<P>
The DJP alliance is a coalition of the two major opposition
groups, the National Congress for New Politics (NCNP) led by Kim
Dae-jung and the United Liberal Democrats (ULD) led by Kim
Jong-pil.
</P>
<P>
A breakthrough came Monday night when Kim Dae-jung secretly
visited Kim Jong-pil at his home and endorsed what their deputies
had negotiated concerning the single candidacy and ways of sharing
power after winning the election.
</P>
<P>
"Everything has come to a successful end. The only procedure
left is signing the accord," said Kim Dae-jung, adding that an
official announcement would be made on November 3.
</P>
<P>
According to media reports on their pact on the formation of a
coalition government with power equally shared by the two parties,
once Kim Dae-jung wins the election, Kim Jong-pil will become the
first prime minister with strengthened powers to control the
cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties also agreed to revise the constitution
by 1999 to introduce a German-style parliamentary system of
government, in which a strong premiership reduces the presidency
to a figurehead post.
</P>
<P>
The NCNP leader said he made the concessions in a bid to help
achieve a transfer of power from the ruling to an opposition
party, which has not occurred for decades in South Korean
political history.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts said that the opposition, boosted by the
alliance between the two parties, has the greatest chance of
winning the upcoming presidential election.

<HEADLINE> French Minister Says Stock Market Crisis Won't </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 28 (Xinhua) -- French Minister of Industry,
Finance and Economy Dominique Strauss-Kahn said today that the
on-going world-wide stock market crisis will not hit the economic
growth of France and other European countries.
</P>
<P>
"In France as in Europe, the resumption is there, it is solid
and profound," said Strauss-Kahn at the French National Assembly
(parliament) when answering questions about the stock crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said that the consequences of the stock market crisis on
"the real economy" will remain weak, and that the hypothesis on
an economic growth in France will not be jeopardized by it.
</P>
<P>
The French stock exchange index, CAC 40, fell by 8 percent this
morning soon after the Paris Bourse opened, amid falls in other
European markets and New York.
</P>
<P>
The financial crisis in Southeast Asian nations are widely
blamed for the stock crisis which is hitting Europe, the United
States and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
"But one should stay very careful about the evolution,"
Strauss-Kahn added, saying that the balance of the French stock
market depends on its liquidity and solventness.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the on-going crisis in Southeast Asia and
Hong Kong is "a crisis of adjustment after a very strong growth"
in the region.
</P>
<P>
He said that the countries and regions in crisis should seek a
solution in collaboration with international institutions, such as
the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.

<HEADLINE> Kazakh Economy Grows Steadily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA-ATA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The Kazakh economy grew
steadily in the first nine months of 1997, with the industrial and
agricultural output rising 3.6 percent and 1.5 percent
respectively over the same period in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The industrial output reached 593 billion tenge (about 7.8
billion U.S. dollars) during the period, according to the latest
economic report released by the Kazakh State Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural output amounted to 230 billion tenge (about
3.03 billion U.S. dollars) in the January-September period, among
which the output of crops stood at 146 billion tenge (about 1.9
billion U.S. dollars), increasing 8.5 percent over the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
However, the country's foreign trade in the first eight months
of this year dropped one percent to 6.673 billion U.S. dollars
from the same period last year, mainly due to the decline of its
foreign trade with the CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States)
countries, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan's foreign trade with the CIS states in the
January-August period accounted for 53 percent of its total,
dropping from the 74 percent in the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Kazakhstan's inflation rate remained
at 7.1 percent in the period.

<P>
HARARE, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Foreign Affairs
Deputy Minister Nicholas Goche today condemned the attempted coup
against the Zambian government of President Frederick Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
Nicholas Goche said African countries needed to uphold the
stance of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) to exercise
democracy when it came to change governments.
</P>
<P>
"Change of government should be done through the ballot box.
We totally disapprove of this move," Goche told journalists at
the one day meeting of Foreign Affairs Sub-Committee of the
Zimbabwe-South Africa Joint Commission.
</P>
<P>
The OAU has always been concerned about undemocratic
overthrows of elected governments.
</P>
<P>
Zimbia's State Broadcasting headquarters had been seized this
morning by a man who called himself Captain Solo of the National
Redemption Council. Later Chiluba announced on the radio that
the coup had been crushed and coup plotters arrested.
</P>

The coup leader said he had taken the action to fight
corruption and crime and end chaos in the country.

<P>
HONG KONG, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Denmark's Olympic champion
Poul-Erik Hoyer-Larsen has quit for family reasons from the 1997
170,000 U.S. dollars Millennium Hong Kong Open Badminton
Championsh starting on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The world number three and the men's singles top seed for the
five-day event will compete in the China Open set to open in
Shanghai, China in a week's time.
</P>
<P>
And his pull out did not quite bother Danish national coach
Henrik Lyngby.
</P>
<P>
"We're expecting for very good results here, even if Poul-Erik
Larsen is not here," he said.
</P>
<P>
He thought second seed Peter Christensen Gade Poul-Erik Larsen
in the semi-finals before losting to China's Dong Jun in the final
in the Danish Open earlier month. "He is probably one of our
strongest at the moment," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Out goal is definately to win the title here," he continued.
</P>
<P>
Lyngby picked up Indonesia's former world champion Joko
Suprianto, who is seeded ninth here, and his teammate Marieve
Mainaky from the field as the ones to watch at the Hong Kong event.
</P>
<P>
But he is happy with the team as a whole. "Even we are surpsied
that we have so many players in the world's top ten for the first
time in the history," he comented.
</P>
<P>
"As China brought here a very yong team, so we don't expect
them to take the gold medal this year," the Danish coach put
frankly.
</P>
<P>
"We had a fairly young team here and they all need to be steeled
through international tournaments," said Chinese captain Ren Chunhui.
</P>
<P>
His idea was echoed by Chinese coach Yang Daiming.
</P>
<P>
"As our first-line players are preparing for the China Open,
the Hong Kong Open offered the best chance for the younger ones to
test their stregnth," Yang said.
</P>
<P>
But the Chinese duet Qian Hong annd Liu Lu, ranked fifth in the
world, are hot contenders for the women's doubles title, Yang
added.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Taipei's defending men's singles champion Permandi Fung
said that his goal here was to "play to the final day." But his
latest shape put doubt on his expectation.
</P>
<P>
"I did not do well this year," he admitted. He could only
managed to the top eight before declining out of the race in the
Danish Open. He is now ranked 16th in the world.
</P>
<P>
The five-star event has drawn more than 100 players from 15
countries and regions including China, Indonesia, Malaysia,
Thailand, Denmark, South Korea, Japan and hosts Hong Kong which is
China's Special Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
On the competition program are men's and women's singles,
doubles and mixed doubles events.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Open, 13th on its annual series, is one of the 22
events worldwide on the IBF-sectioned World Grand Prix

<HEADLINE> Canadian Public Endorses Radical Steps to HIV Rise, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Canadians are generally willing
to endorse radical steps to drug addiction and AIDS-virus
infection, according to the head of a national task force.
</P>
<P>
There is widespread public recognition about the failure of
current policy, Dr. Catharine Hankins told a national conference
on HIV and AIDS in Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
"Most people in Canada know someone who has done drugs" and
want to see more effective responses to the spread of HIV among
drug users, she was quoted as saying by reports today.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the task force released a report that called for
decriminalizing heroin, increasing methadone treatment and
allowing widespread commercial availability of clean needles to
reduce the risks of contracting the AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
Cutting the spread of the disease among users through the
controversial methods is a first step to curbing health costs,
which is in the national interest, she said.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Overhauls Insurance Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria has taken measures to
restore order to the insurance industry in order to provide
qualified service for people.
</P>
<P>
A revised insurance law stipulates that the registered capital
of an insurance company must amount to at least 3 billion leva (17
million U.S. dollars) by the end of March 1998.
</P>
<P>
The companies that also deal in the reinsurance business are
required to have a registered capital of at least 4 billion leva
(23 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
This measure will force a number of small insurance companies
to either merge into other companies or go out of business.
</P>
<P>
More than 80 percent of the country's insurance market is
controlled by around five insurance companies out of about 120
insurance companies in Bulgaria. Many small companies sell
insurance illegally and often use violence.
</P>
<P>
The State Insurance Institute, the biggest insurance company in
the country, will be transformed into a holding company with a
registered capital of 35 billion leva (200 million dollars)
divided into 3.5 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Parliamentarians and concerned government staff are not allowed
to be members of the board.

<HEADLINE> S. African Government Condemns Coup Attempt in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The South African
government today strongly condemned the foiled coup in Zambia,
saying that it supports the Zambian government's measures to
defeat the plotters and assert its authority.
</P>
<P>
"We strongly condemn the illegal attempt to seize power in
Zambia," the South African Press Association (SAPA) quoted Acting
Foreign Minister Valli Moosa, as saying in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement was also read in the National Assembly in Cape
Town.
</P>
<P>
"Our government views the attempted coup d'etat in the
Republic of Zambia in a very serious light, considering it
unconstitutional and unacceptable action against a democratically
elected government," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Acting President Thabo Mbeki has been in touch with various
leaders in the region to discuss this matter, Moosa said.
</P>
<P>
They included Zambian President Frederick Chiluba, Southern
African Development Community (SADC) Chairman Robert Mugabe and
South African President Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
Moosa said South Africa also took the opportunity to reaffirm
the commitment of the SADC region to act in defense of democracy
and the protection of human rights, as well as against the
seizure of power through the use of force.
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for all of South Africa's opposition parties in the
National Assembly said they support the government position.
</P>
<P>
Zambian rebel military officers led by Captain Steven Mungu
stormed the Zambian National Broadcasting Corporation this
morning and Mungu announced that a military junta had taken over
the power.
</P>
<P>
The coup failed when his forces was thwarted by troops loyal
to Chiluba, who told the nation that he is in full control of the
situation.

<HEADLINE> ASE to Tighten Foreign Listing Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The Alberta Stock Exchange (ASE)
of Canada is tightening listing rules for foreign operators to
help prevent stock market fraud like Bre-X Minerals Ltd.
</P>
<P>
"With foreign junior mining and energy companies, because of
the difficulties in getting information, we are going to set a
higher hurdle rate," ASE president Tom Cumming was quoted as
saying by a report today.
</P>
<P>
Under the new rules, foreign issuers must have tangible assets
of at least one million dollars (720,000 US dollars), up from
500,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
They must also have adequate internal controls to ensure
proceeds from share offerings are spent as disclosed.
</P>
<P>
And at least two directors must be Canadian with an
"acceptable" level of public company and industry specific or
technical experience.
</P>
<P>
The new rules will come into effect on November 1, according to
today's Financial Post newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The Calgary-based exchange has been pondering tightening the
rules, and the Bre-X fiasco, probably the largest market fraud
ever, increased its resolve. Bre-X started on the ASE.
</P>
<P>
The ASE defines a foreign issuer as a company whose principal
assets, proposed business and controlling shareholders or
management are located outside Canada.
</P>
<P>
Some five percent of its listed companies fit that category.

<HEADLINE> Russia Denies Selling Rocket Technology to Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Russia today denied that it had
sold rocket technology to Iran, describing the allegations as
"groundless reprimands" most probably concocted by Israel and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Presidential Spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky told a briefing
here that rumors to this effect "most often come from two
sources: Washington and Tel Aviv."
</P>
<P>
There was, is and will be no cooperation in the the field of
rocket technology between the two countries, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He said companies believed by the U.S. to have participated in
building rockets in Iran have been checked "in the most thorough
way."
</P>
<P>
He added that the joint construction of a nuclear power station
in Bushehr, Iran, was strictly supervised by the International
Atomic Energy Agency.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman added that despite the allegation, which was
aimed at preventing Russia from cooperating economically with
Iran, Russia will continue to trade with Iran.

<HEADLINE> Top-seeded Hoyer-Erik Larsen Quits from HK Open(Updated) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Denmark's Olympic champion
Poul-Erik Hoyer-Larsen has quit for family reasons from the 1997
170,000 U.S. dollars Millennium Hong Kong Open Badminton
Championsh starting on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The world number three and the men's singles top seed for the
five-day event will compete in the China Open set to open in
Shanghai, China in a week's time.
</P>
<P>
And his pull out did not quite bother Danish national coach
Henrik Lyngby.
</P>
<P>
"We're expecting for very good results here, even if Poul-Erik
Larsen is not here," he said.
</P>
<P>
He thought second seed Peter Christensen Gade "is probably one
of our strongest at the moment. Out goal is definately to win the
title here."
</P>
<P>
Lyngby picked up Indonesia's former world champion Joko
Suprianto, who is seeded ninth here, and his teammate Marieve
Mainaky from the field as the ones to watch at the Hong Kong event.
</P>
<P>
But he is happy with the team as a whole. "Even we are surpsied
that we have so many players in the world's top ten for the first
time in the history," he comented.
</P>
<P>
"As China brought here a very yong team, so we don't expect
them to take the gold medal this year," the Danish coach put
frankly.
</P>
<P>
"We had a fairly young team here and they all need to be
steeled through international tournaments," said Chinese captain
Ren Chunhui.
</P>
<P>
His idea was echoed by Chinese coach Yang Daiming.
</P>
<P>
"As our first-line players are preparing for the China Open,
the Hong Kong Open offered the best chance for the younger ones to
test their stregnth," Yang said.
</P>
<P>
But the Chinese duet Qian Hong annd Liu Lu, ranked fifth in the
world, are hot contenders for the women's doubles title, Yang
added.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Taipei's defending men's singles champion Permandi Fung
said that his goal here was to "play to the final day." But his
latest shape put doubt on his expectation.
</P>
<P>
"I did not do well this year," he admitted. He could only
managed to the top eight before declining out of the race in the
Danish Open. He is now ranked 16th in the world.
</P>
<P>
The five-star event has drawn more than 100 players from 15
countries and regions including China, Indonesia, Malaysia,
Thailand, Denmark, South Korea, Japan and host Hong Kong which is
China's Special Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
The competition program are men's and women's singles, doubles
and mixed doubles events.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Open is one of the 22 events worldwide on the
IBF-sectioned World Grand Prix series. Players who earn enough
points in the series are to be invited to the World Grand Prix
Finals in December in Jakarta, Indonesia.

<HEADLINE> President Clinton Says U.S. Economy Strong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
stressed today that U.S. economy is strong, apparently to calm
nervous investors when the stock market is in a turmoil.
</P>
<P>
But he said it wouldn't be "prudent nor appropriate" to comment
on the market's hour by hour gyrations.
</P>
<P>
"Our economy is as strong and vibrant today as it has been in a
generation," Clinton said at a Chicago public school. "We have to
feel confident and continue our economic strategy."
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging global concerns over plunging financial markets,
Clinton said that "a lot of Americans are focused on the stock
market and it may be disappointing, but I think it neither prudent
nor appropriate for any president to comment on the hour-by-hour
or the day-by-day movements of the market."
</P>
<P>
"With unemployment and inflation at their lowest levels in two
decades and businesses and banks healthy and sound, with new jobs
being created every day, our economy is continuing to grow steady
and strong," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average resumed plunging at the
opening bell today, losing as much as 180 points in the first
minutes of trading, but by the Dow was up over 100 points the time
Clinton made the speech.
</P>
<P>
Since a 544-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial average on
Monday, the largest in points but only the 12th biggest in
percentage terms, the U.S. government officials have sought to
reassure nervous investors about the fundamental soundness of the
U.S. economy.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October (Xinhua) -- The opposition Zambia Democratic
Congress (ZDC) condemned today's abortive coup d'etat, saying it
is not the best solution to resolving differences in the country.
</P>
<P>
ZDC Vice- President for Information and Publicity Andrew Banda
said there is no need to resort to military coups to solve the
pressing problems in the country.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Zambia News Agency in Chipata, the
capital of Eastern Province, Andrew Banda said that both the
ruling and opposition parties should not waste time but start
dialogue to sort out their differences to avoid a situation like
the one the country witnessed today.
</P>
<P>
"ZDC does not advocate for military coups but we call upon
those who are stubborn and insensitive to calls for dialogue," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He charged that both the government and the opposition are
responsible for today's abortive coup plot because of their
alleged failure to open talks.
</P>
<P>
He called on the Zambians to protect their peaceful country at
all cost, saying that "if they destroy it now through violence
means, it will be difficult to regain what has been lost and the
ordinary citizens will suffer greatly."
</P>
<P>
Some of the causes to the current political crisis in the
country are poverty, diseases and hunger, he said,and for this
reason, the government should put measures in place to address
them seriously and immediately.

<HEADLINE> Canada to Have Boom Year for Energy Exploration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Western Canada's booming energy
industry is headed for even higher levels of drilling in 1998,
according to a new survey published today.
</P>
<P>
The survey estimates 16,300 oil and gas wells will be drilled
next year, up from this year's record of 14,700.
</P>
<P>
Sector revenues are expected to swell to 6.2 billion dollars
(4.5 billion USD), up from 5.1 billion dollars this year,
according to the survey compiled for the Petroleum Services
Association of Canada.
</P>
<P>
The industry is predicted to drill 9,061 oil wells, 3,957
natural gas wells, 2,782 dry wells and 500 service wells in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Drilling focused on natural gas is up only moderately at this
point, but activity could escalate late in the year, and into
1999, if plans to build new pipelines are approved, said
association president Roger Soucy.
</P>
<P>
It will be a challenge for the sector, which is already
struggling with equipment and staff shortages to keep up with
industry demand.
</P>
<P>
Soucy said that more drilling doesn't mean an increase in
overall production because of aging oilfields.
</P>
<P>
However, it allows the industry to maintain production at
current levels, he added.

<HEADLINE> US Wages, Benefits Up Moderately in 3rd Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Wages and benefits paid to
American workers rose a moderate 0.8 percent in the third quarter,
U.S. Labor Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that it was another sign that U.S. inflation in
the labor market remains relatively contained.
</P>
<P>
The report said that July-September quarter increase in total
compensation included a 0.9 percent rise in wages and salaries
following a 0.8 percent increase the previous quarter. Wages and
salaries climbed by 3.5 percent over the 12 months ended in
September, the most in nearly six years.
</P>
<P>
Benefits rose by 0.4 percent in the third quarter, down from a
0.6 percent increase in the second quarter. They're up by 1.9
percent for the past year.
</P>
<P>
The report shows a slow upward creep in wages and benefits that
companies have so far managed to meet through improved
productivity.
</P>
<P>
The increase in total compensation followed an identical gain
in the previous quarter, according to the Labor Department.
</P>
<P>
The rise was predicted by many U.S. economists and thus was
unlikely to have a major impact on the U.S. stock market which has
been reeling from a worldwide selling wave triggered by a crash in
the Hong Kong stock market.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Zambians Lash at Attempted Military Coup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 28 (Xinhua) --The attempted Military coup,
staged by Zambian army rebels this morning, was put down by armed
forces loyal to the government only two hours after it staged.
The abortive coup has evoked wide condemnation in the country.
</P>
<P>
In a nationwide speech on the television this afternoon,
Zambian President Chiluba condemned the aborted coup and vowed to
avoid possible bloodshed in the country.
</P>
<P>
He said the coupists want to destabilize the country at the
expense of the interests of the Zambian people, adding that no
force against his government will succeed.
</P>
<P>
The president said that his government is determined to
continue the economic and political reforms in spite of strong
opposition.
</P>
<P>
Alec Chirwa, General Secretary of Zambia Congress of Trade
Unions (ZCTU), also condemned the failed coup, saying that it has
cast a "dark cloud" over all peace-loving citizens in the country
as people are not sure what would happen next.

<P>
The ZCTU does not believe that military coups are the best way
to resolve problems in Zambia, said Chirwa.
</P>
<P>
Many residents interviewed this morning said that a military
rule can not be accepted in the country.
</P>
<P>
Bill Richardson, the United States ambassador to the United
Nations, who was visiting Kenya on a six-nation African tour,
also condemned the coup attempt.
</P>
<P>
"We are always concerned about undemocratic, unconstitutional
overthrows of elected governments," said Richardson in response
to the coup before leaving Nairobi today.
</P>
<P>
In the Early morning, a group of soldiers from the army
besieged the State House where President Chiluba lives and took
the Mass Media Complex which houses the Zambian Broadcasting
Corporation, the Zambian Information Services and the Zambian
News Agency.
</P>
<P>
In a statement broadcast around six o'clock local time, the
coup leader Captain "Solo", who were identified later by army
sources as Captain Steven Mungu, claimed that the National
Redemption Council he represented had taken over the government
and demanded President Chiluba to resign.
</P>
<P>
He justified the military action by saying that the governance
by Chiluba's Movement for Multi-Democracy Movement is corrupted
and undemocratic.
</P>
<P>
About two hours later, the coupists were evicted from around
the State House by armed forces loyal to the government. However,
the government did not take control of the situation until
heavily-armed forces besieged the Mass Media Complex and arrested
most of the coupists including Captain "Solo".

<HEADLINE> New Private University to Open in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, October 28 (Xinhua)-- More than 300 students are
sitting for the admission exams for a newly established private
university in the Somali capital among the anarchy and
lawlessness in the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
Mogadishu University, situated in north of the capital, was
founded by a group of Somali professors who have long been
studying how they could revive the Somali universities which had
collapsed with the late regime early 1991.
</P>
<P>
However, unlike former universities run by the government,
this new university will charge the students with a fee of US
$300 for each student per academic year, according to the
administration of the university.
</P>
<P>
About 400 students are required to attend the first academic
year which will begin on November 8 after the on-going exams. The
students are required to obtain high secondary school diploma
with good conduct.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Chairman of the university Ali Hassan Mohamed said the
private university offers four year long high education and has
three faculties of law and sharia, education and arts.
</P>
<P>
In these faculties, Somali students will acquire full
knowledge of Islamic studies, sharia and international law,
history, languages, physics, biology and chemistry.
</P>
<P>
Lectures will be offered by 12 permanent local and foreign
professors together with other part time lecturers.

<HEADLINE> Russian Government Approves Budget Revisions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The Russian government has
approved today the draft 1998 budget reworked by the tripartite
commission after the Duma turned down the government's budget
version, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the governmental culture and information
department told a briefing that 1998 gross domestic product target
is two trillion 840 billion re-denominated roubles (one US dollar
equals 5882 roubles).
</P>
<P>
The budget projects revenue of 367.5 billion roubles and
spending of 499.9 billion roubles. The budget deficit, 132.4
billion roubles, is to make 4.7 percent of GDP and 26.5 percent of
the budget's total spending in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Annual inflation is forecast to be 5.7 percent in next year.
</P>
<P>
The budget deficit is to be filled with 30.4 billion roubles
from external and 102 billion roubles from internal sources.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the government has approved ten draft laws
intended to build up the budget's revenue.
</P>
<P>
The laws are to add to federal taxes, on January 1, 1998, taxes
on the water and use of he fauna, and license rates on alcohol
production and sales.
</P>
<P>
The government plans to introduce amendments to the federal law
on taxation of the purchase of foreign currencies. The amended law
is to revise the foreign currency tax from 0.5 to one percent of
the total worth of a deal in the foreign currency, since January
1.
</P>
<P>
Another draft law seeks to increase the current soft ten
percent value added tax on food, including children's food, to 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
The Russian government is going to motion amendments to the law
on taxation of corporate bodies and individuals to cancel on
January 1 income tax benefits for the military personnel and other
eligible in this category.

<HEADLINE> S. Leonean Junta Lifts Curfew Following Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The military junta in Sierra
Leone has lifted the night curfew on the capital Freetown
following last Thursday's peace agreement it signed with west
African countries to return power to the ousted government within
six months.
</P>
<P>
The state radio announced on Monday that the midnight-to-6:00
a.m. curfew, put in force since the May 25 coup, had been lifted
with immediate effect.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was warmly welcomed by many Freetown
residents, according to a report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of residents who fled clashes between junta forces
and the west African peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG enforcing
sanctions against the country have been streaming back since the
signing of the agreement, it said.
</P>
<P>
The accord with the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS) calls for a truce, disarmament, a broad-based government
under ousted President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah and amnesty for coup
leaders.
</P>
<P>
The agreement has won wide welcome among the international
community, and ECOWAS member countries in particular.
</P>
<P>
But Kabbah said on Monday he had not yet been briefed on the
accord signed in Conakry, capital of Guinea.
</P>
<P>
He said he would seek clarifications on why it would take
until April 22 next year for him to resume power.
</P>
<P>
He would seek assistance from the European Union to rebuild
his country, Kabbah said at a new conference earlier.

<P>
NAIROBI, October 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Ambassador to the U.N.
William Richardson said here today that the U.S. administration
supports Wednesday's Sudan peace talks brokered by the
Inter-Governmental Authority of Development (IGAD).
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when meeting Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi this morning, citing the demonstration of U.S. support as a
key reason behind his brief visit, the Kenyan News Agency
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Richardson arrived here on Monday and left before noon today.
He is on a six-African-nation tour which also include Democratic
Republic of Congo, Eritrea, Angola, Ethiopia and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. will contribute 130,000 U.S. Dollars towards IGAD
initiative to end the Sudan civil war, Richardson told Moi, who
is chairman of IGAD, a regional forum comprising Sudan, Eritrea,
Uganda, Somalia, Kenya, Djibouti and Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
"The leaders of this organization (IGAD) deserve the world's
praise for establishing a negotiating framework that seeks to
advance the rights and interests of the Sudanese people," said
Richardson in a statement issued before talks with Moi.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is encouraged at that the countries of the Horn of
Africa have come together to create a peaceful solution to the
14-year conflicts that has devastated southern Sudan, according
to Richardson's statement.
</P>
<P>
The Sudan peace negotiations are to open here tomorrow
afternoon under the auspices of IGAD with an IGAD ministerial
meeting first.
</P>
<P>
Salve Kiir, Chief of Staff of Sudan People's Liberation Army
(SPLA) will lead the rebel team and Foreign Minister Hussein abu
Saleh will head the Khartoum delegation in the talks.
</P>
<P>
The war in Sudan has claimed more than 1.3 million lives and
made tens of thousands displaced in the country since 1983 when
the SPLA rose to fight against Islamic-backed Khartoum power for
a secular state and more autonomy in the Christian-dominated
south.

WASHINGTON, October 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today ordered the federal education officials to distribute
guidelines to school districts to upgrade school education in the
nation.
</P>
<P>
Clinton instructed the Education Department to help local
districts get better access to existing federal programs and
resources, such as charter schools or his "America Reads"
volunteer tutoring program, "to transform schools that are not
performing into world-class learning centers."
</P>
<P>
During a visit to Oscar Mayer Elementary School in Chicago,
Clinton praised reforms instituted by Chicago Mayor Richard Daley.
</P>
<P>
The mayor took control of the school system, abolished the
practice of promoting children for social reasons and required
that students meet academic standards in grades 3, 6, 8 and 9.
</P>
<P>
"Ending social promotion does not put children down. It gives
us a chance to lift all children up," Clinton said. "When they
move from grade to grade, it means something. All of our children
can succeed, and they deserve a chance to do it."

AMMAN, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's King Hussein today
called for collective efforts of the co-sponsors of the Middle
East peace process to help overcome obstacles towards a just and
comprehensive peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with visiting Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov, the king said Russia, the United States and Europe
should make collective efforts to revive the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Jordan would also like to continue to make its contributions,
he added, quoted by Radio Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Primakov briefed Hussein on his current Middle East tour which
aims to boost Russia's role and help overcome the deadlock in
peace making between the Arabs and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Also present at the meeting were Jordan's Crown Prince Hassan,
and other high-ranking officials.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, the Russia minister held talks with Jordanian
Prime Minister Abdul Salam Majali and Foreign Minister Fayez
Tarawneh on Middle East situation.
</P>
<P>
Before arriving in Amman late Monday evening, Primakov headed
for Syria to meet President Hafez Assad again and presented "new
ideas" from Israeli government on resuming peace talks.
</P>
<P>
He had voiced Russia's willingness to mediate between Syria and
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Primakov's week-long trip in the region began on October 24 in
Lebanon, which also includes Syria, Israel, the Palestinian
self-rule area, Jordan and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Although Russia co-sponsored the peace process together with
the U.S., its long absence in the region has left Washington
played the dominant role in brokering talks between the Arabs and
Israelis.

<HEADLINE> Official: Russia-Eastern Europe Arms Trade Has Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Russia holds that there is a
future for arms trade with former Warsaw Pact countries, the
Interfax news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Minister for Foreign Economic Relations and Trade
Vladimir Pakhomov was quoted as saying that "Interesting areas of
cooperation for trade in arms and related services with Poland,
Bulgaria, the Czech Republic and Slovakia have appeared."
</P>
<P>
Pakhomov said "Russia and many Eastern European countries have
signed new agreements on cooperation in arms trade."
</P>
<P>
He said he saw such links between Russia and Slovakia as
especially promising. Moscow and Bratislava "have recently
prepared a memorandum on Russian arms supplies to Slovakia through
the year 2000," the deputy minister said.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, Moscow will supply Bratislava with 140 million US
dollars worth of military equipment, including S-300 PMU
anti-aircraft system, in order to offset part of its debt," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also cooperate in the production of Yak-130
training planes powered with Slovakian engines, Pakhomov said. In
his opinion, "this plane has every chance of selling successfully
on foreign markets."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, other former Warsaw Pact countries have chosen other
ways to upgrade their armed forces, which are different from the
case of Slovakia. However, Moscow is ready to work with these
countries as well, presuming that the economy holds out," the
official said.
</P>
<P>
Also, "Russia expects to take part in different European
projects via its Eastern European partners," Pakhomov said. Within
the scope of such cooperation, Russia could hand over its latest
technology and borrow some technology from its partners at the
same time, he added.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa, EU Could Reach Trade Accord in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Negotiations between
South Africa and the European Union (EU) on a comprehensive trade
and development agreement are on track and could be concluded by
mid-1998, the South African Press Association reported today.
</P>
<P>
An EU parliamentary delegation is in South Africa for talks
about the trade pact with various South African government
departments, non-governmental organizations and politicians.
</P>
<P>
They briefed South African National Assembly's foreign
affairs, trade and industry, and agricultural committees on
progress made toward an agreement.
</P>
<P>
Head of the delegation, Gerald Collins of Ireland, said the
talks have been going on for 27 months, but that negotiations of
such a nature usually take 36 months.
</P>
<P>
He said major difficulties lie in fisheries and agricultural
products. However, he said, none of the problems appeared
insurmountable.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is reluctant to include fisheries into the accord
and complained about EU protectionism in agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
Another member of the EU delegation, Caroline Jackson of
Britain, told the committees that some European countries, such
as Spain, Portugal and Greece, are especially opposed to open
trade, as they produce similar agricultural products to South
Africa, such as fruit, wine and spirits.
</P>
<P>
South Africa and the EU are also involved in negotiations
about South Africa's accession to the Lome Convention, through
which the EU grants aid to 70 African, Caribbean and Pacific
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The EU is South Africa's largest trading partner and source of
investment.

<HEADLINE> Liberia, Libya Establish Diplomatic Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Liberia has established
diplomatic relations with Libya, and appointed its ambassador to
Tripoli, it is reported today.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here quoted a government communique as
saying that Moses Blah, a former commander of President Charles
Taylor's defunct National Patriotic Front militia, would serve as
Liberia's ambassador to Tripoli as well as Tunisia.
</P>
<P>
Liberia and Libya had trade relations before Taylor launched
the civil war in 1989, but there has been no diplomatic relations
for more than two decades.
</P>
<P>
Blah's appointment comes less than a month after Liberia and
Libya signed a joint communique in Tripoli, calling for increased
cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, a Libyan delegation arrived in
Monrovia, capital of Liberia, last month to discuss the opening
of a Libyan people's bureau (embassy).
</P>
<P>
The delegation comprised Rajab Fartas, senior member of the
Libyan People's Congress (parliament), Fadel Saity, Libyan
ambassador-designate to Liberia, and Ashur Moushai, adviser on
international relations to Libyan leader Col. M. Gaddafi.
</P>
<P>
Taylor's militia group, which ignited the rebellion in
Liberia, received military training in Libya in 1988 before
attacking Liberia from neighboring Cote d'Ivoire on Christmas Eve
in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of people were killed in the seven-year
bloody civil war, with more others fleeing the country as
refugees or displaced.
</P>
<P>
Taylor finally achieved his goal and became the Liberian
president after winning the elections in July this year.
</P>
<P>
He paid a visit to Libya as president of Liberia late last
month to strengthen bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Taylor recently signed the country's
first human rights bill, vowing to take the lead in fighting
human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
The bill provides for a human rights commission to be
appointed by the government, but the neutrality and independence
of the commission was questioned by human rights groups in the
capital Monrovia.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The blockade on Sierra Leone is
to continue despite the peace accord signed between the military
junta and west African countries, the Nigerian defense
headquarters announced today.
</P>
<P>
The economic sanctions against the junta was still on although
the junta had agreed to quit in six months, said Col. Godwin
Ugbo, acting director of defense information.
</P>
<P>
West African countries and the junta signed a peace agreement
last Thursday in Conakry, capital of Guinea, which set April 22
next year as the date to hand over to elected President Ahmed
Tejan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
Kabbah was ousted in the May 25 coup, which invited sanctions
imposed by both its west African neighbors and the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
The west African peace-keeping force (ECOMOG) led by Nigerian
troops has been mandated to enforce the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
According to Ugbo, ECOMOG would continue to prevent supply of
arms and ammunition to the military authorities in Sierra Leone
as a way of ensuring a faster resolution of the crisis triggered
off by the coup.
</P>
<P>
The peace agreement also requires a cease-fire between the
junta and ECOMOG troops, disarmament of combatants in that
country, an all-embracing government under Kabbah and amnesty for
coup leaders.

<HEADLINE> Somalia's Aideed Promises Dialogue with Rivals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 28 (Xinhua) -- A leading Somali faction leader
reaffirmed his commitment today to holding dialogues with rival
leaders to advance the country's reconciliation process.
</P>
<P>
The Somali National Alliance, the most powerful Somali faction,
was ready to open dialogue with all who follow democratic courses,
its leader Hussein Farah Aideed told reporters here after meeting
with Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa.
</P>
<P>
Aideed, who arrived here Monday, may hold talks with his
arch-rival Ali Mahdi Mohamed, leader of the Somali Salvation
Alliance, in Cairo Wednesday on ways to end their long-running
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Egypt mediated for months between Aideed and Mahdi, who signed
a reconciliation agreement in Cairo on May 29 on holding talks. At
least three agreements were signed between them in the aftermath
but none was carried out.
</P>
<P>
Aideed praised Egypt's role in Somalia's reconciliation process
within the context of the Arab and African efforts exerted to
unify Somali ranks.
</P>
<P>
He discussed with Moussa the Somali national unity conference,
organized by the National Salvation Council, which is due to be
held next month in the Somali town of Bosaso, south of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Aideed, who is seen as the key to a lasting peace in Somalia,
has refused to join the National Salvation Council, which was
formed by 26 faction leaders in January, and has yet to agree to
attend the conference.
</P>
<P>
Since the ouster of the late dictator Mohamed Siad Barre in
1991, Somalia has been fragmented into fiefdoms protected by
faction leaders, who continued to fight to expand their turfs
despite a number of peace conferences.
</P>
<P>
The factional fighting, combined with a 1992 famine, has
claimed about 350,000 lives.

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambican Ministry of
Foreign Affairs and Cooperation today issued a press communique
denouncing the coup in Zambia in an attempt to overthrow the
government of President Frederick Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican government, said the statement, denounced the
failed coup aimed at ousting the democratically-elected
government in Zambia, and congratulated the Zambian government on
its immediate restoration of law and order in the country.
</P>
<P>
"The Mozambican government strongly condemns the disgusting
event which was aimed at sabotaging the stability and democratic
atmosphere in Zambia and other member states of the Southern
African Development Community (SADC)," the statement noted.
</P>
<P>
It reiterated Mozambique's support and friendship toward the
lawful authorities of the brotherly Zambia Republic.
</P>
<P>
Some Zambian soldiers launched a military coup early this
morning. But a few hours later, President F. Chiluba announced
on state radio that the coup had been smashed and that he has
taken complete control of the situation.
</P>
<P>
The 54-year-old Chiluba was re-elected in November 1996 as
president of Zambia.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi voiced strong condemnation on the short-lived military coup
attempt in Zambia earlier today.
</P>
<P>
The military should go back to the barracks to give Zambia a
chance to develop its democracy in a free atmosphere, Moi said at
a public rally in Ngong Town, near the capital Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
Military coups have no place in Africa, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the president urged Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba to immediately restore his country to normality and
remove the negative impacts of the coup.
</P>
<P>
Zambian rebel military officers led by Captain Steven Mungu
stormed the Zambian National Broadcasting Corporation this
morning and announced that a military junta had taken over power.
</P>
<P>
The coup failed when Mungu's forces was swiftly thwarted by
troops loyal to Chiluba, who later told the nation that he is in
complete control of the situation.

<HEADLINE> EU Commissioner to Visit Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU)
Commissioner for Foreign Affairs Hans Van Den Broek will arrive
here Thursday to discuss EU-Turkish relations with Turkish
leaders.
</P>
<P>
Van Den Broek is expected to meet with Turkish Parliament
Speaker Hikmet Cetin, Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit and
Foreign Minister Ismail Cem, according to the Anatolia News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's EU membership issue will reportedly be taken up
during the EU official's visit here.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the Turkish government will use
the chance to justify its efforts for full EU membership.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry officials, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said that Van Den Broek's visit was planned weeks ago
and had nothing to do with the recent EU ministerial meeting.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the EU meeting held in Mondorf town, Luxembourg
last weekend, German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel made it clear
that Bonn cannot support Turkey's EU membership bid at present.
</P>
<P>
He said that Turkey cannot be invited to the accession talks
unless it has made considerable progress on a number of issues,
including the Kurds problem, human rights as well as its
economy.
</P>
<P>
In reaction, Turkish President Suleyman Demirel told a press
conference Monday that Germany should not withdraw its
support for Turkey's EU membership efforts, saying this is also
against Germany's interests.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has been sparing no efforts for full EU membership but
so far no positive results have been achieved owing to its
differences with the European organ.

<HEADLINE> PNA Regards Netanyahu's Policy "Very Dangerous" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) today warned that Israeli government's latest
hardline stance on troop redeployment and Jewish settlement is
"very dangerous."
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian news service JMCC today quoted PNA Cabinet
Secretary Ahmed Abdul Rahman as saying Israeli government's
intransigent statement is unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
In his policy address to the Israeli Knesset (Parliament)
Tuesday evening, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu blamed
the PNA for not doing enough to fight terrorism, thus breaching
its commitments and pledges.
</P>
<P>
He declared that Israeli will continue Jewish settlement
activities in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and refrain from
handing over more land to the PNA unless it fulfills its commitment.
</P>
<P>
"The policy of the Israeli government towards the peace
process is very dangerous," Rahman said.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said Netanyahu's words are yet another
indication of his unbudged high-handedness, which has also caused
a delay of the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks scheduled for this
week in Washington.
</P>
<P>
PNA chief negotiator Saeb Erakat issued a statement today to
the Palestine Radio saying that the PNA has already contacted
U.S. Peace Envoy Dennis Ross and inquired the U.S. Administration
on the postponement of the talks.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy refused to go to
Washington for the talks because Netanyahu did not give him clear
instructions governing his negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu decided to let the cabinet formulate guidelines and
principles for peace talks during its session on Wednesday.

LUSAKA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Defense Minister
Benjamin Mwila announced here today that 15 abortive coup
plotters including coup leader captain Steven Lungu have been
arrested.
</P>
<P>
The minister also confirmed the death of one plotter during

</P>
<P>
Lungu, who identified himself as "Captain Solo", seized the

<HEADLINE> Campaign Bill Blocks Action on Highway Legislation Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 28 (Xinhua) -- For the fourth time in two
weeks, Democrats today blocked action on a highway building bill
to pressure Republicans into scheduling full debate and action on
a campaign finance overhaul measure in the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
The vote was 52-48, eight votes short of the 60 needed to end
the Democratic filibuster of the 145 billion-dollar bill. All
votes to end the filibuster were cast by Republicans, while three
Republicans joined the 45 Democrats in voting against it.
</P>
<P>
Democrats have said they will block virtually all legislation
not related to spending for fiscal 1998, which began October 1.
Congress has finished work on seven of the 13 appropriations
bills, and President Bill Clinton has signed six of them into law.
</P>
<P>
Majority Leader Trent Lott, Republican from Mississippi, has
said he would pull the six-year highway bill off the floor if he
failed to overcome the Democratic filibuster today.
</P>
<P>
Senator Rod Grams, a Republican, called the delaying action a
politically motivated attempt to halt crucial legislation.
</P>
<P>
"It's ironic that senators proclaiming to support labor issues
would now thumb their noses at the same hard-working Americans who
feed and clothe their families through the salaries they earn
working on transportation projects," Grams said in a speech today
before the vote.
</P>
<P>
Minority Leader Thomas Daschle, in a speech after the vote,
urged Republican leaders to reach agreement on a date for full
debate of campaign finance legislation and then move to
consideration of the full six-year highway bill.
</P>
<P>
The campaign finance bill that Democrats support -- a
bipartisan measure sponsored by Senators John McCain, a
Republican, and Russell Feingold, a Democrat -- was debated for
several days on the Senate floor earlier this month before being
blocked by a Republican filibuster.
</P>
<P>
Lott allowed only one amendment -- to require unions to get
permission from each member before spending any dues for political
purposes. Democrats blocked that with a filibuster of their own.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Zambian Coup Meets with Continental </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian coup, which
lasted no more than five hours before it was clamped down by the
government troops today, has been receiving condemnations from
the African society.
</P>
<P>
Of all countries and organizations that stood against the
abortive coup, member states of the Southern African Development
Community (SADC) have expressed strongest disapproval of the
incident.
</P>
<P>
South Africa took the lead in denouncing the military coup
soon after it happened in the early morning.
</P>
<P>
"The whole world will condemn what is happening in Zambia
today," Premier Tokyo Sexwale of Gauteng Province, South Africa,
told reporters hours before the mutiny was put down by troops
loyal to Zambian President Frederick Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
Describing the coup as "bad news for this continent, Sexwale
said, "the era of guns and tanks rolling out of the camps against
civilians has got to come to an end in Africa."
</P>
<P>
Following Sexwale's remarks, South Africa's ruling African
National Congress (ANC) issued a statement, saying it
"unequivocally condemns attempts by a clique of military officers
to use unconstitutional means to remove from office the
democratically-elected government of Zambia".
</P>
<P>
The statement noted that "Africa can no longer tolerate
undemocratic, dictatorial and militaristic regimes being imposed
upon the will of the majority of the people any where on the
continent."
</P>
<P>
It said whatever political problems may exist, such problems
should be resolved through political and peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
While the South African government was condemning the foiled
coup, acting President Thabo Mbeki had been in touch with leaders
in the southern African region to discuss the matter, acting
South African foreign minister Valli Moosa said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to South African President Nelson Mandela, Mbeki
had contacted with President F. Chiluba of Zambia and SADC
Chairman Robert Mugabe, Moosa said.
</P>
<P>
Moosa said South Africa would take the opportunity to reaffirm
the commitment of the SADC region to act in defense of democracy
and the protection of human rights, as well as against the
seizure of power through the use of force.
</P>
<P>
Sharing South Africa's view point, Zimbabwe today also voiced
its support to the legal government headed by President Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean Deputy Foreign Minister Nicholas Goche said African
countries needed to uphold the stance of the Organization of
African Unity (OAU) to exercise democracy when it came to change
governments.
</P>
<P>
"Change of government should be done through the ballot box,"
Goche told reporters at the one-day meeting of the Foreign
Affairs Sub-committee of the Zimbabwe-South Africa Joint
Commission.
</P>
<P>
The OAU has always been concerned about undemocratic
overthrows of elected governments. In its annual meeting in
Harare, Zimbabwe early this year, the OAU adopted a resolution
calling on all the African countries not to recognize any
political regime which takes state power by force.
</P>
<P>
The OAU also appealed to all political parties in Africa to
resolve their problems through peaceful means so as to create
stability for economic development in the continent.
</P>
<P>
Kaire Mbuende, SADC executive secretary, said the Zambian coup
has set back the progress of democracy in Africa, particularly in
southern Africa, noting "it will cast a shadow of doubt on the
future political stability of our region."
</P>
<P>
Mbuende stressed that SADC member states must try their best
to prevent such event from happening again.

<HEADLINE> Russian Foreign Minister Visits Egypt Tomorrow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov will begin his visit to Egypt Wednesday to discuss
regional and bilateral issues, a senior official said here today.
</P>
<P>
The Russian minister's visit is of special importance
considering the peace crisis in the Middle East, Mohamed Fathi al
Shazli, assistant foreign minister told the Middle East News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
Primakov is expected to hold talks with his Egyptian
counterpart Amr Moussa on the latest developments in the peace
process, current situations in Iraq and Libya, and ways to enhance
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is the last leg of Primakov week-long Mideast tour which
has taken him to Lebanon, Syria, Israel, the Palestinian self-rule
areas and Jordan. The trip was aimed to boost Russia's profile as
a co-sponsor of the peace process and help revive Arab-Israeli
talks on all tracks.
</P>
<P>
Al Shazli said the present impasse in the peace march requires
the international community, mainly Moscow, to push forward
"whether by words, deeds or by acts."
</P>
<P>
Russia, alongside with the U.S., co-sponsored the Madrid
conference in 1991 to set the Middle East peace wheel going.
However, its inactivity over the past few years left the
U.S. dominated the scene in brokering Arab-Israeli negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Primakov's Cairo trip was agreed upon by the two countries'
presidents, Boris Yeltsin and Hosni Mubarak, during the latter's
visit to Moscow last month, al Shazli said.
</P>
<P>
Primakov and Moussa will also follow up the steps to carry out
agreements and resolutions recently adopted by the joint committee
of the two countries to broaden cooperation as well as bilateral
relation.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Urges NATO to Stop Greek-Russian Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Turkey has sent a letter to
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to protest against
the Greek-Russian alliance, a senior military official confirmed
here today.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Deputy Chief of General Staff Cevik Bir told the
press that the letter was aimed at warning NATO over the
increasing Greek-Russian threat to Turkey's security, the
Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Local daily Sabah reported today that Ismail Hakki Karadayi,
the chief of general staff of Turkish Armed Forces, had written
to his NATO counterparts to voice Ankara's concern over the
Greek-Russian alliance against Turkey.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Karadayi warned that Greece, a NATO member, is
now joining hands with Russia to threaten the state security of
Turkey, which is also a member country of NATO.
</P>
<P>
"We demand you take measures against these grave developments
that could lead to the collapse of the NATO's southern flank,"
he said in the letter.
</P>
<P>
The Greek-Turkish relations have become even worse since the
Cypriot government made it clear that it would not give up its
plan to buy anti-aircraft S-300 missiles from Russia.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has repeatedly threatened that it would use force to
destroy all the missiles if they are finally deployed in
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Russia, however, warned earlier that Moscow will see it as a
declaration of war against the Russian Federation if Turkey
attacks vesseles shipping the missiles to Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Turkish General Staff has not received any response from NATO
and its member states so far, Bir said.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, two traditionally rival countries, have
long been at odds over a number of issues, including the mineral
resources of the Agean, airspace division as well as the
settlement of the Cyprus issue.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Stock Exchange Unaffected by Global </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The global stocks sell-off
during the last few days is not expected to have a significant
impact on the Cyprus Stock Exchange (CSE), CSE Chairman Dinos
Papadopoulos said here today.
</P>
<P>
Papadopoulos explained to Cyprus News Agency today that there
are three factors which secure the level of CSE's prices.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, Cyprus is not an open market regarding the capital
movement, and secondly the CSE's stocks are not overpriced,
which was the case in a number of countries involved in the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The third factor is that the problem in south-east Asia was
that a large amount of capital had been transferred from the
countries of the region by foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Papadopoulos said that "this is not possible in Cyprus, as the
CSE does not have a significant number of foreign investors."
</P>
<P>
The island's economy will be affected only if the U.S. dollar
or the British pound are affected, the CSE official was quoted as
saying.

<HEADLINE> Seven Hong Kong Young Industrialists Awarded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee Hwa, chief
executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) of
China, presented the Young Industrialists Awards of Hong Kong
today to seven outstanding young entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
The awards were given by the Federation of Hong Kong Industries
as a public recognition of the achievements made by the seven
outstanding young industrialists and to encourage them to continue
their contribution to the local industry and the economy of Hong
Kong as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The awards winners -- Ricky Cheng Chung-hing, Choi Yee-sang,
Roy Chung Chi-ping, Benjamin Kwok Chan-yiu, Clement Lam Ching-wah,
Winger Lam Sai-wing and Wilson Wong Wing-shing -- are leaders of
enterprises that engage in high technology and high value-added
industries.
</P>
<P>
This year's award presentation ceremony, the first after Hong
Kong's return to China, coincides with the 10th anniversary of the
awards.
</P>
<P>
Federation Chairman Henry Tang, who himself was given the
awards in 1989, said at the ceremony that he very much enjoys
being an industrialist.
</P>
<P>
He said operating a manufacturing business in Hong Kong
requires determination and long-term vision as challenges come
from every angle.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the chief executive's maiden policy speech
delivered earlier this month, Tang said it had detailed the future
plans and policies of the SAR government to build a solid
foundation for Hong Kong's long-term development as an
international center for industry, finance, trade and services.
</P>
<P>
Tang noted that this year's seven winners are good examples of
success stories. "They demonstrate that if we judge the market
well and correctly identify our niche, we can enjoy value-added
production and prosperity made possible by technology."
</P>
<P>
Tang paid tribute to the awards' sole sponsor, the Sin Hua
Bank, for its continual support for the awards since their
inception, which demonstrates its confidence in the local
industrial sectors.
</P>
<P>
He believed that he himself and the seven awards winners are
also confident about the prospect of industrial development in
Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Mercedes to Modify New Compact Car After Freak Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 29 (Xinhua) -- German Daimler-Benz said today its
subsidiary Mercedes would upgrade its newly introduced A-Class
autos with new tires and electronics in response to reports that
the car has tipped over in tests.
</P>
<P>
The Stuttgart-based parent company said some 3,000 of the new
Mercedes compacts, which went on sale just a few days ago, have
already been delivered. They will be recalled and refitted with
new tires and an electronic stability program.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference called to discuss the A-Class's safety,
Daimler-Benz car division chief Juergen Hubbert said the tires
fitted to the A-Class were too soft and could make the car
unstable during quick evasive turns.
</P>
<P>
The A-Class became the object of intense scrutiny about its
safety after Swedish motoring magazine Teknikens Varld flipped one
of the cars during tests, injuring the driver.
</P>
<P>
The car rolled over when the driver made a sharp left turn
while traveling at a speed of 60 kilometers per hour.
</P>
<P>
Daimler said the refitting would cost 57.5 million U.S. dollars
a year, but it would not raise the price of the car, which sells
for around 30,000 German marks (17,100 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The A-class is a five-door hatchback designed to compete with
the best selling Volkswagen Golf. It is a new product for Mercedes
which has traditionally built larger saloons and sports models.
</P>
<P>
The company said the A-class models have been tested
extensively without incident. Orders for the new car extend into
the middle of next year.

HONG KONG, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Legislators of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR) today voted for a motion
supporting SAR Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa's recent policy
address and approved a package of bills.
</P>
<P>
At its plenary session held this afternoon, the 60-member
Provisional Legislative Council (PLC) voted for the "motion of

feasible long-term plans for the SAR's development.
</P>
<P>
Before the voting, Administrative Secretary of the SAR
government Anson Chan told the legislators that Tung had
underlined four priorities in the address, including economy,
housing, education and care for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
She stressed that the address fully demonstrated the principle
of "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
Following her speech, several other senior SAR government
officials explained the policy address in details and briefed the
PLC on their departments' concrete implementation plans.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> GCC States Halve Budget Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC) countries have cut in half their budget deficits between
1993 and 1996, said a report released by the United Arab Emirates
(UAE) Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
The budget shortfall in the six-member alliance was slashed
from around 20.7 billion U.S. dollars in 1993 to 10.9 billion
dollars last year, said the report obtained here today.
</P>
<P>
It attributes this to a pick-up in oil prices which rebounded
from 16 dollars per barrel in 1995 to 20.5 dollars a barrel in
1996. The improvement has enabled the GCC states to earn a 13-year
high of 83 billion dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
The report pointed out that a sharp reduction in most of the
GCC states' expenditures also helped them to narrow their budget
gap.
</P>
<P>
The GCC states which include Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Kuwait,
Bahrain, Qatar and Oman were forced to trim their spending due to
weak oil prices before 1996.
</P>
<P>
The spending cuts were offset by stronger private sector
involvement in the domestic economies and this boosted their
combined Gross Domestic Product to 238 billion dollars in 1996
from around 203 billion dollars in 1992, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The international reserves of the GCC are also recovering,
standing at 24.6 billion dollars at the end of June. This
compares with around 19 billion dollars in 1992, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Oil-reliant GCC states have been reeling under fluctuating
crude prices and huge payments for a U.S.-led multinational
coalition which evicted Iraq from Kuwait in the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Their budgets suffered from a record deficit of nearly 63
billion dollars in 1991.

MOSCOW, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the Russian State
Duma (Lower House) Gennady said today that the status of the
Dnestr region should be settled through negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Moldova can seek various ways to settle the status of the
Dnestr region, such as setting up an autonomous region, republic
or federation, a report from the capital of Moldova Kishinev
quoted Seleznev, who is paying an official visit in Moldova, as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Russia will make an effort to broker negotiations on the
matter, which is an internal issue of Moldova, Seleznev stressed.
</P>
<P>
The separatists in the eastern Dnestr region bordering
southwest Ukraine declared independence in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people were killed when fighting broke out in 1992
between Kishinev and Dnestr's mainly Slav separatists. They were
afraid that with the collapse of the Soviet Union, Moldova might
unite with ethnic kin in neighboring Romania to the west.

<HEADLINE> Seoul Stocks Rise, Won Tumbles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Share prices on the Seoul bourse
rose 2.29 percent today to regain the lost 500-point level, but the
South Korean won fell further against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The market started off with a plunge of 8 points, continuing
its decline from the previous four days. Immediately after the
opening, however, the overnight strong rebound on Wall Street, as
well as the news of the recovery of the Hang Seng Index, buoyed
investors' sentiment.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark South Korea Stock Price Index (KOSPI) rose 11.36
points to close at 506.65.
</P>
<P>
However, market observers cautioned that the local market is
extremely sensitive to outside factors, including moves of the
global markets.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, despite renewed governmental resolve for "direct"
intervention, the South Korean won fell today to their daily limit
lows against the dollar for the second consecutive day.
</P>
<P>
The won opened at 956.00 won to the greenback and fell to an
allowable low of 964.00 won in just 40 minutes of trading,
bringing all transaction to a near halt amid no sell orders for
dollars, currency dealers said.
</P>
<P>
Since December 1995, the Central Bank of Korea has allowed the
won to move within a daily range of plus or minus 2.5 percent from
the previous day's closing. The South Korean currency closed at
957.60 won per dollar Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean won has depreciated about 13 percent from
December 31, 1996 when it was posted at 844.20 won to U.S. currency.
</P>
<P>
Alarmed by the won's sharp plunge against the U.S. dollar in
two days, market participants here raised doubt over whether the
monetary authorities have given up intervening in the
domestic foreign-exchange market to defend the won.
</P>
<P>
A central bank official, however, strongly refuted such an
allegation, saying that the central bank would continue to step in
to the market to keep the won-dollar parity rate at a proper level.
</P>
<P>
Some dealers cautiously warned that the won would fall below
the 1,000-won level to the dollar in a few days, not by the end of
this year, if the government leaves the current situation
untouched.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Hong Kong Stock Market Rebounds, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong stock market
rallied today after an amazing recovery in Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
The key Hang Seng Index rocketed 1,705 points, or 18.8 percent
today, recouping all the devastating losses on Tuesday. The
rebound, the biggest single-day gain both in terms of points and
percentage, pushed the blue-chip index up to 10,765 points. Stock
prices plummeted more than 1,400 points Tuesday, the heaviest
point loss in history.
</P>
<P>
The sharp rise today showed that the confidence of investors
was picking up, but the market will still be volatile in the short
run, said a securities analyst. In the last few days, many listed
companies purchased their own shares as the prices had fallen to
the bottom.
</P>
<P>
"Confidence is the most decisive factor that will influence the
direction of the stock market in the next few weeks," Brian
Parker, head of Hong Kong Research of Credit Lyonnais Securities
Asia, told Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
Parker said positive signs have now emerged as Wall Street
rebounded, Hong Kong's primary interest rates, once jacked up to
record levels, began to scale down and the market has never been
cheaper to offer opportunities for bargain hunting.
</P>
<P>
He refused to predict when the market is going to bottom out,
but estimated that it would swing around the fair level of 12,000
points.
</P>
<P>
The recent severe downturn in the Hong Kong stock market was
triggered by international speculators, who wanted to flush
investors out of the market, which reached its peak of above
16,000 points in early August, said Russell Napier, regional
strategist of Credit Lyonnais Securities Asia.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that some international funds attacked the Hong
Kong currency's peg to the greenback and in turn interest rates in
 Hong Kong were forced up to a record high. The eventual result
was that stock investors became panic and sold off shares to
throw the market into a free fall.
</P>
<P>
However, Napier maintained an optimistic outlook for the Hong
Kong market. Hong Kong remains a very profitable place to do
business despite its high costs and China plays a unique role in
boosting Hong Kong's competitiveness, he said.

over 50 passengers were Chinese and foreign media.
</P>
<P>
Local hotel managers are happy these days as all beds in hotels

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Industrialists Facing New Challenges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong needs to expand
into higher value-added, technology-intensive activities in order
to stay ahead of its competitors, a high-ranking official of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) said here today.
</P>
<P>
K C Kwong, HKSAR secretary for treasury, told a group of local
young industrialists that Hong Kong's competitive edge lies in its
position as the gateway to China.
</P>
<P>
But he cautioned: "Hong Kong will not be making the best use of
our position as an SAR of China if we merely continue to rely only
on the supply of relatively cheap land and labor in the mainland."
</P>
<P>
Over the past two decades, Hong Kong businessmen have moved on
a large scale their manufacturing operations to southern China and
later to the inland parts of the country to take advantage of the
lower costs of land and labor there.
</P>
<P>
Now Hong Kong manufacturers employ more than 7 million workers
in the inland areas while Hong Kong has become a service center
that concentrates on product design, marketing, financing,
insurance and shipping. The result is a winning formula that has
strengthened Hong Kong's competitiveness, Kwong noted.
</P>
<P>
He urged Hong Kong's young industrialists to continue to
develop and adopt new technology, tap high value-added fields and
make full use of the knowledge and expertise from China's inland
areas.

<HEADLINE> SKorea, EU Agree on Talks on Recognition of Standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 29 (Xinhua) -- South Korea and the European
Union (EU) agreed today to negotiate an agreement on mutual
recognition of industrial standards.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was outlined during the 13th South Korea-EU
ministrial meeting between the two delegations, which were
respectively led by South Korean Foreign Minister Yoo Chong-ha and
Leon Brittan, EU's vice president and commissioner for external
relations, said ministry spokesman Lee Kyu-hyung.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed to hold seminars in Seoul and Brussels to
explain the two markets' recognition systems to members of their
business communities, said Lee.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, they also agreed to set up a program to coordinate
exchange visits of businessmen and launch a separate working-level
meeting on industrial cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In a move to promote mutual trade and investment, the EU
promised to allow South Korean companies to use BC-net, the
information network of small- and medium-sized firms of the EU,
beginning in 1998, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
The EU agreed to end sometime soon the anti-dumping tariffs on
South Korean-made DRAM chips, video tapes and color TV units, and
also to import Samgyetang, a traditional Korean-style chicken soup
with Ginseng and other herbs, he said.
</P>
<P>
The EU urged South Korea to ease inspections on imported
cosmetics, simplify quarantine and customs procedures and further
open its auto market to foreign auto makers.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean side said Seoul has made efforts to facilitate
foreign access to its auto market, explaining that a recent
decrease in foreign car sales in South Korea was a result of the
country's economic difficulties.
</P>
<P>
The EU delegation reaffirmed EU's support for four-way talks on
a permanent peace on the Korean Peninsula, promising that the EU,
which joined the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization
(KEDO) earlier this year, would continue to play an active role to
help maintain peace and stability on the peninsula.
</P>
<P>
During the annual ministerial meeting, the two sides agreed to
hold regular policy dialogues on major international issues and to
strengthen cooperation in politics, the economy and security, Lee
said.
</P>
<P>
Before the meeting, Brittan and South Korean Information and
Communication Minister Kang Bong-kyun signed an agreement on
opening their communications equipment procurement markets to each
other.

<HEADLINE> Hu Jintao Calls for Stronger Grassroots Party Branches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Senior Communist Party leader
Hu Jintao said today that to strengthen the Party's grassroots
organizations is crucial if the tasks for rural areas put forward
by the Party's 15th National Congress are to be fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a national conference on the building of the Party's
grassroots untis in rural areas, Hu, a member of the Standing
Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China
(CPC) Central Committee, urged local Party officials to be
clear-minded about the current rural situation and work to improve
grassroots Party organizations in the countryside.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three years, improvements have been made of rural
Party branches. Reviewing work in this regard, Hu said that a
large number of officials who have expertise in rural work have
matured, along with increasing accumulation of experience on Party
building in the rural areas, thus providing good conditions for
further advancement of rural reforms and development.
</P>
<P>
He noted that agriculture is the foundation of the national
economy. Only qualified Party grassroots units in the countryside
can unite farmers around the Party and government, so that the
Party's policies can be implemented well in the rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Further work in this regard must be guided by the theme of the
Party's 15th National Congress, Deng Xiaoping Theory and the rural
policies of the CPC Central Committee, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
The building of rural Party branches should be aimed at
boosting agriculture and rural economy, raising the income of
farmers, and deepening rural reforms, he said.

<P>
WASHINGTON, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- A day before getting down to the serious diplomatic work
of his first state visit to Washington, President Jiang Zemin of
China wrapped himself in the culture of Colonial Williamsburg,
where the way of life of 18th century America is recreated in
traditional architecture, old-fashioned dress and modern tourism.
</P>
<P>
-- Main street rode in to rescue Wall street as America's
amateur investors rushed to buy stocks, halting the global
financial free fall that began last week. The Dow Jones
industrial average soared 4.7 percent, the greatest gain in more
than a decade and the sixth-largest ever.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton and Chinese President Jiang Zemin began
the first U.S.-Sino summit in eight years on an informal note
last night, huddling in the White House for almost two hours in
what administration officials described as a broad and
philosophical conversation. Both presidents endorsed a permanent
"hot line" between the two capitals.
</P>
<P>
-- Major stock markets in Europe and Latin America were given a
boost by Wall Street's record-setting gains on Tuesday, and the
volatile Asian markets rebounded with strong rallies. In Hong Kong
the key Hang Seng index shot up dramatically in the morning
session on Wednesday, climbing more than 16 percent, after losing
nearly 14 percent the day before.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- In a sweeping reaffirmation of their love affair with
stocks, investors on Tuesday besieged Wall Street with buy
orders, smashing records for the single-biggest point gain in
the Dow Jones industrial average and the biggest trading day on
the New York Stock Exchange. This sent important signals about
investor confidence in the U.S. economy, the resilience of the
seven-year-old bull market and the ability of financial
industry in handle sudden shifts in sentiment and huge volumes
of trading.

<HEADLINE> Eco-Tourism Urged to Be Highlighted in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Tourism and Wildlife
Minister Protas Momanyi today called on African governments and
world experts to make efforts together to boost eco-tourism in
the whole Africa.
</P>
<P>
"The new approach and direction for tourism in general are
steered by the growing interest in eco-tourism," Momanyi noted at
the ongoing eco-tourism international conference, which, he said,
is the first-ever on the continent.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the Kenyan government and all stake-holders in
the industry to "work in unity towards a commercial environment
which allows eco-tourism to be entrenched as a tourism business
norm" in the country.
</P>
<P>
"This new policy direction fosters bio-diversity conservation
through partnerships among local, national and international
interests," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the conference makes a remarked contribution to
Africa's eco-tourism agenda by bringing together world experts to
exchange ideas and experiences in the field.
</P>
<P>
Tourism has become the largest civil industry in the world and
will continue to swell up with nature-based eco-tourism,
participants noted at the conference which opened here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Eco-tourism, defined by the Eco-tourism Society as
"responsible travel to natural areas that conserves the
environment and sustains the well-being of local people," was
first popularized in Latin America and then rooted in Africa in
1970s.
</P>
<P>
The eco-tourism experience can be dated from nature tourism
which has flourished in the national parks of the Untied States
for over 100 years.
</P>
<P>
Nowadays eco-tourism, which focuses on the industry's quality
instead of quantity and try to have local communities benefited
from relevant natural resources, is representing the main trend
of future world travel market, experts say.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, with the theme as "Eco-tourism -- Charting the
Way Forward," was focused on how to draft eco-tourism principles
and improve eco-tourism operation on the continent in the next
century and global and regional case studies on successful
eco-tourism models.
</P>
<P>
On the sidelines of the conference was an exhibition of
community-based tourism activities, showcasing the unique
heritage, handicrafts and tourism development efforts of Kenya's
40-plus diverse cultures.
</P>
<P>
More than 260 delegates from the U.S., Britain, South Africa,
Mexico, Brazil, Belize, Tanzania, Swaziland, Uganda, Australia,
Botswana, Namibia, Mozambique, Malawi, Zimbabwe and other
countries attended the meeting, which is to end on November 3.
</P>
<P>
World tourism hit a record high to 1996 with 593 million
international tourist arrivals, up 4.6 percent from the previous
year, according to the latest data from the World Tourism
Organization.

MOSCOW, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Uzbekistan's gross
domestic product in the first nine months was up 4.9 percent
compared with the same period of last year, the Interfax news
agency reported today from Tashkent, capital of Uzbekistan.
</P>

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Time to Wake Asia to Threat of AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 29 (Xinhua) -- An HIV/AIDS epidemic can be
possibly averted in Asia, the region of emerging economic tigers
and populous countries, only if it wakes up in time and
intensifies its campaign against the deadly disease.
</P>
<P>
This is an opinion shared by many medical practitioners, AIDS
activists and researchers during the five-day Fourth International
Congress on AIDS in Asia and the Pacific, which ended here today.
</P>
<P>
And AIDS (acquired immuno-deficiency syndrome) is caused by the
human immuno-deficiency virus (HIV) and the late-stage HIV
infection, characterized by a severely weakened immune system.
</P>
<P>
Although HIV/AIDS is "traveling faster than ever" in Asia, hope
still exists for Asia to tame it since the dreaded disease is
still at an early stage in most Asian countries and an earlier
expected upsurge in infections has not yet occurred, they said.
</P>
<P>
During the last three years, the estimated HIV infections in
the region have doubled to between 5 million to 7 million,
according to the latest data from the U.N. Joint Program Against
AIDS (UNAIDS).
</P>
<P>
Asia is widely seen to be the next "flash point" for HIV/AIDS
in the coming years mainly due to its large populations, with the
total number of HIV infections expected to double again by the end
of this century, if no immediate actions are taken against the
virus.
</P>
<P>
But Perter Piot, executive director of UNAIDS, said that
considering the current low HIV incidence, the present time is
opportune for the region to take actions in averting what could
develop into a situation as serious as that in Africa.
</P>
<P>
"This is the grim face of AIDS that Africa had little chance to
prevent and one that Asia and the Pacific can still avert if the
region wakes up in time," he said.
</P>
<P>
Of the 22.6 million people living with HIV and AIDS around the
world, 14 million are in Africa.
</P>
<P>
If a major HIV/AIDS epidemic strikes Asia, the region's current
economic revitalization drive will be jeopardized and prospects of
its future prosperity dimmed, delegates warned.
</P>
<P>
"The AIDS epidemic is the enemy of Asian economic promise. It
threatens in a material way the progress that Asia has made over
the past several decades," said Peter Sullivan, vice president of
the Asian Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
"It imposes huge economic costs on societies, families and
individuals and endangers the economic development of Asian
countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Piot noted that apart from agony to families and individuals,
the deadly pandemic can slow down the economy by bringing about
huge direct medical costs, labor and market losses and increasing
poverty.
</P>
<P>
Taking Cambodia and Indonesia for instance, Piot said most
Asian countries could not afford to the high costs of an AIDS
epidemic in the future.
</P>
<P>
He said Cambodia, one of the poor countries in the world, could
lose 2.8 billion U.S. dollars if it could not prevent infections
of a projected 200,000 toward the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
Delegates also agreed that increased political commitment,
enhanced regional cooperation and intensified prevention campaign
are the key for the region to combating HIV and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Despite small victories in some countries such as Thailand and
the Philippines in curbing the spread of HIV/AIDS, Piot said every
government should shatter complacency, bring AIDS to national
consciousness and put the anti-AIDS campaign on its political
agenda.
</P>
<P>
Delegates also urged policy makers to spend more on AIDS
prevention, and boldly push regional anti-AIDS cooperation since
AIDS is a cross-border issue.
</P>
<P>
"Ultimately, Asia can meet the AIDS challenge if it uses
existing knowledge, existing tools and best practices," Piot
predicted. But he warned, "Not to take full advantage of all that
would be a tragedy of historic proportions for Asia's billions."

<HEADLINE> Sewage Handling Plants to Be Built in Three Gorges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Chongqing, the newest
municipality in China, will invest heavily to protect the local
environment by building more plants to handle polluted water,
according to a senior local government official.
</P>
<P>
The municipality plans to invest 4 billion yuan in sewage
disposal projects in the coming five years, so as to dispel fears
that the ongoing Three Gorges Dam Project will further contaminate
the environment.
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview with Xinhua, Deputy Mayor Gan Yuping said
that the project will use local resources as well as foreign
funds, including World Bank loans.
</P>
<P>
Substantial measures include building large facilities to
handle the domestic sewage and control the industrial
pollution. All local enterprises in Chongqing will be required to
reach the standards on sewage discharge by 2002, according to the
official.
</P>
<P>
"Chongqing is going to clean the branches of the Yangtze River
to ensure the water quality," Gan said.
</P>
<P>
The environment protection plans in the Three Gorges area have
gained support from the central government, which has decided to
reinforce the construction of the shelter-forests on the upper and
middle reaches of the Yangtze River to conserve water and prevent
soil erosion.
</P>
<P>
"The sewage handling capacity in the whole Three Gorges area
is expected to reach one million tons per day in a few years,"
deputy-director of the Yangtze River Three Gorges Construction
Committee Guo Shuyan told Xinhua
</P>
<P>
"Chinese-made equipment will be mainly used in these
water-handling projects, but key equipment will be imported. This
offers a good opportunity for the foreign manufacturers," he added.
</P>
<P>
China is building the country's largest hydro-power project in
the Three Gorges area in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River to
control floods, generate electricity, and facilitate shipping.

<HEADLINE> Israel Not Ready for Washington Peace Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy has to delay his travel to the United States
until next week because today's Israeli inner Cabinet meeting
failed to reach guidelines for future negotiations with
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The abortive Cabinet meeting, that is expected to continue
discussions next week, ruled out the possibility of a meeting to
be held at the end of the month between Levy and Palestinian
deputy leader Mamoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Levy has said that only after the parameters for concessions
that Israel is expected to make and the commitments to be
undertaken by the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) are defined
by the Cabinet, he will be able to leave for Washington.
</P>
<P>
The local media disclosed the meeting between Levy and Abbas
will not be feasible until late November or early December.
</P>
<P>
This is because U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is
scheduled to attend the World Economic Forum's Middle East and
North Africa economic conference due to open in Qatar on November
16 and can not host Israeli-Palestinian negotiations in the
mid-November.
</P>
<P>
Levy conferred with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Monday
on three main issues which he wants specific instructions: a
"time-out" on settlement activity; further redeployment of Israeli
troops in the West Bank and preparations for the final status
talks.
</P>
<P>
On the Palestinian side, PNA President Yasser Arafat said
Monday that the PNA withheld a decision about whether to attend
next week's planned talks in Washington until Israel decides.
</P>
<P>
"We have to wait for the final resolution from the Israeli side
to decide if we will go to this meeting or not," Arafat
said.

CAIRO, October 29 (Xinhua) -- A Sudanese minister today
stressed the need of dialog with Cairo to solve Egyptian-Sudanese
problems and improve bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Sudanese Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Mustafa Othman
Ismail made the remark following talks between Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak and visiting Sudanese First Vice President el-Zubeir
Mohammad Salih.
</P>
<P>
"President Mubarak has a marked understanding of Sudan's
issues...Our relationship is distinguished and time-honored," he
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Mubarak highlighted the importance of
maintaining Sudan's stability and unity, while Zubeir briefed him
on the developments in his country, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
In a move seen as a Sudanese overture to mend fence with Egypt,
Salih arrived here this morning on a lightning visit to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that Sudanese-Egyptian ties will be put back on track
for the good of the two peoples," the minister said, adding that
the Sudanese delegation will convey Mubarak's views to the
Sudanese leadership.
</P>
<P>
Ahead of Salih's visit, Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir told
the parliament earlier this month that his government seeks
improving battered ties with neighboring countries, especially
"sister Egypt." His initiative drew support from the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of the two countries met late last month
on the fringe of the U.N. General Assembly meeting, signaling that
the two countries are working to move towards better ties.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Sudanese Information Minister Tabib Ibrahim
Mohammed Khair, also called for talks with Egypt to resolve
disputes between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Sudan and Egypt have contested ownership of Halaib, a triangle
of land located between the two countries, since Sudan's
independence in 1956.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese government also took over the Cairo University
campus in Khartoum, renaming the institution Neelein, or the two
Niles.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Egypt and Sudan have been strained since
el-Bashir took power in Sudan in 1989 and worsened in 1995 when
Cairo accused Khartoum of involvement in an assassination attempt
on Mubarak in Addis Ababa.

Cairo accused Khartoum of involvement in an assassination attempt
on Mubarak in Addis Ababa.

<HEADLINE> India to Make Rupee Convertible by 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Indian Finance Minister P.
Chidambaram has said the Indian currency, the rupee, will be made
fully and freely convertible by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
"India is on way to making the rupee fully and freely
convertible to any currency by the year 2000," the Press Trust of
India quoted Chidambaram as saying at an international conference
on finance and infrastructure here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The rupee, which is currently convertible on the current
account, will be extended to the capital account as well, the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed optimism that India would be able to wipe out
poverty from the country by the year 2020 if the present growth
rate of 7 percent sustains.
</P>
<P>
By then, the country will have raised its per capita gross
domestic product from the current 350 U.S. dollars to 1,500
dollars, providing enough resources to eliminate poverty, he said.

<HEADLINE> Reporters Shown Around Construction Site of Three Gorges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Kim Sang-Chul could not help
marveling at the grandeur of the scene, though it was the third
time for the correspondent of the Republic of Korea to visit the
construction site of the Three Gorges water conservation project.
</P>
<P>
Speaking fluent Chinese, the Beijing Bureau correspondent of
the Munhwa Broadcasting Corp. of the Republic of Korea said that
the Three Gorges project will surely "make a great contribution to
China's future."
</P>
<P>
It will enhance flood-control along the middle reaches of the
Yangtze River, and the hydropower station will be the largest in
the world, he said, predicting that a tourism site will emerge
here and local residents will benefit from an abundance of job
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Kim Sang-Chul, more than 20 reporters from a
dozen Hong Kong newspapers and from the China branches of news
organizations of countries such as Britain, France, Finland and
Ireland visited the construction site today.
</P>
<P>
The tour was sponsored by the Information Office of the State
Council just before the final damming of China's longest river on
November 8.
</P>
<P>
Li Junlin, a senior engineer with the China Yangtze River Three
Gorges Development Corp., was bombarded with reporters' questions
during their three-hour visit.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five days, the reporters had visited some
reservoir areas in Chongqing, Fuling and Wanxian to cover the
resettlement of local residents, environmental protection and the
protection of cultural relics in the area.
</P>
<P>
Kim Sang-Chul said that the TV station where he is employed
often airs programs related to the Three Gorges, for people in his
country show much interest in the gigantic flood-control and
hydro-power project in their neighboring country.
</P>
<P>
Conor O'Clery, an Asia correspondent of the Irish times, said
his countrymen feel the same.
</P>
<P>
The Irish are interested in events in China, and almost all of
them have heard about the Yangtze River and the Three Gorges
project, he said.
</P>
<P>
The scale, technology and construction speed left a deep
impression on him, and the resettlement of local residents is an
intriguing topic for the press. So, the Irish Times will set aside
a whole page for him to cover the project, he said.
</P>
<P>
Isaac H. Y. Tam, a reporter with the Sing Tao Daily in Hong
Kong, said that the newspaper will publish a special edition on
the day of the damming's completion.

<HEADLINE> Asia-Pacific Congress on AIDS Ends in Manila </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The Fourth International
Congress on AIDS in Asia and the Pacific ended here today with
calls for enhanced regional cooperation and more government
budgets for fighting against the disease.
</P>
<P>
"We hereby resolve to build a sustainable network of exchange
and collaboration (in the anti-AIDS campaign)," said the Manila
Manifesto, which was adopted at the end of the five-day congress.
</P>
<P>
The manifesto committed to increasing the allocation of funds
in national and local budgets through innovation and advocacy and
developing a strategy for the sustainable provision of appropriate
treatments and social support for all people infected with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The manifesto also called for more attention to vulnerability,
risk and harm reduction relating to HIV/AIDS and for abolishing
the sexual exploitation of children, youth and women.
</P>
<P>
HIV is the human immuno-deficiency virus that causes AIDS
(acquired immuno-deficiency syndrome).
</P>
<P>
The congress, attended by nearly 3,000 delegates from 65
countries and regions, discussed the status of HIV/AIDS in the
Asia-Pacific region, socio-economic impacts related to HIV/AIDS in
the region and ways to check the spread of the lethal disease.
</P>
<P>
In parallel to the meeting, a mammoth exhibition was held to
display publications about and medicines and efforts made by all
countries against the disease.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released by the U.N. Joint Program Against
AIDS, about 5 million to 7 million people are believed to be
living with HIV in the Asia-Pacific region, out of an estimated
total of 22.6 million HIV-affected persons worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The Fifth International Congress on AIDS in the Asia and the
Pacific will be held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, in 1999.

<HEADLINE> China's Bu Ends 15,000 KM Centennial Olympic Tour (Updated) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese journalist Bu Fanzhou
Wednesday completed a 15,000 km bicycle journey in Sydney after
visiting each of the 21 host cities of the Summer Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Bu, a 39-year-old journalist for the China Sports magazine,
took a 16 month journey and was met in front of the Sydney Opera
House by John Coates, president of the Australian Olympic
Committee, Phil Coles, member of the International Olympic
Committee, and Hua Junduo, Chinese Ambassador to Australia.
</P>
<P>
His mission was to experience both mentally and physically what
the Olympic spirit entails. He diarised his experience and taken
about 20,000 pictures.
</P>
<P>
The journey, or as he put it, the Centennial Olympic Tour, has
long been a dream of Bu.
</P>
<P>
He said it is the first time a journalist has retraced the
history of the modern Olympic Games by cycling to all host cities.
</P>
<P>
"It was a dream for me to take the Olympic tour," Bu told
reporters in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
"And also it's a very difficult jouney, especially in Mexico
City where I was robbed of my Nikon camera by two gunmen who got
on the taxi he was traveling in broad daylight."
</P>
<P>
The taxi driver was apparently part of the robbery plot, he
said.
</P>
<P>
But most of his tour was pleasant for him. He said he could not
forget a Korean girl who offered to lead the way last winter to
Seoul, the capital of South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The girl, a sports teacher, drove a car in front of him at a
speed of about 15 km an hour, and helped him, who speaks some
English, overcome language problems during part of his journey in
the country.
</P>
<P>
"I asked her why she offered to help me, a stranger, and she
replied 'you don't know the way to Seoul and does not understand
the local language. You need help. That's it'," Bu recalled.
</P>
<P>
He said he covered part of his tour by plane or ship.
</P>
<P>
With a tent in his bag, he started his journey on July 1 last
year in Athens, the home of the modern Olympics and the host city
of the 2004 Games.
</P>
<P>
Bu traveled through 17 countries on four continents, including
Greece, the United States, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Spain,
Italy, Germany, Holland, Belgium, France, Britain, Sweden,
Finland, Russia, Canada and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
The graduate from Beijing University has been a sports
journalist and photographer with the China Sports magazine since
1985.

<HEADLINE> Jordan: Ties With Israel Damaged by Likud Acts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Frustrated by the stalled Mideast
talks and enraged by a bungled Israeli spy action in Amman, Jordan
admitted that ties with Israel have been damaged three years after
a bilateral peace treaty was signed.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Cairo-based Voice of Arabs Radio today,
Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul-Salam Majali accused Israel of
supporting state terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Israel claimed a fight against terrorism while it was involved
in terrorism itself, he said, alluding to last month's failed
attempt by Israeli intelligent agents on a Hamas leader Khalid
Mashaal in Amman.
</P>
<P>
"Such Israeli actions in addition to the Likud government's
intransigence vis-a-vis the peace process have negatively affected
Jordanian-Israeli ties," he said.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Jordan's King Hussein, Israel's closest Arab friend,
also expressed frustration over the policies of Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has frequently criticized Netanyahu for stalemate in the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and Egypt are the only two Arab countries that signed
peace treaties with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov's Amman
trip, Majali said Jordan felt a Russian readiness to play a more
active role in the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The Russian official has not submitted a fresh initiative but
discussed ways of pushing forward the negotiating process, Majali
said in the interview conducted on the phone from Amman.

PARIS, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Semi-retired Boris Becker
admitted that he had planned a full schedule for the first three
months of next season.
</P>
<P>
The German tennis hero will start his season in Dubai and play
a few indoor tournaments after that. Scottsdale, Key Biscayne and
maybe Indian Wells are also to be taken into account.
</P>
<P>
The former world No.1 player will face Pete Sampras, current

on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The triple Wimbledon champion announced this summer his
quitting in next year's Wimbledon tournament when he was upset by
Sampras. Becker said he was almost sure of his last appearance of
the Open in Paris.
</P>
<P>
Becker has won 49 singles titles during his career, containing
1985, 1986 and 1989 Wimbledon triumphs, 1991 and 1996 Australian
Opens wins and a United States Open champion in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Meets Indonesian Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, October 29 (Xinhua) -- China pays close attention to
developing a long-term and stable relationship with Indonesia and
other members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) marked by good-neighborliness and mutual cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Premier Li Peng made the remark here today in a meeting
with Bacharudin Jusuf Habibie, Indonesia's state minister for
research and technology.
</P>
<P>
Li said that Indonesia has worked for the development of
friendly relations between members of the ASEAN and China and
China-ASEAN ties as a whole over the past years -- something China
appreciates very much.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that China and the ASEAN members will
increase mutual understanding, trust and cooperation in the years
to come.
</P>
<P>
Li recalled his meeting with Habibie during a visit to
Indonesia in Bandung in 1990, when the two countries restored
their diplomatic relations. Since then, they have seen a steady
development in the bilateral relationship, and reached some
important agreements on both regional and international issues, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government stresses the need to advance science and
technology, Li said. He also pointed out that national
revitalization through science and education and sustained
development have been listed as two strategies for China's
economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
He said that China has established cooperative relations on
science and technology with more than 130 countries or regions,
and is fully prepared to expand cooperation with Indonesia in
science, technology and other areas on the basis of equality,
mutual benefit and complementary advantages.
</P>
<P>
Habibie told Li Peng that Indonesian President Soeharto
underlines the importance of relations with China, and hopes that
the two countries will bolster bilateral cooperation in the areas
of economy, culture, science and technology, and increase
personnel exchanges.
</P>
<P>
President Soeharto also believes that the two countries should
approach their relationship with a view toward the 21st century,
Habibie said.

<P>
TUNIS, October 29 (Xinhua) -- South African President Nelson
Mandela arrived this morning in the Libyan town of Zuwara, 120
kilometers west of Tripoli, for a second meeting with Libyan
leader Muammar Gaddafi in a week.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi welcomed Mandela on his arrival, the Jamahiriya News
Agency of Libya said.
</P>
<P>
During his two-day visit to Libya last week on his way to
attend the Commonwealth summit in Britain, Mandela held talks with
Gaddafi last Wednesday night on ways of developing bilateral ties
and a number of regional issues.
</P>
<P>
The agency added that Gaddafi and Mandela will hold talks to
examine developments of the Lockerbie issue involving Libya, and
the U.S. and Britain.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council imposed an air ban on Libya in 1992
to force the surrender of two Libyans wanted in the 1988 bombing
of Pan AM flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, which killed 270
people.

<HEADLINE> SKorea Opens Bond Market to Encourage Foreign Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 29 (Xinhua) -- In a desperate move to stabilize
the shaky financial sector, the South Korean government will open
the domestic bond market wider and earlier than scheduled, a top
economic policy-maker said today.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance and Economy Kang
Kyong-shik said in a special statement that the government will
also encourage private enterprises to drastically expand their
offshore borrowing.
</P>
<P>
Kang also called on investors to refrain from foreign currency
speculation and "impulsively" selling off stocks.
</P>
<P>
As parts of the effort to stabilize the foreign exchange
market, Kang said the government will speed up the time for
opening the long-term corporate bond market to early next year
instead of the originally-scheduled 1999 or soon thereafter.
</P>
<P>
Investment limits on large companies' non-guaranteed
convertible bonds (CBs) will be raised from the current 30 percent
for all foreign investors to 50 percent and from 6 percent for
individual investors to 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
For non-guaranteed CBs and medium- and long-term bonds issued by
small businesses, the existing foreign investment limits will be
lifted.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the current instability in the foreign exchange
market has been triggered by indiscriminate buying of U.S. dollars
by domestic financial institutions, Kang said the government will
impose a purchase limit to deter speculation.
</P>
<P>
Unlike widespread expectations, however, the government has
decided not to mobilize any special central bank loans to
stabilize the local bourse. Neither was an additional increase in
the foreign equity ownership limit included in the special
measures, said financial analysts.
</P>
<P>
Instead, Kang encouraged pension funds and institutional
players to invest in the sagging bourse.
</P>
<P>
He said despite the latest jitters in stock and money markets,
the nation's macro-economic fundamentals are constantly improving.
</P>
<P>
The lack of a dignified market booster, however, may dash cold
water on the local bourse, which showed a minor gain on the day
due to a technical rebound and hopes of a more drastic boosting
package, analysts said.

HONG KONG, October 29 (Xinhua) -- More than 100 exhibitors from
17 countries and regions are displaying their
writing equipment and paper products at an international trade
fair opened today at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition
Center.
</P>
<P>
The International Trade Fair for Stationery, Office Supplies
and Educational Systems (Pen &AMP; Paper), which runs until October
31, has attracted 107 exhibitors from Hong Kong, China's mainland,
France, Germany, Hungary, India, Italy, Malaysia, Pakistan, the
Philippines, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, Taiwan, the United
Kingdom, the United States and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The fair, organized by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council
(HKTDC) and the German company of Messe Frankfurt (HK), features
an extensive array of latest products in five categories: writing
equipment, paper and paper products, office supplies, artist
equipment, and educational equipment.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of the fair, HKTDC's Executive
Director Michael Sze noted that while Asian economies are growing
at impressive rates, incomes are rising and demand for more
sophisticated products, like stationery, is rising as well.
</P>
<P>
"Asia's growth is also fueling demand for upgraded office
supplies and up to date business systems. And in the West, demand
is also up due to an expanding home office market, particularly in
the United States," Sze said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the fair not only strongly reconfirms Hong Kong's
status as the trade fair capital of the region but also
strengthens Hong Kong's position as the regional center for the
industry.

civil servants, said on Tuesday at a ceremony on the issuing of
three volume of new Putonghua textbooks that learning Putonghua
has become a fashion among Macao civil servants now.

Macao-born Portuguese servants, and those from Portugal who have
decided to stay on after 1999.
</P>
<P>
When they finish the Putonghua training course at the institute
after learning all nine volumes of textbooks, they will be at
about the same level as senior middle school graduates in China's
inland, Lei said.
</P>
<P>
The first four volumes of the textbooks have been published by
the institute in cooperation with the Department of Administration
and Personnel. The remaining will be published soon.

<HEADLINE> Mozambian Newspaper Condemned Coup Attempt in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique's newspaper,
Noticias, in a commentary today, condemned the attempted coup
in Zambia, saying that violence should never be taken as means
to solve pressing problems in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The commentary said that the short-fated coup in
Lusaka Tuesday is "worrisome to not only Zambia, but the southern
African nations as a whole".
</P>
<P>
It said that though Zambian President Frederick Chiluba has
been under strong criticism from the opposition at home, violence
should not be taken in solving their differences, since violence begets
violence.
</P>
<P>
The failled military coup in Zambia, like a potential virus,
will directly threaten the stability in Southern African region,
the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
It said, "People should not take the attempted coup in Zambia
as a sheer internal issue, governments in southern African
nations should reflect on it."
</P>
<P>
In the past few months, stability in the southern African
region had been endangered by the civil war in former Zaire, it
said.
</P>
<P>
" We hold that conflict should be solved through dialogue. We
don't stand for violence, much less foreign interference which
often conveys an expansionist desire," the commentary noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano in a
statement Tuesday, also denounce the attempted coup in Zambia.

<HEADLINE> No Massive Redemption by Funds in Equity Market, Managers Say </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 29 (Xinhua) -- There was no massive
redemption by mutual funds in the past week on the severely
battered Hong Kong stock market as well as other major bourses
across the world, fund managers said here today.
</P>
<P>
"Fund is a long-term savings vehicle," said Chris Russell from
the Hong Kong Investment Funds Association, who chaired an
organizing committee for the just-concluded International
Investment Funds Conference.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time for an Asian city outside Tokyo to host
the private event, which attracted more than 50 senior managers
representing 27 investment funds associations from all the world.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is a very befitting venue for the 1997 conference
since people engaged in the industry can eye for themselves "the
confidence going forward in Hong Kong from July 1", said Russell.
</P>
<P>
Topics touched upon during the two-day discussion included
strengths of mutual funds, emerging pension markets, mutual fund
governance structure and emerging market clearance and settlement
system.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the United States, Europe and Japan
outlined at today's press conference the latest developments in
the mutual fund and unit trust industry in their respective
markets.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the impact of the recently savaged stock markets on
their funds, they claimed they did not see large volume
redemption.
</P>
<P>
Takashi Hinata, vice chairman of the Investment Trusts
Association of Japan, said equity investment only constituted a
small 11 percent of their investment portfolios. "We don't see so
far much redemption."
</P>
<P>
"I'm not too much concerned about Tokyo market," which fell
significantly in the past several days because "the foreign
exchange rate is stable and economic fundamentals are sound," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He also expected the current turbulence in Hong Kong market to
get settled in near future.
</P>
<P>
Julian Tregoning, president of the European Federation of
Investment Funds and Companies, spoke highly of what the Hong Kong
government has done in stabilizing the Hong Kong dollar.
</P>
<P>
He said that compared with a few years ago, Hong Kong's
financial mechanism has turned more mature with volumes traded at
the stock exchange multiplying.
</P>
<P>
He played down the fluctuations on the local market, saying
stocks up and stocks down are a very natural phenomenon that every
investor should understand.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong shares are very cheap at the current level, he said.
"I'm more willing to buy now than three months ago."

<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, October 29 (Xinhua) -- China's largest urban
water-diversion project was completed in Dalian in northeast
China's Liaoning Province on Tuesday. It took three years to
build, one year ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
The project is designed to bring in water from the Biliu River,
which is over 150 km away from this coastal open city, which has a
population of 2.4 million.
</P>
<P>
According to officials in charge of the project, the project,
with a daily water-supply of 1.2 million tons, cost three billion
yuan, 500 million yuan less than originally planned. The Asian
Development Bank (ADB) offered 1.4 billion yuan in loans for the
work.
</P>
<P>
International practices have been adopted in the project,
including public bidding and quality supervision, the officials
say.
</P>
<P>
The project was initiated in 1994, when the city government
took steps to resolve the severe water-shortage.
</P>
<P>
Dalian is one of the largest industrial cities in the country
and is also home to over 6,000 Sino-foreign joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
Mayor Bo Xilai told Xinhua that the city government is
considering launching more water-introduction projects in future,
so as to ensure the city's sustained development.

<HEADLINE> HK to Maintain Low, Simple Tax Regime: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong is firmly committed
to a low, simple and predictable tax regime, Financial Secretary
Donald Tsang said here today.
</P>
<P>
Nothing substantial has changed with respect to taxation since
Hong Kong entered into the new era on July 1, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I can assure you that we are going to keep our tax law very,
very much simpler than the 9,451 pages of the U.S. tax code, to
which the latest budget agreement in the U.S. added another 285
new sections and 824 amendments," Tsang told the annual luncheon
of the Board of Review (Inland Revenue).
</P>
<P>
He estimated that total government revenue receipts in the
1997-1998 year will reach 235 billion HK dollars (30.1 billion
U.S. dollars) and that the fiscal reserves will exceed 400 billion
HK dollars (51.3 billion U.S. dollars) by the end of this
financial year.
</P>
<P>
This year marks the 50th anniversary of the Board of Review,
which was constituted in 1947 upon enactment of the Inland Revenue
Ordinance, to deal with appeal cases raised by taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
Tsang told the board: "We are currently conducting a
comprehensive review on profits tax to examine whether we can make
our taxation system and business environment more competitive. The
public consultation period ended in early September."
</P>
<P>
He said that despite the relatively simple taxation system,
there may well be areas which are not sufficiently clear and which
may give rise to disputes over tax assessment.
</P>
<P>
"One area which we must certainly address is to enhance
certainty in the operation of the taxation system. This should
help to clear gray areas in tax assessment and reduce the
opportunity for disputes, and thus the need for appeal," he said.
</P>
<P>
The number of appeal cases received has increased substantially
in the past several years.
</P>
<P>
The use of Chinese language has been introduced in Board
proceedings. Up to now, more than 20 cases were heard in Chinese
during this year.

MACAO, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Macao gold shops have witnessed a
booming business over the past few days as the price of gold hit a

</P>
<P>
Local gold shops have reported a business growth of from 30 to
60 percent over normal days as the shops were overcrowded with

The price of gold in Macao dropped to the lowest in 10 years
last Saturday after it plummeted on international markets
following the news that Switzerland plans to sell 1,400 tons of
reserved gold.
</P>
<P>
However, experts said that the crash of stock markets worldwide

market, noting that the price of gold has bounced back a little

While most other suspects of the case have been caught and

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Welcomes Commonwealth Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria yesterday welcomed the
Commonwealth decision to hold any further actions against it
until next year, local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
"I think it is a good thing that they support our transition
program," Nigerian Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi told newsmen at the
Lagos airport last night.
</P>
<P>
He said the Nigerian government will study the communique of
the Commonwealth summit of heads of government that ended Monday
in Edinburgh, Scotland, and will work upon it.
</P>
<P>
He also defended the country's human rights record and said
that Nigeria could not be isolated internationally.
</P>
<P>
The Commonwealth summit refused suggestions by some
pro-democracy groups that Nigeria be expelled from the 54-nation
organization and be imposed of fresh sanctions.
</P>
<P>
It, however, warned that Nigeria will suffer new sanctions
including oil embargo, if there is no progress in the transition
program by October next year.
</P>
<P>
The Commonwealth suspended Nigeria's membership in November
1995 after its government executed author Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight
other minority activists on charges of murder.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian military government led by General Sani Abacha
has announced a transition program which promises to return power
to elected civilian government by October next year.
</P>
<P>
As part of the transition program, the government has approved
the registration of five political parties and has held a local
election on party basis in March, which is generally regarded as
free and fair.
</P>
<P>
Some pro-democracy groups, however, have criticized the
government of being insincere in implementing the transition
program. They also hold that the government has not done enough
in improving its human rights records.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Foreign Debt Declining </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's foreign debt profile
went down by 1.048 billion U.S. Dollars in the six months of this
year, Finance Minister Anthony Ani announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The foreign debt overhang was reduced from 28.06 billion
dollars on December 31, 1996 to 27.012 billion dollars at the end
of June this year, according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ani denied the figure of around 34 billion dollars
provided by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund,
saying that the government had done a thorough job of
ascertaining the accuracy of the figures.
</P>
<P>
Th minister noted that the differentials between the figures
arose because the nation's debt for budget purposes were
converted to U.S. dollars while in actual fact the loans that
constitute the debt stock were obtained in various currencies.
</P>
<P>
He also attributed the differentials to the fact that some of
the debts to some creditors of the Paris Club were still included
in the debt stock despite the fact that the debts had been paid
off.
</P>
<P>
"Our debt stock is to some extent determined by the movement
of currencies in the capital market," Ani told a seminar on the
country's debt problem, organized by the Central Bank of Nigeria
in the capital Abuja.
</P>
<P>
For instance, he said that the appreciation of the dollar
against the Japanese yen by 29 percent in which some of the loans
were denominated had led to a reduction of the debt stock.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has been seeking to expand export and reduce foreign
debt in its bid to stabilize the nation's economy.
</P>
<P>
To this end, the finance minister announced an embargo on new
foreign loans in July this year, saying that new loans would not
be allowed until the bulk of its current debt was paid.
</P>
<P>
The policy, along with others implemented so far would
continue until the debt stock service ratio attains a sustainable
level, Ani reiterated.

<HEADLINE> Pak Senior Official on Chemical Weapons Convention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The Chemical Weapons
Convention (CWC) would serve as an effective disarmament
instrument only when all countries possessing such weapons
strictly adhere to its provisions, Pakistani Foreign Secretary
Shamshad Ahmad said here today.
</P>
<P>
"It is crucial for the success of the CWC that all possessors
of chemical weapons must become parties to the convention and
adhere to its provisions, including the complete and speedy
destruction of chemical weapons stockpiles," Shamshad said at a
news briefing here a day after Pakistan's Instrument of
Ratification to the CWC was deposited with the United Nations
Secretary General Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Only then would the convention serve as an effective
disarmament instrument," he said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, an original signatory to the CWC in January 1993,
delayed its ratification of the convention because of the
completion of the process in this regard, Shamshad said.
</P>
<P>
Shamshad described the CWC as "an international legal
framework" for the realization of complete prohibition and
thorough destruction of all chemical weapons and their production
facilities.
</P>
<P>
He expressed Pakistan's support for the convention but
emphasized that all its provisions "must be implemented in an
objective and faithful manner."
</P>
<P>
The foreign secretary also pointed out that Pakistan "will at
all times retain its sovereign right to take all necessary
measures to protect its national security interests" while
adopting necessary measures and establishing necessary procedures
to implement its obligations under the convention.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan will exercise its rights to indicate its
non-acceptance of inspectors and inspection assistants as it deems
appropriate," he said.

<P>
CANBERRA, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar scooted
up to close more than one U.S. cent stronger today in Sydney,
following a stunning comeback on the local stock exchange.
</P>
<P>
The local unit finished here at 70.57 U.S. cents, from 69.29
U.S. cents Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
But it was off a high for the day of 71.50 U.S. cents after
profit-takers moved in during late session dealings.
</P>
<P>
John Basile, Colonial State Bank foreign exchange market head,
said the recovery in U.S. and local stock prices, stronger gold
and stop loss buying overnight had all combined to help the
previously fading currency.
</P>
<P>
Basile said although trading was steadier today, financial
markets still fear global and Australian equity markets could
still be in for a rocky ride.
</P>
<P>
The local unit was at 84.04 Japanese yen, from 83.58, and at
1.2286 German marks, from 1.1959.

TOKYO, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Tokyo stocks rebounded sharply
following the largest single-day rise on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
The key Nikkei average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, which plunged 725.67 points
on Tuesday, rose 544.35 points, or 3.34 percent to close at

<HEADLINE> Sudanese Vice President Visits Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese First Vice President
el-Zubeir Mohammad Salih arrived here today on a visit designed to
improve Cairo-Khartoum ties.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Agriculture
Youssef Amin Youssef Wali welcomed Salih at the airport, the
Middle East News Agency (MENA) reported.
</P>
<P>
But the report did not mention who will attend talks with Salih
on behalf of Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Ahead of Salih's visit, Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir told
the parliament that his government seeks improving relations with
Arab countries, particularly Egypt. His initiative drew support
from the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Noticeably, Sudanese newspapers turn out to be clear from
routine criticism against Egypt, flashing "sisterly Egypt"
instead, according to MENA.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of the two countries met late last month
on the fringe of the U.N. General Assembly meeting, signaling that
the two countries are working to move towards better ties.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Sudanese Information Minister Tabib Ibrahim
Mohammed Khair, called for talks with Egypt to resolve disputes
between the the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Sudan and Egypt have contested ownership of Halaib, a triangle
of land located between the two countries, since Sudan's
independence in 1956.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese government also took over the Cairo University
campus in Khartoum, renaming the institution Neelein, or the two
Niles.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Egypt and Sudan have been strained since
el-Bashir took power in Sudan in 1989 and worsened in 1995 when
Cairo accused Khartoum of involvement in an assassination attempt
on Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Addis Ababa.

<P>
The ASX issued a statement apologizing for the 20 minute early
close, sparked by the inability of its trading system to cope with
more than 60,000 trades in one day.
</P>

day's trade was unparalleled in Australia's history.

<HEADLINE> Israel Partially Reopens Controversial Street in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Israel today partially
reopened a controversial street in the flashpoint West Bank city
Hebron according to the Hebron agreement signed in last January.
</P>
<P>
In the heavy presence of Israeli soldiers deployed to prevent
possible clashes between Jewish settlers and Palestinian
residents, the Shuhada Street, or Martyrs' Street, was partially
opened early this morning to both Israeli and Palestinian traffic.
</P>
<P>
Israeli military governor of Hebron Baruch Najar said that
Israel opened the 400-meter section as a test, adding the rest of
the street would be opened if the first stage goes well without
trouble, local radios reported.
</P>
<P>
Only authorized vehicles would be allowed to travel through it
under strict scrutiny of the Israeli soldiers. Jewish settlers
feared the opening of the street would enable Palestinian
militants to launch terror attacks against settlers living by the
roadside, such as car bombings or drive-by shootings.
</P>
<P>
Shuhada Street was closed three years ago after a Jewish
settler shot dead 29 Palestinian prayers in the Tomb of
Patriarchs, or Ibrahim Mosque called by Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Under the Hebron agreement that led to Israeli troop withdrawal
from 80 percent of the city in January, the street has been
beautified with 2.5 million dollars donated by the United
States. Following the redeployment, Israeli soldiers remained to
guard the rest 20 percent area where about 450 Jewish settlers are
still living.
</P>
<P>
Despite Israel's move today, the Palestinians still demanded
for full opening of the street. Palestinian Mayor Mustafa Natche
accused Israel of failing to open the street totally for
Palestinians while imposing no limits on the Jewish settlers.
</P>
<P>
For months, settlers in the city have been compaigning to
prevent the reopening of Shuhada Street. Spokesman for the Hebron
settlers Noam Arnon said the opening of the street would endanger
the security of the Jewish community.

<HEADLINE> Australian Airline to Add Australia-China Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Qantas Airways Ltd., the
largest airline in Australia, will increase its weekly flights
between China and Australia from four to six starting April 1998.
</P>
<P>
At the same time it will reduce the number of direct flights
between Japan and the north Queensland tourist center of Cairns.
</P>
<P>
Two new weekly non-stop China-Brisbane flights would be
introduced, bringing to six the airline's weekly frequency between
China and Australia, said Geoff Dixon, Qantas' executive general
manager commercial said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
One of the flights will link the Chinese capital Beijing and
Brisbane, the capital of the Queensland state in northeast
Australia, while the other will operate between China's eastern
coastal city Shanghai and Brisbane, Dixon said.
</P>
<P>
Queensland, Australia's major tourist destination, has been the
leading foreign exchange earner in Australia's tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
Qantas also rescheduled its services between Japan and Cairns,
a coastal city in northeast Australia, to cater for existing
demand and projected growth.
</P>
<P>
Dixon said from April next year, two of Qantas' five weekly
Fukuoka-Cairns-Sydney flights would switch to non-stop services
between Fukuoka and Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Also from April, the weekly Osaka-Cairns and Tokyo-Brisbane
services would be discontinued.
</P>
<P>
The twice-weekly Sapporo-Cairns service would be suspended
between April and October next year.
</P>
<P>
Dixon said Qantas would schedule an extra peak-season
Auckland-Cairns flight to bring to three the weekly services
linking Los Angeles in the United States with Cairns via Auckland
in New Zealand.

<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Second Prime
Minister Hun Sen held talks earlier today with former Khmer Rouge
leader Ieng Sary, but the details of the talks were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
The meeting took place at Hun Sen's suburban villa.
</P>
<P>
Ieng Sary, who did not take sides in Cambodia's recent
political turmoil, arrived here on Tuesday for the first time
since the Khmer Rouge was driven from power by a Vietnamese
invasion in early 1979.
</P>
<P>
The Cambodian co-prime minister met this morning with Ieng Sary
and they had lunch together afterwards. Ieng Sary is expected to
hold a press conference the following morning to brief on the
talks, it was reported.
</P>
<P>
Pardoned by king Norodom Sihanouk in September last year, Ieng
Sary was former foreign minister under the 1975-1979 Khmer Rouge
regime.
</P>
<P>
Ieng Sary with several thousand Khmer Rouge forces broke away
from the guerrilla movement and crossed over to the government of
Cambodia in August last year.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Legislators Consider Proposed Law on Fire Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 29 (Xinhua)--The proposed law on fire control
was submitted here today to the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress, China's top legislative body.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the proposal, Minister of Public Security Tao Siju
said that China has confronted severe challenges in fire control
in the last decade, a time of rapid economic expansion.
</P>
<P>
More tall and multi-functional buildings have been erected
without adequate preparation for fire prevention and control.
</P>
<P>
"A generally weak awareness of fire prevention and outdated
firefighting facilities, including an inadequate number of fire
stations, lack of water supply and express lanes for fire-fighting
equipment have contributed to heavy losses in human lives and
property," Tao said.
</P>
<P>
The 1984 State Council regulation on fire control cannot cope
with the changing situation, he said, and imposes a very light
punishment on those responsible for fire accidents. The current
penalty is 100 yuan and less than 10 days' detention for severe
cases.
</P>
<P>
The proposed fire control law has 47 articles in six chapters
covering fire prevention, organization, fire-fighting, first aid
and legal responsibility.
</P>
<P>
The proposed law would beef up firefighting infrastructures and
management. Inspections would be required for schools, hospitals,
social welfare institutions and places such as cinemas, ballrooms,
shopping malls, big hotels and restaurants before they would be
allowed to open to the public.
</P>
<P>
Organizers for large gatherings such as mass rallies, fireworks
demonstrations and lantern festivals would be required to submit
their plans for firefighting and crowd control.
</P>
<P>
To minimize casualties, the proposed law requires workers at
public places to help people safely exit in case of fire. Those
who fail to perform their legal obligation and flee for their own
safety would face severe penalties under the law.
</P>
<P>
The proposed law also increases the penalty for arsonists. For
example, those responsible for causing a fire that leads to heavy
losses would face criminal charges.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Cypriot Leader Sends Letter to UN Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash has recently sent a letter to U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan, accusing the European Union (EU) of interfering in the
Cyprus problem, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Denktash's letter was in response to Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides' recent speech at the U.N. General Assembly, the reports
said.
</P>
<P>
Denktash said in his letter that the EU's "untimely
interference" in the Cyprus problem had had the most profound
effect on the U.N.-sponsored direct talks between the two Cypriot
communities' leaders.
</P>
<P>
The current impasse in the inter-communal talks was not due to
any precondition brought to the table by the Turkish Cypriot side,
Denktash claimed.
</P>
<P>
The last round of direct talks between Denktash and Clerides in
Glion in Switzerland in August ended in deadlock as the Turkish
Cypriot side insisted Cyprus-EU negotiations be postponed pending
a solution to the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
The EU reaffirmed its decision in July this year that the
accession talks with Cyprus will begin in early 1998.
</P>
<P>
"The Turkish Cypriot side cannot be expected to watch
helplessly while the EU takes concrete steps to convert Cyprus
into a Greek state," Denktash said in the letter to Annan.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot leader pointed out that there were four
conditions the Turkish Cypriot side would not
relinquish: sovereignty, security and guarantees; political
equality; the maintenance of the balance between Turkey and Greece
established by the 1960 agreements; and a bi-zonal system
reinforced by the exchange of properties.
</P>
<P>
"As long as the Turkish Cypriots' equal status is not
recognized, the Greek Cypriots will continue to undermine every
initiative," Denktash said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Denktash would soon travel to New York to
have meetings with Annan and U.S. Presidential Emissary Richard
Holbrooke on Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
The East Mediterranean island has been divided since 1974 when
Turkey landed its troops and took over the northern third of the
island following a short-lived pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. and international community have been trying for
decades to reunite the divided island as a bi-zonal, bi-communal
federation through peace talks, but so far no tangible results
have been achieved.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Stock Market Drops But Shielded Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The Kuwaiti stock market
dropped by 2.5 percent in the world big markets turmoil Tuesday,
but local market analysts said today it would be shielded from
market crisis.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers, both English and Arabic, quoted the
analysts as believing that international crisis might provide a
good opportunity to buy up undervalued stocks and cool down
buying of the overvalued shares in the market which were seen
roaring recently.
</P>
<P>
They said Kuwait is well insulated from the international
crisis and the crisis would not have a big effect on its market.
</P>
<P>
The drop was mainly caused by psychological elements without
any specific reason, they said adding that this is a healthy
correction.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the disastrous performance of major stock
markets in the last two days, the Kuwait Stock Exchange closed
70.4 points lower than Monday at 2707.1 points, dropping from the
highest 2777.5 point since last year.
</P>
<P>
Investment companies were some of the hardest hit in
yesterday's drop because of concerns about their exposure to
stocks in the foreign markets where shares have spiraled
downwards.
</P>
<P>
The analysts argued that Kuwait's foreign investments are
focused mainly on the European and the US markets, which they
expect to recover soon.
</P>
<P>
They also do not expect a massive capital withdrawal from
foreign markets at present.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti stock market has been rising strongly for the past two
years, the index had been up 45.76 percent this year following a
40 percent increase in 1996. Yesterday's index was still 42
percent higher then that starting 1997.
</P>
<P>
Despite the drop, volume, value and number of deals increased
by 7.2 percent, 9.8 percent and 2 percent respectively, according
to a market statement.
</P>
<P>
However, other experts believe that the selling pressure
experienced by the Kuwaiti stock market could continue for a
couple of days.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Tombs of Slaves Buried Alive Found in Shaanxi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists have
discovered two ancient tombs in the eastern suburbs of Xi'an City,
capital of northwest China's Shaanxi Province. Three slaves had
been buried alive in the tomb with their deceased masters,
archaeologists said.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists said the tombs were built between 557 A.D. and
618 A.D. in the Northern Zhou Dynasty and the Sui Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
The two tombs with the rare find are among four recently
discovered ancient sites in the city's suburban area.
</P>
<P>
According to a gravestone inside the largest tomb, a
61-year-old official of the Northern Zhou Dynasty and his wife
were buried in the coffin chamber. The official died in 573 A.D. A
nine-year-old slave was buried alive in the eastern niche of the
coffin chamber. Two other slaves were buried alive in the eastern
and western niches of another tomb along with other members of the
master's family.
</P>
<P>
Sacrificial objects found in the tomb include jade rings, clay
figures of worriers, pottery and coins.
</P>
<P>
The practice of burying the slaves with their deceased masters
was prevalent in China between 2,000 and 3,000 years ago.
However, tombs with slaves buried alive were seldom discovered.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the discovery of the two ancient tombs are of
great importance to the research of the Northern Zhou Dynasty and
Sui Dynasty.

-- The shock wave of Asian monetary crisis, which provoked the

<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The spectacular turning of the tendency on Wall Street on
Tuesday, with the Dow Jones index regaining 337 points and erasing
most of the loss it suffered on Monday, gave the signal of
re-establishment of European stock exchanges, after Monday's
collapse provoked a wave of shares sellings in all places which
caused a plunge of the indexes.

-- The Flammarion publishing house has decided to withdraw the
sale of the book by Andre Rougeot and Jean-Michel Verne,
"L'Affaire Yann Piat, Des Assassins au Coeur du Pouvoir (Yann Piat
Affair, Assassins in the Heart of Power)," after a court ordered
the suppression of about 15 passages in which former defense
minister and president of the Union for French Democracy, Francois
Leotard, was implicitly accused of ordering the murder of Yann
Piat, a mafia-fighter murdered in 1992.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Speculative trading took the
reigns of shares at Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE) today as the
KSE-100 index crossed the 1800 barrier.
</P>
<P>
The KSE-100 Index was up 40.79 points to 1837 at the close of
first session.
</P>
<P>
Dealers attributed the positive trend at KSE to bullish
activity in other bourses of the world.
</P>
<P>
In the early morning the index saw a surge of almost 70 points.
</P>
<P>
The stock market Tuesday virtually crashed as a result of what
analysts called a fallout of the global turmoil in major bourses,
plunging the KSE-100 index by a record 171.26 points at 1,788.33
or about 9 percent on panic liquidation coming from all quarters.
</P>
<P>
Trading had to be suspended in the afternoon session before the
closing bell to apparently forestall fresh sell-off.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Raises Tariff on Imported Wheat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has
raised tariff on imported wheat from 25 percent to 50 percent in
order to protect local farmers from unfair competition, local
press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Agriculture Minister Darius Mbela told Kenyan Parliament
Tuesday that the new tariff took effect on Monday, adding that
the measures were expected to adequately protect local farmers as
international wheat prices had been falling.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that the new duty would push the cost of
buying and shipping a bag of wheat (90 kilograms) from 1.100
Kenyan Shillings (about 18 U.S. Dollars) to 1.500 Shillings.
</P>
<P>
He made the ministerial statement at the Parliament on the
request of parliament members to explain the situation of the
wheat in the East African country following disagreements on
prices between wheat farmers and millers.
</P>
<P>
Farmers in Uasin Gishu District, west Kenya, are insisting on
1.800 Shillings per 90-kg bag of wheat while the millers are
offering a price of 1.350 Shillings.
</P>
<P>
Since the wheat sector was liberalized in 1993, the Kenyan
government has ceased setting prices for wheat and wheat
products.
</P>
<P>
Cyril Nabutola, General Manager of the Unga Limited operating
in west Kenya, was quoted as saying that his company's position
on wheat prices was determined by economic factor.
</P>
<P>
The annual wheat production in Kenya stands at around 3.5
million bags compared to a demand of 7 million bags for local
consumption. Kenya has to import more than 3 million bags of
wheat annually to meet the domestic demands.

<HEADLINE> South Koreans Advised Not to Take 500-won Coins to Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 29 (Xinhua) -- South Korean tourists are advised
by the government not to carry 500-won South Korean coins to Japan
because Japanese authorities are cracking down on the illegal use
of 500-won coins as 500-yen coins (about 4,000 won).
</P>
<P>
The government has decided to punish those and confiscate their
passports who are caught in Japan carrying a large number of South
Korean coins, which can be used in vending machines in Japan as
500-yen coins with slight modifications, according to the Foreign
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
"We have advised people not to carry the coins when they go
to Japan as they may be subjected to unexpected disadvantages
there," a ministry spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The move stemmed from the South Korean government's efforts to
prevent damage of its external image that may be caused by the
increasing use of 500-won South Korean coins in Japan recently.
</P>
<P>
Japanese customs authorities have recently checked 12 people
including four South Koreans who carried a total of 24,823 coins,
and referred most of them for prosecution for violating customs
laws.

<P>
CHONGQING, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Two Chinese artists are
preparing to paint a 100-meter long picture of the Yangtze River,
China's longest river.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze, which stretches some 6,300 km., is one of the
world's longest rivers.
</P>
<P>
Wu Song and Song Gang, the two young artists involved, are
currently in the Three Gorges area sketching landscapes and
features along the banks of the Yangtze River prior to its damming.
</P>
<P>
Song, a Ph.D. who studied painting in Rome, and Wu, an
associate professor at the Sichuan Academy of Fine Arts, are known
for their use of bright colors. The artists have prepared for the
project for over two years.
</P>
<P>
The painting will depict scenes from Snow Mount. Gladaindong,
the source of the Yangtze in northwest China's Qinghai Province,
to Wusongkou in Shanghai where the river empties into the Pacific
Ocean.
</P>
<P>
The massive painting will depict prosperity along banks of
China's longest river prior to the turn of the century, as well as
natural scenery, historic sites and cultural relices.
</P>
<P>
Another huge painting, the 150-meter long traditional Chinese
painting entitled "A New Look at the 10,000-Li Yangtze River," was

<HEADLINE> Bama Centenarians Tell Secrets of Longevity (1) by Wu Xiaojun and Lu Hankui </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, October 29 (Xinhua) -- It's all in the diet, say some
of China's longest-living residents. A bowl of maize-flour
porridge, a plate of bean curd, a cup of corn wine and a glass of
mountain tea can do wonders for life expectancy, they say.
</P>
<P>
At least that's the experience recounted by 79 centenarians in
Bama Autonomous County of Yao Nationality in southwestern China's
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. Bama has a population of its
260,000.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China has more than 8,000 centenarians,
most of whom live in the remote mountainous areas of northwestern,
southern and southwestern China.
</P>
<P>
In the Chinese capital of Beijing, only 56 centenarians were
registered out of some 11 million citizens in 1990, according to
statistics of China's fourth national census in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Chen Jinchao, head of the Bama Longevity Research Institute,
said that the diet of Bama centenarians is in accordance with
scientific research on longevity in China and some Western
countries. The mild subtropical climate in mountainous soil rich
in manganese and selenium also play a part in fostering longevity
as well as the clear river water and negative-ion enriched air.
</P>
<P>
Of the 79 Bama centenarians, Chen said 18 are males while 61
are females. The oldest is 112.
</P>
<P>
Chen's research institute analyzed the diet of Bama
centenarians who eat maize-flour porridge, rice and beans, or mung
beans as their staple food along with other beans such as soy,
jack and kidney and peas as the main dishes.
</P>
<P>
Experts say maize produced in Bama contains much more Vitamin
B-1, E and beta carotene than other areas because of the soil
conditions.

<TEXT>
<P>
Besides bean curd, centenarians often eat wild vegetables as
their main dish. They consume meat, mutton or beef only two or
three times a month, however, many of them favor fatty meat.
</P>
<P>
Bama centenarians use soy bean or herbal oils which contains
linoleic acids which reduce cholesterol, metabolize fat and
encourage the regeneration of liver cells.
</P>
<P>
All of the Bama centenarians have contracted with measles; 60
of them have never visited a doctor.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the remote mountain areas have a sparse population
where infectious diseases rarely spread.
</P>
<P>
The Bama centenarians also drink wild mountain tea that is rich
in amino acids, vitamins and other micro-elements good for health
and longevity. The incidence of coronary heart disease among
centenarians in Bama is only 4.3 percent, while that of Guangzhou,
capital of the neighboring Guangdong Province in the plains area,
ranges between 29 to 38.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Experts say a human's need for trace elements are absorbed
through their food because crops absorb these elements from the
soil. They play an important role in people's normal growth,
resistance to diseases and longevity.
</P>
<P>
Researchers also found that many Bama centenarians daily
consume wine made from maize or a "medicinal liquor" made from
gecko lizards, poisonous and non-poisonous snakes, and traditional
Chinese medicine.

The medicinal liquor reportedly improves blood circulation and
relieves colds.
</P>
<P>
All the centenarians are active -- farming, household chores or
sports such as archery and hunting. Many of them have hobbies such
as chess, calligraphy and singing.
</P>
<P>
Wei Puming, 102, still hunts and Huang Jiaxiang, 103, weaves
bamboo. Lu Dihua, Lu Dimei and Lu Dixiao, three sisters ranging
from 100 to 110, still care for themselves and do household chores.
</P>
<P>
Researchers found that most of the Bama centenarians are very
active and social, and are kind to other family members and
neighbors. They are neither materialistic nor ambitious, and seem
to live for their three meals a day and their household affairs.
</P>
<P>
Most of the centenarians live in mountainous areas covered with
more than 2,000 kinds of plants. Since these areas receive fewer
hours of sunshine than the plains, crops ripen a few weeks later.
</P>
<P>
Most of the centenarians live along the banks of the
145-kilometer Panyang River.

<HEADLINE> Herdsmen's Children Go to College in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, October 29 (Xinhua) -- In a small village in eastern
Inner Mongolia, 164 of the 1,209 villagers are studying in
universities, colleges or secondary technical schools.
</P>
<P>
And, Golibu, a herdsman in the village Shabage on the Bairin
Grassland, is the only one who does not have a college education
in his six-member family.
</P>
<P>
Golibu gave up education after finishing junior middle school
studies. He now oversees 75 hectares of grassland and forest, and
cares for 120 cows and 160 sheep and makes at least 40,000 yuan
(5,000 US dollars) annually.
</P>
<P>
Many families in Shabage are similar to Golibu's, according to
Uligi, secretary of the village Party committee.
</P>
<P>
Uligi explains that, since the beginning of the 1990s,
per-capita annual income in the village has exceeded 2,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
"When people make more money, the first thing they think of is
sending their children to school. The families compete with each
other to see who has more children in college, and whose children
do well in school," Uligi says. More than 80 percent of the
families have at least one child with a higher education
experience.
</P>
<P>
And, since 1991, the village has spent more than 300,000 yuan
on schools and better teachers, and 100 percent of the school-age
children are in school. When those 164 students have graduated, a
quarter of them will probably come back and work in their
hometown.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Chief of Staff of the Philippine
Armed Forces Arnulfo Acedera said today that the military is ready
to react to any major attacks to be launched by the rebel groups.
</P>
<P>
Acedera said this in response to reports that some Moro Islamic
Liberation Front (MILF) extremists held a secret meeting with
another rebel group last month to plan a strategy against the
military.
</P>
<P>
Although the government troops withdrew from their previous
positions in line with the July 16 ceasefire agreement with the
MILF, some units are still operating in the area to respond to any
attacks, he said.
</P>
<P>
Acedera said he had directed all military units to take
security measures to avert any surprise attacks after capturing
two top leaders of the Alex Boncayao Brigade rebel group.
</P>
<P>
He added that the military has no intention to release the two
rebel leaders.
</P>
<P>
However, Al Hadj Murad, MILF vice chairman for military
affairs, downplayed the secret meeting, saying it was only "sort
of exchange of ideas along the lower level of the two groups".
</P>
<P>
The MILF is a 12,000-member rebel group in the country. It
entered a peace process with the government early this year, but
so far made little progress in forging a peace agreement with the
government.

Nigeria depended on the total sincerity of its citizens even as
he maintained that the country was not in any form of isolation
following the continued suspension of its membership of the
Commonwealth.
</P>
<P>
-- Nigeria's first global satellite television station is set
to hit the air wave on November 3 this year as arrangements have

Television by the head of state General Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian
</P>
<P>
-- General Sani Abacha said on Tuesday that Nigeria would not
be intimidated by "orchestrated international hostility" and
would maintain an ability to defend fundemental Nigerian
interests.
</P>
<P>
-- Of the 13.7 billion U.S. dollars external loans procured by
Nigeria to a variety of projects, 836.2 million dollars has been
lost to ghost projects in various parts of the country, according

</P>
<P>

<P>
-- The Nigerian government has condemned in very strong terms
the reported moves by the European Parliament to provide some 3.6
million dollars as special aid to pro-democracy and human rights
campaigners in the country to fight the Abacha government next

<HEADLINE> Iran Reiterates Opposition to Doha Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry
spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi has reiterated Iran's opposition to
the forthcoming Middle East and North African (MENA) economic
conference.
</P>
<P>
Local radios quoted Mohammadi as saying Thursday such a
conference would not be in the benefit of Islamic solidarity,
adding that Tehran had earlier informed Qatar of Iran's stance
towards the conference, to be held in Qatari capital Doha from
November 16 to 18.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi stressed that Israel and the United States had
always been trying to create a cleft among the Muslim countries.
</P>
<P>
Some Arab countries, such as Lebanon, Syria, the United Arab
Emirates and Saudi Arabia have threatened to boycott the
Israeli-present conference, in protest against Israeli
government's hardline policy towards the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
On Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai's recent remarks
terming Iran as a threat to the security of the Middle East,
Mohammadi said that the objective behind "Israeli regime's
dissemination of misinformation and disinformation is to deviate
public attention from the realities of the region."
</P>
<P>
Israel and the United States have allegedly believed that Iran
has the capacity to produce ballistic missiles threatening Israel
and the U.S. interests in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Mordechai said, Israel reserves the right of
attacking targets such as the Iranian long-range missile bases,
threatening that those who would be involved in targeting Israeli
sensitive systems should expect to pay a high price.

HANGZHOU, October 29 (Xinhua) -- East China's Zhejiang Province
will import four Airbus Industrie planes to increase its air
transport capacity over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
The province already has one A320 airliner, the local aviation
department says. Over the past five years, it has greatly improved
its air transport by increasing the number of airports to seven
and opening more than 100 air routes.
</P>
<P>
An aviation network, with the provincial capital of Hangzhou as
the center, connecting the cities of Ningbo, Wenzhou, Huangyan,
Yiwu, Quzhou, and Zhoushan, has been established.
</P>
<P>
It has handled more than 18 million passengers and roughly
300,000 tons of goods over the past five years, giving an annual
growth rate of 25 percent on average, one of the highest of
China's air carriers.
</P>
<P>
The air transport boom has contributed a lot to the local
economy, especially foreign trade and tourism, and Zhejiang's
annual economic growth rate was more than ten percent over the
past decade.
</P>
<P>
It plans to build the Xiaoshan International Airport in
Hangzhou, at a cost of over three billion yuan, to further improve

<P>
YANGON, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Thai Foreign Minister Prachuab
Chaiyasarn arrived here today on a two-day official visit to
Myanmar in a bid to strengthen bilateral relations between the two
countries and coordination on ASEAN issues.
</P>
<P>
It is Prachuab's second visit to Myanmar in this year. The
first one was in May when he accompanied Prime Minister Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh on his official trip to the country.
</P>
<P>
Prachuab is expected to have talks with his Myanmar counterpart
U Ohn Gyaw on bilateral cooperation as well as regional issues.
</P>
<P>
Thailand, one of Myanmar's five major trading partners,
formally reached a border trade agreement with myanmar in March
1996 to carry out trade activities at three border points. The
volume of trade between the two countries amounted to 450 million
U.S. dollars in the year, according to Thai official sources.
</P>
<P>
A Myanmar-Thai friendship bridge on the Moei (Thaungyin) River
linking border towns of Myawaddy of Myanmar and Maesot of Thailand
was also opened later in August, facilitating trade, transport and
communications between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
In the same month, meetings of Myanmar-Thai Joint Border
Committee, chaired by deputy foreign ministers, and Regional
Border committee, chaired by regional commanders, were held in
Thailand's Bangkok and Chiang Rai respectively.
</P>
<P>
To improve transport links between the two countries, Myanmar
and Thailand have planed to develop two deep-sea ports -- one in
Thailand's Bagn Saphan on the Gulf of Thailand and the other in
Myanmar's Bokpyin area beside the Andaman Sea.
</P>
<P>
Thailand, one of the leading foreign investors in Myanmar,
ranked third after the United Kingdom and Singapore with 1.15
billion U.S. dollars in 42 permitted projects out of
6.44-billion-dollars' total foreign investment at the end of
September this year, covering sectors of oil and gas, hotels and
tourism, livestock breeding and fishery, industry estate and

</P>
<P>
The university has decided to put more into Dunhuang research,

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Buddhism Undergoing Resurgence (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Freedom in religious belief is
guaranteed in the Tibet Autonomous Region, and Tibetan Buddhism is
in the prime of life, a noted Tibetan scholar says.
</P>
<P>
According to Gabsang Gya, an assistant research fellow in the
Institute of World Religions of the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences, the policy of freedom in religious belief has fully been
implemented in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
To meet the needs of religious people, the central and local
government have spent more than 300 million yuan (36 million US
dollars) in the past decade on renovating Tibetan monasteries, and
many, like the Potala Palace and the Johkang, Zhebung, Sera,
Sagya, Samyai and Gandain monasteries, have been rebuilt or are
undergoing renovations, the scholar says.
</P>
<P>
There are 1,787 religious sites in Tibet, 300 more than in 1951
when Tibet was liberated, and all of them are open all the year round.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the restoration work after the destruction of the
Great Cultural Revolution (1966-76), there are 46,380 monks and
nuns living in monasteries, where they are free to hold religious
activities.
</P>
<P>
In his study of conditions across Tibet, the scholar found that
major religious festivals, some of which were seldom seen before,
have been restored, and many are done on a larger scale.

NANJING, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Suzhou, widely known as the
"City of Chinese Gardens", hosted over 300,000 overseas tourists
in the first nine months of this year, up 17 percent on the 1996

</P>
<P>
Tourists are not only attracted by world-class attractions and
numerous gardens, including the Humble Administrator's Garden,
Hanshan Temple and the Huqiu Pagoda, but also by new itineraries
such as the ancient town tour, Taihu Lake tour, and folklore and
country tours. The International Silk Festival held in September

<HEADLINE> Pak Court Suspends Operation of Anti-Defection Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme Court of Pakistan
today suspended the operation of the Anti-Defection Law. Therefore
no adverse action will be taken against members of the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah, head of the three member bench,
pronounced a short order on a petition regarding the
Anti-Defection Law.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court took the decision at the crucial moment when
the government and the Judiciary are trying to resolve the
two-month-old tussle over the elevation of judges.
</P>
<P>
The decision also came hours before the National Assembly
session scheduled for this evening in which the government is
likely to pass a bill restricting the sanctioned strength of the
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
"In the circumstances it is proper to grant interim relief. No
adverse action is allowed to be taken against the members of the
Parliament in pursuance of newly added article 63(a) in the
Constitution, till the final disposal of the petition," said the
Chief Justice in the order.
</P>
<P>
If a member of the Parliament will be dissident, there will be
no action against him, he added.
</P>
<P>
The order further said, "Initially, we were of the view that
proceedings should be concluded and final order may be passed as
early as possible. But, due to the gravity of the situation, and
the act of the parliament under consideration, it is not possible
to conclude the proceedings."
</P>
<P>
Members of the parliament feel that in the presence of such
provision, if they express freely their candid opinions, they may
lose their seats. So, it is fit and proper to grant interim
relief, the order further said.
</P>
<P>
Before announcing the judgment, the three member bench heard
the arguments of Attorney General Chaudhry Muhammad Farooq, who
was of the opinion that the Anti-Defection Law was introduced to
strengthen democracy and check horse-trading.
</P>
<P>
The Anti-Defection Law, or the 14th Amendment to the
Constitution, was passed by both houses of the Parliament
unanimously early July.
</P>
<P>
It restrains members of the Parliament from breaching party
discipline, code of conduct and declared policies.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Overpopulation, Main Hurdle to Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Overpopulation remains a main
hurdle to the development of the South Asian countries and common
efforts should be made to overcome poverty, illiteracy and
overpopulation in the region.
</P>
<P>
This view was echoed among Speakers from Pakistan, India,
Bangladesh, the Maldives, Bhutan, Nepal and Sri Lanka at a
three-day conference of speakers and parliamentarians of the South
Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) which concluded
here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Speakers pointed out that overpopulation, illiteracy and
poverty have defied vast natural and human resources, and deprived
one fifth of humanity of fruits of progress.
</P>
<P>
South Asia accounts for only 3.3 percent of the world's land
surface, but its population of 1.2 billion is 20 percent of the
world's total and its population growth rate is the highest in the
world.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the region is the abode for nearly half of the
world's illiterate, and about 160 million children in the region
are suffering from malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
Noting South Asia is the poorest part of the world, the
Speakers said that overpopulation, poverty, low literacy and
shortage of basic amenities pose a big threat to the social and
economic order in the region's countries.
</P>
<P>
They called for the SAARC countries to work together to achieve
peace, prosperity and people's development, which are the SAARC's
objectives.
</P>
<P>
For economic growth, said the Speakers, the international trade
is a proven strategy. "We should concentrate in this area, keeping
aside our political differences for the moment," one of them
stressed.
</P>
<P>
They urged the SAARC countries to focus on tackling the issues
of overpopulation and poverty by addressing them at both
governmental and people's levels.
</P>
<P>
They also called for promoting economic cooperation among the
SAARC member countries and active role from all the member
countries in handling the problems in a concerted manner.
</P>
<P>
With the promotion of people-to-people contacts and population
welfare and development as the focal subject, the three-day
conference unanimously approved the recommendations made by the
participants.
</P>
<P>
It called on the parliaments and parliamentarians to play an
active role in tackling the issues of overpopulation, illiteracy
and poverty in the region.

JAKARTA, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Share prices on the Jakarta
Stock Exchange (JSX) plunged sharply by 8.59 percent or 42.12
points to a new low of 447.99 points Tuesday, brokers here said
today.
</P>
<P>
The panic selling by most investors was triggered by the
overnight plunge in Wall Street Monday and another crash of the
Hong Kong Stock Exchange Tuesday, said the brokers.
</P>
<P>
Most stock brokers in Jakarta said stocks across the board
became sell-off targets of foreign and local fund managers,
forcing the local main price gauge to fall steeply.
</P>
<P>
David Chang, head of research at Trimegah Securities, said the
fall of regional stock markets several months ago had perforated
the global market.
</P>
<P>
He said stock markets in Southeast Asian countries were badly
hit as they bore the brunt of the currency crisis in the region,
triggered by the devaluation of the Thai baht in early July.
</P>
<P>
"Now the Asian virus has spread to the world," Chang said,
referring to the fall of global stock markets.
</P>
<P>
"The general feeling is that we cannot do much. We just lie low
and find out what the corporate problems are and try to cope with
those problems," Chang added.
</P>
<P>
Most securities analysts said that it was a really difficult
time for the Jakarta stock market. "It is very difficult to
estimate when the Jakarta market will recover," one analyst said.
</P>

President Soeharto confirmed Tuesday that Singapore is ready to
offer 10 billion U.S. dollars to Indonesia to help it overcome its

<P>
NAIROBI, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's population growth rate
fell from 3.8 percent in the mid-eighties to 2.7 percent in mid
1996, the Daily Nation newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The drop, the biggest in the sub-Saharan Africa, is partly due
to the fact that more and more Kenyan women, making up 37 percent
in 1997, now use modern family planning methods, said U.S. Agency
for International Development Mission chief George Jones.
</P>
<P>
Education is playing a leading role in downing the birth rate
in the eastern African country as it helps people make informed
choices on family planning methods, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, infant mortality has dropped from 69 per 1000
children in 1970 to 60 per 1,000 currently due to the spread of
education, he said in Embu, central Kenya, on Tuesday.

<P>
The zone expects to use 500 million U.S. dollars of foreign

Thirty-two overseas-backed enterprises have increased their

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmers Getting New Hygiene Practices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, October 29 (Xinhua) -- In a remote village in central
China's Hunan province, a farmer says that if they want to lead a
better life, they, first of all, must have a good health.,
</P>
<P>
In this remote village, 10 children hold out their hands to
display fingernails neatly cut. This makes provincial health
officials happy, because Chinese farmers had no health habits in
the past. They drank unboiled water, many people shared a single
towel, and they seldom brushed their teeth.
</P>
<P>
Then, three years ago, the Chinese government began an
education campaign for its 900 million farmers to give them a
better sense of the need for hygiene and better health habits.
</P>
<P>
In Hunan's Luxi county, a local hospital did a survey in 1990
and found that 71.4 percent of the people had roundworms, and
every summer, malaria and similar diseases were quite common.
</P>
<P>
Over the past seven years, the local government has helped
farmers get greater access to clean water, and health education
films have been shown and health classes opened in local schools.
</P>
<P>
As a result, half the farmers in Luxi's town of Pushi have
changed their habits, and improved health has helped them earn
more. In 1996, the average income in the town was 2,100 yuan, five
times the figure of seven years ago.

LOS ANGELES, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Six-time NBA title holders
Los Angeles Lakers will have an enlarged new home arena in
downtown city after a proposal was agreed by the City Council.
</P>
<P>
The City Council today formally approved a plan to build for
the Lakers a new 22,000-seat arena, 5,000 seats bigger than their
current home and seated in a more convient downtown city.
</P>
<P>
The Lakers' current home, The Great Western Forum, was built 30
years ago with only 17,000 seats and is some 20 miles away from
L.A. downtown, not convenient for fans.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the new arena will begin soon in downtown
Los Angeles and it is expected to open in October, 1999.
</P>
<P>
"Now all we have to do is perform," said John Semcken,
president of the Los Angeles Arena Corp., after the plan was

<P>
LHASA, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Geoff Bailey, an Australian
studying at Tibet University, says he's surprised at the number of
cars on the streets of Lhasa, capital of the Tibet Autonomous
Region, not only Chinese, but foreign types as well.
</P>
<P>
Geoff has been studying the Tibetan language for one and a half
years, but says he didn't think life here would be very
convenient, but it turned out that the local people are enjoying a
fairly good life.
</P>
<P>
He and his wife have visited quite a few Tibetan families and
have found living conditions improving daily, even if sanitary
conditions need some improvement. Many locals live in good
buildings and have electric household appliances.
</P>
<P>
The couple like Lhasa's marketplace, where clothes are good
quality and cheap, and food market where they can find many kinds
of their favorites.
</P>
<P>
Geoff says he's satisfied with communications in Lhasa and
thinks they're developing fast. A parcel from his hometown takes
about 10 days and phone calls to other parts of the world are
fairly easy.
</P>
<P>
The couple are fascinated by the plateau's snow-covered
mountains, grassland, and lakes that are not polluted, and they
like to ride bicycles.
</P>
<P>
They also care about the traditional culture and have visited
the Potala and the Johkang and Norbu Lingka monasteries to watch
people from neighboring provinces come for religious activities.
Tibetan families take their tents, food, and musical instruments
to Norbu Lingka or parks in Lhasa, wearing Tibetan or
Western-style clothes or Chinese tunics, and they seem to be
content with their lives, he says.
</P>
<P>
The couple say they're satisfied with the public security in
Lhasa and seldom hear of violent incidents.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Lawmakers Examine Draft Forestry Amendments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 29 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislators are
examining draft amendments to the 12-year-old Forestry Law to protect
timber resources in this forest-deficient country.
</P>
<P>
The members of the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress (NPC) today began to examine proposed amendments to the
existing law during their bimonthly meeting here.
</P>
<P>
The draft suggests an article governing the transfer of the
right to use woods and trees, which can provide terms for
cooperative reforestation. It also bans approval by local
authorities for logging state-owned forests, which accounts for
only 3.3 percent of the world forestry acreage.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, indiscriminate local certifications have
reduced the nation's forest acreage. The present Forestry Law
stipulates that only governments above the county level can
authorize certificates for logging.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a new clause has been proposed for planting and
managing shelter-forests, conserving water and preventing soil
erosion.
</P>
<P>
According to the draft, the country will compensate those who
manage shelter forests.
</P>
<P>
To protect the diversity of plant resources, China will ban or
limit the export of precious trees if the top legislature approves
the amendments.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the implementation of various stipulations of the
Forestry Law, the country will also set up police departments in
forestry areas to maintain social order, protect forestry
resources and prevent forestry fires.

<HEADLINE> First Two Patients Infected with HIV-Tainted Blood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Two patients have been
infected with the Human Immuno-deficiency Virus (HIV) which causes
AIDS because the blood they received in a hospital here was
tainted, the Straits Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
This is the first such case in Singapore and the Singapore
Government has said that it would pay for all the medical expenses
of the two patients who were given the HIV-tainted blood.
</P>
<P>
The report said that police are investigating the case to see
if the donor of the tainted blood ought to be prosecuted. The
HIV-infected blood came from a man who had been a regular blood
donor at the Singapore Blood Transfusion Service since July last
year.
</P>
<P>
Tests on blood he gave in June this year did not show the HIV,
because he made the donation during what is called the "window
period" of about three weeks after infection, when the virus does
not show up in available tests. But he was infected at the time,
and the blood was transfused to the two patients, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The truth was found out only later in September when the man
turned up again to make a sixth donation, and this time the tests
showed that he was HIV-positive.
</P>
<P>
The Healthy Ministry said in a statement that it is the first
case in almost 742,000 blood donations made in Singapore since
1985 when HIV screening of blood donors was started.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry said that the victims and their families were
devastated by the discovery. The Government has promised that "all
necessary medical treatment and support" would be given to the
victims. Besides, the victims, together with their family members,
were receiving counseling to cope with the horrifying discovery.

NEW DELHI, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government has

in India in order to ensure even utilization of airport
infrastructure during day and night, the local press said today.

Speaking at an international conference which opened here
Monday, Civil Aviation Minister C.M. Ibrahim said most

At the same time, airport facilities remain "heavily

Stating that such under-utilization of expensive facilities can
not be afforded, Ibrahim called for rescheduling of flights so
that utilization is spread evenly.

NEW DELHI, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government has
formally notified its decision to liberalize import of gold as

Payment of duty could be made in rupees under the new import
policy instead of in U.S. dollars as stipulated by the old regime.

<HEADLINE> Judges Issue in Pakistan Likely to Be Settled Today </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The tussle between the
government and the Supreme Court over the appointment of judges
seemed to be resolved after an unprecedented meeting at the
presidency late last night.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which started at nine o'clock Tuesday evening and
lasted about three and a half hours, was called by President
Farooq Leghari and attended by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, Chief
of Army Staff General Jehangir Karamat and Chief Justice Sajjad
Ali Shah.
</P>
<P>
It is believed to be the first time in Pakistan's history that
heads of the executive, the judiciary and the army met in this
manner to head off an impending clash between different state
institutions.
</P>
<P>
According to government sources, the meeting Tuesday night has
hammered out a "mutually acceptable solution" to the problem.
</P>
<P>
The government has decided not to bring up the issue in the
National Assembly session scheduled for Wednesday evening and the
details of the final settlement are expected to be announced by
the government today.
</P>
<P>
The meeting between the four powerful men was "positive,
constructive and was held in a cordial atmosphere," the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
There are reports that last night's meeting had worked out a
settlement between the government and the judiciary and the
dispute had been buried. The question of the number of judges to
be elevated had also been settled.
</P>
<P>
The extraordinary and unprecedented meeting was held to arrest
the crisis situation arising from the dispute between the
government and the Chief Justice on the elevation of five judges
to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
since the negotiations between the government and the Chief
Justice had reached point of no return with the government going
ahead with legislation on fixing the strength of Supreme Court
judges, President Leghari finally interfered to make last ditch
efforts to resolve the issue outside the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the government had prepared its strategy after taking
its allied parties into confidence regarding its proposed
legislation to reduce the sanctioned strength of judges in the
Supreme Court. However, the plan was canceled late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Other sources said that the government has made no final
decisions about its strategy and kept its options open leaving
them on developments today.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court will pass final order on the stay application
praying for suspension of the operation of the Anti-Defection Law
today, only hours before the National Assembly session in which
the government is likely to table a bill relating to the
judiciary.
</P>
<P>
The Anti-Defection Law, or the 14th amendment to the
Constitution, passed unanimously by both houses of the parliament
early July restrains members of the parliament from breaching
party discipline, code of conduct and declared policies.

KATHMANDU, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The crime rate in the
Kathmandu Valley has decreased so far this year by 77.13 percent
compared with the previous year, Nepali newspapers reported today.

Traffic accidents and deaths caused thereby have dropped by

and that of the region and the world," while talking "frankly
about difference" with China.
</P>
<P>
She reaffirmed, however, that the U.S. relationship with China
should not be held hostage to any one single issue.

Colombo, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan police in the
northern city of Vavuniya Tuesday arrested 15 Tamil rebels who
were involved in the massive bombing of downtown Colombo on
October 15, police sources said here today.

explosives under the special direction of the Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam, which was blamed for the attack.

<P>
Police added that some other people who were involved in making
such compartments for trucks were also in custody.
</P>
<P>
Security has been tightened up both in Colombo and the other
cities in the country following the powerful blast nearly half
month ago. Colombo police have arrested several key suspects for
the bombing.

<HEADLINE> Economic Conditions Improving in Ethnic Minority Regions (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, October 29 (Xinhua) -- China's ethnic minority areas
have achieved amazing progress in turning their rich resources to
economic advantage in the last couple of years, a senior government
official reported to a recent conference.
</P>
<P>
The gross domestic product (GDP) of areas inhabited by ethnic
minorities in China has grown at an average annual rate of 12.7
percent in the past five years, higher than the national average,
Tudao Doje, vice minister of the State Nationalities Affairs
Commission, told a national conference on ethnic development in
Beihai, a port city in southern China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region.
</P>
<P>
The economic strength of ethnic minority regions has greatly
improved with fixed assets increasing by 337.5 billion yuan in the
1992-96 period, mainly as a result of tapping their natural
resources, Tudao said.
</P>
<P>
Industrial output rose from 188 billion yuan to 488.5 billion
yuan, representing an annual growth of 14 percent, he said. Tudao
credited the achievement to new trends in fully exploiting natural
resources in such regions.
</P>
<P>
The majority of China's minorities live in the Xinjiang Uygur,
Tibet, Inner Mongolia, Guangxi Zhuang and Ningxia Hui autonomous
regions, 13 autonomous prefectures and 121 autonomous counties
with a combined population of 103 million.
</P>
<P>
Economic growth of these regions long has lagged behind that of
other parts of the country because of poor transportation,
inadequate funding and a lack of technical expertise.
</P>
<P>
The central government's new policy of speeding up economic
development in central and western China combined with a market
economy have provided the impetus for rapid growth in ethnic
minority regions, Tudao said.

During the 1990-96 period, Inner Mongolia, which has a verified
coal reserve of 217 billion tons, provided Beijing with 12.4
billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, 25 percent of the city's
demand.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with a new government strategy, Inner Mongolia is
burning coal to produce electricity. This strategy has turned
Inner Mongolia from an electricity importer to exporter and has
accelerated its process of industrialization.
</P>
<P>
The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in northwestern China is
emerging as a leading oil producer in the country. The region has
succeeded in increasing its oil output from 5.5 million tons in
1986 to last year's 14.7 million tons. Three petro-chemical
plants have been built. The output from oil accounts for 30
percent of the region's total industrial production.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang also leads the country in both the total outout and
unit yield of cotton.
</P>
<P>
The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has put into operation the
Nanning-Kunming Railway line and airports in the cities of Guilin
and Liuzhou since the region was designated in 1992 as a major
outlet on the sea in southwestern China.
</P>
<P>
Exploitation of natural resources in ethnic minority regions
will help to accelerate their economic growth, enhance unity among
people of various ethnic groups and narrow the gap between these
regions and economically developed areas, Tudao said.
</P>
<P>
Resource-tapping has combined the efforts of people in the
eastern and western parts of the country and of Han and ethnic
minorities. More than 20,000 township-run enterprises in eastern
China have invested 30 billion yuan in developing untapped
resources in the central and western parts of China.
</P>
<P>
Official 1996 statistics show that the range of the increase in
per capita net income of farmers in China's minority-inhabited
central and western parts surpassed that in the income of farmers
on the eastern coast.

<HEADLINE> City in Three Gorges Area Aims High in Rebuilding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Wanxian City aims to become a
regional economic center as a result of the massive resettlement
for the Three Gorges Project, sources here said.
</P>
<P>
Wanxian, covering 29,500 square kilometers in the eastern part
of Chongqing, is a big grain production center with more than 90
percent of its population engaged in farming.
</P>
<P>
More than 800,000 people are being resettled and part of the
city's urban area will be removed to make way for constructing the
dam project.
</P>
<P>
According to Gu Wenxing, a leading official of Wanxian, the
resettlement has given the city an opportunity to benefit from a
central government's investment of one billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
In the next 10 years, the central and local governments are
expected to invest more than five billion yuan annually for
resettlement and rebuilding.
</P>
<P>
Gu told Xinhua that the city expects to become a prosperous,
regional center in industrial, communications, financial,
commercial, tourism and information fields in eastern Chongqing,
the youngest municipality in China.
</P>
<P>
Wanxian has been granted preferential policies to promote the
local economy, he said, noting that the new residents of the city
will become a manufacturing center for many name-brand products.
</P>
<P>
The city government has also drawn up plans to tap its unique
tourism resources and hopes to make it a backbone industry.
</P>
<P>
Gu said that the city has invested more than 200 million yuan
in the Wanxian Yangtze River Bridge Project and road extensions,
and another 600 million yuan in Wuqiao Airport.
</P>
<P>
One billion yuan is expected to be invested in railway
construction between Wanxian and Daxian, and a deep-water port
capable of handling 1,500-ton-class vessels, he said.
</P>
<P>
The city's rebuilding is an important part of economic
development in Chongqing as well as the southwestern part of the
country, Gu said.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Ready to Offer $10 Bln in Aid to Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
has confirmed that Singapore is ready to offer 10 billion U.S.
Dollars in assistance to help restore confidence in the Indonesian
economy, local newspapers reported today.
</P>
<P>
Out of the 10 billion U.S. Dollars, Soeharto said Tuesday in
Pasuruan, East Java, 5 billion U.S. Dollars would be standby loans
to strengthen the country's foreign exchange reserves and another
5 billion U.S. Dollars would be used to buy rupiahs to help the
country re-build public confidence in its currency.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto said rupiah bought by Singapore would remain in
control of Bank Indonesia, the central bank, to extend credit
facilities.
</P>
<P>
The offer was made by Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong
during his visit here on October 21. No figures were given then on
the amount of aid.
</P>
<P>
Similar pledge was also made by Malaysia with Deputy Prime
Minister Anwar Ibrahim committing one billion U.S. Dollar Monday
in standby loans to help Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, informed sources at the State Secretariat said
Tuesday that Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto would hold
telephone discussions with President Soeharto today on the current
crisis in the region.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the Indonesian government had decided to
ask for financial assistance from international financial
institutions, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the
World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
But Soeharto surprised the market on Tuesday by saying that
Indonesia was not seeking financial aid from the IMF but only
advice on some economic reform packages already prepared by the
government.
</P>
<P>
"Don't misunderstand, we're not asking for money, we've
already set up out own (reform) programs, and we've asked IMF to
look at them because of their experience," Soeharto said.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto also asserted that IMF did not insist on any
conditionality to restore confidence in the rupiah which has
dropped by about 50 percent against the U.S. Dollar since the
beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
The president said the monetary crisis the country had suffered
for months so far was not because the country's economic
fundamentals were weak but because the impact of the monetary
crisis in neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
He said the country's economic fundamentals were quite strong
with foreign exchange reserve amounting to 22 billion U.S. Dollars
which was enough for five month imports.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate meanwhile remained below 10 percent while
economy grew by seven to eight percent, he added.
</P>
<P>
"We have to face the crisis calmly and with full
self-confidence," he said.

<HEADLINE> NATO Supports Ukraine's Integration with Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine's cooperation with the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is an important step in
the process of European Integration, says Don McConnen, head of
the NATO political committee.
</P>
<P>
McConnen made the remark at a press conference before ending a
two-day visit here as the leader of a NATO delegation.
</P>
<P>
The alliance is planning to enhance ties with eastern European
countries, including Russia and Ukraine, he said.
</P>
<P>
During his stay, McConnen discussed with Ukrainian officials
the necessity of stepping up joint actions to improve the
implementation of the Ukrainian-NATO distinctive partnership
charter signed in July.
</P>
<P>
He told Boris Olinyk, chairman of the Committee for Foreign
Affairs and Relations with Commonwealth of Independent States
(CIS) Nations, that it is feasible to open a Ukrainian military
mission for communications at NATO's headquarters in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
McConnen also proposed arranging various seminars on military
development in Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
Olinyk said: "Ukrainian citizens, particularly the Ukrainian
parliament, have different opinions on the Ukrainian-NATO
relations and NATO's expansion."
</P>
<P>
However, he said, Ukraine seeks to integrate into the European
community and at the same time maintain its own
sovereignty. Cooperation between the two sides was in accordance
with Ukraine's national interests and security.
</P>
<P>
"We will integrate into European structures to ensure our
sovereignty, even though not everyone welcomes this process," he
stressed.

<P>
HUHHOT, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Since 1984, 2.41 billion yuan
(about 300 million U.S. dollars) has been invested in impoverished
areas of north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Regions.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the region has built more than 10,000
kilometers of roads and increased irrigated areas by 200,000
hectares and transformed 66,000 hectares of medium- and low-yield
fields.
</P>
<P>
Potable water projects have been a high priority for the region
with 1.61 million farmers and 5.73 million head of livestock in
impoverished areas now having access to high-quality drinking
water. The general level of farmers' health has markedly improved,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
To develop animal husbandry, the regional government has
provided livestock for herdsmen living in impoverished areas.
</P>
<P>
As a result, 3.8 million farmers have escaped poverty. Grain
output for the 50 poorest counties topped 10 billion kilograms in
1996, increasing by 6 billion kilograms over the 1984 figure.

<P>
It plans to help 160,000 of the 450,000 poor people in Hainan
get rid of poverty this year, by raising their per-capital income
by at least 100 yuan, and the reamaining 290,000 will be rid of
poverty by 1999.
</P>
<P>
Since 1990, the province has put 232 million yuan into poverty
eradication and has brought the number of its poor people to the
present figure from 1.4 million.
</P>
<P>
In the past seven years, Hainan has built 400 water
conservation projects and 2,430 drinking water projects in rual areas.

The power generating capacity has increased by 760,000 kw and
922 km of roads have been built.
</P>
<P>
The province has paid attention to the agricultural development
and the better use of local resources in backward areas. It has
set up 212 agricultural production bases and developed 26,700
ha. of land for tropical plant cultivation in impoverished areas.
</P>
<P>
Scientific farming has been another important part of the
drive. Hainan has run training courses for 160,000 farmers.

a high-ranking official said here at a travel industry fair.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Global Stock Plunges Unlikely to Affect China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The recent across-the-board
plunges in major stock indices worldwide will not affect China's
"A share" market, according to a report by the Shanghai Securities
News today.
</P>
<P>
The fact that A shares are not open to overseas investors means
that stock market volatility in other parts of the world will not
affect China, said the report citing Chinese experts.
</P>
<P>
There are two separate stock markets in China. The A share
market is for domestic investors only, while the B share market is
reserved for overseas buyers.
</P>
<P>
Pan Yingli, a professor in international finance, said that
China's not-yet-open capital market will prevent the A share
market from being affected by the wild fluctuations of other world
markets.
</P>
<P>
The major stock indices in Hong Kong, New York, London, Tokyo,
Seoul, Paris, Frankfurt and Sydney have dived in recent days.
</P>
<P>
Pan, a professor with the Shanghai-based East China Teachers'
University, said the performance of China's A share market is
determined by the fundamentals of the Chinese mainland and by
market confidence.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese economy has been sound in recent years, the experts
said, with the monthly inflation rate down to almost nothing, and
investor confidence remaining stable.
</P>
<P>
Gu Mingde, a researcher at the Shanghai Branch of the People's
Bank of China, the central bank, acknowledged that the recent
stock plunges in other parts of the world may affect the markets
of the B shares and H shares, which refer to those listed in Hong
Kong by inland Chinese companies.
</P>
<P>
"The impact on A shares will be very limited," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese currency is still not convertible under the capital
account, making it virtually impossible for international
speculators to launch an attack on the Chinese stock market, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Both experts say that interest rate cuts this month will
benefit the development of the stock market in the long term.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 29 (Xinhua) -- A flower trading center with a
floor space of 46,000 square meters, the largest of its kind in
Asia, is under construction in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The project is scheduled for completion by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The 220-million-yuan project has been jointly funded by the

The center in the Chaoyang District will include a flower
supermarket, an auction hall, an exhibition hall and an
international agricultural information center equipped with a
computer network.
</P>
<P>
Other support facilities such as banks and transport services
will be incorporated into the center.
</P>
<P>
International practices will be followed at the flower auction,
according to Yang Bin, president of the Holland-based company.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that the trade volume of flowers in
Beijing had increased eightfold in the 1991-96 period.
</P>
<P>
Sales at the flower shops in the city, which now number 256,
were 100 million yuan in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Beijing now has three large flower wholesale markets, covering
more than 27,000 square meters.
</P>
<P>
A local survey predicts that flower sales will go up 30 percent
this year.
</P>
<P>
The trading center is expected to play an active role in
boosting the development of country's fledgling floral
industry.

</P>
<P>
Croatia received a total of 80.07 million U.S. dollars in

Austria, Switzerland, Sweden, Belgium, Germany, the United States,
Denmark and Italy.
</P>
<P>
The investments went into more than 60 projects in the food,
cement and electronic industries.

BANGKOK, October 29 (Xinhua) -- With about 20 billion U.S.
dollars in foreign loans owed by 250 private businesses coming due
next year, the Thai Bankers' Association (TBA) is urging to create
a special forum to negotiate extensions with some 150 foreign
creditors, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The sum is part of the foreign loans totaling 71 billion U.S.
dollars owed by Thai private borrowers.
</P>
<P>
If the loans are recalled without extensions, tight liquidity
in the country would worsen further, TBA Chairman Olarn Chaipravat
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, Olarn said the Thai government must act as a
core in organizing a forum for talks with foreign creditors.
</P>
<P>
In July total capital outflows amounted to 1.5 billion U.S.
dollars, rising to 3.5 billion U.S. dollars in August. In the
fourth quarter of this year, at least 2 billion U.S. dollars will
leave the country, Olarn said.

<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria expects a four percent
gross domestic product (GDP) growth for 1998, Financial Minister
Muravei Radev announced today.
</P>
<P>
The budget draft approved by the government today envisages an
annual inflation rate of 35 percent and a 42 percent increase in
the average wage for next year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Radev told a press conference that the GDP is likely to
decline by 6-8 percent this year and the accumulated inflation
rate will reach six percent.
</P>
<P>
The monthly average pay is 125,000 lev (78 U.S. dollars) this
year and will rise to 177,000 lev (110 dollars) in 1998, the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
Among the 8.37 million population, 1.5 million people were on
pay rolls and 2.4 million people received pensions from the
government, he said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 600,000 people were jobless. Radev said that the
government would introduce social reform on employment to address
the problem.
</P>
<P>
The fiscal deficit would be four percent of the GDP this year
and it would fall to two percent next year, he said.
</P>
<P>
The deficit would be filled up by revenues collected from
privatization, which would amount to 540 billion lev (337.5
million dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The international balance of payments will be 175 million
dollars in favor of Bulgaria and it will reach 350 million dollars

restrictions on products of other countries.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Intensifies Drug Trafficking Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The Bulgarian Interior Ministry
is going to step up efforts to deal with increasingly serious
drug-related crimes in the country.
</P>
<P>
About 80 per cent of the drugs sold in Europe passed along the
Balkan route and through Bulgaria, Interior Ministry Chief
Secretary General Bozhidar Popov told a news conference Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Heroin accounted for the bulk of the drugs trafficked through
Bulgaria but the quantities of cocaine, marihuana, hasheesh and
psychotropic substances were also increasing.
</P>
<P>
In the first eight months of this year Bulgarian customs
officials seized 71 per cent more heroin and over 140 times more
hasheesh than in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
More Bulgarians were involved in drug trafficking. They used to
play a supporting role but had recently joined in setting up
channels, albeit under the leadership of more powerful

<P>
LHASA, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Grain and rapeseed output in
China's Tibet Autonomous Region is expected to be 800,000 tons and
38,500 tons respectively this year, up 5.5 percent and 11.1
percent over last year, according to the Agriculture and Animal
Husbandry Bureau of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Per-capita income of farmers and herdsmen may reach 1,040 yuan,

</P>
<P>
The region has built 13,000 irrigation channels and 5,200 large
and small reservoirs in the past 10 years, and since the 1990s, the
central government has put 2.2 billion yuan into developing the
Yarlung Zengbo, Nyangqu, and Lhasa river valleys. This has
resulted in an annual increase of 52,000 tons of wheat and 1,672
tons of rapeseed.
</P>
<P>
The use of tractors and quality seeds also contributed to the
good harvest, an agriculture and animal husbandry official said.

<HEADLINE>   Peru Loses 290,000 Hectares of Forests Yearly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Peru loses about 290,000 hectares
of forests each year due to natural disasters and indiscriminate
exploitation, causing precious vegetal species to disappear, a
Peruvian biologist said today.
</P>
<P>
Jose Rios, dean of School of Biology of the National University
of Agriculture (NUA), said Peru has already lost 8 million
hectares of forests, and one of the main causes is the lack of an
adequate government control to help regeneration of natural
resources.
</P>
<P>
He said poverty also led to the deforestation, because the
population uses lands for agriculture and cattle breeding
irrationally, with no planning at all and with no law enacted to
protect the natural resources.
</P>
<P>
The conflagration in the area of Machu Picchu earlier this year
engulfed 600 hectares of forests, which will take 15 to 20 years
to restore the areas devastated, he said.
</P>
<P>
Among the most endangered species are cedar, mahogany,
cinchona and chestnut.
</P>
<P>
The NUA has signed an agreement with a U.S. university to
install a system to detect fires in forests in the Peruvian and
Brazilian Amazon, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 29 (Xinhua) -- China on Tuesday issued a set
of rules requiring large and medium-sized State-owned retailers to
employ special supervisors with official qualifications to further
ensure commodity quality.
</P>
<P>
The rules, jointly issued by the Ministry of Internal Trade and
the State Bureau of Technical Supervision, says full-time or
part-time supervisors are a must for large and medium-sized
State-owned retailers.
</P>
<P>
"China has about 50,000 large and medium-sized State-owned
retail businesses whose annual sales volume is above 40 million
yuan (4.8 million US dollars) each, and all of them have assigned
staff to be responsible for commodity quality supervision," said
Zhang Huiling, an official with the Ministry of Internal Trade.
</P>
<P>
"We have drafted the rules to help improve the quality of the
market commodity supervisors and standardize the current market
supervision of commodity quality, labelling and metrology, and
better protect the legal interests of consumers," today's China
Daily quoted Zhang as saying.
</P>
<P>
She said the new rules will help maintain a normal order of
commodity distribution by improving the "immunity of the markets"
from the entry of fake goods and substandard products.
</P>
<P>
According to the new rules, commodity supervisors will have the
right to ask commodity purchasers to refuse to sign contracts that
do not conform to the requirements of the contract acceptance
system.
</P>
<P>
They have the right to stop the sale of commodities with
quality problems and involve themselves in the investigation and
settlement of commodity disputes.

When they started, Zhao noted, auctioneers mainly handled goods
confiscated by the authorities or artworks, but now they are
handling a dozen different items, even property rights transfers.
</P>
<P>
The Auction Law took effect on January 1 this year, and there
are other laws and rules for regulating the business. China has
tried to standardize it and to improve the level of people working
in the business, Zhao said.
</P>
<P>
The auction business has also helped enliven the art market and
has caused many Chinese cultural relics to be returned from
abroad, Zhao said.
</P>
<P>
However, Zhao pointed out the business is still very
small when compared with other countries, so there are plans to
make bigger auction houses through mergers or other means.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Overseas banks have become an
important force in the economic development of Shanghai, China's
largest industrial city.
</P>
<P>
Official data show that overseas financial institutions have
set up 52 operational agencies and more than 150 representative
offices in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The 200-plus financial institutions in Shanghai account for
more than one third of all overseas financial institutions in
China.
</P>
<P>
Official figures also indicate that the 52 operational overseas
financial institutions have more than 15 billion US dollars in
total assets.
</P>
<P>
The nine overseas banks approved by the People's Bank of China,
the country's central bank, to deal in the Chinese yuan on a trial
basis, including the Citibank and the Hong Kong and Shanghai
Banking Corp, have all moved their Shanghai branches to Pudong, a
rising financial and trade district west of the Huangpu
River. Many other banks and insurance companies have followed suit.
</P>
<P>
Economists say that overseas banks have both benefited from the
rapid economic growth of Shanghai and helped introduce large
amounts of overseas funds and advanced management expertise into
Shanghai.

<HEADLINE> Heilongjiang to Absorb Foreign Funds in Mining Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Absorbing and utilizing foreign
funds effectively is the key to improving the mining industry in
Heilongjiang province, said a provincial government official.
</P>
<P>
The mining industrial output for 1996 in Heilongjiang Province,
rich in mineral resources, was 60 billion yuan (7.5 billion
U.S. dollars), second in the country.
</P>
<P>
Though the mining industry has become a pillar industry in the
province, its rigid economic structure would restrict sustainable
development of the economy, said Zhang Chengyi, vice-governor of
the province.
</P>
<P>
The province's resources include 131 kinds of minerals which
are distributed in 3,102 locations. Among them, 73 kinds have
proven deposits, 17 of which are in the top three of the nation
and 38 are first in the northeast provinces.
</P>
<P>
Sources said the province has exploited only 39 kinds of
minerals including oil, coal, and gold. Others remain
unexploited. Few foreign funds have been invested in the mining
industry.
</P>
<P>
To sustain development of the mining industry, Zhang said, the
province needs foreign investment, advanced technology and
expertise, and reforms in the mining industry's structure.

<HEADLINE> Experts: China to Achieve Zero Population Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, October 29 (Xinhua) -- China may achieve the goal of
zero population growth when its population reaches about 1.6
billion by the year 2050, a scholar from the Chinese Academy of
Social Sciences (CASS) has said.
</P>
<P>
"China's population is bound to keep going up over a long
period of time, even though the country has scored notable
achievements in controlling the population increase," said Tian
Xueyuan, director of the CASS Institute of Population Science, at
a training program on family planning being held in Chongqing
Municipality.
</P>
<P>
He added that experts both at home and abroad predicted that
China's population will climb to 1.3 billion by 2000, 1.4 billion
by 2010, and may reach around 1.6 billion by 2050, the year China
can realize zero population growth.
</P>
<P>
Chinese people's income will grow by a large margin during the
next 50 years, along with the booming urbanization and
modernization, Tian said.
</P>
<P>
"All these factors will lead to a rapid consumption growth that
contributes to the conflicts between the over-population and the
lack of natural resources," said Tian. "So it is urgent for us to
seek a means of sustainable development which can save more
resources and be compatible with the population growth."

port city of Thessaloniki.
</P>
<P>
On October 28, 1940, Greece was dragged into World War II after
rejecting Italian dictator Benito Mussolini's ultimatum to
surrender to the fascist forces or be invaded.
</P>
<P>
After the military parade in Thessaloniki, Greek President
Costis Stephanopoulos said that with strong armed forces capable
of confronting any designs against Greece, the country was
peacefully proceeding on the road of progress and prosperity,
looking at the future with courage and hope.
</P>
<P>
It was necessary for the younger generations to be fully
informed on the 1940 epoch, so that they too could feel the
emotion and enthusiasm with which the Greek people had hastened to
fulfill their duty of defending the homeland, the president said.
</P>
<P>
Greek Defense Minister Akis Tsohatzopoulos said that the Greek
armed forces gave, with their presence, the message of certainty,
stability and calm that the Greek people should feel.
</P>
<P>
He added that they showed that they were capable of confronting
and providing what Greece and the entire region need: prosperity,
peace and progress.
</P>
<P>
Main opposition New Democracy leader Costas Karamanlis said
that the Ochi Day anniversary was a reminder that when the nation
had unity and determination, it could attain all its goals.

<HEADLINE> President Jiang Zemin Arrives in Washington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin arrived here today to continue his state visit to the United
States at the invitation of President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
It is the first state visit by a Chinese head of state to the
U.S. in 12 years, a historical event seen as a milestone in the
Sino-American relations.
</P>
<P>
At the Andrews military airport, President Jiang was met by
U.S. Vice President Al Gore. Red carpets rolled down and flowers
were presented to the Chinese leader and his wife Wang Yeping. He
shook hands with the U.S. and Chinese officials present and waved
his acknowledgement to a big crowd holding the Chinese and
American national flags.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president was driven straight to the Blair House
downtown Washington where he and his wife are going to stay and
where Secretary of State Madelaine Albright was awaiting to meet
them.
</P>
<P>
Jiang is to receive a 21-gun solute welcome Wednesday morning
in the South Lawn of the White House, which is to be followed by a
summit meeting with President Clinton at noon and a state dinner
in the evening.
</P>
<P>
Upon departure from Beijing Sunday, President Jiang told the
press that he is going to discuss with President Clinton the
bilateral ties, cooperation in both bilateral and international
spheres.
</P>
<P>
"I hope and believe that my U.S. tour will produce important
results through joint efforts by both sides," he said.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang flew to the American Capital, the third leg of
his current trip, from Williamsburg, a symbol of British colonial
rule in the 17th century. He also made a stopover in Honolulu,
Hawaii, after a long flight from Beijing Sunday.
</P>
<P>
His entourage -- Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen
and his wife Zhou Hanqiong, special assistant Zeng Qinghong,
Director of the State Council's Foreign Affairs Office Liu
Huaqiu, special assistant Teng wensheng, Vice-Foreign Minister Li
zhaoxing, Assistant Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi and special
assistant You Xigui -- also arrived here on the same plane.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's summit meeting will be the fifth of its kind since
1993 when the two presidents met in Seattle at the APEC informal
meeting of leaders. In the following years, they met in Jakarta,
New York and Manila.
</P>
<P>
The Presidents agreed to exchange visits at their Manila summit
meeting in last November, giving a momentum to the improvement of
Sino-American relationship which turned sour following the U.S.
imposition of sanctions against China in 1989 and the invitation
to Lee Teng Hui of Taiwan to visit the United States in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Preparation has been under way since then, with both sides
making greater efforts to figure out the interests to be shared
and the differences to be ironed out.
</P>
<P>
The both sides have expressed their desire to work together on
regional and world peace and stability, non-proliferation, drugs
and crimes, economy and trade, science and technology, as well as
environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
As for the differences, mainly on human rights and trade
imbalance, the two countries share the view of narrowing the gaps
through talks and negotiations rather than pointing fingers at
each other publicly.
</P>
<P>
Against this backdrop, the upcoming summit meeting is expected
to focus on seeking common ground for closer cooperation toward
the 21st century while trying to diminish their differences.
</P>
<P>
The current tour will also take Jiang to Philadelphia, New
York, Boston and Los Angeles before he winds up his nine-day U.S.
trip.
</P>
<P>
It has been confirmed that President Clinton will return a
visit to China next Spring, fueling optimism for future ties
between the two major countries in the world.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon: Warsaw Pact Structure May Reduce NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 28 (Xinhua) -- A top U.S. Defense
Department official said today that the vast military structure
established by the Warsaw Pact during the Cold War could reduce
the cost of expanding the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO).
</P>
<P>
"The old Soviet-style infrastructure, while having some
defects, provides a very good foundation on which to build," said
Defense Undersecretary Walter Slocombe in his testimony to the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
The Senate is expected to vote to ratify the expansion treaty
next spring and is holding hearings into various aspects of the
expansion plan now.
</P>
<P>
Slocombe said all three nations, Poland, Hungary and the Czech
Republic, invited to join NATO in 1999 have made sufficient
progress on military, political, economic and social reforms.
</P>
<P>
"They are clearly ready to take the next steps to becoming full
members, accepting all the rights and responsibilities of
membership," Slocombe said.
</P>
<P>
The financial burden of the expansion of the alliance has
aroused controversies. The Pentagon estimated in February that the
total cost would be at 27 billion U.S. dollars to 35 billion
dollars over a 13-year period, much of it paid by the three new
members. The U.S. share was put at 150 million dollars to 200
million dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
But many senators have said that the cost could be much higher.

<HEADLINE> Sudan Wishes to Improve Relations with Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese Minister of State at
the Foreign Ministry Mustafa Othman Ismail announced that Sudan
welcomes any initiative aimed at overcoming obstacles and
improving Sudanese-Egyptian relations.
</P>
<P>
According to local reports today, the minister said Sudan was
convinced that the best means to improve Sudanese-Egyptian
relations was direct dialogue to determine the obstacles that
obstruct the historical and geographic ties.
</P>
<P>
The minister welcomed efforts to promote such dialogue, adding
that Sudan believes in joint actions within the framework of the
League of Arab States or that of the Organization of African Unity
for resolving the problems.
</P>
<P>
Such an approach, however, does not prevent bilateral or
trilateral contacts for a solution, he said.
</P>
<P>
South Africa President Nelson Mandela had, during the visit to
South Africa by Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir last August,
proposed an initiative for the eradication of differences between
the Sudan and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Sudanese-Egyptian relations have in recent years seen mounting
tension over disputed border areas.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Egypt has been accusing Sudan of supporting
Egyptian terrorists and involving in an attempt on the life of
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak during the African summit in
1995. Sudan promptly denied the allegation.

<HEADLINE> China Urges Int'l Community to Assist Developing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 28 (Xinhua) -- It was necessary for the
international community, especially the developed countries, to
take measures to assist the development of the enterprises of the
developing countries, Chinese delegate Yuan Shaofu said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Second Committee (Economic and Financial) of
the 52nd session of the General Assembly, Yuan Shaofu said
enterprises were important players in economic and social
development. Small and medium enterprises in developed countries
played an important role in generating tax revenue, creating
employment, contributing to social stability and represent the
potential for economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Yuan said all enterprises in the developing countries were
small and medium sized, due to the near non-existence of large
transnational corporations. In recent years, the development of
enterprises had been accorded more and more attention from the
international community.
</P>
<P>
Yuan said that in view of the fact that almost all enterprises
in developing countries were small and medium sized, which
suffered from technical backwardness, lacked of human and
financial resources, and lagged far behind the level that
enterprises in developed countries had reached, assistance in this
regard could take a variety of forms which could at least include
the following: joint venture, stock participation,
sub-contracting, technological transfer, strategic alliances and
licensing.
</P>
<P>
Such kind of assistance, he said, was indispensable because
interdependence was also expressed in the relationship between the
enterprises of developed countries and those of developing
countries, given the increasing globalization and liberalization
of the world economy.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegate said industrial development occupied an
important position in the development of national economies. it
was the key to the process of modernization. In the globalization
process, the issue of industrialization of the developing
countries was particularly important.
</P>
<P>
Yuan stressed a country's own efforts were of course
indispensable for its industrialization process. But at the same
time, support from the international community was also necessary.
Assisting the developing countries to achieve industrial
development and economic growth should be a major component in
international development cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Yuan expressed the hope the United Nations Industrial
Development Organization would further strengthen its mandated
role, so as to continue to contribute to the promotion of
international cooperation in the industrial sector, and to assist
the developing countries in achieving the elimination of poverty
and the revitalization of their economies.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Criticizes Israeli Stance on Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa today criticized the Israeli stance toward peace and
emphasized that permanent peace needs a balanced approach.
</P>
<P>
"By logic and the testimony of history, peace can not be
considered permanent unless it is balanced," Moussa was quoted by
the Middle East News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
He refuted the remarks made by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu Tuesday that peace will not be achieved according to
the will of the Arabs but rather to Israel's security requirements.
</P>
<P>
"Eventually they (the statements) will inflame violence,"
Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
He said Netanyahu's remarks on peace in his policy address to
Israeli Knesset (parliament) Tuesday is "unrealistic" and only
expresses a "short-sighted policy of intransigence."
</P>
<P>
He warned that Netanyahu's policy of rejection of all signed
peace agreements with the Palestinians will lead to a state of
international chaos.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said that Israel wants to advance the peace process,
adding peace agreements can not be fully carried out unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
He said that no more land will be handed over to the
Palestinians unless the Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
fulfills its commitments to fight terror.
</P>
<P>
He also declared that Israel will continue Jewish settlement
activities in the West Bank, and Jerusalem will remain as the
unified capital of Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks have come to a crucial
crossroad as Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy has postponed his
talks with PNA chief negotiator Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) scheduled
in Washington this week.

JERUSALEM, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has
pledged to provide economic aid to the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA), said PNA Finance Minister Mohammed Zuhdi
Nashashibi in Gaza today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters upon his return from his recent visit to
Brussels, Nashashibi said that the EU has agreed to provide an
economic aid of 30 million U.S. dollars to the PNA, the Jerusalem
Media and Communication Cernter (JMCC) reported.
</P>
<P>
He added that the EU will also grant the PNA a loan of 100
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the finance minister disclosed that the budget
deficit of the PNA has amounted to 116 million dollars due to
Israel's closure on the Palestinian self-ruled areas, according to
JMCC.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the deficit will continue to rise if Israel does
not lift the closure.
</P>
<P>
Israel sealed off the PNA territories in the wake of suicide
bombings in Jerusalem on July 30, blocking Palestinian workers and
vehicles from entering Israel.
</P>
<P>
So far, internal closure has been lifted in some cities, but
the total closure remains intact.
