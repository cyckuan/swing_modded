<HEADLINE> 26 More Die of Gastroenteritis in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 26 (Xinhua) -- A latest outbreak of
gastroenteritis has claimed 26 lives in the past week in Rupandehi
district, western Nepal, the official RSS news agency reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 451 people in the district have been suffering from
the disease with children hardest hit, the RSS said.
</P>
<P>
Consumption of polluted water and fingerlings was blamed for
the outbreak of the disease, the news agency quoted a local health
officer as saying.
</P>
<P>
Gastroenteritis used to be controlled before mid-September in
the past years, but this year it is still raging in the country at
this time.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that 840 people had succumbed to the
disease from mid-April to October 12.

<HEADLINE> Injured S. African Soccer Players Released from Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Six players of local premier league club Moroka Swallows were
injured Sunday afternoon at George Goch stadium in Johannesburg
when lightning struck the pitch.
</P>
<P>
The game was first suspended and then cancelled, the first
time in the country that a soccer match was cancelled due to
lightning strike.
</P>
<P>
Two players were taken to hospital after they were knocked
unconscious and the other four suffered no serious injury.
</P>
<P>
Premier Soccer League (PSL) spokesman Andrew Dipela said the
PSL would on Tuesday make an announcement on whether or not it
would be replayed.
</P>
<P>
The incident happened in the last 12 minutes of the game when
Jomo Cosmos led 2-0.
</P>
<P>
Swallows spokesman Godfrey Gxowa said it was a traumatic
experience for the players, but he did not expect the incident to
have any psychological affect on them.
</P>
<P>
"Swallows lost a player on the pitch about 15 years ago and
while it did have an affect on the club, the players did overcome
the psychological pain over time," Gxowa said.
</P>
<P>
"To see so many players struck by lightning was a frightening
experience and really an eye-opener for everybody that such
incidents can, and do, happen."
</P>
<P>
He said he was pleased with Cosmos' coach Jomo Sono's reaction
on Monday when Sono said in an interview he was more concerned on
the players' safety than winning the game.
</P>
<P>
An official at the Johannesburg metro emergency management
services, Charles Terre Blanche, said Monday that except for the
six soccer players who were injured, there were four other
incidents in Johannesburg on Sunday where people were injured by
lightning.
</P>
<P>
None of the incidents were because of a direct hit by
lightning, but by the lightning hitting the ground, he said,
adding that it could be fatal as it causes high-voltage surges.
</P>
<P>
"This is what happened to the soccer players. They received an
electrical shock from the ground," Terre Blanche said.
</P>
<P>
He said electrical storms were normal in South Africa for this
time of year, when everything was still dry.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, a Johannesburg high school pupil, who was
thought to be a cricket star on the rise, was struck dead by
lightning after a cricket match.

<HEADLINE> New Panda Breeding At Beijing Zoo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The progress in giant panda
breeding research at the Beijing Zoo has helped twin panda cubs
survive their most vulnerable period.
</P>
<P>
The twin pandas in question are already a month old and are
doing normal. The survival rate of cubs in artificial surroundings
is quite low, says Zhang Jinguo, the zoo's senior
veterinarian. The major reason is in the artificial propagation. A
mother panda generally looks after only one of the twins and
the other needs assistance.
</P>
<P>
After many trials, researchers at the zoo decided to use two
special breeding methods: one involved alternating natural care
with artificial care, the other involves producing milk that
provided immunity similar to that provided by the mother.
</P>
<P>
The giant panda is on the verge of extinction. Statistics show
a decrease to between 900 and 1,200 in an area that is limited to
mountainous parts of China's Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Zoo, which is China's largest, has had some success
in establishing a self-sufficient giant panda group with one wild
and 15 zoo-bred pandas.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 26 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin, in a
meeting today with newly elected leaders of the All-China
Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU), said that the Party will
adhere to its basic principle of whole-heartedly depending on the
working class.
</P>
<P>
The meeting at Zhongnanhai, the central government
headquarters, also included some delegates to the recent 13th
National Congress of the ACFTU.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the country faces both opportunities and
challenges in the increasing world multipolarization and economic
globalization and rapid scientific and technological progress.
</P>
<P>
He praised the Chinese working class's role in the past century
and said he hopes they will make fresh contributions to the
reform, opening up and the modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes they support the Party's and government's
major measures in promoting the reform of state-owned enterprises
and have a proper attitude toward the readjustment of interests
relations in the course of the reform.
</P>
<P>
He said that enterprises should improve democratic management
and depend more on workers' representatives meetings to deal with
major issues concerning enterprise reforms and development and
workers' interests.
</P>
<P>
Trade unions should play a greater role as a bridge between the
Party and the workers, he said, and unions should help unite the
workers closely around the Party.
</P>
<P>
He said he also hopes that trade union leaders improve
themselves and try their best to serve the workers.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The National People's Congress
(NPC)'s Education, Science, Culture and Public Health Committee
heard reports here today on an amendment to the Pharmaceutical
Administration Law.
</P>
<P>
Committee members also heard reports on an inspection of the
implementation of the Archives Law and an epidemic prevention law.
</P>
<P>
The committee also reviewed 41 bills submitted by the presidium
of the first session of the Ninth NPC.
</P>
<P>
Zheng Xiaoyu, Director of the State Bureau of Pharmaceutical
Supervision and Management, said that 14 years of enforcement of
the Pharmaceutical Administration Law has shown that it has played
an important role in guaranteeing the safety of pharmaceuticals
and the detecting of fake products.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the law needs to be amended to be even more
effective.
</P>
<P>
The committee sent fact-finding teams to nine provinces and
municipalities from May to June to check on the implementation of
the Archives Law and found that in some places units did not pay
much attention to the law.
</P>
<P>
In the past two months, the committee also sent a team to
Sichuan, Yunnan and Zhejiang provinces to look into the
implementation of the epidemic prevention law there.
</P>
<P>
The team discovered that some units failed to follow the law
and that the law itself needs to be amended to adapt to the new
situation.

KUNMING, October 26 (Xinhua) -- A contract signed by Australian
delegates and the organizing committee of the "99 Kunming
Horticulture Exposition" here today meant the implementation of
the committee's plan.
</P>
<P>
The Exposition now has 80 countries and international

The "99 Kunming Horticulture Exposition" will be the only large

scheduled for May 1 to October 31, 1999, and will display
horticultural developments worldwide as a sort of "Horticultural
Olympics".
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that the good reaction worldwide comes from two
things: its theme of man and the nature touches all nations, and
Kunming's unique scenery and moderate climate make it a superb
location for this kind of event.

<HEADLINE> Low Turnout, Close Races Expected in November Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Republican and Democratic
leaders agree that the upcoming midterm elections in the United
States will be marked by low turnout and close races.
</P>
<P>
Democrats said that in an off-year election where the party
that controls the White House usually loses, their hope is to
break even in House of Representatives and Senate races.
Republicans said they will pick up seats, but there will be no
repetition of the 1994 Republican landslide.
</P>
<P>
Representative Martin Frost, a Democrat and chairman of the
House Democratic campaign committee, predicted "a very close
election. Most of the national polls show this in a dead heat. We
think there will be a lot of races that will be decided by 1,000
and 2,000 votes."
</P>
<P>
"These are local races," said Representative John Linder, a
Republican and chairman of the House Republican Campaign Committee
"For some time, I've been saying we'd gain 10 to 15 seats based on
local political fundamentals. And I never did believe it was a
referendum on Bill Clinton," he said on CBS' "Face the Nation."
</P>
<P>
Democrats insisted that would be a plus as their candidates
press themes of Republican shortcomings in such areas as
education, health care and campaign finance."
</P>
<P>
In the last non-presidential-year election, 1994, Republicans
gained 54 seats in the House and nine in the Senate to win control
of both chambers.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia's GDP Growth Tops 6.4 PC Yearly Since </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia has achieved
averaged 6.4 percent growth rate in real gross domestic product
(GDP) per year since 1992/93, Minister of Economic Development
and Cooperation Girma Birru said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting on rural roads and transport here, Girma
said strong recovery has been witnessed in performance of the
Ethiopian economy since the launching of the economic reform
program where growth in real GDP averaged 6.4 percent per annum
between 1992/93 and 1997/98, up from a less than 2 percent
average growth in the 1980's.
</P>
<P>
He stated that the agricultural, industrial and services
sectors have also been growing by 4.3, 9.5 and 8.5 percent per
annum respectively during the stated period.
</P>
<P>
Inflation has been contained at less than 5 percent during the
past five years, Girma noted.
</P>
<P>
"Such growth performance was accompanied by a marked increase
in domestic saving and investment which rose to 7 and 20 percent
of GDP respectively in 1997/98 from 3.5 and 10.5 percent share in
1990/91," he disclosed.
</P>
<P>
The minister told participants that the nation has adopted a
long-term development strategy referred to as "agricultural
development led industrialization" aimed at revitalizing the
agricultural sector and hence laying a sound basis for industrial
growth.
</P>
<P>
However, he said despite such positive achievements, Ethiopia
is still challenged by low level of education and health
standards and that the economic infrastructure need to go a long
way to compare even with African standards.
</P>
<P>
In a similar development, Ethiopian Vice-Minister of Trade and
Industry Biruk Debebe disclosed here Friday that the nation is
expected to achieve a 7-8 percent economic growth in current
1998/99.

<HEADLINE> Over 5,700 Iraqi Children Die in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, October 26 (Xinhua) -- A total of 5,767 Iraqi children
under five and 2,623 adults died in September of malnutrition and
various curable diseases, a report released by the Health Ministry
Monday showed.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the high death toll to the eight-year-old
U.N. sanctions against Iraq, which have left Iraq in severe
shortage of medicine and many Iraqis under starvation.
</P>
<P>
The number of children that under five and adults died of
malnutrition and curable diseases in September, 1989 was 286 and
439 respectively before the sanctions, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions were imposed on Iraq shortly after its invasion of
Kuwait in 1990 and will not be lifted until the U.N. weapons
inspectors certify that Baghdad has eliminated all weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
The report also showed that mortality of children under five
reached 52,052 in the first nine months in 1998 while that of
adults, aged over 50, were 52,174.
</P>
<P>
And a total of 410,794 children below five and 621,958 adults
above 50 had died since the beginning of the sanctions till
September of this year.

<HEADLINE> Museveni, U.S. Envoy Discuss Congo (K) Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni and U.S. Special Envoy to the Great Lakes Region Howard
Wolpe discussed the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC) here Monday.
</P>
<P>
They reviewed the proposals which have so far been made by the
region on how to resolve the conflict in the DRC, a press release
from the President's Office said Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
It said the special envoy was particularly interested in the
mechanism for the implementation of a cease-fire and subsequent
negotiations with a view to seeing how his government can be of
assistance.
</P>
<P>
Monday's East African weekly reported that the U.S. government
has asked Uganda and Rwanda to withdraw their troops from the
12-week-long conflict.
</P>
<P>
The paper said this move by Washington was based on fears that
the rising number of African countries intervening in the Congo
(K) civil war could worsen the conflict.
</P>
<P>
However, while addressing a press conference on October 21,
Museveni refuted press reports that the U.S. government had
ordered Uganda to get out of Congo (K).
</P>
<P>
"I talked to them (Americans) about the press reports and they
denied such claims," the president told dozens of reporters
emphatically.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the rebellion against Congolese
President Laurent Kabila in early August, Uganda and Rwanda have
been accused of being behind the Tutsi rebels, a charge both
governments denied vehemently.
</P>
<P>
Kenya and Tanzania joined Uganda in the view that all foreign
troops should pull out of Congo (K) when presidents of these
countries met in Nairobi on October 18.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe decided to send
2,000 more troops to eastern Congo to reinforce the 3,000-strong
Zimbabwean troops there, an indication that the crisis there is
still worsening fast.
</P>
<P>
With the widening of the crisis, there are growing concerns
that more and more African countries will be drawn into the
conflict, making the regional crisis a continental one.

<HEADLINE> UNITA Organizational Secretary Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Franco Marcolino Nhani,
Secretary for Organizational Affairs in Angola's biggest
opposition movement of UNITA, declared to resign here Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued at a press conference, Nhani said he
made the decision because the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) has continued its war policy,
which he said runs against the will of Angolan people.
</P>
<P>
The UNITA official who is also a UNITA representative at the
joint committee for national peace process, said he held that
implementation of the 1994 Lusaka Peace Protocol, which has
opened up the peace process in Angola, is the only way to free
the country of its three-decade-long civil war.
</P>
<P>
The fresh crisis of the peace process, he said, has put the
Angolan people on the brink of renewing the civil war, which runs
counter to the interest of the country and the will of the
people. For this he decided to resign from his post in UNITA.
</P>
<P>
Nhani did not say whether he would join the break-away UNITA
Renovation Committee, but he made it clear that he would stick to
his ideal of peace, national unity and reconciliation, and keep
loyal to the Angolan people who have voted him into Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Nhani who joined UNITA in 1974, was elected organizational
secretary of the party in 1995 at the eighth national congress
and was sent to Luanda as a representative of the joint committee
of the peace process in Angola in the same year.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, he was chosen as a UNITA parliament member to the
Angolan National Assembly. On April 1, 1998, he was appointed as
one of the leaders of the UNITA delegation in Luanda.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Greece could continue to play a
role in pushing forward procedures that would lead to a lasting
peace in the Middle Eastern region, Israeli ambassador in Athens
Ran Curiel said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference on the Israeli-Palestinian
accord, Curiel described Greece's holding of talks between Israeli
and Palestinian MPs in Vouliagmeni and Rhodes recently as positive
for the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Greece could continue in this way to act in the benefit of the
peace process and also support the new process, whether through
the European Union (EU) or through economic means, as Israel lent
particular weight to economic development of the Palestinians, he
said.
</P>
<P>
To help rekindle the stalled Middle East peace process, Greece
has sponsored a series of meetings between Israeli and Palestinian
figures over the past few years with the latest one taking place
on the southern Greek island of Rhodes in July this year.

<P>
Earlier in the afternoon, a Jewish settler was shot dead in
another West Bank city of Hebron. Israeli security forces blamed
Palestinians for the killing.
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old man, who worked as a security guard at a power
station, was shot in his car near the Jewish settlement of Kiryat
Arba, where he lived. The assailant hurled his body out of the car
before speeding away.
</P>
<P>
A Palestinian journalist found the body and summoned an
ambulance. Palestinian doctors, who rushed to the site trying in
vain to save him, said he had been shot at least twice on the
upper part of the body.
</P>
<P>
Local television quoted a Palestinian source as saying the car
had been located in Palestinian-controlled areas. Palestinian
police joined Israeli security forces in apprehending the attacker.
</P>
<P>
The terror attack was the first since Israeli and Palestinian
leaders signed a land-for-peace deal last Friday at the White
House.
</P>
<P>
Hebron, home to more than 400 Jewish settlers surrounded by
about 120,000 Palestinian residents, has become one of the
flashpoints of conflict.
</P>
<P>
A Jewish settler was stabbed to death in August by a
Palestinian man, who was arrested by Israeli security forces
after throwing two grenades at a bus station in the southern city
of Be'er Sheva injuring 66 people earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
He was said to be also responsible for a grenade attack in
Hebron late September, in which a dozen Israeli soldiers were
injured.

LONDON, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The owner of B&AMP;D and Woolworth,
Kingfisher, is set to create 20,000 jobs with a 750 million pounds
injection into its do-it-yourself chain.
</P>
<P>
The UK's largest DIY chain announced Monday that it is to open
125 new B&AMP;D warehouses over the next five years instead of
originally proposed 75.
</P>

The expansion comes just weeks after Kingfisher announced it
had formed a strategic alliance with France DIY chain, Castorama.
</P>
<P>
Observers in the retail sector here believe that the move is
likely to shake the hard-pressed DIY industry, which in recent
years has seen a number of companies fall victim to over-capacity
and price wars.

<HEADLINE> Relief Food Distributed at Southwest Rwanda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. World Food Program
(WFP) has begun distributing relief food supplies to more than
25,000 rural families facing food shortages in southwestern
Rwanda, said a WFP report available here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Over the next three weeks, the WFP will distribute some 1,200
tons of food aid in Gikongoro Prefecture, where many families are
living in such poor terrain they can no longer grow enough food
to sustain their families.
</P>
<P>
"Most of these families have only a 50 square-foot plot of
land to cultivate," said Gerard van Dijk, WFP representative in
Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
"They're trying to grow their meager crops on steep, hillside
areas where the quality of soil has eroded over the years. This
makes it virtually impossible for them to harvest enough food to
carry them through to the next season," he said.
</P>
<P>
WFP will distribute a combination of maize and beans in all of
Gikongoro's 13 communes, providing assistance to more than 20
percent of the prefecture's 500,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
The distribution has been timed to coincide with the start of
the planting season. Families are now cultivating for the next
harvest due in December. Most residents are hoping that this
season will be better than the last harvest in May which brought
in poor yields.
</P>
<P>
Because the land area most families in Gikongoro have to
cultivate is so small, they can only expect to grow enough food
to feed their immediate need and to put a small amount of their
crops aside as seedlings for the next season, said the WFP
report.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, any reduction in their crops will threaten their
ability to survive, the report added.
</P>
<P>
"Because the last harvest was poor, many families consumed the
little food they reaped and now have virtually nothing to eat or
plant," said Van Dijk.
</P>
<P>
"We're working with other agencies right now to ensure that
really needy families get both seeds as well as relief food to
sustain them throughout the planting season," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This distribution will not only prevent families from going
hungry now, but it will carry them through the next few months,"
said Van Dijk.
</P>
<P>
WFP is currently feeding over 520,000 people in Rwanda, more
than 360,000 of whom are internally displaced people in the
volatile northwest region of the tiny central African country.

<HEADLINE> 2 Lebanese Civilians Wounded by Israeli Bomb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Two Lebanese civilians were
wounded in southern Lebanon Monday by an Israeli bomb, the Orient
radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The two men were moderately injured when they stepped on
a bomb in the village of Shagran in the central sector of
the Israeli occupied south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese security sources accused Israel of planting the
bomb, saying they have started an investigation into the
incident.
</P>
<P>
Following the explosion, the two injured were taken to a
nearby governmental hospital for treatment, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
The fresh casualties have raised to 55 the number of Lebanese
civilians wounded in conflicts between Lebanese guerrillas and
Israeli occupation forces since the start of this year. And 19
others were killed over the same period.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a self-declared security zone in southern
Lebanon in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north
from cross-border attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, is spearheading a
guerrilla war to try to oust the Israeli troops out of the
country.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Central Bank to Increase Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Israeli central bank
announced on Monday that it will increase the interest rates for
the first time this year in a bid to check the devaluation of the
shekel.
</P>
<P>
Bank of Israel Governor Jacob Frenkel said in Jerusalem that
the key lending rate will rise by 2 percentage points to 11.5
percent as of November 1.
</P>
<P>
Frenkel said that it was necessary to take such a step in
order to stabilize the foreign currency markets.
</P>
<P>
As the foreign investors rushed to sell off the shekel in light
of current global economic crisis, the shekel has depreciated
sharply against the U.S. dollar this month.
</P>
<P>
At the end of September, the representative rate was only 3.90
shekels against one dollar. But the reate hit a record of 4.367
shekels against the dollar last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
After the central bank's announcement, the shekel appreciated
on Monday and the new representative rate rose to 4.18 shekels
against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
Frenkel said that the increase of interest rates would also
prevent the growth of living cost and the high inflation rate of 7
percent in 1997. The government is trying to reduce it to 4
percent.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Israeli industrial leaders have called on
the central bank to refrain from raising the interest rates,
fearing such a move would bring about an economic slowdown.
</P>
<P>
Since January the Israeli central bank has cut the key lending
rate by 3.9 percent in a bid to spur the economic growth. And
currently the key lending rate is 9.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Hold Nationwide City Council Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Iran announced on Monday that
the first nationwide elections for city councils would be held on
February 26, 1999.
</P>
<P>
An Interior Ministry statement requires applicants to sign up
for the elections by January 3, 1999, the official Islamic
Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that applicants should be above 25 and
capable of reading and writing, with at least one-year's record of
stay in the constituency.
</P>
<P>
Those applying for membership in the city councils should
resign from government posts by November 4, 1998, it said.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian constitution has accredited the city councils,
which are separate from the municipalities, with the
administration of the affairs of the cities.
</P>
<P>
Governors and other civil officials appointed by the
government should observe the decisions made by the councils, the
constitution said.
</P>
<P>
Although the constitution underlined the need to form city
councils, but so far no such councils existed in the country.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the elections would be another arena for
the conservatives and the moderates after Friday's election for
the third Experts Assembly which has the right to determine and
dismiss the supreme leader.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia to Promote Rural Transport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Roads
Authority Monday stressed the need to create conditions for
promoting rural transport infrastructure and transport means to
minimize the existing transport problem in Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting on the rural roads and transport strategy
development here, Tesfamichael Nahusenay, General Manager of the
authority, said despite the 110 percent increase of road network
since 1988, Ethiopia has one of the lowest road densities
compared to average Africa standard.
</P>
<P>
Tesfamichael said Ethiopia's modern transport system covers
about 20 percent of the existing transport demand, adding that
the remaining 80 percent of the population and goods movement
depends on traditional means of transport, primarily walking,
head and back loading, and animal transport.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the road transport accounts for about 97 percent
of the passenger and freight movement.
</P>
<P>
Opening the three-day meeting, Minister of Economic
Development and Cooperation Girma Birru said the inadequate road
network in Ethiopia has not only resulted in high transport
costs, but also contributed to the problem of inaccessibility to
areas of agriculture potential and social services.
</P>
<P>
The meeting aims to achieve consensus on ways of improving the
rural roads and transport sub-sector.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Criticizes Palestinian-Israeli Peace Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister Fares
Boueiz Monday criticized the Palestinian-Israeli peace deal
signed in Washington, saying Lebanon will never have such an
agreement with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
"The deal brings about a great disappointment for the
Palestinian people in their struggle to restore legal rights and
build an independent country," Boueiz said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
This is not a victory for the Palestinians in particular and the
Arabs in general as the settlement was reached after the
Palestinians agreed to the Israeli conditions, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We long for a full and real peace which is based on the
implementation of international resolutions and an Israeli serious
withdrawal from its occupied Lebanese and Syrian territories," he
said.
</P>
<P>
After nine days of negotiations at the Wye Plantation near
Washington, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu signed an agreement last Friday,
breaking a 19-month deadlock in the peace talks between the two
sides.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Israel will withdraw its troops from a
further 13.1 percent of the West Bank in three months, while
Palestinians will revoke anti-Israel clauses in their national
charter.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he renewed the call on Israel to restart talks with
Lebanon and Syria from where they were broken off. The talks have
been stalled since early 1996.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in parts of southern
Lebanon in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
cross-border attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
It is also occupying Syrian Golan Heights that it captured in
the 1967 Middle East War.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, October 27 (Xinhua) -- China is planning to
introduce Internet into China Export Commodity Fair, which is one
of the most influential foreign trade event in the country.
</P>
<P>
Face-to-face talks and Internet trading will become a new trend
for the fair to be held biannually in Guangzhou, officials
attending the current 84th event told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Preparations for such a fair are being made by China
International Electronic Commerce Center under the Ministry of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, the officials
disclosed. The Internet will play the role of introducing
participating enterprises and products, statistics and background
information of previous fairs.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang Daming, deputy director of the Center, the
projected Internet event is expected to expand the scale and
influence of the fair, and facilitate the exchange between
exporters and importers.
</P>
<P>
The novelty will also become an extension of the biannual
event, providing chances for further contacts after the
on-the-spot event is closed, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Internet was used for the first time two years ago during the
80th fair when a web-site of the fair was opened. Statistics show
about 4,000 people visit the site everyday.
</P>
<P>
The 83rd fair employed Internet to send invitations to over
2,000 chain stores and department stores.
</P>
<P>
During the current fair, Legend Group, a leading Chinese
computer maker, struck a deal worth 18 million US dollars with a
Hong Kong company.
</P>
<P>
"All these have paved the way for the coming of the Internet
fair in the future," Zhang said.

HONG KONG, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Investments of some 700
billion U.S. dollars into China's infrastructure projects over the
next two to three years will make China remain a huge market for
international construction industry and flooring sector in
particular, a leading Chinese interior architect said here on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of the third annual Asia
Pacific flooring exhibition Asiaflor '98 at the Hong Kong
Convention and Exhibition Center, Zeng Jian, Chairman of the China
Institute of Interior Architects, said large-scale construction
projects are well going on in China. China, which has recently
successfully withstood both the Asian economic crises and the
disastrous flooding, is maintaining a rapid pace in the
development of national economy, he added.
</P>
<P>
Zeng's opinions were echoed by Ivan Dai, Chairman of the
Interior Design Association of Hong Kong, who also officiated the
opening ceremony. "The products on display here will provide an
important opportunity for building professionals throughout Asia
to familiarize themselves with the latest trends in flooring."
Such opportunities will make Asiaflor '98 "an informative and
rewarding experience for anyone involved in interior design,
architecture and construction and trade," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mike Chappel, the organizer of Asiaflor '98, said the
exhibition helps to make "contacts between international flooring
suppliers and manufacturers and expanding Asian market."
</P>
<P>
The three-day event has attracted representatives from more
than 180 exhibitors from 30 countries and regions the world over.
Displaying at the exhibition are rugs, carpets, tiles, wood,
laminate, vinyl and rubber flooring as well as fibers, raw
materials, equipment and accessories, installation systems and
underlays.
</P>
<P>
Also arranged for the event were more than a dozen seminar
programs designed to introduce the latest flooring systems,
materials and installation equipment.

<HEADLINE> China Preparing For Meteor Storm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 27 (Xinhua) -- China will open three
observation stations here to help stargazers get a good look at a
meteor storm in the constellation Leo.
</P>
<P>
The storm is expected to occur between 2:00 and 4:00 am on
November 18 (Beijing Time), and will be the first such storm
visible in the eastern hemisphere for the past century.
</P>
<P>
The northeastern part of China will be the best position to
observe the storm, because it can be seen by the naked eye there.
</P>
<P>
Wang Kemin, deputy director of the Chinese Academy of Sciences'
Beijing Observatory, told a press conference here today that the
observatory has also prepared programs for institutions that
specialize in this and astronomers from the Netherlands, the
United States, France, and the Czech Republic are expected to come
to witness the special event.
</P>
<P>
A meteor storm in the constellation Leo was first recorded by
the Chinese in 902 AD, formed by solid fragments of Tempel
Tuttle. The phenomenon occurred approximately every 32 to 33 years.
</P>
<P>
Scientists say that the storm will not harm people on earth but
may affect man-made objects in outer space.

<HEADLINE> Thai Central Bank Buys Dollar in Foreign Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's central bank entered
the foreign market Tuesday to buy U.S. dollars in a bid to shore
up the country's financial status, Deputy Governor Kitti
Patpongpibul said.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that the dollar purchase aimed mainly to
prepare for the settlement of some outstanding forward
obligations, and to stabilize the baht which has risen about 11
percent against the dollar over the last two months.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said on October 22 that its outstanding net
forward foreign exchange contracts to buy the local currency had
fallen to 9.1 billion dollars as of October 16, compared to 9.4
billion dollars a week earlier.
</P>
<P>
Kitti added that the current rate of the baht (37.5 against the
dollar) was not excessive. The central bank is keen to ensure some
stability, although it does not want to interfere with broader
market trends.
</P>
<P>
"The bank is supervising the market in order not to let the
baht strengthen excessively. But we have no intention to change
its direction," he said.

<HEADLINE> China Increasing Indoor Air Pollution Monitoring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Specialists from provinces and
municipalities and Hong Kong met at a national symposium on
technology of indoor air pollution control here today to
discuss ways to monitor indoor air pollution and purify the air.
</P>
<P>
They discussed air hygiene in kitchens, nicotine smoke, and
formaldehyde released by synthetic wooden floor boards.
</P>
<P>
Participants said that they believe that although China has
clean air standards for hospitals, food, electronics, and
pharmaceutical industries, it does not have any for air in civilian
buildings.
</P>
<P>
They say that indoor air purification technology also needs to
be studied and that indoor materials, domestic chemical products,
and air conditioners are all potential pollutants.
</P>
<P>
Recent research has shown that indoor air pollution may cause
irritation to throats and noses and could also cause an increase
in the number of white blood cells in old people and
children.

<HEADLINE> China Improving Administrative Appeals Law (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 27 (Xinhua) -- A motion to stop illegal and
inappropriate administrative behavior was submitted to China's top
legislative body for review today.
</P>
<P>
A draft of the Administrative Appeals Law is meant to get
administrative offices to act in accordance with the law and to
protect the rights and interests of citizens and organizations.
</P>
<P>
The fifth meeting of the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC)
Standing Committee will study the 41 articles in 7 chapters that
allow for administrative appeals when citizens or organizations
who believe their rights and interests have been violated by
specific administrative behavior.
</P>
<P>
Administrative offices have to fulfill administrative appeals
duty legally and promptly and under the principle of openness and
convenience. They are required to correct every act of wrongdoing
to guarantee that laws and regulations are implemented correctly.
</P>
<P>
Yang Jingyu, director of the State Council's Legislative
Affairs Office, explained the draft to the NPC Standing Committee
and said that it is significant in perfecting the administrative
appeals system, which improves supervision in administrative
offices, urges administrative offices to carry out their functions
legally and correctly, and guards social and economic order,
rights and interests of citizens and organizations, and social
stability.

<TEXT>
<P>
China adopted a system of administrative appeals in the early
1950s and has passed related laws in the past several decades.
</P>
<P>
The State Council developed administrative appeals regulations
in 1990 to further elaborate and develop the system of
administrative appeals. There were 220,000 administrative appeals
cases in the 1991-1997 period nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Implementation of the regulations has provided useful
experience and has revealed problems as well, according to Yang
Jingyu. For example, individual citizens and organizations have
found administrative appeals inconvenient because of too many
restrictions. And, some administrative offices are afraid of
becoming defendants or try to avoid troubles and refuse to accept
an appeal, he says.
</P>
<P>
Some administrative offices don't get rid of certain
administrative behavior that should be discouraged or corrected,
he adds.
</P>
<P>
The draft clearly defines basic principles of administrative
appeal, limits of appeals, decisions, and legal responsibilities.

<HEADLINE> France Confirms Deposition of Accusations Against Pinochet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 27 (Xinhua) -- France Tuesday confirmed the
deposition of accusations by three French families against former
Chilean President Augusto Pinochet, which could lead French
authorities to demand the extradition of the general from Britain.
</P>
<P>
The three families said two of their relatives disappeared and
one was assassinated in Chile during the military rule of Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret said if
French judicial authorities decide that it is legally appropriate
to ask for the extradition of Pinochet, France would ask Britain
to apply the 1957 bilateral agreement on extradition.
</P>
<P>
While refusing to comment on the on-going legal proceedings in
London, Gazeau-Secret said any future contacts with Britain on
extraditing Pinochet would be made by the Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The lawyer of the three families has written to Minister of
Justice Elisabeth Guigou, asking her to prepare "in the shortest
time possible to contact her British counterpart for a procedure
of extradition of General Pinochet."
</P>
<P>
The French magistrature also asked for the extradition of
Pinochet Monday evening in a memorandum written by lawyer Me
Bourdon to the Procurator of the Republic in Paris, Jean-Pierre
Dintilhac.
</P>
<P>
Bourdon presented the memorandum in the name of the families
of Enrique Andres Maria Ropert Contreras, a Frenchman killed by
Chile's military authorities in September 1973; Alphonse Rene
Chanfreau, who was arrested by Chilean political police and never
came out of his detention center; and Etienne Pesle, who was
arrested at his office in Santiago by "a Chilean Air Force team"
and disappeared.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet was arrested on October 16 in London after undergoing
surgery there. His arrest was requested by the Spanish
authorities who, together with Switzerland, have asked for his
extradition for the assassination of Spanish and Swiss
nationals.

<HEADLINE> Manchester United Fans Press Parlia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Football supporters from around
the Britain joined a group of Manchester United fans to lobby MPs
on the BSkyB take-over on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The club's supporters' association hoped to persuade Trade
Secretary Peter Mandelson to refer the deal to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Lee Hodgkiss described himself as "delighted" at the
news that Rupert Murdoch's company has so far managed to purchase
only 45 per cent of the football team's shares.
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure Rupert Murdoch is pretty disappointed," he told BBC
News Online. "Seventy-five per cent (of shareholders) have
decided not to sell their shares to him."
</P>
<P>
Hodgkiss said the meeting of supporters and MPs in Parliament
marked a new phase in the campaign to keep BSkyB out the Old
Trafford boardroom.
</P>
<P>
"We're here today to try to win over the floating voter
really, the people who are not really sure yet what the best way
to go is.
</P>
<P>
"We would hope that they would use their influence to talk to
Mr.Mandelson and get over to him our concerns. People within
football are totally against this.
</P>
<P>
"We've made it clear from the start this isn't just an issue
for Manchester United, it's an issue for the footballing
community at large. We've got representation from other clubs
around the country," he added.
</P>
<P>
Hodgkiss dismissed the suggestion that fans from other clubs
had more to fear from the injection of Murdoch's millions into
Manchester United.
</P>
<P>
He asked: "Is it in Murdoch's interest for Manchester United
to remain the greatest football team in the world?
</P>
<P>
"He's said he doesn't want a situation for the Premier League
like in Scotland where Rangers tend to win every year.
</P>
<P>
"Well, I'm a Manchester United supporter. I want my team to
win every single year. I know they won't and that's what makes it
exciting. But it's not in Murdoch's interests to make Manchester
United as successful as we want them to be.
</P>
<P>
"The main crux of our position is that we lose the
independence of our football club. Some people say, 'You're a plc
now'. That's correct but the money that the club makes now is
poured back in to the business.
</P>
<P>
Manchester United Supporters' Association has already written
to every MP and has received overwhelming support from about 100.
</P>
<P>
About half that number have signed an Early Day Motion
registering their opposition to the deal.
</P>
<P>
The EDM states the purchase "will create an unacceptable
situation" and "is not in the best interests of fans, clubs or
television viewers and the sport in general".

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The fifth meeting of the Council
of the Mekong River Commission (CMRC) opened here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Participants in the two-day meeting are officials from four
countries sharing the Mekong river lower basin, namely Vietnam,
Thailand, Laos and Cambodia, and representatives from the United
Nations Development Program (UNDP), the Economic and Social
Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) and other
international organizations.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development Le Huy
Ngo, who is CMRC president for the 1998-99 term, chaired the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The meeting focuses discussions on socio-economic development
cooperation program of the four countries, assessment on impacts
of and policies on environmental protection in the basin, and
proper use and protection of the Mekong river water resources.
</P>
<P>
Also on the agenda is a concrete plan for the Mekong river
basin.
</P>
<P>
Countries located in the basin of the Mekong river have since
1957 cooperated to study the utility of the river, work out
measures to protect its marine resources, preserve the river's
natural characteristics, and minimize bad affects of the river.
</P>
<P>
The four-nation Mekong river commission, set up in 1995, is an
inter-governmental organization. Each commission member country
will hold alternatively the presidency for a one-year term.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's Mekong delta covers 3.9 million hectares of land with
2.4 million hectares being reserved for agricultural production
and aquaculture. This region contributes over 40 percent of the
country's agricultural output.
</P>
<P>
Without fresh water provided by Mekong river in the dry season,
around 2 million hectares of land for intensive farming in the
Mekong delta will be contaminated with saline water, affecting the
agricultural production in the Mekong delta.

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Alvaro de Soto, special envoy of
the United Nations (U.N.) secretary-general, arrived here Tuesday
on his second four-day trip to Myanmar this year to look into the
current political situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
Alvaro, assistant U.N. secretary-general, is expected to meet
Lieutenant-General Khin Nyunt, first secretary of the Myanmar
State Peace and Development Council, as well as Aung San Suu Kyi,
general secretary of the opposition National League for Democracy
(NLD).
</P>
<P>
The visit came over a month after the NLD formed on September
16 a 10-member committee representing the parliament elected in
the 1990 Multi-party general election and unilaterally set up a
People's Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The government had ignored a deadline set by the NLD for the
parliament to be convened.
</P>
<P>
In August, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan proposed to
Myanmar leader Senior-General Than Shwe that a special emissary be
sent to Yangon for discussions, which was rejected by Myanmar,
according to an earlier official report.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar government has maintained since 1994 dialogue with
the U.N. secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
In January, Alvaro visited Yangon and met with Than Shwe and
Khin Nyunt.
</P>
<P>
He then had discussions with Myanmar Foreign Minister U Ohn
Gyaw on matters of mutual interest and also met with Aung San Suu
Kyi.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a latest government statement warned that no
pressure from foreign countries and organizations including the
U.N. will deter Myanmar from its chosen path.

<HEADLINE> UN Court Insists Counsel Rules as Most Detainees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) insists the
right for assigning counsels for the accused though most of them
joined Monday the on-going hunger strike in their detention
facilities in Arusha, northern Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
An ICTR news release said Tuesday that Le Greffier, registrar
of the ICTR, argued that the assignment of counsel is his
responsibility under the Tribunal's rules as he received a letter
Monday signed by 25 out of the 32 detainees indicating they have
embarked on a hunger strike.
</P>
<P>
"Defense lawyers are assigned to detainees who can not afford
the costs of hiring their own lawyer in order to ensure respect
for the right of the accused to a fair trial," he said. "This
responsibility is acknowledged by the detainees in their letter."
</P>
<P>
The hunger strike was initiated last Thursday by a former
Rwandan mayor who has been convicted of genocide and sentenced to
a life imprisonment by the Tribunal earlier this month for his
role in Rwanda's 1994 massacre.
</P>
<P>
Jean-Paul Akayesu, 45, began his hunger strike to protest the
Tribunal's refusal to assign him the lawyer of his choice, the
Canadian lawyer John Philpot.
</P>
<P>
But Philpot did not apply to be on the Tribunal's list of
approved lawyers, and therefore is ineligible to defend the
convicted mayor on appeal in accordance with the Tribunal's
rules.
</P>
<P>
Akayesu was given a list of six approved lawyers and told to
chose two as his defense counsel, but he refused.
</P>
<P>
The registrar said in the early days of the Tribunal's work,
an attempt was made by a small group of lawyers, mainly from
Canada and Belgium, to monopolize the defense of persons accused
by the Tribunal so that they could determine the course of
events, including blocking the Tribunal's judicial proceedings as
they saw fit.
</P>
<P>
This was a major factor in the Tribunal's decision to
streamline the assignment of defense counsel through the adoption
in January 1996 of the Directive on the Assignment of Defense
Counsel, approved by the Judges in Plenary Session.
</P>
<P>
At present, he said, 41 lawyers from all over the world are
assigned as defense counsel and co-counsel to the detainees. been
assigned, he said.
</P>
<P>
The news release said the registry believes that the on-going
hunger strikes by detainees to pressure the Tribunal are
unwarranted and may indeed be unrelated to the issue of
assignment of defense counsel.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a spokesman for the Tribunal said the ICTR will not
be pressurized or blackmailed by Akayesu by going on a hunger
strike.
</P>
<P>
However, Kingsley Moghalu said Monday, Akayesu was free to
have a lawyer of his choice if he was prepared to finance his
defense counsel.
</P>
<P>
He added that the UN-court has always respected the rights of
the accused persons "but within the framework of a UN-system and
its established courts."
</P>
<P>
Prison sources said Akayesu has not been taking any solid
food, but was profusely smoking and has access to newspapers and
radio.
</P>
<P>
A total of 35 suspects have been indicted so far by the ICTR,
founded by the United Nations following the Rwanda massacre in
April 1994 soon after President Juvenal Habyarimana, a Hutu, died
when his plane was shot down over the capital Kigali.
</P>
<P>
About 500,000 people, mostly Tutsis and moderate Hutus, were
reportedly killed in the three-month slaughter.

<HEADLINE> Dunhuang's 2,000-Year-Old Spring In Danger Of Drying Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DUNHUANG, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The Crescent Spring has
existed in Gansu province's Dunhuang for more than 2,000 years,
but it now faces the danger of drying up, as its water level keeps
dropping 30 cm every year.
</P>
<P>
Its size has decreased from 1.7 hectares in the 1960s to 0.4
hectare today, according to a Dunhuang Environment Bureau official
and there are now dead trees near the spring.
</P>
<P>
The spring got its name from its appearance and is as much an
attraction as the Mogao Grotto. In more than 2,000 years, it has
never been buried by the moving dunes. Some geologists say that it
was part of the Danghe River in ancient times, but after the river
changed its course, the spring kept supplying water.
</P>
<P>
A reservoir was built on the upper reaches of the Danghe in the
1970s, cutting off some of the subterranean flow to the spring,
the environmental official says.
</P>
<P>
The General Administration of Environmental Protection recently
had a look at the environment of Dunhuang and pointed to the
improper water use in tourism and agriculture as another reason
for the spring's drying up.
</P>
<P>
Dunhuang's annual rainfall is less than 50 mm and the annual
amount of evaporation exceeds 2,400 mm. However, irrigation by
flooding is still very popular in nearby fields, allowing a large
amount of water to evaporate.
</P>
<P>
Dunhuang has more than 100 hotels, but their waste water is not
treated, causing serious waste.
</P>
<P>
No effective ways have been found to keep the spring from
drying up but environmental specialists warn that water use
methods have to be changed in Dunhuang.

<P>
WASHINGTON, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. Newspapers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Yugoslavia began what appeared to be serious troop
withdrawals from many positions in Kosovo, only a day before a
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) deadline and under
threat of air strike. NATO is almost certain to extend the
deadline for ordering air strikes against Yugoslav military and
police forces.
</P>
<P>
-- Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin called off a visit to
Austria, citing poor health, three days after his spokesman
asserted that Yeltsin was healthy and had been wounded by rumor
mongering to the contrary.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Peru and Ecuador, which fought three territorial wars this
century and almost clashed again three months ago, signed a
landmark peace agreement Monday that resolved their violent border
dispute with an innovative plan that includes creation of two
national "peace parks" near the most contested stretch of their
frontier.
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu fought a rear
guard battle Monday against the growing likelihood of early
elections as an odd alliance of liberals, security hawks and
religious parties aimed to topple his government in the fallout
from the Middle East peace accord.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Tests on Iraqi warheads largely back a U.S. assertion that
Baghdad loaded VX nerve gas onto missiles before the Gulf War.
The report to the United Nations Security Council was submitted by
17 scientists who analyzed findings from U.S. Swiss and French
labs.
</P>
<P>
An insurance-redlining jury ordered Nationwide Mutual to pay
100 million dollars in punitive and 500,000 dollars in
compensatory damages after a fair-housing group sued it for bias
against black neighborhoods in Richmond, Virginia. The firm vowed
to appeal to the state's high court.

<HEADLINE> Dublin Sets for Shock Blackburn Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 6.75 million pound (about 11.2 million U.S. dollars)
transfer fee has been negotiated and the England frontman will be
on his way to Ewood Park as long as he agrees personal terms.
</P>
<P>
Coventry City chairman Bryan Richardson announced at a news
conference at Highfield Road on Tuesday that the club had
accepted Rovers' offer for the 29-year-old former Manchester
United star.
</P>
<P>
"We are, and always have been, reluctant to sell Dion Dublin,"
said Richardson. "But we were duty-bound to give him permission
to speak to Blackburn."
</P>
<P>
He confirmed Dublin has a clause in his one million pound a
year contract that allows him to speak to any club that makes an
offer in excess of five million for him.
</P>
<P>
Richardson said: "They contacted us last week to ask if we
were prepared to sell him, and we have been negotiating hard with
them over the last few days.
</P>
<P>
"We received a written offer of 6.75m which we, in turn, have
accepted in writing.
</P>
<P>
"The player is now discussing personal terms with Blackburn
with a view to signing for them. So the situation is now outside
of our control, " he said.
</P>
<P>
Blackburn manager Roy Hodgson failed in an attempt to capture
the City skipper during the summer, but has since increased his
bid.
</P>
<P>
Rovers, who are languishing in the Premiership relegation
zone, have been plagued with problems up front this season.

<P>
Chris Sutton has struggled with fitness and is now banned for
four games and Kevin Gallacher has also been ruled out by injury.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Right-Wingers Urged to Halt Incitement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 27 (Xinhua) -- A rightist party in Israel's
coalition government joined President Ezer Weizman Tuesday in his
call for a halt of incitement campaign launched by right-wingers
against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Yitzhak Levy, leader of the National Religious Party (NRP),
was quoted by Israel Radio as calling on religious and political
leaders of the right wings to clearly condemn the incitement
campaign.
</P>
<P>
In recent demonstrations held in the West Bank and outside the
prime minister's residence, some Jewish settlers and right-wing
politicians accused Netanyahu of "betrayal" by signing a
land-for-peace deal with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat last
week. Some called him "a traitor."
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Netanyahu Tuesday morning, Weizman said the
prime minister had achieved a "good agreement" and it would be
"very grave" if there would be a repetition of the incitement
waged against "someone else," referring to slain prime minister
Yitzhak Rabin.
</P>
<P>
Rabin, who jointly started the peace process with Arafat by
signing the historic Oslo Accords in 1993, was assassinated by an
extreme Jewish rightist in 1995. The rightists had accused him of
"treason."
</P>
<P>
Meretz leader Yossi Sarid said since the assassination of
Rabin, he has sworn never again to accept calling the prime
minister of Israel as a "traitor" again.
</P>
<P>
Levy, who is also education minister in Netanyahu's cabinet,
said he believes the prime minister can prevent a political
assassination.
</P>
<P>
Security measures have been strengthened to protect Netanyahu,
Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon and Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai since they returned from the U.S. Sunday.
</P>
<P>
After nine days of negotiations, Palestinian and Israeli
leaders signed the peace agreement at the White House last Friday,
which broke a 19-month deadlock in the Palestinian-Israeli peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Israel will withdraw its troops from 13.1
percent of the West Bank and free hundreds of Palestinian
prisoners, while the Palestinian side will step up efforts to
crack down on Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
As a fresh sign of the incitement campaign, a poster jointly
made by rightist groups and occupying about one quarter of the
front page of the Israeli daily Haaretz Tuesday said that
Netanyahu and Sharon should be responsible for the "shameful
agreement."
</P>
<P>
"We voted for you and we put you in power," the poster reads,
"we will remember...we won't forget...and we won't forgive..."
</P>
<P>
On top of the poster, which appeared Monday on the front page
of another daily The Jerusalem Post, were the white-and-black
photos of Netanyahu and Sharon.
</P>
<P>
Levy's party, the NRP, which strongly opposed the interim
agreement, dealt a blow to Netanyahu Monday when its members in
the Knesset (Parliament) Law Committee joined the opposition in
voting for a decision to present two bills calling for early
elections to the Knesset.
</P>
<P>
The bills have passed in the preliminary reading in late July
and need to pass three more readings before becoming law.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Netanyahu continued his campaign to win approval for
the agreement. After meeting twice with Likud ministers and
appealing for their support Monday, he met with several ministers
again Tuesday, including Communications Minister Limor Livnat, who
has expressed her opposition to the agreement.

<HEADLINE> Britain Rules out Talks With Menem Over Falklands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The British government on
Tuesday ruled out possible negotiations over the sovereignty of
the disputed Falkland (Malvinas) Islands with Argentine President
Carlos Menem during his landmark visit to London.
</P>
<P>
Menem, accompanied by senior Argentine cabinet ministers and
some 100 businessmen, is due to arrive here later Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said he hoped Menem's
six-day visit would reconcile Britain and Argentina after the
brief but bloody war they fought over the remote South Atlantic
islands in 1982.
</P>
<P>
But he told the BBC that there was no question of negotiations
on the status of the Falklands, which Argentina calls the Malvinas
and has claimed for 165 years.
</P>
<P>
"There is going to be no substantive discussion on the
Falklands. I am quite sure President Menem will repeat the
well-known Argentine position," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We will very firmly state Britain's position, which is that
there will be no change in the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands
unless the Falklanders themselves ask for it."
</P>
<P>
Cook, noting that Britain was the number one European Union
investor in Argentina, said "while we remember the past we
shouldn't let it prevent us from building a future together and
this is a very different Argentina."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Argentina's ambassador to Britain Rogelio Pfirter
told the BBC that he hoped Menem's visit, the first by an
Argentine leader since 1960, would open "a new chapter in
bilateral relations."
</P>
<P>
"It will represent a major contribution to reconciliation and
friendship between Britain and Argentina. It will help us to
enhance existing cooperation notably in the area of trade and
investment," he said.
</P>
<P>
Both Britain and Argentina needed to put the war, which claimed
1,000 lives, behind them, he added.
</P>
<P>
"We should recognize that the war existed but we should also
recognize that we look at the future as modern nations and build
the future together if possible."

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Police Arrest Suspects in Hebron Killing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian security forces
announced Tuesday afternoon that they have arrested two
Palestinians suspected of killing a Jewish settler in the divided
West Bank town of Hebron Monday, local television reported.
</P>
<P>
The reports said the two had confessed to the murder and also
the killing of another Israeli man in a communal farm outside
Jerusalem about two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Israeli troops enforced a curfew in the Israeli-controlled
part of Hebron Tuesday, barring about 30,000 Palestinians from
leaving their homes. Palestinians are even not allowed to go
to work or school.
</P>
<P>
The curfew, imposed Monday night after the slaying of Danny
Vargas, a 29-year-old security guard from the nearby Jewish
settlement of Kiryat Arba, was the third time since August that
the Palestinians in the Israeli-run sector of the city are not
allowed to go out.
</P>
<P>
Vargas was shot three times when driving back home Monday
afternoon and his body was dumped on a Hebron street. Palestinian
doctors rushing to the site after informed by a Palestinian
journalist who saw the body tried in vain to revive him.
</P>
<P>
As hundreds of Jewish settlers were taking part in the funeral
of Vargas in Hebron Tuesday, Palestinians took to the street of
another West Bank town of Nablus to mourn Mohammed Zalmout, a
68-year-old Palestinian also murdered Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The body of Zalmout was found outside the Jewish settlement
of Itamar, south of Nablus, several hours after the shooting
of Vargas. An anonymous phone call said that was an avenge killing.
</P>
<P>
There were fears that the terror attacks, conducted only
several days after Israeli and Palestinian leaders signed a
land-for-peace deal in the United States, would help derail the
peace process again.

OTTAWA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The majority of Canadian people
believe their health-care system needs fundamental changes or a
complete restructuring, a survey by researchers at the Harvard
University School of Public Health shows.
</P>
<P>
The survey, in which 1,006 Canadians were interviewed by phone,
found that 56 percent believed there are "some good things (in the
health-care system), but fundamental changes are needed." A
further 23 percent said the system needed to be completely rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
When the researchers asked the same question in another survey
10 years ago, only five percent believed the system needed to be
rebuilt and 37 percent thought fundamental changes were needed.
</P>
<P>
"Canadians once (thought they) had the Shangri-la of medical
systems in the industrialized world, but they don't see it that
way any more," said health policy professor Robert Blendon, the
survey's head researcher.
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, 56 percent of Canadians thought the system
worked well and only minor changes were needed, but the number had
dropped to 20 percent in the interviews conducted between April
and June this year, Blendon said.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Leaders Call for Cooperation Between </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait's parliament
reconvened Tuesday morning after a summer recess with top leaders
calling for constructive cooperation between the legislative and
executive authorities, the Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the inauguration of the third annual session of
the National Assembly's eighth term, Emir Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber
Al-Sabah said "we open the session wishing constructive
cooperation from all of you away from whatever could affect our
democratic course."
</P>
<P>
He also urged parliament and cabinet members attending the
session to employ "strenuous efforts to strengthen our economy,
develop our reserves and to have our full will away from the
hegemony of any foreign country."
</P>
<P>
In his speech to the assembly, Crown Prince and Prime Minister
Sheikh Saad Al-Abdullah Al-Salem Al-Sabah reiterated the
government's keenness on cooperation between the two authorities
and the importance of collective work.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation between the legislative and executive is
believed to be vital during this session since they have been at
odds over a number of issues including a government proposal to
raise services charges and defense deals with foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
During last session, a grilling motion against Interior
Minister Sheikh Mohammad Al-Sabah by some parliament members
sparked a major confrontation between the executive and
legislative. The cooperation crisis ended almost in a parliament
dissolution.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local media reports said Tuesday that the current
session would start under growing pressure to tackle unpopular
economic reforms aimed at improving state finances and boosting a
sagging stock market.
</P>
<P>
Persistent low oil prices have prompted the government to
consider a raise of charges to some heavily-subsidized services
like water, power, health care and local communication in an
effort to increase revenues, a measure opposed by many MPs.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Forestry Research Institute Celebrates 40th Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 27 (Xinhua) -- China's largest forestry
research base, the Chinese Research Institute of Forestry, today
held a meeting to commemorate its 40th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
Some 50 experts from UNDP and a number of other international
organizations and a dozen of countries were present at the
commemoration meeting. The experts will also attend a two-day
seminar on China's forestry development after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Research Institute of Forestry, located in the
western suburb of Beijing and with about 1,700 researchers, now
includes nine research institutes and seven R&AMP;D (research and
development) centers.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zehui, president of the Chinese Research Institute of
Forestry, said at today's commemoration meeting that by the year
2010, the institute is expected to become a first-class forestry
research base in the world.
</P>
<P>
According to her, to date researchers in the institute have
achieved more than 1,000 academic findings and published some 200
books.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhibao, director of the State Administration of Forestry,
also addressed the meeting saying that more research findings
should be applied in the conservation of forest resources.
</P>
<P>
"The conservation of forests has come to be a key issue for the
global ecological improvement," he said.

<HEADLINE> Party Committees at Grass-roots Support Villagers' Democratic Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 27 (Xinhua) -- An amendment to China's Organic
Law for Villagers' Committee proposes that Party committees at the
grass-roots continue to be the core of local leadership
while supporting villagers in exercising democratic rights.
</P>
<P>
The draft was submitted to the Standing Committee of China's
National People's Congress today. Zhou Keyu, deputy head of the
NPC Law Committee, says that self government was a great invention
for improving rural democracy under the leadership of the Communist
Party of China, and that the amendment finally clarifies the
relation between villagers committees and Party committees in
villages.
</P>
<P>
The relation between villagers' committees and Party committees
in villages is one of the three items causing heated discussions
during the amendment of the Organic Law for Villagers'
Committees. The other two are the relations between villagers'
committees and township governments and the relations between
villagers' committees and economic organizations in villages.
</P>
<P>
Those who favor the township government as the leader of
villagers' committees believe that this will make it easier for
the township government to give instructions to villages. But others
argue that, as the leader of the villagers' committee, the township
government may appoint village heads, resulting in villagers'
committees losing their rights.
</P>
<P>
After repeated discussions, most members of the NPC Standing
Committee have agreed that township governments should be
directors instead of leaders of villagers' committees. While
villagers have the right of self-government, the local villagers'
committee has the responsibility of assisting the government.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 27 (Xinhua) -- A three-day international
conference is scheduled to open here Friday on "spiritual and
moral values for a better 21st century," the organizer said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Over 2,000 delegates from 40 countries in the five continents

<P>
"It is now universally recognized that although humanity has

numerous complex problems because of crisis of values," the press
release noted.
</P>
<P>
It said that in order to create awareness about ethical, moral
and spiritual values among the global human community, the Brahma
Kumaris World Spiritual University, through its network of
teaching centers in over 70 countries, has been offering numerous
educational programs focusing on personal development, life skills
and the development of personal vision and values.
</P>
<P>
"The present conference in Nepal is yet another step in this
direction for making the world in the 21st century a better place
to live in," the press release said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the university was upgraded to general
consultative status in September 1998 by the United Nations
Economic and Social Council in recognition of its services.
</P>
<P>
Nepali King Birendra will inaugurate the conference, during
which four open sessions and workshops will be organized for

<HEADLINE> Iran Launches New Initiative for Decentralization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian government has
launched a new initiative to offer more authority to provincial
governors general in order to prepare the grounds toward
decentralization, the official news agency IRNA reported on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Vice President and head of the Administrative and Recruiting
Organization Mohammad Baqerian was quoted as saying that under the
new plan, which became effective last week, governors general
would act as the government's high commissioners in dealing with
provincial administrative affairs.
</P>
<P>
He said that the decentralization drive would enhance the
decision-making power of provincial officials and enable them to
offer more services to local inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
Baqerian underlined the need for decentralization of executive
affairs and change in the administration structure of the
country, saying that the issue of rendering more authority to
provincial officials, which was seriously followed in the past
two decades, is given top priority under the administration of
President Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Given the rapid pace of population growth, expansion of cities
and sophisticated political, security, cultural and social
issues, the country can no longer be administered on basis of old
patterns, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Observers here see the initiative as a step by Khatami's
government to push forward his proposed political development, or
reform, in the country, which was opposed by the conservatives
who give priorities to solving the country's economic problems.
</P>
<P>
Another step was to hold the first nationwide elections to
form city councils, according to an announcement by the Interior
Ministry on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Baqerian also noted that the objective of the new plan is
to consolidate position of the high commissioners, strengthen the
role that governors general play in coordinating and supervising
over local affairs and encourage further participation in social,
political and cultural activities.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Rupiah Strengthens Against U.S. Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian rupiah was closed at
7,275/7,375 rupiah against the U.S. dollar in the Jakarta
inter-bank spot market on Tuesday, strengthened compared with
Monday's close of 7,500/7,700 rupiah to the greenback.
</P>
<P>
A dealer with an European bank said the rupiah's gain came on
continued selling of U.S. dollars by the central bank Bank
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Some dealers said a report on intervention trading bank also
gave rupiah a boost in trading. It was reported that Bank
Indonesia will use a band when the rupiah exchange rate reaches a
level between 5,000 to 6,000 per dollar.
</P>
<P>
However, Bank Indonesia director Miranda Goeltom had said the
central bank had no plan to restore a rupiah intervention band.
</P>
<P>
"We haven't made any decisions yet. We don't want to do things
in a rush if it is not needed. We certainly will study all
alternatives," she said.
</P>
<P>
"It's part of the research division's job to study various
possibilities. But it does not necessarily mean that we will
implement what we have studied," she added.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah, which hit an eight-month high of 7,150 last
Wednesday, slid back to 7,800 on Thursday and to 7,850 on Friday
following a controversial statement by Coordinating Minister for
Economy, Finance and Industry Ginandjar Kartasasmita.
</P>
<P>
Ginandjar said the ideal level of the rupiah-U.S. dollar
exchange rate would be between 7,000 and 8,000 to maintain the
competitiveness of the country's exports.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan, Saudi Arabia Welcome Mideast Peace Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan and Saudi Arabia
have welcomed the latest Palestinian-Israeli accord towards
restoring the Middle East peace process to its proper track.
</P>
<P>
In a joint communique issued at the end of a three-day official
visit to Pakistan by Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah Bin Abdul Aziz,
the two sides hoped that the recently signed agreement will
constitute a step towards restoring the peace process to its
proper track.
</P>
<P>
They further expressed the hope that the international
community will play an effective role to bring about Israeli
adherence to its commitments under various peace accords.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and Saudi Arabia also called in the communique for the
resumption of the Syrian-Israeli talks and the prompt
implementation of the U.N. Security Council Resolution 425
concerning southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi crown prince arrived in Lahore, Pakistan's second
largest city, on Sunday for a three-day official visit at the
invitation of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, the crown prince held extensive talks with
Sharif on matters relating to bilateral relations and regional
situation, with particular reference to the Arab and Muslim world,
and the international developments at large.
</P>
<P>
The joint communique said the two sides agreed that the
establishment of peace and security in South Asia required non-use
of force and peaceful settlement of disputes, especially the Jammu
and Kashmir dispute, which should be finally settled in accordance
with the U.N. resolution.
</P>
<P>
The two sides expressed satisfaction over the steady growth of
their collaboration in various fields. They reiterated their
determination to intensify cooperation in the economic and
technological fields to make it commensurate with the level and
quality of bilateral political relations.

<HEADLINE> China Expands Export of High-Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The 84th China Export
Commodity Fair sold new and high-tech products worth over 500
million yuan (60.26 million US dollars) in the first 12 days since
it opened here on October 15, accounting for over 10 percent of
the transactions done so far, fair organizers said.
</P>
<P>
This indicates that China's efforts to readjust its export
structure amid adverse impact of the Asian financial crisis have
already produced results, analysts pointed out.
</P>
<P>
In order to facilitate the export of high technology, the
biannual event for the first time introduced a 400-square-meter
information industry hall, which has been a focus of attention.
</P>
<P>
A staff member of the Guangzhou Zhenhua Light Industry
Enterprise Group said that her booth has received an average of
over 30 clients every day since the fair opened.
</P>
<P>
Liu Shangtong, a salesman of the Shanghai Donghai Computer
Co. Ltd., which is the producer of the first personnel computer in
China, said that his company is very optimistic about the export
prospects since the company mainly targets Africa and the Middle
East while clients from Europe and North America are also showing
interest.
</P>
<P>
The current fair has drawn 33 high-tech companies from across
China who are displaying 140 varieties of products. In comparison,
only two high-tech firms were present during the 80th fair.
</P>
<P>
Legend Group, a leading Chinese computer maker which attended
the 80th fair, struck a deal worth 18 million US dollars at the
first day of the on-going fair.
</P>
<P>
The Haier Group, a leading refrigerator maker, has already
received over 30 million US dollars of orders during the fair.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, products with high technology content accounted
for only 5.3 percent of China's total exports.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Military Authority Warns of Escalation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Following two murders in the
West Bank, the Israeli military authority has warned of an
escalation of violence in the territories, local daily Haaretz
reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted the authority as saying that in advance of
the implementation of the second redeployment in the West Bank,
the killing made the atmosphere "extremely tense."
</P>
<P>
On Monday, a 29-year-old Jewish settler was shot dead in the
West Bank city of Hebron. Several hours later the body of a
65-year-old Palestinian was found near the West Bank Jewish
settlement of Itamar.
</P>
<P>
After the incidents, Israeli troops imposed a general closure
on Hebron Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a curfew was imposed on the Palestinians who live
in the Israeli-controlled sector of the city. And about 30,000
Palestinians are barred from leaving their homes.
</P>
<P>
Israeli President Ezer Weizman said the murders were "not a
good start for the accord signed at Wye (in the U.S.)."
</P>
<P>
But he noted that it "shows how necessary such an agreement is
in order to prevent such incidents in the future."
</P>
<P>
Israel and the Palestinians signed a land-for-security
agreement at the White House last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Israel will hand over 13 percent of the
West Bank to the Palestinians in the second troop redeployment, in
return for the fulfillment of the Palestinian commitments to
fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
But there is a fear that the anti-peace forces from both sides
will make efforts to halt the implementation of the
agreement.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Lawmakers Want To Add Continental Shelf Law To HKSAR Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Chairpersons of the Standing
Committee of China's National People's Congress (NPC) delivered a
draft to the Ninth NPC Standing Committee for the Exclusive
Economic Zone (EEZ) and Continental Shelf Law to be included in
Appendix 3 of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
The chairpersons said that, according to the basic law,
China's national laws, except for Appendix 3, do not apply to the
HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
The NPC Standing Committee can add or reduce the number of laws
included in Appendix 3 after consulting with its Committee on the
HKSAR Basic Law and the government of HKSAR. All laws in Appendix
3 must be on national defense and foreign affairs, and other laws
that do not concern the autonomy of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
The EEZ and Continental Shelf Law, which was adopted by the
Third Meeting of the Ninth NPC Standing Committee in April, is a
national defense and foreign affairs law and is outside the
autonomy of the HKSAR, thus it needs to be included in Appendix 3.
</P>
<P>
The HKSAR Basic Law Committee, which is affiliated to the NPC
Standing Committee, and the HKSAR government have agreed to
include the law in Appendix 3 of the Basic Law of the
HKSAR.

<HEADLINE> Schroeder Formally Elected German Chancellor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The German parliament Tuesday
formally elected Gerhard Schroeder the seventh postwar chancellor,
exactly a month after his victory over the veteran chancellor
Helmut Kohl in the September general elections.
</P>
<P>
The new Bundestag, the lower house of parliament which was
formed on Monday, elected Schroeder by a vote of 351 to 287, with
27 abstentions.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder will be officially named chancellor by Germany
President Roman Herzog later Tuesday. He will take the oath of
office in parliament an hour later.
</P>
<P>
As Germany's first Social Democrat chancellor after 16 years of
conservative rule under Kohl, Schroeder will lead a coalition
government with his Social Democratic Party (SPD) sharing power
with the much smaller ecologist Greens party to get a 21-seat
majority in parliament.
</P>
<P>
It is Germany's first center-left ruling coalition in such a
formation.
</P>
<P>
Born on April 7, 1944 in the small northern town of Mossenberg,
Schroeder was one of the five children raised by a war widow who
eked out a living as a cleaning lady. He never saw his father,
who was killed in the same year while serving in the German army
in Romania.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder graduated from Goettingen University in 1976 as a law
major. He became a state parliament member in Lower Saxony in
1980 and was elected the state premier in 1990, a post he held
until Monday.
</P>
<P>
After winning a landslide victory in the state legislature
election in March this year, Schroeder won his party's trust to be
picked as its chief candidate to challenge Kohl, who has defeated
three SPD contenders since 1982.
</P>
<P>
Describing himself as a pro-business pragmatist, Schroeder said
he understands the challenges faced up by German businesses in
coping with the global economy and pledged reforms and innovations
to improve the country's economic strength.
</P>
<P>
And remembering his miserable childhood experiences, Schroeder
also promised to concentrate on social justice at a time when
German unemployment is hovering at the near record high of over
four million.
</P>
<P>
Campaigning on a program he called a political "New Center,"
Schroeder appealed to the large pool of centrist voters, inviting
comparisons with U.S. President Bill Clinton and British Prime
Minister Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
The SPD's chairman, Oskar Lafontaine, will be finance minister
in the new government.
</P>
<P>
Germany's media has been filled with speculation of a power
struggle between Schroeder and Lafontaine, which has been
repeatedly denied by both.
</P>
<P>
Also, Schroeder will have to maintain good cooperation with the
Greens, who have never held office in Bonn before.

<HEADLINE> China's Securities Law Being Examined </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 27 (Xinhua) -- China is taking a cautious
approach towards its young securities market as is reflected in a
draft of a securities law that emphasizes supervision and risk
prevention and avoids discussing risky derivatives.
</P>
<P>
The law, drafted six years ago, was submitted to the Standing
Committee of the National People's Congress at its fifth session
that opened here this morning for deliberation.
</P>
<P>
The securities law draft covers stocks, corporate bonds, bonds
issued by government and financial institutions, mutual funds and
other securities approved by the State Council, China's highest
governing body.
</P>
<P>
It does not apply to securities futures, options and other
derivatives, which, it says, should be handled with great care.
</P>
<P>
The law drafted six years ago was examined by the top
legislature three times from 1992 to 1994 and puts emphasis on
open, fair and equal market principles and protecting investors.
</P>
<P>
It describes trading practices, transparency, adequate
information disclosure, bans insider trading, market manipulation
and other infractions. It also provides punishment for
violations.

<HEADLINE> Legislators Need To Study Contract Law Draft More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Gu Angran, vice-chairman of the
Law Committee of China's National People's Congress (NPC), said
here today that a Contract Law draft needs further study.
</P>
<P>
Gu told the 5th meeting of the 9th NPC Standing Committee that
the draft should describe certain losses caused by changing
situations and pointed out that it should say whether a person can
demand a change or cancellation of the contract.
</P>
<P>
Gu said that two laws on economic contracts allow for increased
fines for a breach of contract if the compensation is not enough
to cover losses, and the legislators will study how to handle this
matter.
</P>
<P>
The draft states that real estate contracts must be in written
form, and contracts involving foreign traders and payments
exceeding 100,000 yuan (about 12,000 U.S. dollars) must also be
written form, Gu said.
</P>
<P>
However, just which contracts and how much a contract should
contain for payment needs further study, he said.

<HEADLINE> Hyundai Boss Re-enters DPRK Through Panmunjom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 27 (Xinhua) -- South Korean Hyundai Group
founder Chung Ju-yung on Tuesday crossed the inter-Korean border
via the truce village of Panmunjom to begin his second trip to
Pyongyang with a donation of 501 head of cattle.
</P>
<P>
Chung intends to meet Kim Jong-il, the leader of the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
"I hope I will meet him (DPRK leader Kim Jong-il). I plan to
discuss various issues regarding inter-Korean economic
cooperation," Chung said in the southern part of Panmunjom before
entering the northern half of the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Chung visited the DPRK in June with a donation of 500 head of
cattle, 50 trucks and food. During the visit, Hyundai reached an
agreement with the DPRK to jointly develop the tourism resources
of Mount Kumgang in the North.
</P>
<P>
Chung said that he hoped to secure a DPRK commitment on the
question of when Mount Kumgang tourism program will begin.
</P>
<P>
Originally, Hyundai planned to bring 1,000 South Koreans each
day to the mountain area starting from September 25 this year, but
failed to meet the target because of a delay in technical talks
between Hyundai and DPRK's Asia-Pacific Peace Committee.
</P>
<P>
Asked when Hyundai will start the tourism program, Chung only
said there was no problem because the Mount Kumgang tour project
had already been agreed.
</P>
<P>
"In the past four months, Hyundai has done its utmost to
realize the Mountain Kumgang tour project. In the near future,
everyone will be given the opportunity to tour Mount Kumgang
without fear," he said.
</P>
<P>
As the Mount Kumgang project is regarded as a source of hard
currency for the DPRK, observers expected it to start next month.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK is expected to earn around 100 million U.S. dollars
from the project annually.

<HEADLINE> China Simplifying Procedures For Adoption Of Children By Foreigners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 27 (Xinhua) -- A draft of an Adoption Law
amendment that simplifies procedures for foreigners who want to
adopt Chinese children was submitted to the 5th meeting of the 9th
National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee today.
</P>
<P>
An existing draft stipulates that when foreigners want to adopt
Chinese children, they must register with civil affairs
departments and get a notarization at an office approved by the
State Council.
</P>
<P>
The revised draft removes the notarization procedure. If the
parties concerned want documents notarized, they should do so in
notary offices, says Zhang Xuwu, deputy director of NPC Legal
Committee.
</P>
<P>
The former draft says that people adopting abandoned children
raised in social welfare institutions can have their own children
and may adopt more than one orphan.
</P>
<P>
Some members of the NPC Standing Committee say that the
adopting of orphans should not be limited to welfare institutions,
but some members worry that a loosening of the terms may have a
negative effect on birth control.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that the NPC Legal Committee favors not revising
existing regulations and asks the civil affairs departments and
the family planning departments to cooperate in implementing the
Adoption Law.
</P>
<P>
The new draft has no age limit on people adopting grown
children.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong government has
launched a territory-wide operation against illegal immigration
and arrested 195 people.
</P>
<P>
The operation, jointly mounted by the Police, Immigration
Department and Labor Department of Hong Kong, was part of the
government's continuous effort to flush out illegal immigrants, a
government announcement said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The 130 suspected illegal immigrants arrested by the Police
have been referred to the Immigration Department, and those found
to be illegal immigrants will be repatriated, the announcement
said.
</P>
<P>
During the 24-hour operation ended at 5 am Tuesday, the Police
stepped up their identification spot checks in public places and
carried out checks at suspicious locations throughout the
territory.
</P>
<P>
A government spokesman reiterated that there was no question of
any amnesty for illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
"Our latest operation should drive home the point that there
will be no change to this policy. Anyone foolish enough to believe
otherwise is only cheating oneself," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman stressed that apart from continuous checks
throughout the territory, there was no let-up in anti-illegal
immigration efforts at the border.
</P>
<P>
"A high state of vigilance will continue to be maintained by
the Police and the security forces both at the land and sea
borders," he said.

ordered him to ride with them in a FIAT 131 car they were driving
and sped away firing no shots.
</P>
<P>
Later reports said Sheikh Omar was taken to Sigaleh area of
Bermuda vicinity, one of Mogadishu's most dangerous areas in the
heart of the capital, where well-armed gunmen have been operating
since the beginning of the civil war.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Islamic court were seen getting ready in
their headquarters with their battle wagons and gunmen in case
any trace is found.
</P>
<P>
Neither the identity of the gunmen nor the reason behind the
abduction is known. However, some sources said the gunmen are
just the remaining of a group whose malicious activities were
seriously handicapped by the Islamic Court after many of their
fellow friends were arrested, while others have run for exile
after the threat and pressure on them was increased.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen in Bermuda area have been responsible for the
kidnaping of many Somalis since beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
The incident followed an armed confrontation between two rival
militiamen near the Black Sea junction of South Mogadishu Monday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
At least four people were wounded including two school girls
in their uniforms after gunmen driving two battle wagons attacked
a communication center near Black Sea junction.
</P>
<P>
The assault was reportedly a retaliation move by the attacking
gunmen who have lost one of their fellow sub-clan men to the
owners of the communication facility in the same area a day
earlier.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Turkey has sent a note to
Russia to extradite outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) leader
Abdullah Ocalan to Ankara, Turkish Foreign Ministry Deputy
Spokesman Sermet Atacanli said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The semi-official Anatolia News Agency quoted Atacanli as
saying that Turkey asked Russia to confirm that Ocalan is in
Russia, adding that Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz had written a
letter to his Russian counterpart Yevgeny Primakov on this
issue.
</P>
<P>
Atacanli pointed out that "the Russian side has not still
confirmed that Ocalan is in Russia. Therefore, Russia has to
respond to us concerning this issue."
</P>
<P>
He said that the attitude of Turkey towards the PKK is clear,
adding that "We told the Russian side that we determined that this
man is in Russia and requested Russia to give him to us."
</P>
<P>
Turkey once massed heavy troops along the Syrian border and
issued an ultimatum, threatening to uproot the PKK bases in Syria
if Damascus continues its alleged support to the Kurdish rebels.
</P>
<P>
Last Tuesday, Syria pledged to ban PKK on its territory and in
the Syrian-controlled Bekka Valley and agreed not to allow the PKK
militants to launch cross-border attacks on the Turkish territory.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached during a two-day secret meeting
held in Turkey's southern province of Adana.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Deregulates Gas Market to End Fuel Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has
deregulated the liquefied petroleum gas (lpg) market in an effort
to curtail the persisting fuel crisis in the country.
</P>
<P>
Special Adviser on Petroleum Resources, Aret Adams announced
the Nigerian government's decision in capital Abuja Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Post Express newspaper Tuesday quoted Adams as saying that
the new policy makes it possible for any corporate body to import
and sell the cooking gas at the Nigerian market.
</P>
<P>
For effective coordination of the deregulated market, the
official said, a lpg development committee has been set up to
develop strategies for ensuring the safety and quality of lpg
plants and equipment.
</P>
<P>
Following the scarcity of the commodity occasioned by non
production by the local refineries, the price of cooking gas has
gone up from the approved price of 250 Naira (about 2.8 U.S.
Dollars) per 12.5 kg cylinder to 1,400 Naira (about 15.5
Dollars).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Nigerian government has ordered 50 shiploads of
petrol to ensure that the current fuel scarcity being experienced
nationwide will not spill into the Christmas and New Year
celebrations.
</P>
<P>
Lagos State Administrator Mohammed Marwa was quoted as saying
Monday that about 100 million liters of petrol will be discharged
at the Apapa Port of Lagos within the coming week to ease the
shortage of petrol supply in Lagos.
</P>
<P>
Long queues of vehicles are still a common sight at fuel
stations in Lagos as the perennial fuel scarcity has continued in
the state.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Philippine government forces and
Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) rebels clashed again Tuesday
in Maguindanao, Southwestern Mindanao, despite a new ceasefire
agreement.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Philippine News Agency reported that the
government troops and the MILF rebels "traded a barrage of mortar
fires against each other" in Garigayan, Buldon, Maguindanao.
</P>
<P>
This was the third time the two sides clashed after they signed
their latest truce last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Ricardo Torrevillas, government army spokesman, was quoted by
the agency as saying that the exchange of fires, which started at
dawn Tuesday, lasted up to 10:00 (02:00 GMT). It occurred near the
Secretary Narciso Ramos highway, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the rebel fires were directed to the headquarters of
the 39th Infantry Battalion (IB) which is stationed near
Garigayan. No one was reported hurt on the government side.
</P>
<P>
The government and the rebels forged last Saturday an agreement
ending their week-long fighting in the Datu
Piang-Shariff-Agwak-Talayan complex, also in Maguindanao.
</P>
<P>
Mortar fires, however, flew again in the same area eight hours
after the ceasefire was signed.
</P>
<P>
The warring parties once again unleashed a number of mortar
shells at each other's position in the complex Monday.
</P>
<P>
The MILF is fighting for independence of Mindanao.

<TEXT>
<P>
The BFF's fact-finding mission follows a trip to Brazil at the
weekend by the South African 2006 World Cup bid committee's chief
executive officer Danny Jordaan. Brazil is considering bidding
for the 2006 finals.
</P>
<P>
BFF president Ricardo Texeirra will be among the visitors.
</P>
<P>
Jordaan said he is confident that he can persuade Brazilians
to shelve their plans in favor of South Africa, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"The Brazilians understand how much it means to us to stage
the finals," Jordaan said.
</P>
<P>
"I was given their unconditional support in the event of
Brazil bidding for the event but falling at the first voting
hurdle when FIFA conduct the vote in 2000," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Federation of International Football Association (FIFA)
starts to receive bids for 2006 World Cup next month and the
bidding ends in July 1999. A final decision will be made in March
2000.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Cook: NATO Should Not Drop Guard on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Britain said on Tuesday
President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia was making serious
progress in the withdrawal of troops from Kosovo's battlefronts
but NATO should not drop its guard.
</P>
<P>
"I am pleased to say there is some evidence that he (Milosevic)
is now making serious progress to deliver on his commitment and
our demand that he reduce his forces, both police and army, to the
levels before the conflict," British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook
told BBC radio in an interview.
</P>
<P>
But Cook didn't say whether military action against Yugoslavia
would be necessary when the NATO deadline expires at 1900 GMT on
Tuesday. He said the alliance should keep up the pressure.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether air strikes were now unlikely, Cook said, "It may
well be prudent to decide that we're not going to drop our guard,
that we're not going to end our state of readiness, that we're
going to keep it there because we know President Milosevic will
only keep up his side of the bargain if we keep the pressure on
him."
</P>
<P>
NATO ambassadors' meeting in Brussels on Tuesday afternoon
would have to decide how far Milosevic has complied with the
substantial withdrawal demanded by NATO and how far he still has
to go, Cook said.

KATHMANDU, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Heads of the sub-regional
organizations in Asia and the Pacific and the Economic and Social
Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) reiterated here
Tuesday their commitment to regional cooperation and economic
integration.
</P>
<P>
Regional cooperation and regional economic integration should
serve as a means to promote sustained development with equity and
stability in the widest possible sense, the heads noted in a joint
communique issued Tuesday after a two-day consultative meeting.
</P>
<P>
Heads of the ESCAP, the South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation (SAARC), the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN), the Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO) and the
(South Pacific) Forum Secretariat attended the consultative
meeting hosted by the Kathmandu-based SAARC Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the Asian Development Bank and the United
Nations Development Program (UNDP) were also present at the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
"The heads of sub-regional organizations and ESCAP expressed
their deep satisfaction at the enhanced pace and seriousness with
which their organizations coordinated their actions to promote
cooperation in such key areas as exchange and sharing of
experiences on matters pertaining to trade liberalization,
promotion of investment, development of infrastructure, poverty
eradication, human resource development and complementing each
others' institutional capabilities in these areas to achieve
specific objectives," the joint communique said.
</P>
<P>
They pledged to continue their useful work in these areas and
strengthen cooperation among them through identifying focal points
for sharing of information and experiences, more frequent use of
each others' websites and accelerating progress toward networking
of trade-related research institutions and data bases on a
sub-regional scale.
</P>
<P>
Besides, they will seek greater cooperation in the area of
transport facilitation and infrastructure development, networking
of center of excellencies for research and training for human
resources development, dissemination of human resources
development studies as well as implementation of targeted programs
in the area of poverty eradication, the communique said.
</P>
<P>
The heads stressed the continued importance attached by their
organizations to the useful role the private sectors may play in
supplementing the inter-governmental efforts in promoting
cooperation among different sub-regions in Asia and the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
"They stressed that concrete steps would be considered by their
organizations to promote such cooperation within the framework of
their agreed plans and programs as well as mandates," the
communique said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting took place after a financial crisis hit parts of
the world, in particular, the East Asian nations. The heads shared
their concerns on the negative consequences of the ongoing
financial crisis for the countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
"They stressed that efforts are necessary to develop a
comprehensive strategy to address the root causes of this crisis
and initiate concrete measures which are in keeping with the needs
of the Asia-Pacific region and the greater interest of the global
economy at large," the communique said.
</P>
<P>
The heads urged concerned international and regional
institutions, U.N. specialized agencies and bilateral donors to
enhance and increase their assistance in keeping with the needs of
the sub-regional organizations and the ESCAP to enable them to
realize their full potentials.
</P>
<P>
In particular, they urged the UNDP to extend all possible help
and support under its regional cooperation framework, the joint
communique said.
</P>
<P>
"From this meeting, we're now moving from generalized form of
cooperation to more specific areas of cooperation," SAARC
Secretary-General Naeem U. Hasan told a press conference held
after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
He said that the ASEAN focuses on trade, the ECO based in
Tehran, Iran, focuses on transportation while the SAARC's priority
is poverty alleviation, so they can learn from each other.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation among sub-regional organizations in Asia and the
Pacific and the ESCAP was initiated by the ESCAP four years ago,
and the consultative meeting of the heads was held annually for
high-level consultations to strengthen cooperation among them in
the vital areas of trade, investment, development of
infrastructure, poverty eradication, human resource development
and greater people-to-people contact.
</P>
<P>
The Forum Secretariat based in Suva, Fiji, has offered to host
the next consultative meeting some time in 1999.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The Romanian government has
taken measures to curb economic collapse and put it back on track,
the country's media reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to Nine O'clock daily, the government has asked
several large loss-making enterprises to gradually close down so
that losses sustained by the economy can shrink by a minimum of 30
percent by the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
A first batch will be closed down by next January 1, which will
reduce the country's loss burden by 15 percent, Economy Minister
Decebal Traian Remes was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
More enterprises will be closed at the beginning of every
quarter next year so that losses may further shrink by a minimum
of five percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
Economic analysts said the closure of large loss-making
enterprises may allow the Romanian economy to achieve an upward
curve.
</P>
<P>
Romania is in its second year of economic decline, after a GDP
fall of 6.6 percent in 1997. Economic predictions indicate a
decline of 4-6 percent will be in this year.

<HEADLINE> National Population Policy Launched in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe has launched its
national population policy with an aim to increase the country's
economic growth to at least six percent in real terms from 1998
onwards.
</P>
<P>
Launching the 76-page policy document in Harare Monday,
National Economic Planning Commissioner, Richard Hove, said that
the framework was aimed at influencing the population variables
and development trends in order to achieve the economic and
social goals of the nation.
</P>
<P>
"The objective of the national population policy is to raise
the quality of life for all the people," said Hove.
</P>
<P>
"This can be accomplished through appropriate development
policies and programs aimed at achieving poverty eradication,
sustained economic growth and sustainable patterns of
consumption," he added.
</P>
<P>
While the population growth rate may be declining, the
country's population is still likely to double in the next 30
years, the document says.
</P>
<P>
As a result,the nation's ability to save has been eroded as a
large proportions of the budget have to be set aside for social
services.
</P>
<P>
It is, therefore, part of the population policy that family
planning programs should continue with the the on-going efforts
to increase contraceptive availability, the document stresses.
</P>
<P>
The document quoted the 1997 population of Zimbabwe at 12
million, compared to 10.4 million in 1992, with 32 percent
residing in urban areas and 52 percent female.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's population is regarded as young with 43 percent
below the age of 15 years and only four percent aged 65 years and
above, according to the document.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's TRC Final Report to Be Announced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The Truth and
Reconciliation Commission (TRC), a special court of South Africa,
will hand over its final report to President Nelson Mandela and
make it public later this week, local press reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The 3,500-page report in five volumes is expected to lay the
overwhelming blame for gross human rights violations on
successive apartheid governments and their security forces.
</P>
<P>
South African Press Association quoted unidentified TRC
sources as saying that the TRC report also accused the now ruling
African National Congress (ANC) of violating human rights during
the apartheid struggle.
</P>
<P>
However, the report acknowledged that the ANC was a liberation
movement, conducting a legitimate struggle against apartheid.
</P>
<P>
TRC, set in motion in 1995, was authorized to listen to all
those who alleged a gross violation of their human rights at the
hands of either the previous or current government, to receive
applications from those who had committed violations, in the
expectation of full amnesty for full confessions, and to provide
for appropriate reparations to the victims.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Sends More Troops to Crisis-Torn Warri </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has sent
more troops including units of the Amphibious Brigade to Warri to
beef up military presence in the crisis-torn town, This Day
newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
About 500 soldiers arrived last Sunday at the Warri airstrip
where arrangements were being made to airlift them to the coastal
area.
</P>
<P>
An officer at David Ejoor Barracks in Effurun near Warri was
quoted as saying that most of the soldiers would be deployed in
the Riverine areas to protect oil installations.
</P>
<P>
The reinforcement of troops in Warri followed the escalation
of the mayhem in the area last Saturday when the Itsekiri
ancestral home and the Olu's alternate palace were allegedly
razed by Ijaw youths who also sacked two police stations and took
all the policemen hostage.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government condemned at the weekend the renewed
hostilities between the Ijaws and Itsekiris, saying that it will
no longer tolerate any act of lawlessness.
</P>
<P>
The soldiers were probably being taken to flush out Ijaw
youths who are still laying siege to some oil flow stations, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Non native residents in Warri and the surrounding trouble
spots have fled the area following the attack by Ijaw youths last
Saturday on the ancestral home of the Itsekiris.
</P>
<P>
The non natives' fear heightened when a Yoruba boat captain
was shot by some Ijaws for allegedly scolding an Ijaw youth.
</P>
<P>
The Ijaws and Itsekiris have been engaged in communal clashes
since 1996 over the relocation of the headquarters of the Warri
south local government from Ogbe-Ijo (an Ijaw settlement) to
Ogidegben (an Itsekiri settlement).
</P>
<P>
Hostilities between them were rekindled about 10 days ago when
the Ijaws were alleged to have interrupted the funeral procession
of an Itsekiri chief and kidnaped his son and some others.
</P>
<P>
The Delta State Government last Friday imposed a dusk to dawn
curfew on Warri and its environs.

MOSCOW, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
arrived in the Barvikha sanatorium from his Gorky-9 residence on
Tuesday to undergo "a course of rehabilitation treatment."
</P>

<HEADLINE> 4 Wounded in South Lebanon's Bomb Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Four people were wounded by a
car bomb blast in Lebanon's southern biggest city of Sidon
Tuesday morning, the Orient radio reported.
</P>
<P>
At 9:05 a.m. (7:05 GMT), a huge sound was heard across the
city when the bomb in a car which was parked on Sidon's eastern
highway exploded.
</P>
<P>
A man, who is said to be a leader of the Palestinian militant
group Islamic Jihad in Sidon, his wife and and their son and
another unidentified man were moderately wounded and rushed to a
nearby hospital.
</P>
<P>
They were standing near the car when the bomb exploded, the
radio said.
</P>
<P>
Following the incident, Lebanese army and interior security
forces arrived and sealed off the site and started an
investigation into the case.
</P>
<P>
Only five minutes before the bombing, a convoy of Lebanese
Prime Minister Rafik Hariri was passing by the site, the radio
said.
</P>
<P>
It has not been clear yet whether there is a link between the
bombing and the killing of two policemen in the same city last
Saturday by two motorcyclists.
</P>
<P>
Some Lebanese officials said the crime was aimed at
destabilizing the country during the presidential election in
which army commander Emile Lahoud was elected the next president
on October 15 by the parliament.

<HEADLINE> Japan's September Jobless Rate Stays at Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Japan's unemployment rate
remained at a record high of 4.3 percent in September, unchanged
from August, the Management and Coordination Agency said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The jobless rate among men was at a record high of 4.4 percent,
the same as in the previous month, while that among women was 4.2
percent, down 0.1 percentage point from August, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Altogether 2.95 million people were without jobs in September,
up 25 percent from a year earlier, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Economists with the agency and with private sectors have agreed
that the jobless figure will likely remain high in the coming
months.
</P>
<P>
This sentiment was bolstered by a separate report also released
Tuesday by the Labor Ministry.
</P>
<P>
In the report, the ministry said the seasonally adjusted ratio
of job offers in September fell to 0.49 -- the lowest level since
the end of World War II -- from 0.50 in August, meaning there were
only 49 job offers for every 100 people looking for work.
</P>
<P>
Japan's jobless rate broke the 4-percent barrier for the first
time in April and has edged up gradually in the months since.

BEIJING, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Since China and Russia are both
big nations with great influence in the world, and neighboring

The two countries have greatly enhanced cooperation and
exchanges between various sectors at different levels, he noted.
And there is also an increase in the bilateral exchange of

the all-round development of Sino-Russian strategic partnership.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 27 (Xinhua) -- A number of high profile laws
related to village democracy, adoption, security and
administrative appeals were tabled during today's opening session
of the National People's Congress (NPC), China's highest
legislative body.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng, chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, presided over
an explanatory hearing of draft laws during the opening meeting of
the fifth session of the Ninth NPC Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
The draft revision to the Basic law on Village Committees,
adopted 10 years ago, strengthens grass roots democracy in
China.

delicate relations between village committees and Party committee
branches on the village level.

work in accordance with the CPC charter and related
regulations. Branches will strictly abide by the Constitution and
national laws to protect the direct democratic rights of villagers
and their self-governing responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
The new draft law on adoption features simplified procedures
for foreigners adopting Chinese children. The first draft required
foreigners to both register with the government and authenticate
documents with notaries of public authorized by the Chinese
government. However, the new draft make the notarization
requirement optional depending on the desires of either one or
both parties.
</P>
<P>
The Security Act, which was drafted six years ago, was
resubmitted for a fourth review. Lawmakers noted that lessons
learned from the international financial crisis were summerized
and are reflected in the new draft.
</P>
<P>
A number of chapters and clauses are devoted to strengthening
the government's supervisory and regulatory powers over the
securities market, risk protection and protecting the interests of
investors.

MOSCOW, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov left here for Vienna Tuesday on a one-day trip,
representing President Boris Yeltsin at the Russia-European Union
(EU) summit.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure, Primakov met Yeltsin at the president's
residence Gorki-9 outside Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, who suffered irregular blood pressure and "serious
fatigue" in the wake of a bout of bronchitis, cancelled the

take a vacation.
</P>

Primakov's entourage included Vice Premier Vladimir Bulgak,
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and Minister for Economy Andrei
Shapovalyants, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Besides the Russia-EU summit, the ministers will also meet
their Austrian counterparts and discuss bilateral relations.

More than 10 major economic agreements worth 600 million
U.S. dollars will be signed during the visit, said the report.
</P>

of the agenda during Primakov's visit.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Novye Izvestia daily said Tuesday that Primakov
was going to the Russia-EU summit in Vienna with "a begging hand."
Some reports say Moscow asked for EU food aid, although some

<P>
The focus of attention in the economic arena has centered on
formulating the nation's first contract law. However, lawmakers
are still debating several key issues, including how to handle the
breaches of contract resulting from changes in national policy,
compensation for losses beyond the financial terms of a contract,
and the applicability of verbal and written contracts.
</P>
<P>
The draft law on administrative appeals represents a major part
of anti-corruption and human rights legislation. The draft
condenses procedures for public appeals to the government
concerning violations of the legal rights and interests of
citizens and legal entities. The government is expected to adopt
the law which will provide a highly effective supervisory
mechanism.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers will also review the draft law on military service
which will reduce the existing 3-4 year compulsory military
service to only two years. China currently has a volunteer
military service system and the draft law includes a stipulation
banning extended service for draftees.
</P>
<P>
The State Council submitted the amended Highway Law which
integrates various highway fees with state automobile sales and
fuel taxes.
</P>
<P>
The amended law is expected to help to curb the arbitrary
collection of highway fees and relive motor vehicle operators of
excessive changes.
</P>
<P>
In a rare move, leaders of the NPC Standing Committee tabled a
bill calling implementation of the National Law on Exclusive
Economic Zones and the Continental Shelf in the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region.

KUALA LUMPUR, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia is discussing
with the World Bank for a loan to finance efforts by government
agencies to tackle the Y2K computer problem, according to
Malaysian Energy, Telecommunications and Posts Minister Leo Moggie
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The quantum of the World Bank loan sought for has not been

In addition World Bank financial support was also sought for
the appointment of additional "verifiers" of Y2K-compliance
reports of companies, he said.

when computers cannot read "00" for the year 2000 as the numerals
also represent the year 1900 in the two-digit system.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Weaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar closed
weaker Tuesday ahead of key economic data due Wednesday, which
could pave the way for the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) to ease
monetary policy following its board meeting next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
After quiet session which saw trade volumes reduced to a
dribble, the local currency ended at 61.50 U.S. cents, down from
its close in local trade Monday of 61.77 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
The currency traded between 61.46 U.S. cents and 61.67 U.S.
cents during the day.
</P>
<P>
"I think most market participants are sitting on the sidelines
until such times as perhaps after the RBA board meeting next
week," said Peter Whitley, foreign exchange manager for Colonial
State Bank.
</P>
<P>
"There's a distinct lack of interest in the currency at the
present time."
</P>
<P>
Whitley said the local currency had dropped nearly two U.S.
cents in the past week and "continues to drift off".
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's quarterly inflation figures, as well as wages
growth numbers scheduled for release on Thursday, are not expected
to deter RBA, Australia's central bank, from cutting interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar finished at 73.35 Japanese yen from 73.36
yen, and 1.0216 German marks from 1.0177 marks.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Dhaka, capital of Bangladesh,
started a permanent drive Tuesday to check the emission of thick
black smoke and high-pitched sound by the defective and junk
vehicles plying on the streets.
</P>
<P>
The program was inaugurated in the morning by Minister of
Forest and Environment Sayeda Sajeda Chowdhury.
</P>
<P>
The launching program was jointly organized by the Bangladesh
Road Transport Authority, the Dhaka Metropolitan Police and
magistracy and some voluntary organizations.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 250,000 defective vehicles ply in Dhaka every day,
constantly releasing thick black smoke and making high-pitched
sound which cause severe air and noise pollution, concerned
sources estimated.
</P>
<P>
Considering the fast environmental degradation, the Department
of Environment earlier also launched such drives each year and
realized penalties.
</P>
<P>
But the drive from Tuesday will be a permanent one to check the
emission of black smoke and high-pitched sound vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The government and municipal departments concerned will take
corresponding measures to control the air pollution on the basis
of the check results.
</P>
<P>
The air pollution level in Dhaka was often 5-10 times higher
than the recommended WHO (World Health Organization) guidelines
for suspended particulate matter, sulphur dioxide and airborne
lead, according to a recent WHO report.
</P>
<P>
With a population of over nine million, Dhaka has become a
capital city with the level of lead pollution in the air during
November to January being the highest in the world.

<HEADLINE> Mkapa's Anti-Corruption Drive Wins Praise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa's campaign against corruption has won praise from
the country's Attorney-General Andrew Chenge.
</P>
<P>
The president's anti-corruption drive has caused worries of
officials across the country, which is a manifestation that the
campaign has been successfully carried out, Chenge said at the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian newspaper Tuesday quoted the attorney-general as
saying that his office has been approached by some big targets
complaining why they were being asked to account for their
"legally amassed" wealth.
</P>
<P>
In response, Chenge queried why "fear instead of cooperating
to account for the wealth so amassed if it was through clean
sources?"
</P>
<P>
The attorney-general said in an interview with the newspaper
that he feels so bad to learn that almost all sectors in the
society have been tainted by corruption.
</P>
<P>
He said that the war against the social vice could succeed if
everybody plays a due role.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian former vice-president and prime minister, Joseph
Warioba, has said in a report that the corruption situation in
the country is alarming.
</P>
<P>
In hospitals, for instance, bribes are demanded for the
initial registration of a patient, consultations with the doctor,
laboratory examination, provision of drugs, dressing of wounds,
admission of in-patients and general treatment, including food
service.
</P>
<P>
Since he came to office in 1995, President Mkapa has
repeatedly sounded warnings that those corrupt elements should be
thrown out of the government and pay heavily for their evil
deeds.
</P>
<P>
Several senior government officials have stepped down on
corruption scandals.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand's Imports Climb But Growth Slowing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, October 27 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand importers are
still buying more foreign goods than they were a year ago, but
the rate of import growth is slowing, according to Statistics New
Zealand data out Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Adjusted merchandise imports were 1.87 billion NZ dollars (967
million U.S. dollars) in September, continuing a slight downward
trend from a peak of 1.89 billion NZ dollars in May.
</P>
<P>
However, the September result is still up on the same month
last year, when goods worth adjusted 1.77 billion NZ dollars were
imported.
</P>
<P>
The data is adjusted to remove seasonal and irregular effects
which distort comparisons of the monthly data, New Zealand
Government Statistician Len Cook said.
</P>
<P>
The falling trend might be a response to a depreciation in the
NZ dollar against the currencies of New Zealand's major trading
partners, he explained.
</P>
<P>
The NZ dollar has fallen about 12.6 percent over the year to
September, pushing up the price of imports, he said.
</P>
<P>
The decline in the economic activity of New Zealand in the
first half of 1998 would also have reduced import demand, Cook
said.
</P>
<P>
Actual merchandise imports in September were 2.05 billion NZ
dollars (1.06 billion U.S. dollars), 3.2 percent higher than the
same month last year. he added.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Army Chief on U.N. Peace-keeping Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Chief of the Nepalese Army
Staff General Dharmapal Bar Singh Thapa said here Tuesday that the
army attaches great importance to all the activities of the United
Nations, especially the peace-keeping operations.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a function held to mark the 53rd anniversary of the
founding of the United Nations and the 50th anniversary of U.N.
peace-keeping operations, Thapa said that "following the policies
of the government, the army will continue to support future U.N.
peace-keeping operations."
</P>
<P>
He said that since Nepal participated in U.N. peace-keeping
operations in 1958, some 34,000 Nepalese soldiers have been
involved and 35 Nepalese army officers and soldiers have
sacrificed their lives for the cause of peace.
</P>
<P>
He continued that as the United Nations has identified the need
for a system of "standby arrangements" with the capability of
deploying on short notice to facilitate the planning,
implementation and effectiveness of peace-keeping, Nepal has
already signed the memorandum of understanding and kept 2,000
troops on standby for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
Since the Nepalese police first joined U.N. peace-keeping
mission in former Yugoslavia in March 1992, a total of 759
policemen have served in peace-keeping operations and four of them
sacrificed their lives, a senior police officer told the function.
</P>
<P>
"As a peace-loving country, Nepal wishes to see that peace,
security and progress prevail in every nook and corner of the
world," Nepali Prime Minister and Defense Minister Girija Prasad
Koirala said at the function.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, Nepal has been consistently contributing her troops
to the U.N. peace-keeping operations in many troubled parts of the
world," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the occasion, a wreath was laid at a peace memorial erected
in the U.N. complex in Nepal to remember and honor the Nepalese
who gave their lives in U.N. peace-keeping operations.

MANILA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Islamic Liberation Front (MILF)
rebels and Philippine government forces have exchanged fires in
Maguindanao, Mindanao, despite a ceasefire agreement, reports from
Maguindanao said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> China Shortens Term of Military Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 27 (Xinhua) -- An amended law which will have
a direct bearing on the interests of Chinese military personnel
was submitted to the National People's Congress (NPC), China's
highest legislative body, today.
</P>
<P>
The amended Military Service Law of the People's Republic of
China (draft) shortens the length of compulsory military service
from 3-4 years to only two years. The law also eliminates extended
military service.
</P>
<P>
Chinese land forces currently serve for three years, with
enlistment periods for naval and air force personnel set at four
years. Extended service period for army personnel range from one
to two years, with the period naval and air force personnel set at
one year.
</P>
<P>
Yu Yongbo, a member of the Central Military Commission (CMC),
explained the amended law during today's fifth meeting of
the Ninth NPC Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
He said that excessive length of the current enlistment period
creates a great burden for many people and dampens enthusiasm for
voluntary enlistments.
</P>
<P>
"Many young people old enough to join the army hesitate because
of the long enlistment period, and the fact that parents also
object affects the number of enlistments," said Fu
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the extended service in the army will not be needed
with the establishment of the system of volunteer soldiers, Fu
added.
</P>
<P>
The draft law contains a number of stipulations on China's
system of military service and combines compulsory and volunteer
service, along with militia and reserve forces.
</P>
<P>
Volunteers currently account for 18 percent of total military
personnel, with the figure expected to reach 35 percent by the
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The draft also contains new stipulations on the military
service for volunteers, division of reserve forces, and subsidies
for militiamen and reserve forces during military training. Other
stipulations cover the welfare of families of compulsory soldiers,
arrangements for former servicemen and punishment for those who
have violated the related law.
</P>
<P>
Yu stressed that the amended military service law was needed to
strengthen national defense and promote military modernization.
</P>
<P>
The revisions also help to improve the quality and
effectiveness of the Chinese army and upgrade the standards of
military technology, according to Yu.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia May Become World's Biggest Exporter of Fishery Commodities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia is determined to
become the world's biggest exporter of fishery commodities as the
country has vast marine resources, which had not been exploited to
the maximum, Agriculture Minister Soleh Solahudin said.
</P>
<P>
"With the support of adequate and high-quality system,
equipment and fish species which can be further developed
intensively, Indonesia has a good chance of becoming the world's
biggest fishery commodity exporter," Solahudin said.
</P>
<P>
Inspecting the Loka Fishery Research Center at Gondol Beach in
Bali on Monday, the minister said the support facilities had
already been prepared, especially in some eastern provinces, with
the participation of big businesses and vast investment.
</P>
<P>
This project is also aimed to develop the agricultural sector
into a reliable sector, which in the past has been functioning
merely as a supporting sector, in boosting national economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's earnings from sea fishery commodity exports in 2003
had been projected to reach 2.64 billion U.S. dollars, and 7.36
billion U.S. dollars from coastal fishery commodity exports.
</P>
<P>
The minister expressed optimism that the target could be
achieved as the results of intensive fishery research are now
applied by fishermen, such as in Gondol Beach.
</P>
<P>
The government is trying to devise a scheme to enable fishermen
to receive low-interest credits, such as those already enjoyed by
farmers for intensified rice and second crops cultivation, the
minister was quoted by Antara News Agency Tuesday as saying.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Cabinet Okays New World Bank Lending Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's cabinet Monday
approved a new kind of loan program proposed by the World Bank
(WB) for future financing in the country's energy sector, media
reports here said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The new loan, called "Adaptable Program Lending (APL)", will be
available with the implementation of the reform programs to be
negotiated with the WB.
</P>
<P>
The loan scheme was a new type of program and it would be given
to support the energy sector reform over a particular period,
Finance Minister Shah A.M.S. Kibria was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The reform proposals would be decided through discussions
between the WB and the Energy Ministry, he said, adding the
conditions for the reform programs to be set by the WB were
negotiable, and they were yet to be finalized.
</P>
<P>
The WB's proposals also included revision of prices of power
and gas and other infrastructural development in the sector, he
stated.
</P>
<P>
The reform program would start within two or three months, with
the WB providing a huge amount of money for the development of the
sector, he said, without mentioning the concrete sum.
</P>
<P>
The loan would support normal development schemes in the
sector, and this would be disbursed in phases after a review of
the progress of the reform package.
</P>
<P>
A large sum of money could be obtained from the WB under the
"APL", he pointed out, saying the reform program would have to be
negotiated in the first year of disbursement of loan and the
implementation of the scheme would be reviewed after a certain
period.
</P>
<P>
The WB has been pressuring the Bangladeshi government for
reform in the energy sector, including upward revision of prices
of power and gas.

<HEADLINE> Italian Prime Minister Urges Approval of 1999 Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Massino
D'Alema Monday urged the majority caucuses in the senate to adopt
exceptional fast track procedures to ensure "very rapid" approval
of the 1999 budget, saying the budget is one of his government's
three basic priorities.
</P>
<P>
"We are already almost beyond the statutory limit, but we must
do all we can to get back within the timetable we already seen to
have lost," he said, "To do this, an exceptional procedure is
needed."
</P>
<P>
"The senators should communicate their observations on the
measure to their colleagues in the Lower House," D'Alema said.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema won a lower house confidence vote on Friday by a margin
of over 50 votes, and the same outcome is a foregone conclusion in
the senate confidence debate on Monday and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Repeating what he told the lower house, D'Alema said his
government's priorities are approval of the budget, election of a
successor to President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro in April, and a bill
to reform the present electoral system.
</P>
<P>
If this last reform is not passed or in the pipeline early next
year, the country will vote on the issue in a nationwide
referendum, although this eventuality would be avoided if early
elections are called.
</P>
<P>
But he also said that if the conservative opposition wants to
stand by its demand for elections, it must contribute to getting
the electoral reform through rapidly.

<HEADLINE> IFC Increases Investments in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The International Finance
Corporation (IFC) Monday announced its plan to invest 14.4 million
U.S. dollars in Settavex, the largest integrated textile company
in Morocco, to help it produce higher value-added products.
</P>
<P>
IFC will provide a 5.4 million dollar loan and an equity
investment of up to 9 million dollars. Settavex is responding to
strong competition in the industry by undertaking a 46 million
dollars upgrading and expansion project to shift part of its
output from commodity-like basic articles to higher-margin, more
refined differentiated articles such as gabardines, khakis, chinos
and corduroys.
</P>
<P>
Later last week, IFC signed agreements to invest 120 million
dollars towards construction of the Mozal Aluminum smelter of
Mozambique, and international lenders would likely provide
financing totaling 820 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The project is the largest single private sector investment to
date in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Mozal project will contribute to successful economic reform
initiatives in Mozambique, with annual production capacity of
250,000 tons of primary aluminum ingots that will triple the
country's exports and add more than 7 percent of GDP from the
first year of operation.
</P>
<P>
Mozal's total project cost of 1.34 billion dollars will be
financed through equity of 520 million dollars, subordinated loans
of 150 million dollars, and senior loans of 670 million dollars.
IFC will provide 65 million dollars in a subordinated loan.
</P>
<P>
IFC is a member of the World Bank Group and also the largest
multilateral source of lending in private sectors of developing
countries.

<HEADLINE> NGOs in South Asia Plan Strategy for Climate Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Several non-government
organizations (NGOs) of South Asia are trying to forge a front
against industrialized nations on the issue of greenhouse gas
emission cuts, Business Standard said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The issue is to be thrashed out at the forthcoming global
climate convention in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
</P>
<P>
Select NGOs from India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and
Nepal met here last week and decided that unless the principle of
equal entitlements to greenhouse gas emissions on a global level
was agreed upon, developing countries should not accept the
protocol's prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
They felt that the protocol had provisions that put developing
countries, particularly those rich in fossil fuels, at a
disadvantage and was detrimental to their economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Anil Agarwal, director, Center for Science and Environment,
said that the concept of equitable entitlement to emission rights
meant each country had the right to emit equal amounts of gases.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the entitlements should be fixed on a global per
capita basis.
</P>
<P>
The country which emitted more than its aggregate entitlement
should accordingly reduce its emission level while the country
emitting less than its aggregate entitlement should be allowed to
emit more.
</P>
<P>
Agarwal suggested that in such a case those industrialized
countries which had emitted more than their entitlement could buy
the surplus from developing countries. They could invest in
energy-efficiency measures in solar, wind and hydel sectors in the
developing countries.

<HEADLINE> Peru, Ecuador Sign Landmark Peace Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Peruvian President Alberto
Fujimori and his Ecuadoran counterpart Jamil Mahuad Monday signed
a landmark peace treaty ending a 57-year bloody border dispute
between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the pact is seen as highly significant for Latin
America, bringing together two rivals in an example which should
be followed throughout the region and the world.
</P>
<P>
The signing ceremony was held in Brasilia, capital of Brazil,
and attended by the presidents or representatives of the four
guarantor countries - Brazil, Argentina, Chile and the United
States. These countries have engaged in over a half-century
mediation.
</P>
<P>
Under the pact, Peru ceded a 100-hectare hill area to
Ecuador. The area, know as Tiwintza, is of great symbolical
importance for Ecuador since its soldiers successfully defended it
against Peruvian forces during the 1995 war.
</P>
<P>
For its part, Ecuador pledged not to post any troops at
Tiwintza, eliminating the risk of another war. The territory will
be turned into an ecological reserve.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador and Peru fought three border wars over a 77-kilometer
section of their 1,600 kilometer-long border.
</P>
<P>
The last large-scale border war erupted in January 1995 and
lasted for nearly two months, resulting in 500 casualties and
causing 1.5 billion dollars of losses.
</P>
<P>
The two countries began their peace negotiations in 1995 to
re-establish a neighborly relationship based on trust and mutual
respect.
</P>
<P>
After years of slow peace talks, presidents of the two nations
met in August to work out the final details of the peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the treaty will have other benefits as both
countries will significantly decrease their military budgets.
</P>
<P>
Another gain for the two countries is a 500 million dollar loan
approved by the Interamerican Development Bank to develop their
border region.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Asian Economy: Rough Road to Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Currencies and stock markets in
Asia are rising, interest rates in the region are coming down, and
money managers are taking cautious steps back into Asia.
</P>
<P>
Are these hints of an economic recovery in Asia?
</P>
<P>
No doubt, these could be described as encouraging signs of a
recovery. At least, financial panic has subdued now and markets
are stabilizing. Asian currencies have been rebounding sharply
against the U.S. dollar recently.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the Indonesian rupiah and the Philippine peso
strengthened sharply against the dollar. The dollar was quoted at
7,425 rupiah at the close Monday, while the peso rose to 41.625
from 42.05 Friday, the highest level since Mid-July.
</P>
<P>
Over the past month, the Singapore dollar has appreciated
nearly 6 percent against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
Another hopeful sign is that interest rates in Asian countries
have fallen sharply. Inter-bank rates are as low as 7 percent in
Malaysia. Since July, South Korea's have fallen by 8 percentage
points to 8.6 percent, and Thailand's have tumbled from 22 percent
to 9.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The interest rate cuts will certainly help reduce borrowing
cost of companies and promote production in Asia, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
These positive developments in the Asian economy could be
largely attributed to a surprise U.S. interest rate cut, the
Japanese yen's abrupt surge and the dollar sales by hedge funds
which were forced to unwind positions as banks trim credit lines.
</P>
<P>
Economists said that if the dollar's fall is sustained, it
would reduce dollar debts in local currency terms, and a dear yen
would help those economies like South Korea's, which compete
head-on with Japanese producers.
</P>
<P>
However, the positive developments in the Asian economy do not
indicate that a recovery is already in sight. In fact, there are
still lots of obstacles to an early recovery.
</P>
<P>
In its "World Economic Outlook" released earlier this month,
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said that the downturn of
the Asian economy has accelerated far faster than expected, with
many of the regional economies in "deep recession."
</P>
<P>
The fall in Asian currencies in the past 17 months has failed
to spark a boom in export revenues, since not so many people in
Asia are buying and prices are falling, it said.
</P>
<P>
Falling interest rates have failed to ease the regionwide
credit crunch, in part because banks are busy disposing of bad
loans, and wary of new commitments, the IMF said.
</P>
<P>
Clyde Prestowiz, president of the U.S.-based Economic Strategy
Institute, said that unless Asian countries increase domestic
spending, there will not be enough demand for the region's
products because of weakening consumption around the world.
</P>
<P>
Even if the encouraging trend in the financial market will
continue, a huge collapse in gross domestic product this year
could hardly be prevented in some Asian countries, many economists
said.
</P>
<P>
The latest poll by the Economist magazine shows that output
will fall by 7-8 percent this year in Thailand and South Korea, 16
percent in Indonesia. GDP is also expected to fall in Singapore
and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Although IMF predicted earlier that most Asian economies will
bottom out in the first half of 1999, with growth resuming in the
second half, many things might blow this forecast off course, such
as a recession in America, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
At present, the most basic element which is affecting Asia's
recovery is the reduction in foreign investments. The five most
troubled East Asian economies -- South Korea, Thailand, Indonesia,
Malaysia, and the Philippines -- have experienced an estimated net
outflow of private capital of 25 billion dollars this year,
compared with a net inflow of 94 billion dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investments in Nine ASEAN countries have fallen by 33.6
percent since the Asian financial crisis erupted in July 1997,
according to ASEAN documents.
</P>
<P>
The huge non-performing debts of Asian banks is also hampering
the region's recovery. Deutsche Bank estimated that non-performing
loans amount to 35 percent or more of total bank lending in
Indonesia, Malaysia, South Korea and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Economic recovery is unlikely to get fully under way until
banks start lending again, economists said.
</P>
<P>
Another big obstacle to Asia's recovery is the massive burden
of both domestic and foreign debts. The East Asian nations'
foreign debts are, on average, equivalent to more than 70 percent
of GDP, even bigger than Latin America's foreign debts of 55
percent of GDP in its crisis in the early 1980s. At the meantime,
they also have huge burden of domestic debts.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that total debts amount to 200 percent of GDP
in Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and South Korea. Because of huge
debts, banks' non-performing loans may increase further, hampering
recovery in the region.
</P>
<P>
All these problems are hindering an early economic recovery in
Asia, and Asia's road toward a recovery will be very rough,
analysts said.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar to Expedite Completion of Special Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar leader Senior-General
Than Shwe called for expediting the completion of special projects
being implemented in the country to avoid increased expenses and
hindrance of national development.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of the country's Special Projects Implementation
Committee here Monday, Than Shwe, chairman of the State Peace and
Development Council, said these major projects require joint
efforts of ministries for the speedy completion instead of being
implemented by a single ministry concerned through conventional
methods.
</P>
<P>
Ministers attending the meeting disclosed that the government
has recently approved the proposed signing of contracts with
foreign companies on exploration and production of oil and gas in
Shwedaung and Padaung areas in Bago division, Rakhine and Mottama
offshore areas.
</P>
<P>
Programs of improving the waterways in four rivers of
Ayeyawaddy, Chindwin, Thanlwin and Sittoung for better transport
are being undertaken, they added.
</P>
<P>
The committee approved in 1994 numerous special projects to be
further carried out, which comprise 6 bridges, 12 dams and 11
other projects including expansion of the Thilawa Port in Yangon
and construction of Zawgyi Reservoir in Shan state.
</P>
<P>
Since late 1988, Myanmar has been implementing major projects
in the country in an effort to bring about infrastructural
development.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 27 (Xinhua) -- China's highest legislative
body has decided to fill the vacancy for one deputy from the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR).
</P>
<P>
The decision, which was announced today during the fifth
meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress (NPC), stipulates that unelected candidates in the
December 8, 1997 election for HKSAR deputies to the Ninth NPC
will fill vacancies in accordance with the number of votes they
received.
</P>
<P>
The HKSAR has elected 36 NPC deputies in accordance with
election rules adopted during the fifth session of the Eighth
NPC. The death of Deputy Liu Lit-for created a vacancy shortly
after the election.
</P>
<P>
An explanation from the NPC leadership pointed out that the
Presidium for the Conference for Electing HKSAR Deputies to the
Ninth NPC conducted a preliminary election involving 54
candidates. Thirty-six deputies were eventually elected.

<P>
SANTIAGO, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The Latin American sale of
state-owned companies grew by 6 percent during the July-September
period this year over the same period last year, Santiago's
Chamber of Commerce said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The downward trend registered by privatization in the first six
months of the year, with about 5 billion U.S. dollars in total
sales, ended after Brazil's telephone company sold for 18 billion

</P>
<P>
Latin American privatization amounted to 31 billion dollars

</P>
<P>
Brazil ranked the first among Latin American privatization with
89.1 percent of total sales, followed by Colombia with 3.4
percent, El Salvador with 2.8 percent, and Guatemala with 1.7
percent.

<HEADLINE> Ivan Slavkov, I Shall Stay Head of Football Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I have examined the relevant papers. The specific status of
the BOC allows me to head the football union and the Olympic
committee at the same time. I do not see any reason why I should
leave my positions," said Slavkov.
</P>
<P>
Slavkov, son-in-law of the late communist leader Todor
Zhivkov, is a longtime BOC chairman and has been at the head of
the football union for several years.
</P>
<P>
A lot of criticism has been leveled at him lately, last year
in particular, over the current state of Bulgarian football,
which many consider poor.
</P>
<P>
Slavkov was really surprised to hear Sofia Mayor Stefan
Sofiyanski say that after its congress, the BFU will have new
leadership.
</P>
<P>
"I'll have to find out what Sofiyansky meant. I do not know
why the mayor has such ideas," the BFU and BOC chief said.
</P>
<P>
"we examined carefully the statute of the German football
union and I believe we should copy some its clauses. I will put
to the vote at the BFU congress the clauses I liked," the BFU
president added and specified he had in mind the clauses
referring to the structure of the professional and the amateur
leagues as well the organization of the congress.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 27 (Xinhua) -- High-tech personnel from
Shanghai universities are playing an increasingly important role
in local industrial technological development.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation between enterprises and universities emerged in
1988 and has since strongly promoted technological development in
the city's industrial sector.
</P>
<P>
The city has carried out 260 key technological development
projects in recent years, with some 133 completed by local
universities and colleges.
</P>
<P>
Industrial enterprises in the city have established 43
technological development centers involving local universities and
research institutions.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Automobile Manufacturing Group, one of the first
enterprises to enter into related cooperative ventures, has
provided some 60 million yuan to construct 16 technology centers
since 1994.
</P>
<P>
Long-term steady cooperation between enterprises and
universities has provided leverage enabling parties involved to
share the advantageous use of resources.

<HEADLINE>   Mandela Praises WBC for Helping Building New South Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of the 36th WBC annual
convention in Johannesburg, Mandela said sport in general has
been making a important contribution to the building of the new
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The WBC, which was founded in 1963 and seen as the mainstay in
boxing, expelled South Africa in 1975 because of its apartheid
policies. The body readmitted the country in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, who was once an amateur boxer himself, said the
holding of the WBC convention in South Africa confirmed the
country's acceptance in the international sporting community.
</P>
<P>
He said he looked forward to the day when South Africa would
host its first WBC championship fight.
</P>
<P>
Mandela's words were seen as a call for the promoter of the
unification world heavyweight title match between Evander
Holyfield and Lennox lewis to bring the contest to the country.
</P>
<P>
WBC president Jose Sulaiman had already voiced his support for
South Africa to stage the bout between the World Boxing
Association (WBA champion and the WBC title holder.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Mandela criticized the proliferation of boxing
controlling bodies and said it was encouraging that the WBC and
the WBA, the world's oldest boxing bodies, are unifying their
rules.
</P>
<P>
"I have often wondered whether we will ever return to the days
when the term 'world champion' meant just that, and was not
dependent for its significance on what boxing controlling body
one is talking about," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela also called on the WBC to be vocal in the fight
against HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
WBC president Jose Sulaiman paid tribute to Mandela for what
he had done and honored him as the champion of the world human
equality.
</P>
<P>
Sulaiman presented Mandela with an award of human dignity and
a championship belt.

NBA Commissioner David Stern, union director Billy Hunter and

resume labor talks.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, the sides met for 3 1/2 hours to conclude a
contentious week that included arbitrator John Feerick's decision

It's learned the owners made several new proposals to the

The league's Board of Governors on Wednesday is expected to

toward settlement in front of possible 400 players.
</P>
<P>
The players voted unanimously last week to never accept a hard
salary cap which the owners are offering on the table.

The next meeting will be the seventh time between the sides

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 26 (Xinhua) -- China will receive a 28 million
U.S. dollar assistance from a U.N. body to develop agriculture in
its Guizhou and Hunan provinces as part of the efforts to ease
poverty in the widespread countryside.
</P>
<P>
An agreement for this was singed here Monday by the
U.N. International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD)
President Fawzi H. Al-Sutan and the Chinese representative to IFAD.
</P>
<P>
The aid will be used to fund half of a 107-million-dollar
agriculture project in a mountainous area lying along the border
of the provinces.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government and other international organizations
will cover the remaining cost of project.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the IFAD has allocated a total of 344 million
dollars in assistance to 14 projects in China.
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued Monday, the IFAD praised China for
its massive and effective nationwide anti-poverty campaign, which

<TEXT>
<P>
The Dutch striker is due to return to the City Ground on
Thursday and is expected to resume training with the Premiership
strugglers 24 hours later.
</P>
<P>
But manager Dave Bassett has made it clear that Van Hooijdonk
is returning against his wishes.
</P>
<P>
"In an ideal world this would not have happened," Bassett said.
</P>
<P>
"I was aware of a meeting that had taken place between Irving
Scholar and van Hooijdonk but I was sworn to secrecy.
</P>
<P>
"I have to be professional about it, but this was not a
football decision, it was a corporate decision.
</P>
<P>
"The club is the major factor. We have discussed the situation
at plc level and I will go along with the decision of the board.
</P>
<P>
"We are not going to sell him while he's at home in Holland,
so some form of action had to be taken. It was felt that this was
the best way of dealing with it, " he said.
</P>
<P>
Van Hooijdonk, who scored 34 goals when Forest won the First
Division title last season, has said he is prepared for a mixed
reception from his teammates after he went on strike, claiming
the club lacked ambition.
</P>
<P>
"I am ready for a bit of, what shall we call it, banter from
the players but I hope, after a meeting with them, that I can
explain and build bridges," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I hope I can also can recover the relationship I had with the
fans."
</P>
<P>
Van Hooijdonk, who will remain on the transfer list, could
make his return to action for Forest in a reserve encounter with
Birmingham at the City Ground next Tuesday.

Shanghai Mayor Xu Kuangdi.
</P>
<P>
Xu recently visited Fujian and said that economic cooperation

governments will engage in joint efforts to establish high-tech
industrial centers. A network system linking Shanghai with various
other provinces, including Fujian, is currently under construction.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has adopted a number of policies designed to attract
enterprise groups in order to help reorganize industrial assets
and promote transregional trade and cooperation, according to Xu.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai and Fujian offer unique advantages which will promote
agricultural modernization, according to Xu. For example, Fujian

<TEXT>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference Gascoigne, who spent 16 days in
rehabilitation clinic, insisted he had given up drinking and
added: "I'm feeling good. I'm looking forward to getting back on
the pitch."
</P>
<P>
It was the ex-England midfielder's first appearance in front
of the media since seeking hospital treatment for his ongoing
problems.
</P>
<P>
With Robson's help, Gascoigne decided to seek medical advice
for stress, depression and alcohol-related problems after a
catalogue of personal blows including his omission from Glenn
Hoddle's World Cup Finals squad, divorce from his wife Sheryl and
the death of a close friend.
</P>
<P>
Promising to deal with his problems, Gascoigne said he has
decided to stop drinking.
</P>
<P>
"I've had a lot of support," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't coping well and I decided it was in my best
interests to get away and sort everything out.
</P>
<P>
"It was everything not just the drink - depression, stress -
and the papers are always full of me and I just thought 'why'?
</P>
<P>
"But yes I will stop drinking. That's a decision I've decided
to make, " he added.
</P>
<P>
Sitting alongside Gascoigne, Robson said the troubled
midfielder had coped well with his treatment and it had been
decided that he could now return to the pitch.
</P>
<P>
"We felt it was better for Paul to get back to the club and
still get his treatment two or three times a week
</P>
<P>
"The medical team are happy with his progress but his
treatment will always remain ongoing.
</P>
<P>
"He's going to be under treatment as well as playing his
football," the manager said.
</P>
<P>
Robson, a long-time friend of the Gateshead-born player, had
previously avoided any prediction on a return date but Gascoigne
now looks set to start for the club in Sunday's clash against
Nottingham Forest.
</P>
<P>
Robson said: "I'll be watching Paul in the next few weeks. He
is training today (Monday) and though I've ruled him out of
Wednesday he is a possibility for Sunday."

<HEADLINE> Blatter Expects Professional English World Cup Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Blatter emphasized that any successful nation would have to
meet all the conditions set by FIFA for hosting the tournament --
listing stadium facilities, transportation, telecommunications,
security and hotels -- and only then could an African nation be
considered.
</P>
<P>
The 62-year-old president, who took the post last June at the
eve of the World Cup finals in France, made his second trip to
England in a month.
</P>
<P>
Blatter was in London to meet British prime minister Tony
Blair who aimed to push England's case for hosting the 2006 World
Cup.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting at Downing Street Blair and Sports Minister Tony
Banks told Blatter that England has the facilities,
communications and experience to host the game's biggest event.
</P>
<P>
Blatter said at a news conference after the meeting: "Nothing
has changed since I first became FIFA president in June. I think
that after the United States in 1994, France in 1998 and Asia in
2002, the logical choice for the 2006 World Cup should be Africa.
</P>
<P>
"But I know we will get a very strong, professional bid from
England, and it is not just me that makes the decision but the 24
members of the FIFA Executive."
</P>
<P>
Blatter also said that the "hooligan elements" that attach
themselves to the English team would not damage England's hopes.
This was a view welcomed by British Sports Minister Tony Banks,
who said that the Prime Minister had re-assured Mr. Blatter
legislation would soon be in place closing loop-holes that allow
known hooligans to follow England to matches around Europe.
</P>
<P>
England's campaign to stage the World Cup for the first time
since 1966 gained a boost earlier this month when FIFA brought
forward the deadline for bids to be submitted from September 1999
to July 1999 -- which could put extra pressure on some of the
other contenders.
</P>
<P>
Blatter confirmed that he expected bids from England, Germany
South Africa, Nigeria, Morocco, Egypt and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Alec McGivan, the director of the English campaign said on
Monday: "If you take South Africa as our strongest opponents,
there are a lot of conditions to be met and the big question is,
will South Africa meet those conditions in time ?
</P>
<P>
"The final bids must go in by next July and I imagine South
Africa has got a lot of work to do to meet those conditions. That
is an issue and a problem for them.
</P>
<P>
"We were at pains today to make it clear to the president of
FIFA that we are ready. We talked about the building of the new
Wembley but that is the last piece of our jigsaw and everything
else is in place for us to stage a great World Cup and I think
the FIFA president has recognized the strength of our position.
</P>
<P>
"I have no doubt at all that we are the strongest candidate in
what we can offer FIFA.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Blatter said to the Prime Minister today that what ma
tters is that FIFA has the best possible facilities for the World
Cup and I really don't think that we have anything to fear from
the opposition on that score."
</P>
<P>
FIFA inspection teams will visit the contenders next year and
a final decision will be made in March 2000.

five-micron NMOS transistor whose electrical characteristics
equaled those of a traditional wafer transistor.
</P>
<P>
NMOS, standing for N-channel MOS (metal oxide semiconductor --
one of the two categories of chip design), is a type of
microelectronic circuit used for logic and memory chips.
</P>
<P>
Required processes for fabricating the spherically-placed NMOS
transistor includes mask data generation and fabrication using the
five-micron design rule, atmospheric Chemical Vapor Deposition
(CVD), high-temperature oxidation at 1,250 degrees Celsius,
spherical resist-coating process, spherical lithography, etching
and probe-testing of the transistor, according to BALL.
</P>
<P>
The spherical lithography process allows the company to align
and expose six individual masks onto the sphere. The proven
resist-coating process requires the sphere not only drop down an
eight-meter tube through a "soap bubble" of coating material but
also dry within one second.
</P>
<P>
In July, the company announced that it succeeded in exposing
and developing a metal pattern of an integrated circuit on the
surface of a silicon sphere.
</P>
<P>
BALL said that its success proves the theory for placing a
transistor on a spherical surface. The silicon spheres could
reduce the cost of integrated circuit manufacturing by up to 90
percent through the use of hermetically sealed tubes in place of
clean rooms, and by reducing processing times to days instead of
months, the company said.
</P>
<P>
The company said that it is currently working to produce an
electrically functioning integrated circuit on the one-millimeter
sphere, inductance on the sphere and a pilot manufacturing line.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Draw More Loans From IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will draw more funds
from the IMF-brokered bail-out package, according to Deputy Prime
Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi.
</P>
<P>
Although the economy had improved, foreign reserves had
increased and the current account was showing a surplus, a request
would be made after talks with the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) next month reviewing Thailand's progress on economic
reforms, Supachai was quoted Tuesday by the Bangkok Post as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The stronger baht and higher share prices in recent weeks could
indicate stronger fundamentals for the Thai economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
More loans from the 17.2 billion U.S. dollar bail-out package
would be timely as interest rates were low and the repayment
period long.
</P>
<P>
"The restoration of investor confidence and stabilizing the
baht are still the utmost priorities," he said.
</P>
<P>
The package was aimed at helping the long-term stability of the
baht, he said. The baht's strengthening in recent weeks was
short-term, caused mainly by the weakness of the dollar.
</P>
<P>
Investors should be cautious about share price rises as they
were not firmly based, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is still too early to say the Thai economy is picking up.
We will be able to confirm whether we are turning around in next
year. However, the rise in share prices, more or less, has
improved the sentiment of stock investors," Supachai said.

<HEADLINE> Domestic Animals A Major Meat Source For Ancient Chinese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists have
discovered that the people of the Shang Dynasty (1600-1100 B.C.)
mainly ate domestic animals, which accounted for 93 percent of the
total number of animals at that time.
</P>
<P>
A group of young archaeologists at the Chinese Academy of
Social Sciences reached this conclusion after researching animal
bones unearthed at Huayuanzhuang Shang Dynasty (Yinxu) ruins.
</P>
<P>
They says that domestic animals accounted for less than 80
percent of the animals some 4,000 years earlier than the Yinxu
culture.
</P>
<P>
Animal remains unearthed at Huayuanzhuang include black carp,
chicken, voles, dogs, pigs, David's deer, oxen, buffalo, and sheep.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists have also discovered that pigs accounted for a
major part of these animals.
</P>
<P>
The Yinxu site is in the city of Anyang in Henan province,
where the earliest known Chinese characters inscribed on animal
bones were unearthed. They were first discovered in 1899.
</P>
<P>
Other valuable finds there include foundations of palaces and
temples, tombs, bronzes, jade carvings, and oracle bones.

<HEADLINE> Special Shoes For Bound-feet Women Now A Thing Of The Past </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Elderly Chinese women whose
feet were bound since childhood to keep them small have fewer
shoes to choose from in Harbin, the capital of northeast China's
Heilongjiang Province, because shoe factories no longer produce
them, according to a report of Wenhui Bao.
</P>
<P>
In the past, Chinese women's feet were bound with meters of
cloth to stop them from growing so that they would resemble a
"three-inch golden lotus" at a time when normal big feet were
considered alien to feudal virtues.
</P>
<P>
The practice originated in the palace of the last king of the
Latter Tang Dynasty (923-936 AD) and continued even when it was
banned by the Manchuria who established the Qing Dynasty
(1644-1911). In remote mountainous areas, women still had their
feet bound even when the New China was founded in 1949.
</P>
<P>
The last shoe factory to cease mass production of such shoes in
Harbin was the Zhiqiang Shoe Factory. It announced on October 20
that it will make the shoes only on a special-order basis.
</P>
<P>
The factory added small shoes for old women to its product
range in 1991 to fill a gap in the shoe market, which was
gluttered with high-heel shoes for normal feet.
</P>
<P>
In the first two years, more than 2,000 pairs of the shoes were
sold annually, but now the factory has to think of what to do with
the stockpile of tiny pointed shoes, which are not even suitable
for babies.
</P>
<P>
The head of the factory, Du Guanghua, says that he's already
preparing to stop making the shoes in the near future and that he
will donate his shoe trees to museums at that time.

<HEADLINE> Strong Quake Rocks Northeastern Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, October 26 (Xinhua) -- A strong earthquake
with a magnitude of 5.7 on the Richter scale rocked northeastern
Colombia Monday, but there were no immediate reports of injuries
or damage, seismologists said.
</P>
<P>
The quake, which struck the Cordillera Oriental Andean mountain
area at 4:55 p.m. (2155 GMT), was centered deep under the earth's
surface about 48 kilometers southeast of Bucaramanga city,
Santander Province, the National Seismological Institute said.
</P>
<P>
The tremor, which was felt in the capital and other major
cities, was powerful enough to cause serious damage in a populated
area. A quake measuring six or more on the Richter scale can cause
severe damage.
</P>
<P>
But the institute said the shock was not expected to be
destructive since its epicenter was nearly 100 miles underground.
</P>
<P>
The mountain area bordering Venezuela is a seismic area with
more than 20 temblors taking place there daily, it said.
</P>
<P>
The quake was also felt in the western Venezuelan state of
Tachira, which borders the Colombian department of Santander.
</P>
<P>
No casualties or damages were reported so far.

<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Electronic business is growing
in popularity in China, where 78.1 percent of the more than one
million Internet users want to shop on-line.
</P>
<P>
To meet this demand, cities like Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen,
and Xiamen have opened on-line homepages since the spring of 1996,
when the Xinhua Bookstore in Hangzhou, the capital of Zhejiang
province, started a website and China's first electronic business.
</P>
<P>
The address "www.hot100.com.cn:" of an on-line shopping outlet
started by the First General Merchandise Co. Ltd. of Xiamen, in
Fujian province, has proven the most successful.
</P>
<P>
Some 210,000 people have visited the website since the Xiamen
company opened it in September 1997, from Japan, Australia,
Singapore, Hong Kong and many other countries.
</P>
<P>
Che Wancheng, the company's general manager, said that
E-commerce has helped them increase sales, better understand
market trends, and has been a good publicity tool.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 factories in Xiamen have opened homepages using
the website address of Che's company.
</P>
<P>
Che predicted that by the end of this year, there will be some
100,000 people looking at his company's website address each month.
</P>
<P>
According to the International Data Corporation, 7.6 billion
U.S. dollars worth of goods were sold over the Internet globally
last year.

<HEADLINE> Italy Cuts Discount Rate to 4 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Italy Monday cut the
discount rate to 4 percent after weeks of pressure from
politicians and business leaders.
</P>
<P>
The cut, the first since the half-point cut on April 21, will
come into effect on Tuesday, the central bank announced.
</P>
<P>
It also said its lombard, or fixed-term advance rate, would be
cut on the same day from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The bank said it was cutting the rates because inflation
appeared firmly under control, demand remained week and tax
revenues were holding up despite recent reform.
</P>
<P>
The move is seen as a response to calls made by other central
banks in the future euro-zone to cut Italy's rates quickly to
converge with its partners in time for the launch of the single
currency.
</P>
<P>
Rates throughout the 11 founding members of the European Single
Currency have to reach the 3.3 percent basic rate operative in
France and Germany by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Italian Treasury Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi hailed the cut,
saying the new currency would help spur economic growth and that
the euro region has proven to be a haven of stability.
</P>
<P>
"The age of euro is about to begin," Ciampi said in a
statement. "Italy is part of it. On the single currency, we will
be able to build a more secure future of growth and work."

<HEADLINE> Consumer Credit Now Available in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Paying by instalments may have
been a common practice for a long time in many countries, but it
was not available in China until very recently.
</P>
<P>
China's commercial banks used to restrict their loans to
industries but they are now providing individuals with credit
services, allowing more Chinese to spend future income.
</P>
<P>
One female customer in Shanghai is among the first group of
credit users and has bought 13 household items, including a color
TV, an air-conditioner, a washing machine, a refrigerator and a
fax machine by paying instalments since 1993.
</P>
<P>
It benefits both her and society buying what she needs with a
credit card, she said.
</P>
<P>
More than 1.34 million households in 340 cities have got loans
for housing from the Construction Bank of China since it started
providing them at the end of the 1980s. It provided individuals
with a total of 15.9 billion yuan in housing loans last year.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, the bank began to experiment with automobile
loans in Beijing and Shanghai, and it was no more than the
announcement was made when 58 people in Shanghai asked for loans
at the local branch.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Enzhao, head of the bank's Shanghai Branch, said that
they are considering combined housing and automobile loans in the
near future.
</P>
<P>
A recent study in Shanghai found that over 68 percent of the
local people are ready to buy on credit. Another survey in five
cities in the first quarter of this year found that 58.2 percent
of the people think that consumer credit is necessary.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that consumer credit will greatly help stimulate
the home market because the country has a buyers' market after
leaving the period of commodity shortages.
</P>
<P>
"China needs a new upsurge of purchasing to help boost the
economy," said Ning Xiangdong, deputy director of the Economic
Research Center of Qinghua University.
</P>
<P>
Analysts admit that there are problems with credit services
now, as elaborate procedures, a narrow range of choice, and short
payment terms prevent credit from developing rapidly.
</P>
<P>
Ding Junfa, deputy director of the State Internal Trade Bureau,
said that the government places great importance on the views of
analysts and will take steps to expand credit in the years ahead.

"It is necessary for the central bank to carry out measures
that will protect our exports from the impact of a strong peso,"
the paper quoted a well-place source as saying.
</P>
<P>
The central bank is reportedly worried that if the peso should
go beyond the 38 mark to the greenback, the Philippine exports
will become more expensive and less attractive on international
markets, the source said.
</P>
<P>
The peso soared to 41.625 to the dollar at the close Monday
from last Friday's 42.05.

SHENZHEN, October 27 (Xinhua) -- A total of 7,848
foreign-funded companies in the city of Shenzhen, the first
special economic zone in south China, have made profits of 18.82
billion yuan so far this year, 3.8 times their losses.
</P>
<P>
A study of foreign-funded companies found that 1.1 percent of
them have stopped production temporarily and that most
money-losing companies are still at an investment stage.
</P>
<P>
The 7,848 companies have a combined investment of 28 billion
U.S. dollars, with overseas capital accounting for close to 12
billion dollars, or one percent more than what they had agreed to
invest.
</P>
<P>
However, some of the companies still have not met the

<HEADLINE> Peruvian, Ecuadoran Presidents Hail Peace Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The presidents of Peru and
Ecuador on Monday hailed a peace agreement they signed here ending
a long-standing border dispute.
</P>
<P>
By signing the pact, Presidents Alberto Fujimori of Peru and
Jamil Mahuad of Ecuador ended the half-century dispute over a
77-kilometer section of the Andean mountains.
</P>
<P>
The agreement "laid the cement of peace," said Fujimori.
</P>
<P>
"The Amazon could have been destroyed by a war. Now we preserve
it with a peace accord," Mahuad said.
</P>
<P>
The United States, Brazil, Argentina and Chile brokered the
treaty which draws the border along the Cordillera del Condor
range, as Peru wanted.
</P>
<P>
But it granted a hill within Peruvian territory to Ecuador. The
area, known as Tiwintza, is of great symbolic importance to Quito
because its troops successfully defended it againts the Peruvian
army in the 1995 war.
</P>
<P>
Peru and Ecuador both claimed the area, which was left
undefined after a 1941 border war.
</P>
<P>
The two countries fought wars over the strip of land in 1981
and 1995.

PRISTINA, Yugoslavia, October 26 (Xinhua) -- President of the
Temporary Executive Council of Kosovo Zoran Andjelkovic said here
on Monday the Albanian terrorists in Kosovo have been defeated by
now.
</P>
<P>
While meeting with European Parliament Deputy Speaker Bertal
Haardera, Andjelkovic said that ethnic Albanian terrorism in the
province had been defeated, which was a great encouragement to all
those who favored peaceful political dialogue as a means of
solving all problems, according to a statement issued by Kosovo
Information Secretariat,
</P>
<P>
He said the agreement reached between Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic and U.S. envoy to the Balkans Richard Holbrooke
on October 13 should be fully implemented.
</P>
<P>
Although police forces are reduced in Kosovo, the safety to all
citizens is guaranteed, said Andjelkovic.
</P>
<P>
He also said that a mission of the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), including all other missions in
Kosovo, was in the interest of peace and progress, which created
elements of safety, in a belief that all of this would contribute
to normal life in the province.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Haardera expressed interest in the humanitarian
aspect of the problem and ways for distributing relief aid
intended for the threatened and displaced persons.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the head of the Kosovo district, Veljko Odalovic,
also met on Monday with Haardera, the provincial information
secretariat said.
</P>
<P>
Odalovic set out that after the signing of the Agreement, the
Republic of Serbia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY)
are making huge efforts for its realization but, despite that, the
international community is pressuring our country, as confirmed by
the new U.N. Security Council Resolution which does not aim to
stabilize the situation in this region.
</P>
<P>
Odalovic stressed that all activities of the state are aimed at
the resolution of problems through peaceful means and a dialogue,
he added.
</P>
<P>
The ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova also held talks with
Haardera on Monday over the latest development of situation in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Ruguva said there should be an irreversible withdrawal of Serb
forces from Kosovo to create climate for a political settlement of
the Kosovo crisis, according to Albanian-run Kosovo Information
Center.

<HEADLINE> China Aims at More Foreign Investment: Vice Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 26 (Xinhua) -- China has taken a number of
measures to ensure better environment for foreign investment, Vice
Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) Long
Yongtu said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
China has increased allocations for basic infrastructure
construction to achieve the economic growth target of eight
percent this year, he said at a luncheon talk held by U.S. Foreign
Policy Association on the occasion of China-U.S. Investment and
Trade Symposium.
</P>
<P>
China is striving to keep its currency stable and to establish
a trade and investment legal system in line with the international
practice, he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in the capacity of China's Chief Representative for
Trade Negotiations, Long reiterated China's willingness to accede
to the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
The two-day Symposium started today.
</P>
<P>
Despite a decrease in foreign investment from Asia as a result
of the Asian financial crisis, China has attracted more foreign
investment this year, MOFTEC officials said.
</P>
<P>
MOFTEC statistics show that U.S. investment in China has grown
46 percent to 4.48 billion U.S. dollars in approved contractual
value for the first nine months of this year.

<HEADLINE> Survey: UK Most Attractive for Investment in Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Britain is Europe's most
attractive location for investment, according to a new government
survey.
</P>
<P>
Britain accounts for more than a third of global investment in
the European Union and some 40 percent of the total from the
United States and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Within Europe itself, cross-border investment in the U.K. far
exceeds that of any other country, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The findings from the government agency, Invest in Britain
Bureau, come as another report said 500,000 manufacturing jobs
will be cut in the U.K. over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
The survey, based on the Treasury model of the economy,
forecast that the overall jobless total will top the 2 million
mark by the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
This will mark a huge jump on the current level of 1.3 million,
the Ernst &AMP; Young-sponsored Item Club of independent forecasters
predicted.
</P>
<P>
But the report said Britain will narrowly avoid recession
despite the worldwide financial turmoil. The Item Club predicted
U.K. output growth will fall to just 0.5 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
But the stock market slowdown will put the brakes on consumer
spending and inflation, leading the Bank of England to drop
interest rates from their current 7.25 percent to 6 percent by the
end of next year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Item Club said the fall in stock markets since their highs
over the summer had already had a similar effect on curbing
inflation.
</P>
<P>
While the report predicted Britain will manage to avoid a
recession, it added that the downturn will be sharp enough to
threaten Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown's spending
plans.
</P>
<P>
If the global crisis causes world stock markets to slow by a
further 20 percent over the next three months, the Treasury's
income from taxes would drop sufficiently for Brown to be forced
to review his policies.
</P>
<P>
The report comes as the Confederation of British Industry
prepares to release its quarterly report into industrial trends,
which are expected to paint a pessimistic picture of the economy.
</P>
<P>
The Center for Economics and Business Research think-tank
warned of a "scaled-down version of the 1930s slump" if world
leaders fail to address the global economic problems.
</P>
<P>
The reports will all be pored over by Brown's advisers as they
go through the public accounts to produce his pre-Budget report
for 3 November.
</P>
<P>
It is expected to see growth forecasts for next year revised
down to 1 percent and will concentrate on the effect of the global
crisis on the economy.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Keep Pressure on Belgrade on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Monday Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic was moving forces out
of Kosovo but it was too early to tell if he is fully complying
with the U.N. demands.
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of movement of troops. There's some movement. We
haven't seen enough," said White House spokesman Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
Lockhart said the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
will meet on Tuesday and decide about the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin said that the U.S. would
continue its pressure on Belgrade for a full compliance by
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"It is our intention to keep the pressure on because we don't
want to be in a position where the movements become show movements
and then they're returned, or the change in practices of the
police are for show or to get past a certain deadline," said
Rubin.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic is under a Tuesday deadline for troop withdrawals
from Kosovo to comply with U.N. demands and avoid the threat of
NATO military action.
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to decide what each particular movement has been,
but I can certainly say the trend had been and has -- had been in
the right direction; that forces did leave, we identified specific
units that did leave, that left Kosovo. That wasn't show, that
was real," Rubin added.
</P>
<P>
Lockhart also said Milosevic had made some "real progress" on
Kosovo by letting in humanitarian agencies to care for the
refugees and agreeing to a timetable for autonomy negotiations
with the Albanians.
</P>
<P>
But he said the troop withdrawal remained a problem. The North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) ambassadors will meet on
Tuesday to make a final assessment about the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
"The situation on the ground is that there appears to be a lot
of movement but we're going to wait until the dust settles,"
Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
"But we want to make sure that that movement is real and it's
real withdrawal and not reconfiguration," said the spokesman.

<HEADLINE> Investment Gloom for UK's Car Industry without Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Britain's biggest car companies
have warned that future investment could be at risk if the country
does not join the single currency soon.
</P>
<P>
Nick Reilly, the chief executive of the US-owned Vauxhall
Motors, said that if there was "any indication we are not going to
get into Emu (European monetary union) sooner rather than later,
then that is going to affect future investment decisions."
</P>
<P>
He said that he personally wanted the government to accelerate
its efforts to ensure that economic conditions were right to allow
Britain to join.
</P>
<P>
"I think the sooner the better because investors looking at
Europe from the outside will see Britain as very much outside
Europe if we are not in Emu," he said.
</P>
<P>
Reilly also warned that conditions in the car industry were
going to get tougher, with over-capacity in Europe of around 20-25
percent.
</P>
<P>
"When you get that situation, you have got to expect mergers or
closures," he warned.
</P>
<P>
Ken Jackson, general secretary of the engineering union AEEU,
said that thousands of jobs could be at risk throughout the U.K.
car industry if it fails to join the single currency. He said
that Ford, Toyota, Nissan and Honda share Vauxhall's concerns.
</P>
<P>
"Major carmakers acknowledge Britain's decision to remain
outside the single currency's first wave will have serious
consequences for future UK operations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rover, which is owned by Germany's BMW, has blamed the high
pound and the U.K's decision to stay out of the single currency
for the recent problems at Longbridge.
</P>
<P>
A Rover spokesman said the company had always been a strong
advocate of the single currency "because we think there are big
benefits to be had."
</P>
<P>
U.K. businesses are deeply divided about entry into the single
currency. While large manufacturers are generally in favour, many
smaller businesses are more sceptical.
</P>
<P>
The Confederation of British Industry has said that its members
are in favour of joining the euro, while other industrialists have
set up an anti-euro pressure group led by Lord Marsh.

<HEADLINE> Top Irish Firms in Merger Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The Republic of Ireland's
largest life insurer Irish Life and leading mortgage bank Irish
Permanent have announced they are in merger talks.
</P>
<P>
If it goes ahead, the merger will be the country's largest at
2.4 billion punts (3.44 billion U.S. dollars) and create its third
biggest financial group after Allied Irish Banks and Bank of
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
"The boards of Irish Permanent and Irish Life announce that
preliminary discussions in respect of a possible merger have been
held recently," the companies said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The stock exchange in Dublin was closed for a public holiday,
but shares in both companies soared in London.
</P>
<P>
Irish Permanent shares closed up 72 1/2p at 882 1/2p after
hitting 885p at one point. Irish Life closed up 50p at 529 1/2p
after reaching 535p earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
The merged group would combine Irish Life's experience in
investments and life assurance with Irish Permanent's estimated 20
percent share of Ireland's mortgage market and its extensive
network of bank branches.
</P>
<P>
The combined group would employ more than 3,000 people and have
assets of around 15 billion punts. Irish Life would account for
two thirds of the group's capitalization.
</P>
<P>
The two companies are no longer just looking to their domestic
market, but are competing in the wider European market.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the deal would make strategic sense for both
companies as they need scale to be strong in both domestic and
European markets.
</P>
<P>
The news set the U.K. insurance sector alight which is seen as
ripe for consolidation. The sector finished higher on the day on
hopes of more merger or acquisition news to come.

<HEADLINE> 4,500 Serb Troops Out of Kosovo, Says Kosovo Serb Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRISTINA, Yugoslavia, October 26 (Xinhua) -- A total of 4,500
Serb troops pulled out of Kosovo Monday in compliance with U.N.
resolutions, a senior Serb leader in Kosovo said.
</P>
<P>
Zoran Andelkovic, prime minister of the Temporary Executive
Council of Kosovo, told Xinhua that the Serbian government has now
withdrawn all of its 15,000 troops sent into Kosovo in February to
crack down the ethnic Albanian rebellion.
</P>
<P>
"We have pulled out of all troops and police forces to put the
number to the level of February, and the move is in our own
initiative in line with an agreement reached between President
Slobodan Milosevic and the supreme commander of NATO, Wesley
Clark" Sunday, Andelkovic said.
</P>
<P>
After 18 hours of intensive talks, Milosevic assured Clark in
Belgrade Sunday that Yugoslavia will withdraw enough of its force
from Kosovo by a Tuesday NATO deadline to avoid possible air
strikes.
</P>
<P>
NATO threatened air strikes against Yugoslavia on October 13
unless all the additional Serb forces had been withdrawn from
Kosovo by October 17. It then extended the deadline until October
27 to give Yugoslav leaders more time to reduce their forces to
the level demanded by a U.N. resolution.

<HEADLINE> Tanjug Calls for International Help to Release Journalists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Tanjug, the Yugoslav news
agency, on Monday appealed to the international community to
press for the release of its two journalists kidnapped by ethnic
Ablanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The appeal came in a letter sent by Tanjug's director, Dusan
Djordjevic, to the heads of government of the Contact Group, the
rotating chairmen of the Organization for Security and Cooperation
in Europe and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
The two Tanjug reporters disappeared 10 days ago and KLA, the
armed groups of the ethnic Albanians, reportedly admitted that it
had detained the journalists.
</P>
<P>
Djordjevic said in his letter that the kidnapping is a brutal
assault on human rights and the journalistic career as well as a
severe blow to implementing the agreements on Kosovo that the
Yugoslav government reached with U.S. special envoy Richard
Holbrooke and with OSCE. enditem

<HEADLINE> U.N.: French Tests Find Possible Nerve Gas on Iraqi  Warheads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 26 (Xinhua) -- A new U.N. report said
Monday that French tests had found possible traces of nerve gas VX
on Iraqi warhead fragments.
</P>
<P>
The report was submitted to the United Nations Security Council
by 17 scientists from seven countries who analyzed the government
laboratories findings from the United States, France and
Switzerland on samples of Iraqi warhead fragments.
</P>
<P>
France, according to the report, found a "degradation product"
of a nerve agent in one sample, which could be VX, or other nerve
agents called Sarin and Soman.
</P>
<P>
But the report from the experts said tests from French and
Swiss laboratories and a second round of American tests all found
chemicals associated with a decontamination compound, suggesting
that an attempt had been at some point to remove traces of any
nerve gas.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. army laboratory said in June that it found traces of VX
on samples of Iraqi warhead fragments it analyzed. Iraq accused
the Untied States of faking the results and insisted that French
and Swiss laboratories test them. Samples from different areas of
a warhead dump in Iraq were then given to Swiss and French
government laboratories.
</P>
<P>
The report said tests from Switzerland proved negative as did a
second round of U.S. tests from other samples.
</P>
<P>
Its conclusions signified that Iraq probably had hidden
information on its ability to put VX into warheads and now had to
account for its past program so that U.N. inspectors could
determine if all the dangerous arms were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
The experts, called together by the United Nations Special
Commission in charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction, met at U.N. Headquarters Thursday and Friday.

<HEADLINE> UK Mnister: Europe Needs Structural Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 26 (Xinhua) -- A senior British minister Monday
stressed the importance of structural reforms as a way to solve
the economic problems for Europe, warning against "magical fixes."
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State for Trade and Industry Peter Mandelson,
addressing a business dinner in Liverpool, said, "Of course we
must take action to promote jobs and growth. But we must do so in
a sensible way and without sacrificing the benefits that Europe
has secured from prudent finances and stable levels of low
inflation."
</P>
<P>
The minister said Britain would remain a powerful voice urging
the EU to stick to the path of economic reform.
</P>
<P>
"No one believes that we can solve our problems by propping up
companies whose time has come or that there are magical short-term
macroeconomic fixes. Our long-term prosperity depends on
governments throughout Europe recognizing that structural reforms
matter," he said.
</P>
<P>
At a weekend informal summit in Poertschach, the first since
the election of a leftwing government in Germany, EU leaders
endorsed ambitious plans to boost demand and jobs.
</P>
<P>
British media generally see it as a swing back to the kind of
Keynsian pump-priming policies which Blair's government has always
criticized.
</P>
<P>
Also, the minister said that despite Britain's absence from the
launch of the single currency next year, "no one should doubt our
policy, we support the principle and will work to ensure the
euro's success."
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the euro would have a "dramatic and
galvanizing effect" and would leave no space for "high charges and
consumer rip-offs" and a big stimulus to competition.

<HEADLINE> UK to Make Significant Cuts in Gas Emissions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Britain is on course to make
significant cuts in its emissions of the gases that are causing
climate change, according to Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott.
</P>
<P>
Prescott, who is also Environment Secretary, was speaking at
the launch of a consultation paper designed to help the debate on
how Britons can live up to their obligations.
</P>
<P>
The legally binding target set at the Kyoto climate change
conference in December 1997 obliges Britain to cut its emissions of
the main greenhouse gases to 12.5 percent below their 1990 levels.
That target must be met by 2012 at the latest.
</P>
<P>
The British government also promised in its manifesto to reduce
emissions of the chief culprit, carbon dioxide (CO2), by 20
percent by 2010.
</P>
<P>
Prescott said the consultation paper showed the 2012 target was
"well within reach", and the manifesto commitment "achievable".
</P>
<P>
He said emissions were already 7 percent below their 1990
levels, although gross domestic product was 13 percent higher,
something for which he said the previous government deserved some
credit.
</P>
<P>
Warmer homes, better transport and more efficient companies
were some of the benefits the country would reap in reaching the
targets, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Energy efficient companies are more competitive", said the
deputy prime minister. "Better transport systems will be only good
for our economy, and our society."
</P>
<P>
However, he promised the government would not introduce
policies that would damage the country's competitiveness, or have
an unacceptable social cost.
</P>
<P>
One policy under consideration is an energy tax on industry and
business. This would probably be made fiscally neutral, by
cutting employers' national insurance contributions.
</P>
<P>
But the program outlined in the consultation paper will
require change, not only by industry and business, but by
transport and individuals as well.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T Reports Big Increase in Third-quarter Revenue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. largest
telecommunication company, AT&AMP;T Corp. Monday reported a 68 percent
rise in its third-quarter profit due to cost-cutting and stronger
revenue from wireless service.
</P>
<P>
The profit easily beaten the expectations of Wall Street
analysts. The increased sales offset a further drop in the
company's core long-distance business, which fell by 171 million
U.S. dollars to 5.81 billion U.S. dollars amid continued strong
competition from low-cost providers.
</P>
<P>
The telecommunication giant said that it earned 1.96 billion
U.S. dollars in the three months ended September 30. That was up
from a profit of 1.16 billion U.S. dollars a year ago.
</P>
<P>
AT&AMP;T cut its expenses by nearly nine percent in the quarter,
including a 14.5 percent reduction in overhead costs.
</P>
<P>
Its revenue from wireless services rose by 19.4 percent while
its revenue from business services including high-data services
went up by 4.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
AT&AMP;T Chairman C. Michael Armstrong told analysts Monday that he
was pleased with the results of the third quarter, but added,
"There's no question in my mind or any minds of the leadership we
still have further to go."
</P>
<P>
Armstrong has been on an aggressive drive to cut costs in part
to pay for expensive new investment. He enticed some 15,000
employees to retire so far this year, 10,000 in the third quarter
alone.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Lauds Ecuador-Peru Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, the Security Council and the 53rd
General Assembly session issued separate statements, extending a
warm welcome to an agreement signed by Ecuador and Peru to end
their long-standing border disputes.
</P>
<P>
A statement said that the secretary-general "warmly welcomes"
the agreement and "wishes to commend the Guarantor Countries of
the 1942 Rio Protocol for their invaluable role in achieving a
solution to this dispute."
</P>
<P>
The presidents of Ecuador and Peru on Monday morning signed an
agreement in Brasilia to end their long-standing border disputes.
</P>
<P>
The president of the Security Council for the month of October,
Jeremy Greenstock of the United Kingdom, issued a statement,
saying that "Security Council warmly welcomed the global and
definitive peace agreement between Ecuador and Peru, and the the
Brasilia Final Act which was signed today in Brasilia by the
presidents of Ecuador and Peru."
</P>
<P>
"This important event... constitutes a peaceful solution to the
border dispute between Peru and Ecuador," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Also on Monday, the spokesman for the president of the 53rd
General Assembly session, Didier Opertti, said in a statement that
"the president of the 53rd session would like to express his
satisfaction and joy on the agreement reached today between
Ecuador and Peru, giving a global and definitive solution to
territorial differences between those two countries."
</P>
<P>
The statement said that "Apart from the great importance of
this agreement for the cause of peace, not only in the region but
also in the global context, the (General Assembly) president
congratulates the Governments of Ecuador and Peru for the spirit
of dialogue and understanding."
</P>
<P>
The three separate statements all praised the four guarantor
countries, namely Argentina, Brazil, Chile and the United States,
for their efforts to help bring about a peaceful end to the border
dispute between the two neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
In January 1995, conflicts broke out in the border areas
between Ecuador and Peru. The two countries signed a truce pact in
March 1995, after the mediation by the four guarantor countries.
In January 1996, the foreign ministers of the two countries began
consultations on issues related to negotiations in Lima, Peru.

<HEADLINE> N.Irish Leaders in New Effort to Break Arms Deadlock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's First
Minister David Trimble launched a fresh initiative Monday to
break the deadlock over decommissioning which has hampered the
province's peace process.
</P>
<P>
Trimble, the head of Northern Ireland's main Protestant party,
and his Catholic nationalist deputy as first minister, Seamus
Mallon, invited all parties in the province's fledgling assembly
to hold intensive consultations to try to get over the stumbling
block.
</P>
<P>
Under the Good Friday agreement signed in April, October 31 was
penciled in as a psychologically important deadline, when Northern
Ireland's rival parties were due to have agreed on the composition
of a ministerial executive and on the scope of new bodies to forge
closer links between the British-ruled province and the Irish
Republic to the south.
</P>
<P>
But a row over the scrapping of guerrilla arms, or
"decommissioning," has delayed political progress and Mallon
acknowledged Monday that the October 31 deadline was likely to
slip.
</P>
<P>
"That is actually the price we're paying for the deadlock on
decommissioning. And it is a very high price," Reuters quoted
Mallon as telling the assembly.
</P>
<P>
"I feel a deep sense of frustration and I believe that
frustration is shared by all members of this assembly, especially
because people realize the enormous opportunity and potential that
exists at this present time," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Trimble, members of Sinn Fein cannot take their
seats on the new executive, which will administer vast swathes of
daily life in Northern Ireland, until the military wing of the
Irish Republican Army (IRA) has scrapped some of the weapons used
in the past against British rule.
</P>
<P>
But Sinn Fein says the Good Friday agreement sets no such
condition for joining the executive and Irish Prime Minister Berie
Ahern said at the weekend there was no prospect of any handover of
arms in the short term.
</P>
<P>
Northern Irish politicians and British ministers insist that
missing Saturday's deadline will not bring Northern Ireland back
to the brink of political crisis.
</P>
<P>
But they say the lesson of long efforts to bring peace to the
province is the need to maintain political momentum. As such, Mo
Mowlam, the British cabinet minister responsible for Northern
Ireland, welcomed the Trimble/Mallon initiative.
</P>
<P>
"It is vital that the Good Friday agreement keeps moving
forward on all fronts, including the identification of North-South
bodies and ministerial portfolios, as well as decommissioning,"
she said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"I hope these discussions will produce a consensus and I stand
ready, along with the prime minister and other ministers, to help
whenever and in whatever way I can," the Northern Ireland
secretary said.

<HEADLINE> European Food Retailers Challenge EU Price Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 26 (Xinhua) - European food retailers on Monday
challenged the need for an EU probe into differing farm gate and
retail price trends and denied they were pocketing price cuts.
</P>
<P>
British supermarkets, four of which are undergoing a local
anti-trust investigation, said they would comply with a proposed
European Union-level investigation, but denied shelf prices failed
to reflect lower farm gate prices, according to a Reuters report.
</P>
<P>
"It's clearly not true," Reuters quoted Asda Group Plc
spokesman Nick Agarwal as saying. "Whenever we can make savings we
pass them onto our customers."
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Marks &AMP; Spencer said "We would disagree that
we are profiting from (lower wholesale prices). That's not the
case."
</P>
<P>
EU officials said on Friday that Farm Commissioner Franz
Fischler had ordered a study into why consumers often failed to
benefit from falling farm prices. The investigation would focus on
the growing power of multinationals and their ability to set food
prices regardless of current market conditions.
</P>
<P>
"It is quite surprising that despite often quite dramatic
decreases in the price paid to the farmer for his product, the
consumer price in the shops remains virtually stable," Fischler
wrote in a letter to Consumer Affairs Commissioner Emma Bonino.
</P>
<P>
His words underlined fears that upcoming farm reforms, which
may slash EU guaranteed prices for cereals, beef and dairy
products, in favor of direct aid to farmers, could leave
consumers out of pocket unless lower farm prices are passed on.
</P>
<P>
Britain's National Farmers Union (NFU) said it would welcome an
EU probe into an issue that has rankled in relations with
retailers since the 1960s, before the dominance of supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
"We support this type of action," NFU Policy Director Ian
Gardiner was quoted by Reuters as saying. "We need more facts out
in the open so that we can start to lance some boils and throw out
some red herrings."
</P>
<P>
He said external pressures, such as lower demand from
economically-troubled Russia and a strong pound, exacerbated a
problem that had seemed less of a worry in better times, according
to Reuters.
</P>
<P>
French industry sources defended supermarkets, saying it was
hard to pass on savings with processed products as retailers had
less control over fixed costs. Retailers could be reluctant to
adjust prices too quickly when farm prices fluctuated as this
could send wrong signals to consumers, the source added.
</P>
<P>
Supermarkets declined to go into detail on their price tags for
pork, where live hog prices have plummeted to 25 year lows, but
said that price savings were passed on across the board.
</P>
<P>
"When you get much lower prices for farm products, you pass
them on because the market dictates it. That's competition and it
works very well here in Europe," Reuters quoted Hans Gobes,
spokesman for Dutch supermarket giant Ahold as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said pork prices in Dutch supermarkets were currently "the
best bargains you have ever seen".
</P>
<P>
Tesco Plc called Fischler's letter an "interesting development"
and maintained that it passed on any cost savings while rival Asda
said a 10 percent drop in the cost of lamb in the past year had
been passed on in full to the consumer.
</P>
<P>
In a statement this month, Safeway threw down the gauntlet to
critics, detailing the cost of buying, transporting, slaughtering,
processing and packaging its lambs.
</P>
<P>
"Safeway scotches rumors that it is profiting at farmers'
expense or ripping off customers by revealing the costs it pays,"
it said. "Depending on wastage levels at stores, the company makes
little or no net profit selling fresh lamb."
</P>
<P>
German firms were unruffled by the spectre of an EU probe. A
spokesman for market leader Edeka said fierce competition between
five dominant players meant profit margins were much tighter than
elsewhere in Europe, and dictated that lower prices be passed on
to consumers, according to Reuters.
</P>
<P>
Stiff competition between French retailers similarly guaranteed
falling farm prices would filter through to customers, a spokesman
for France's Promodes said.

<HEADLINE> No Breakthrough at Regional Meeting on Congo (K) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Sources attending the regional
meeting on Congo (K) crisis said here Monday night that there was
no breakthrough at the meeting and that disagreements remained on
how to reach a consensus.
</P>
<P>
Sources told Xinhua on condition of anonymity that since there
were different interested parties involved in the war, it was not
easy to find a solution in a short time.
</P>
<P>
Professor Wamba Dia Wamba, President of the rebel Congolese
Coalition for Democracy, predicted that the meeting was doomed to
fail since the rebels were denied direct negotiations with other
parties.
</P>
<P>
The crisis in Congo (K) was a political one, which could only
be resolved through direct negotiations between the government
and the rebels, Wamba noted.
</P>
<P>
He complained that his delegation was invited to come to
Lusaka but was denied the access to the meeting again like those
at previous meetings.
</P>
<P>
The ministerial meeting, which is the largest since the crisis
broke out in early August, attracted about 130 delegates
including foreign and defense ministers as well as senior
officials from at least 14 African countries.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations, the Organization of African Unity (OAU)
and the 14-member Southern African Development Community (SADC)
were also represented at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
It opened at noon Monday and was followed by a closed-door
meeting which lasted for five hours in the afternoon and early
evening.

<HEADLINE> UK's CJD Families Condemn Health Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Relatives of those who died from
the human form of "mad cow" disease (BSE) in Britain are calling
for better care for victims.
</P>
<P>
Members of 11 families have been telling the BSE inquiry how
their relatives died and why they felt let down by a health
service that knew little about the disease.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference, Dorothy Churchill, the mother of
a CJD victim said she thought the standard of health care seemed
"very patchy."
</P>
<P>
"I would say the vast amount (of families) have found
shortcomings in the care and understanding and that's what we have
to get right out for the future. There's going to be more
victims... but so far the system isn't working," BBC quoted the
mother as saying.
</P>
<P>
"It depends on your postcode whether you get good care for
human BSE," she said.
</P>
<P>
Mrs Churchill and her husband David set up the Human BSE
Support Group to offer advice and information to other victims'
families after the death of their 19-year-old son Stephen.
</P>
<P>
Mr Churchill said the family was kept in the dark about
Stephen's condition.
</P>
<P>
"The only clue that we received was when we saw our son's brain
biopsy operating notes and it had in the top right-hand corner
`reason for operation' and it had `CJD?'" he said, adding that
there was little information available at the time and they relied
on the media for details.
</P>
<P>
It emerged that several relatives had carried out their own
research in the quest for information.
</P>
<P>
Stephen's sister, Dr Helen Churchill, who was a dental student
when her brother fell ill, told the inquiry she had spent many
evenings in her college medical library researching neurological
disorders.
</P>
<P>
And Gerard Callaghan, whose brother Maurice died from nvCJD,
said that his family read up on neurological illnesses to find out
what was causing Maurice's rapid deterioration.
</P>
<P>
But at a news conference later he said he was satisfied with
the care his brother received. "Maybe we were lucky but it
shouldn't be a question of luck," he said.
</P>
<P>
Frances Hall, from Durham, was one of several distraught
relatives giving evidence. She talked about her son, Peter, who
died on 8 February 1996, just before his 21st birthday.
</P>
<P>
Peter, who had been a vegetarian since the age of 15, fell ill
shortly after he began a university degree. Mrs Hall said, "He
just appeared apathetic, he lost interest in his appearance,
before that he had been a bundle of energy."
</P>
<P>
At first, Peter's doctor diagnosed depression but his condition
continued to deteriorate and he was eventually taken into
hospital.
</P>
<P>
"It was obvious this was a serious condition, and that's when I
first asked about CJD," she said.
</P>
<P>
Mrs Hall added that she had stopped buying beef five years
before Peter's illness, when BSE in cattle first hit the
headlines.
</P>
<P>
The inquiry resumes Tuesday and will publish its final report
next June, according to BBC.

<HEADLINE> UK Army Closes Base in Northern Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 26 (Xinhua) -- A British military base in
Belfast will be demolished because of a reduced security risk from
terrorism in the province.
</P>
<P>
Royal Ulster Constabulary Chief Constable Ronnie Flanagan
announced on Monday that Whiterock Barracks in the centre of the
strongly republican area of West Belfast is being taken out of
service as security in the area is scaled back.
</P>
<P>
BBC quoted Flanagan as saying that the closure was part of an
ongoing security review across Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
"The security situation continues to be kept under close
scrutiny and further progress will depend on the operational
assessment of the terrorist threat," he said. "Our overriding
concern must be the safety of the public and the safety of police
and military personnel."
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam welcomed the closure and
said it was a symbol of the Good Friday peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
"It is further evidence of the commitment given in the Belfast
agreement to bring about a more normal security environment," she
said.
</P>
<P>
The decision has also been welcomed by the Irish Government as
a spur to the peace process. Foreign Minister David Andrews said
the closure was "an important development in normalizing the
situation in Belfast and elsewhere in Northern Ireland - in line
with the aims and objectives of the Good Friday Agreement".
</P>
<P>
The demolition of the base, known locally as Whiterock Fort, is
the next step that began with the removal of Army foot patrols
from heavily republican areas in Belfast and Londonderry.
</P>
<P>
Border security and airport checks have also been drastically
reduced.

<P>
LAGOS, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Foreign Minister
Ignatius Olisemeka called Monday for the establishment of a
permanent mechanism for crisis management in West Africa.
</P>
<P>
Olisemeka made the call at a meeting of foreign ministers of
the 16-member Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS),
which opened in Nigerian capital Abuja Monday, the Nigerian TV

The meeting, which was presided by Olisemeka, will prepare an
agenda for the forthcoming 21st summit of ECOWAS leaders
scheduled for October 30-31 in Abuja.
</P>
<P>
Top on the agenda of the summit will be the crisis in Guinea
Bissau, which broke out in June after sacked army general

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Says Even The Poorest Deserves The Basics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) issued a strong call on Monday for
global reaffirmation of the 20/20 initiative.
</P>
<P>
The initiative, whose goal is achievement of universal and
sustainable access to good quality basic social services, will
be the subject of an international meeting to be held in Hanoi,
Vietnam, on October 27-29, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Put forward in the early 1990s, 20/20 proposes a framework
for generating the resources needed to achieve the development
goals set by world summits and global conferences, including the
1990 World Summit for Children.
</P>
<P>
The Hanoi meeting is being co-sponsored by Norway and the
Netherlands and will be hosted by Vietnam. It will bring
together government representatives from more than 20 developing
and all donor nations and official from international organizations.
</P>
<P>
"The 20/20 initiative is based on the premise that universal
access to basic social services can be achieved by all countries,
even those with relatively low levels of per capita income,"
UNICEF Executive Director Carol Bellamy said.
</P>
<P>
"Millions of people are still deprived of their right to
basic social services," Bellamy stated. "For instance, an
estimated 40 percent of all children in developing countries,
many of them girls, fail to complete four years of primary
education, the minimum required to ensure lasting literacy."
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF chief added that the initiative's target of 20
percent is indicative, not prescriptive. "The share will vary
from country to country but, at the global level, the allocation
of about 20 percent of national budgets and 20 percent of
Official Development Assistance (ODA) is required to close the
gap between current spending and the minimum level necessary to
reach universality during the first decades of the 21st
century."
</P>
<P>
"The Hanoi meeting should make it clear that providing
universal and sustained access to basic social services is
essential to the development objectives of both developing and
donor countries," Bellamy said.
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line for the world's poorest children is that,
without renewed global commitment to the 20/20 initiative, their
chances of survival will be radically and, in all too many
cases, entirely diminished."

<HEADLINE> Arafat to Update Saudi Leaders on Peace Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National
Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat arrived in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia,
Monday to discuss with Saudi leaders the just-concluded
Palestinian-Israeli agreement.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian ambassador to Riyadh Mustafa Deeb told the Kuwait
News Agency that Arafat would also discuss with Saudi King Fahd
Ibn Abdul-Aziz the second phase of the Oslo agreement concerning
the establishment of an independent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Deeb said that Arafat would seek Saudi support for the
declaration of Palestinian statehood next May.
</P>
<P>
He said Arafat would also meet Saudi Crown Prince and First
Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz and other senior
officials.
</P>
<P>
Arafat signed in Washington last Friday with Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu an interim land-for-peace agreement
after nine days of talks mediated by the United States.
</P>
<P>
During a cabinet meeting earlier Monday, Saudi King Fahd
welcomed the agreement and hoped it would be a springboard for a
just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Arafat had already been to Egypt, Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia
in his shuttle tour in Arab states to update their leaders on the
new Palestinian-Israeli deal.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho Opposition Threatens to Withdraw from </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho opposition
parties Monday threatened to withdraw from the Southern African
Development Community-sponsored multi-party talks, accusing South
Africa of double standards.
</P>
<P>
The talks were designed to establish a structure to bring
political stability to the strife-torn mountain kingdom during an
18-month run-up to fresh elections.
</P>
<P>
"With the new developments in Lesotho, where South Africa is
changing its strategy and combing up our country instead of
keeping peace, we are wondering whether these talks will serve
our common interest," South African Press Association (SAPA)
quoted Lesotho opposition party alliance spokesman Vincent Malebo
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Malebo complained that the multi-party talks were being used
to keep Lesotho's opposition parties quiet while South Africa
extended its occupation of the country.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also claimed that detained Lesotho soldiers,
held on suspicion of mutiny, were being tortured and maltreated,
despite denial of these allegation on Friday by the Lesotho
military authority.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho has been in political crisis since August when
opposition parties claimed the May 23 election was rigged in
favor of the ruling Lesotho Congress for Democracy. Social
turmoil, including looting and arson occurred in early September.
</P>
<P>
At the invitation of the Lesotho government, South Africa and
Botswana imposed a military intervention in the kingdom in the
name of the SADC. By early October, the situation in the country
has stabilized, and the LCD and the opposition party alliance
started peace talks chaired by South African Safety and Security
Minister Sydney Mufamadi.
</P>
<P>
After two rounds of talks, Lesotho ruling and opposition
parties have in principle agreed to hold a fresh election within
18 months.
</P>
<P>
SAPA quoted an unidentified source as saying that Lesotho's
opposition alliance and the LCD had written letters to Mufamadi,
in which they had complained about problems experienced during
the talks.
</P>
<P>
Mufamadi, who is leading the SADC delegation in the
multi-party talks, confirmed Monday that he had received letters
from both sides. He declined to reveal and comment on the content
of the letters.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, arrangements were being made to find a
suitable date for all parties to meet.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 26 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela is due to visit Nigeria, and meet the country's
top leader General Abdulsalam Abubakar Thursday, the president's
office announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders will discuss regional and continental matters,
presidential aide Parks Mankahlana told the press, but he did not
give details.
</P>
<P>
In addition to his Nigerian tour, Mandela will also travel to
Namibia Wednesday to meet his Namibian counterpart Sam Nujoma as
part of his latest bid for a peaceful settlement to the crisis in
the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Namibia sent troops to back Congolese President Laurent Kabila
together with Zimbabwe, Angola and Chad. Kabila accuses Rwanda
and Uganda of invading to support the rebels and he and his
allies refuse to have direct talks with the rebels who occupy
vast territory in the east of the country.
</P>
<P>
Mandela favors settlement of the Congo (K) crisis through
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Business Day, a Johannesburg-based newspaper, reported Monday
that Mandela was also preparing to meet rebel leaders engaged in
a fight against President Kabila, as diplomatic efforts to find a
peaceful solution to the Congo conflict gear up.

<HEADLINE> EU Urges Yugoslavia to Comply With UN Resolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUXEMBOURG, October 26 (Xinhua) -- European Union foreign
ministers urged on Monday that Yugoslavia comply with United
Nations resolutions and allow refugees to return home to avoid a
humanitarian catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schussel told the press
after the day's foreign minister council meeting that a 10-point
action plan was worked out concerning the return of 10,000 to
20,000 refugees still remained in the open in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The EU foreign ministers agreed on a project home plan to offer
Kosovar refugees with immediate relief by providing shelter and
care in villages or places nearby.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers also agreed on prompt despatch of
international observers to ensure security for the return of
refugees through a 24-hour presence in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)
decided on Sunday to immediately deploy the 2,000-member
verification mission in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Schussel said that the European Union member states combined to
provide more than half of the man power of the OSCE-led
verification mission.
</P>
<P>
Britain and Germany each agreed to provide 200 verifiers while
Italy agreed to provide between 150 and 200 verifiers. France,
though not finalized, planned to also provide 150 to 200
verifiers.
</P>
<P>
Austria, the country now holding the rotating presidency of the
European Union, Denmark and Greece each agreed to provide 50
verifiers, followed by Portugal with 30 and Luxembourg with 12.
</P>
<P>
The EU urged reduction of Serb security forces in Kosovo and
appealed to all conflicting parties to avoid any provocation and
attempt at intimidation against the return of refugees.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation union announced that a total of 44 million ECU
(48.4 million U.S. dollars) will be made available by the end of
year for refugees wherever they are in the region.
</P>
<P>
The humanitarian fund will come from the union and EU member
states.
</P>
<P>
The council meeting declared full support for the agreements
signed in Belgrade between Yugoslavia and OSCE and between
Yugoslavia and NATO on two separate occasions.
</P>
<P>
The agreements were regarded as an important step toward a
political solution to the Kosovo crisis, Schussel said.
</P>
<P>
The EU foreign ministers welcomed the United Nations Security
Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1203 adopted on Saturday that demanded
full and immediate compliance by all parties concerned with the
agreements, unilateral commitments and UNSCRs 1160 and 1199.

<HEADLINE> Annan on Lusaka Meeting on Congo (K) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 26 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Monday said he "attaches the greatest importance to
the meeting of Foreign and Defense Ministers which opened on
Monday in Lusaka, Zambia, to discuss a cease-fire and a withdrawal
of foreign troops from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
A statement, issued by his spokesman's office here, said Annan
"is heartened by the continuation of efforts by African leaders
and regional organizations to bring about a peaceful settlement of
the conflict in the DRC."
</P>
<P>
The statement said, "He wishes, in particular, to reiterate his
full support for the crucial role played by the Secretary-General
of the Organization of African Unity in the discussions leading to
the Lusaka meeting."
</P>
<P>
Annan, the statement said, urges the parties to the conflict
"to show the maturity, will and statesmanship needed to reach a
compromise for an immediate ceasefire and an early withdrawal of
troops."
</P>
<P>
The Lusaka meeting "gives them a unique opportunity to
demonstrate to the world their concern for the well-being of the
Congolese people and their commitment to the restoration of
peace," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General calls yet again on all those in a
position of authority in the DRC to put an end to incitements to
ethnic violence and to hate propaganda, and to state publicly
their condemnation of such incitements," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
On October 22, Jeremy Greenstock, president of the U.N.
Security Council, reaffirmed to the press here that "ending the
cycle of human rights violations and the culture of impunity is a
necessary element for any lasting settlement of the crisis in the
region."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Secretary-General is represented in Lusaka by Ibrahima
Fall, U.N. assistant secretary-General for political affairs,
whose delegation includes Berhanu Dinka, Annan's representative
for the Great Lakes Region and regional humanitarian adviser, and
two military advisers.
</P>
<P>
The two military advisers are expected to advise on the
technical aspects of a ceasefire and withdrawal of troops, as they
did at the September 10-12 meeting in Addis Ababa, capital of
Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Conflicts broke out in August this year after the Tutsi-led
armed factions rose up in eastern Congo (K) to topple the
government of President Laurent Kabila. Angola, Namibia and Zambia
sent troops into Congo (K) to help President Kabila fight again
rebels.
</P>
<P>
With the widening of the crisis, there are growing concerns
that more and more African countries will be drawn into the
conflict, making the regional crisis a continental one.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations, under the leadership of Annan who is the
first U.N. Secretary-General from black Africa, has given much
attention and energy to end conflicts and promote peaceful
solutions in Africa.

LUXEMBOURG, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The European Union described
on Monday the peace deal between Israel and Palestine as a
demonstration of courage and sense of responsibility by Benjamin
Netanyahu and Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of EU member states agreed during their

But a sustained political commitment is needed from all parties
concerned, added the foreign ministers, as well as the
determination to resist extremists and others wanting to frustrate
progress toward peace.
</P>
<P>
The EU foreign ministers reiterated the union's firm commitment
to a just and comprehensive settlement in the Middle East based on

<HEADLINE> U.N. Court Tough on Genocide Criminal's Hunger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The International Court
of Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) said Monday it will not be
intimidated or blackmailed by the hunger strike of the former
Rwandan mayor who was convicted of genocide.
</P>
<P>
Jean-Paul Akayesu, former mayor of Taba, 45, has been on
hunger strike for five days protesting against denial of his
right to the lawyer of his choice by the administration of the
United Nations court.
</P>
<P>
Akayesu was sentenced earlier this month to life imprisonment
for his role in the 1994 genocide, in which more than 500,000
people were massacred in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
"The ICTR will not be persuaded or blackmailed by Mr. Akayesu
by going on a hunger strike," acting spokesman of the court
Kingsley Moghalu said in north Tanzania's Arusha town, where the
court is based.
</P>
<P>
However, Moghalu said Akayesu is free to have a lawyer of his
choice if he is prepared to finance his defense counsel.
</P>
<P>
"We have absolutely no objections in that case if Mr. Akayesu
is prepared to finance his lawyer," he said, adding that the
court has its laid-down rules and procedures to operate.
</P>
<P>
He told Xinhua over telephone that the court has already spent
5,000 U.S. Dollars on Akayesu's defense lawyers.
</P>
<P>
He further added that the court has always respected the
rights of the accused persons "but within the framework of a U.N.
system and its established courts."
</P>
<P>
The court has given Akayesu maximum medical attention, Moghalu
said. "Of course he will not die..."
</P>
<P>
The acting spokesman, however, said he has no idea when
Akayesu will end his hunger strike.
</P>
<P>
Prison sources said Akayesu was not taking any food, but was
profusely smoking and has access to newspapers and radio.
</P>
<P>
Before his pre-sentence hearing, Akayesu dismissed his lawyers
and spoke in his own defense. Judges at the court confirmed at
the time that new lawyers would handle his appeal.
</P>
<P>
Akayesu has since indicated his desire to be represented by a
Canadian lawyer John Philpot. But the administration at the ICTR
responded that Philpot did not have the required credentials to
work at the court.
</P>
<P>
In addition, an assistant of the registry disclosed that
countries such as Canada should not be over represented among the
defense lawyers.
</P>
<P>
Akayesu said that the court has 41 lawyers for the accused,
and more than seven of them are Canadians.

<HEADLINE> UK Trade Deficit Deteriorates In September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Britain's export sector
deteriorated further in September when the trade deficit with
non-EU countries widened to a record 3.2 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The volume of exports fell by 6.5 percent, to its lowest
monthly level since December 1996, according to the latest figures
by the Office of National Statistics.
</P>
<P>
The merchandise trade gap was much larger than expected,
compared to the 16 billion U.S. dollars in the previous month.
</P>
<P>
BBC quoted Michael Dicks of Lehman Brothers Monday as saying
that "The bad news is probably more important in the sense the
markets are looking for it."
</P>
<P>
However, as far as global figures are concerned, the UK's trade
deficit for August was better than expected at 40 billion U.S.
dollars, compared to a deficit of 64 billion U.S. dollars in July.
</P>
<P>
Economists in the City said, that was because of a fall in
imports, which may be related to the slowdown in the UK economy.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Adopts Resolution on Sanction Against Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. General
Assembly on Monday adopted a Libyan-sponsored resolution, calling
for the immediate repeal of laws that unilaterally impose
sanctions on companies and nationals of other countries.
</P>
<P>
Eighty countries voted in favor, with only the United States
and Israel voting against. But an unusually large number of 67
delegations abstained from the voting on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, similar to one that the assembly adopted in
1996 by 56 to four, with 76 abstentions, "reiterates its call for
the immediate repeal of unilateral extraterritorial laws that
impose sanctions on corporations and nationals of other states.
</P>
<P>
Although the resolution did not mention the United States by
name, it is directed against such U.S. legislation as the 1996
Iran-Libya Sanctions Act which punishes foreign firms investing in
energy projects in those two countries, on the grounds that they
support terrorism.
</P>
<P>
It also urges all states "not to recognize or apply
extraterritorial coercive economic measures or legislative
enactments" unilaterally imposed by any state.
</P>
<P>
The resolution reaffirms the "inalienable right of every state
to seek economic and social development and to choose the
political, economic and social system" that it deems the most
appropriate for the welfare of its people.

<HEADLINE> Chivukuvuku Re-Elected UNITA MP Group Head </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Abel Chivukuvuku regained his
position as chairman of the UNITA parliament member (MP) group at
the Angolan National Assembly Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chivukuvuku won 49 of the 53 votes at the meeting for the
chairmanship of the group representing the National Union for
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), the biggest opposition
party in the country in parliament.
</P>
<P>
His main rival was Armado Pedro Jorge Caetano.
</P>
<P>
Chivukuvuku was elected as chairman of the UNITA MP group to
National Assembly for the first time on April 9, 1997. He had
resigned from the position on September 9 this year after there
appeared "UNITA Renovation Committee", a breakaway group from the
opposition party.
</P>
<P>
UNITA Renovation Committee appointed Eugenio Manuvakula, the
former secretary general of UNITA to be the new chairman of the
UNITA MP group to the National Assembly soon after its
establishment in early September.
</P>
<P>
But after the first national congress this month, many
parliament members of the UNITA Renovation Committee deemed it
"illegal" to have Manuvakula, who is not even a parliament
member, to be the MP group head. They insisted that a new
chairman be elected to take his place.
</P>
<P>
UNITA, which won 34.1 percent of the votes in the 1992
elections, has 70 seats in the 220-seat National Assembly. The 70
UNITA MPs swore in in April last year.

<HEADLINE> Fatigued Yeltsin to Have Two-Week Vacation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 26 (Xinhua) -- President Boris Yeltsin, who was
suffering irregular blood pressure and fatigue, will start a
two-week holiday probably Wednesday, a senior aide said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin "is not ill enough to be considered disabled," Oleg
Sysuyev, first deputy chief of the presidential administration,
said in a television interview. "A two-week vacation won't do him
harm," he said.
</P>
<P>
Presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin announced earlier
Monday that Yeltsin has canceled a planned trip to Austria and
that Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov will go to Vienna to attend
the EU-Russian summit.
</P>
<P>
Primakov is scheduled to visit Yeltsin early Tuesday before
leaving for Austria, which holds the rotating EU presidency.
</P>
<P>
Sysuyev told the Hero of the Day program on independent NTV
that Yeltsin should relax and distract himself "from the problems
he will have to deal with after he rests."
</P>
<P>
Also Monday, commenting on the cancellation of the Austria
trip, Grigory Yavlinsky, the leader of the Yabloko movement, said
Primakov is effectively acting as Russia's vice president.
</P>
<P>
"Primakov is a seasoned diplomat. It is natural that he is
going to Vienna (in place of Yeltsin)," Yavlinsky told the
Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
Russia should not expect radical changes at the high levels of
power in the near future, Yavlinsky said.
</P>
<P>
"Everything depends on what Primakov is going to do. If he
effectively continues to perform the president's functions, the
situation will remain unchanged for a long time," Yavlinsky said.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, 67, suffered from a cold and bronchitis earlier this
month, forcing him to cut short a visit to Kazakhstan by one day.
</P>
<P>
He suffered two heart attacks in 1996 in the wake of the June
16 presidential election and had quintuple heart bypass surgery in
November that year.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Yakushkin told reporters that Yeltsin had recovered
from the cold and his health was good for a man of his age.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's perceived poor health has prompted many rumors about
his ability to serve out his full term till 2000.
</P>
<P>
Brushing aside his doctors' advice, Yeltsin went ahead with
meetings at the Kremlin with senior aides several times in the
past two weeks, in an attempt to show the world that he was still
fit.
</P>
<P>
Yakushkin told reporters Monday that "recent bronchitis
combined with violations of doctors' prescriptions and overwork
resulted in the development of an asthenia condition" which
manifested itself in "unstable blood pressure and undue fatigue."
</P>
<P>
As Russian television broadcast footage of Yeltsin nearly
losing his footing at a ceremony during a recent trip to
Uzbekistan, his political opponents and other presidential
hopefuls renewed their questions on Yeltsin's fitness to serve as
head of state and supreme commander of the Russian armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Even Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, formerly a staunch supporter of
Yeltsin and a strong contender for the presidency, joined the
chorus, saying Yeltsin should step down for health reasons.
</P>
<P>
Such talk was hurtful to Yeltsin, his spokesman said last
Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone is talking about the president's health," he said. "I
think the president feels hurt when the people he has been working
with and is still working with are discussing the subject."
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin "has set very strict standards for himself," Yakushkin
said. "He has a clear goal, which is to complete his presidential
term and leave in 2000."
</P>
<P>
The president "is evidently strong and willing to fight against
any type of illness," said Yakushkin.
</P>
<P>
"That is why he keeps traveling despite objections from his
doctors," the spokesman added.

<HEADLINE> Interpol Endorses Egypt's Proposal on Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The International Criminal Police
Organization (Interpol) Monday endorsed an Egyptian proposal
calling for increased cooperation in fighting terrorism, Egypt's
Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In the Cairo Declaration Against Terrorism adopted in its 67th
General Assembly, which opened Thursday, the Interpol affirmed
full support for Egypt's proposal on holding an international
conference under the United Nations on combating terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The declaration accentuated the importance of implementing
international action to strengthen police and judicial cooperation
against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Obstacles should be eliminated to the extradition of fugitive
terrorists, to the sharing of information essential to criminal
investigation and to terrorism prevention measures, it said.
</P>
<P>
The declaration urged all the Interpol members to prevent their
territories from being used for the "preparation, perpetration, or
financing of acts of terrorism endangering the peace and security
of other countries."
</P>
<P>
Egypt has suffered serious terrorist attacks by Islamic
extremists, who have sought to topple its secular government and
replace it with strict Islamic rule since 1992. More than 1,200
people have been killed in the insurrection.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has accused some countries of sheltering terrorists
masterminding violence on its soil.

<HEADLINE> Overheated Brake Causes June Plane Crash: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Overheated brakes could have
caused a fire in a plane accident last June, killing all 11 people
on board at Mirable airport in Montreal, an official report said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Examination of the wreckage revealed extensive pre-crash fire
damage to the Propair plane's left wheel well," according to a
report from the Transportation Safety Board of Canada, which
investigated the crash.
</P>
<P>
"Overheated left brake assemblies could have provided an
ignition source for a wheel well fire," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Fairchild Metroliner plane, which was carrying nine
passengers and two crew, was flying from Dorval airport in
Montreal to Peterborough in Ontario.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after it took off from Dorval, the pilot tried to make
an emergency landing at nearby Mirabel. The plane exploded and
crashed just short of the runway.
</P>
<P>
"There have been numerous service difficulty reports of
overheated brakes on Metroliners equipped with the same brake
assemblies as those on the Propair plane," the board said.
</P>
<P>
"Seven reports made specific reference to fires or the burning
of tires or aircraft components and systems. In addition, there
have been two occurrences where overheated brakes on Metroliners
have caused major airborne fires," it noted.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday survived an attempt to unseat his
government after he signed a breakthrough peace deal with the
Palestinians last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Knesset (parliament) defeated a no-confidence motion in the
government tabled by the far-right party Moledet, by a vote of
21-8.
</P>
<P>
Most of the Knesset members did not participate in the voting.
</P>
<P>
A no-confidence motion needs the support of at least 61
members of the 120-seat Knesset to topple the government.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Labor party, which occupies 34 seats in the
Knesset, said on Sunday that it would refrain from voting
no-confidence in the government over the next two weeks in a bid
not to hurt the implementation of the new agreement.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, supported by more than 70 percent of Israelis in
a public opinion poll, will be presented to the Israeli cabinet
later this week. And the Knesset is due to vote on it at the end
of a two-day debate starting next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Labor, which favored making peace with the Palestinians, had
promised to form a "safe net" in the Knesset if Netanyahu
unblocked the Mideast peace stalemate.
</P>
<P>
But Labor will continue its effort to bring down the right-wing
Likud coalition government and expressed its support to a bill
calling for dismissing the Knesset and holding early elections
within 100 days.
</P>
<P>
The bill, also supported by some hardliners of the coalition
government, was passed on Monday in the Knesset's Law Committee.
</P>
<P>
Hanan Porat, chairman of the committee, said that the first
reading of the bill in the Knesset plenum could be held within two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
According to Israeli law, the early elections bill needs to be
approved in three readings before it becomes law and needs to be
backed by an absolute majority of the 120 legislators.
</P>
<P>
After nine-day marathon talks in the United States, Israel and
the Palestinians signed a peace agreement, under which Israel is
to withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank over a 12-week
period, in return for the fulfillment of Palestinian commitment to
fight terrorism.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council on Monday lauded the successful holding of September
elections in Bosnia and Herzegovina "as another important step in
the peace process," and asked the newly-elected leaders to "work
for a strengthened and united Bosnia and Herzegovina."
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the press here, the president of the
15-member Security Council, Jeremy Greenstock of the United
Kingdom, said that the council members "stressed that all
newly-elected leaders are expected to act in accordance with
constitutional principles and the Peace Agreement, and to work for
a strengthened and united Bosnia and Herzegovina."
</P>
<P>
"Members of the council underlined the need for an overall
solution of problems related to refugee returns and reiterated the
importance of full respect for the rights of refugees and
displaced persons to return to their homes in safety," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council "attached particular importance to the
progress in restructuring the police throughout Bosnia and
Herzegovina, and, as part of that, to the reinforcement of a
highly effective U.N. police presence there," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The council members "urged all authorities in Bosnia and
Herzegovina and in both its Entities to make further progress in
fulfilling their obligations under the Peace Agreement, including
full cooperation with the International Tribunal for the former
Yugoslavia, said the statement.

<HEADLINE> WB Denies Poor States Pay More in Debt Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The World bank has denied that
Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPCs) pay more in debt service
than they receive in aid flows.
</P>
<P>
It said the ratio of gross inflows (from long-term debt and
grant) to debt service paid averaged 2:1 for the HIPCs during the
1990s and ranged upward 4:1 in half of these countries.
</P>
<P>
This was contained in a World Bank report on HIPC Initiative
which is an agreement among official creditors designed to help
the poorest, most heavily indebted countries escape from
unsustainable debt, a special story reaching here from Ghanaian
News Agency (GNA) said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The HIPC initiative is also to enable poor countries to focus
their energies on building policy and institutional foundation
for sustainable development and poverty reduction.
</P>
<P>
The report said annual net transfers to the HIPCs on medium
and long-term resource flows, including grants, have averaged 10
percent of GNP (Gross National Product) over the 1990-96 period.
</P>
<P>
Countries which fall under the HIPC label are those which,
among other things, are eligible for assistance only from the
World Bank's International Development Association (IDA), face an
unsustainable debt situation even after the full application of
traditional debt relief mechanisms and have established a track
record of good performance in implementing economic and social
reforms.
</P>
<P>
As at the end of last month, two years after the approval of
the initiative, decisions had been taken on debt relief for seven
countries - Bolivia, Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Guyana, Mali,
Mozambique and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The report said the total amount of debt relief committed to
these countries amounts to more than three billion U.S. Dollars
in present value at the completion point.
</P>
<P>
In nominal terms, the amount is over six billion Dollars of
debt service relief.
</P>
<P>
It said the Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) for Benin and
Senegal confirmed that debt relief through existing mechanisms
was sufficient for them to attain a sustainable debt position.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary consideration is expected to be given to
Ethiopia soon while DSAs are underway for Togo and Mauritania.
That of Guinea-Bissau has been delayed because of the civil war.
</P>
<P>
The report said a number of countries, including Chad,
Guinea,Nicaragua, Niger, Tanzania and Vietnam, could possibly
reach their decision point in 1999.

<HEADLINE> First Sea Channel Linking UAE, Iraq to Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The first sea lane between
the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Iraq since the 1991 Gulf War
will open to navigation early November.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here Monday from Dubai quoted Director General
of the Dubai Ports Sultan Bin-Salim as saying that the line links
UAE's Dubai port and Iraq's Umm-Alkasr.
</P>
<P>
Bin-Salim said the Dubai Ports Administration submitted a
request to the U.N. in September, 1997, for opening the
500-nautical-mile sea lane and the U.N. approved the request
later.
</P>
<P>
A weekly liner will set sail from Dubai for Umm-Alkasr every
Saturday and returns on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The start of liners aims to facilitate cargo and passenger
transport, taking into consideration the U.N.-Iraqi oil-for-food
deal, which allows Iraq to sell limited amount of oil to buy food
and medicine.
</P>
<P>
The luggage of the passengers will be confined to the items
that the U.N. allows access to Iraq, Bin-Salim said.

<HEADLINE> Tennessee Governor Voices Support for Slain Senator's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Republican Governor Don
Sundquist of Tennessee of the United States Monday announced his
support to the the write-in candidacy of the widow of slain
Democratic state Senator Tommy Burks.
</P>
<P>
Sundquist had distanced himself from Byron (Low Tax) Looper,
Burks' Republican opponent who was arrested Friday and charged
with shooting the lawmaker. But he was attacked by Democrats
during the weekend for not combining that with an endorsement of
Charlotte Burks.
</P>
<P>
Sundquist said Monday he had been reluctant to discuss the race
out of sensitivity for the Burks family, according to an
Associated Press report.
</P>
<P>
"Mrs. Burks is a fine person who has suffered an
incomprehensible loss, which should not be exploited for political
purposes," he said in a statement. "And although I won't be
actively involved in her race, she has my support, I wish her well
and I look forward to working with her."
</P>
<P>
Burks' body was found on October 19 in his pickup truck on his
farm in Monterey in central Tennessee. He had been shot once in
the head.
</P>
<P>
Burks' name will be stripped from the ballot. However,
Democrats cannot name another candidate because his death occurred
within 30 days of the election. The name of Looper, who legally
changed his middle name to (Low Tax), will remain on the ballot
because he hasn't been convicted of a felony.
</P>
<P>
Democratic gubernatorial nominee John Jay Hooker criticized
Sundquist "for letting partisanship get in the way of good common
sense." He urged the governor to endorse Mrs. Burks.
</P>
<P>
The Republican Party is two seats away from regaining control
of the state Senate.
</P>
<P>
Looper, 34, already faces a trial in December on charges of
theft and misusing his office as Putnam County assessor. He also
was being sued for 1.2 million dollars by a former girlfriend who
claims he forced her to have sex, fathered a child and stole
ownership of her home.
</P>
<P>
If Looper were elected, senators would likely refuse to seat
him and a special election would be held for the seat, Republican
state Senator Ben Atchley said. County officials would appoint an
interim senator until the election could be held.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Existing Home Sales Continue to Slow Down in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. nationwide house
sales continued to slow down in September, the National
Association of Realtors reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Nationally, sales of existing single-family homes fell for the
second consecutive month in September, to a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 4.68 million, after hitting a record 4.91 million
rate in July, according to the association.
</P>
<P>
American consumers' confidence in the economy fell in September
for the third consecutive month, according to the Conference
Board, a New York-based private research group.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believed though mortgage rates remain affordable,
below 7 percent, the increased volatility in rates in recent weeks
has put some would-be buyers off.
</P>
<P>
During one week earlier this month, First Union's rate on a
30-year, fixed-rate loan with no points jumped from 6.625 percent
on Monday to 7.25 percent on Friday, adding roughly 100 dollars to
a monthly payment on a 150,000 dollar mortgage.
</P>
<P>
The rate's since slipped back to 6.75 percent but borrowers
remain wary.
</P>
<P>
New home sales, after selling at a record seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 922,000 in June, fell in both July and August.
Construction starts of new homes and apartments, meanwhile,
declined in both August and September.
</P>
<P>
Some economists believed that even with the drop-off, this year
will be an unbelievable record year, while 1999 is forecast as a
very good year for sales, but it will not be as good as 1998.
</P>
<P>
And housing construction won't serve as one of the economy's
stellar engines of growth, as it has this year, according to a
panel of 36 forecasters assembled by the National Association for
Business Economics.
</P>
<P>
Residential construction soared at a 15 percent annual rate
during the first half of this year, accounting for one in every
six dollars added to the nation's gross domestic product. But
housing construction next year, according to the forecasters, will
advance at a lackluster 1.5 percent annual rate.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Reports Serb Troop Movements in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The United States said
Monday Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic was moving forces out
of Kosovo but it was too early to tell if he was fully complying
with the U.N. demands.
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of movement of troops. There's some movement. We
haven't seen enough," said White House spokesman Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
Lockhart said Milosevic had made some "real progress" on Kosovo
by letting in humanitarian agencies to care for the refugees and
agreeing to a timetable for autonomy negotiations with the
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
But he said the troop withdrawal remained a problem. The North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) ambassadors will meet Tuesday
to make a final assessment about the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
"The situation on the ground is that there appears to be a lot
of movement but we're going to wait until the dust settles,"
Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
"But we want to make sure that that movement is real and it's
real withdrawal and not reconfiguration," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic is under a Tuesday deadline for troop withdrawals
from Kosovo to comply with U.N. demands and avoid the threat of
NATO military action.

<HEADLINE> PC Sells Well in U.S. and Worldwide in 3rd Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Strong growth was
registered in the U.S. and Western European PC markets in the
third quarter despite weakness in global economies, according to a
report released Monday by an American market analysis firm.
</P>
<P>
Worldwide, PC shipments rose 15 percent over the quarter a year
ago and 13 percent sequentially, said International Data
Corporation (IDC). A total of 22.6 million PCs were shipped during
the quarter.
</P>
<P>
Total U.S. PC vendor shipments, which exclude sales by original
equipment manufacturers, grew 14 percent over the last year, with
9.52 million units. Western Europe also reported strong growth
based on a growing low cost PC market and a strong economy. But
economic woes in Russian and the Southeast Asian markets countered
the strong Western European growth. A positive growth rate in the
Japanese market showed signs of a revival in consumer demand, said
IDC.
</P>
<P>
Among the U.S. computer makers, Compaq retained its number one
position, with 1.5 million shipments and a market share of 15.8
percent. Dell, number two, maintained its high-flying growth with
1.34 million units shipped in the U.S., up 65 percent from a year
ago.

<HEADLINE> European Stock Markets Close Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 26 (Xinhua) -- European stock markets generally
closed higher but off their best levels Monday.
</P>
<P>
In London, shares ended the day showing modest gains after a
volatile session which saw the FTSE see-sawing up and down. The
FTSE 100 Index of top shares finished up 14.4 at 5,231.5, but at
one stage during the morning it was showing a hefty 111.9 point
gain at 5,329.
</P>
<P>
A flurry of deals kicked the morning off briskly, although a
mixed set of official figures showed the trade deficit with
countries outside the European Union was worse than expected last
month.
</P>
<P>
However, trade within Europe was far more healthy than
expected, leaving dealers split over the figures' significance for
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Weekend talk of cuts in European interest rates led to an
improvement in continental markets, which gave some buoyancy to
the London market.
</P>
<P>
An early charge by banks and insurance groups was replaced by a
surge in telecoms stocks after several brokers gave them a mention
in morning briefings.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, German shares slipped from session highs after a
lackluster start to trade on Wall Street. The Xetra Dax closed
99.21 points higher at 4,579.64.
</P>
<P>
Some traders said that continuing rate cut speculation and a
spate of short-covering kept the market well supported. Car stocks
were up generally on recent analyst recommendations.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, shares consolidated the morning's advance after
sentiment was boosted by renewed hopes of cuts in core European
interest rates. The Cac 40 index finished 55.72 points higher at
3,449.48.
</P>
<P>
"Pressure is clearly heightening on European central banks to
cut their interest rates in the wake of the Poertschach meeting,"
said Denis de Ambrogi, a trader at BNP Equities brokerage house.
</P>
<P>
At an informal summit in the Austrian town of Poertschach
Saturday, leaders of the 15 European Union states signaled they
would favor an easing monetary policy.

<P>
LONDON, October 26 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair met world soccer governing body FIFA President Sepp Blatter
on Monday to push England's 2006 World Cup bid.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting at Downing Street Blair and Sports Minister Tony
Banks told Blatter, who took the post last June at the eve of the
World Cup finals in France, that England had the facilities,
communications and experience to host the game's biggest event.
</P>
<P>
Banks said the hour-long meeting had gone "extraordinarily
well".
</P>
<P>
Blatter said at a press conference after the meeting that he
expected England to present a strong and professional bid to host
the 2006 finals.
</P>
<P>
But he also insisted that South Africa would be the logical
choice after tournaments in the USA in 1994, in Europe in 1998 and
the forthcoming Asian World Cup in 2002.
