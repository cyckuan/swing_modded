WASHINGTON, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times
</P>
<P>
-- Attorney General Janet Reno has opened a formal inquiry into
whether President Clinton illegally solicited campaign
contributions in telephone calls from the White House last year.
</P>
<P>
The action is a potential turning point in the sprawling
campaign finance inquiry surrounding his re-election campaign, a
step that could lead to the appointment of an independent
prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
-- An account of the voyage of a gray-bearded Italian Jewish
sailor named Jacob places him in China four years before Marco
Polo arrived. If the document is to be believed, it provides
extraordinary images of a civilization that was the most dazzling
in the world, describing everything from mass-circulation
pornography to an early flame thrower.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post
</P>
<P>
-- A bipartisan advisory commission will urge Congress to
reform the nation's system for admitting immigrants to give
priority to close family members who have been separated for years
because of growing waits for visas.
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. decision not to sign the treaty on land mines ban is
being described by White House and Pentagon officials as an
indication the once-rocky relationship between the president and
military leaders has, on many key issues, been transformed into a
dependable working partnership.

<HEADLINE> EMU Will Start on Time: Santer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 21 (Xinhua) -- A single European currency
will start on time with or without Britain, the European
Commission President Jacques Santer said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on Britain's Sky Television, Santer said that he is
quite confident the convergence criteria of Maastricht will be
reached on time and the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU)
will start operation on time on January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
+We now have real convergence of our economic policies, we have
now very low interest rates, so at this moment there is real
stability,+ he said.
</P>
<P>
Santer, who had just visited Scotland last week, said that
British membership in EMU would be welcomed, as the EU wants
Britain to be at its heart.
</P>
<P>
UK Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said last Friday that the UK
was unlikely to join EMU in 1999, but would find it hard to stay
out if it proved successful.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Taliban Forces Claim Recapture of Border Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Forces opposing the Afghan
Islamic Taliban militia today claimed that they had recaptured the
key border town of Hairatan, which separates Afghanistan from its
Central Asian neighbor Uzbekistan.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban fighters, who entered Hairatan early Thursday, had
been pushed out of the dusty town center by the anti-Taliban
alliance forces, said Afghan sources in Peshawar, northwestern
Pakistan, without giving details on when the counterattack took
place.
</P>
<P>
However, Taliban sources in Peshawar denied the claim but
admitted that the hardline student militia had suffered heavy
losses in repulsing the alliance's offensive.
</P>
<P>
Hairatan, situated 60 kilometers north of Mazar-e-Sharif,
stronghold of the alliance, is a key town on the Uzbekistan border
and located on the banks of the Amu Darya (Oxus River).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the United Nations and the Red Cross have evacuated
more than 50 foreign aid workers from the embattled
Mazar-e-Sharif, 300 kilometers north of Kabul, capital of
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The foreigners had been trapped in Mazar-e-Sharif since the
Taliban, who control two-thirds of Afghan territory and the
capital of Kabul, launched a strong attack on the city early this
month.
</P>
<P>
According to U.N. officials, the U.N. offices in Mazar-e-Sharif
were looted by gun-toting youths and losses were estimated at
millions of U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban, who have vowed to impose a strict Islamic rule in
the war-torn country, briefly controlled Mazar-e-Sharif, but were
forced to retreat later.
</P>
<P>
The anti-Taliban alliance, which comprises forces led by Uzbek
warlord Abdul Malik, Afghanistan's former military chief Ahmad
Masood and the Shiite Hezb-e-Wadhat, has been battling the Islamic
militia in several fronts in northern, central and western
Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> Arab Foreign Ministers Doubtful Over Regional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Arab foreign ministers are
sceptical over the success of a regional economic summit scheduled
for November in Doha, Qatar, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
said today.
</P>
<P>
After their three-day Arab League (AL) council meeting, the
foreign ministers failed to reached a single stand towards the
Middle East and North Africa summit which has been criticized for
Israeli attendance.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's Middle East News Agency quoted Moussa as saying that
"if the Israeli government does not change its policies (towards
peace), I think that prospects for the success of the conference
would be slim."
</P>
<P>
The Doha summit was not mentioned in a final statement issued
after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, the foreign ministers strongly condemned
Israeli "ferocious" settlement activities in Arab Jerusalem and
the rest of the occupied Arab territories.
</P>
<P>
They underlined the need of boosting the peace process and
continuing it on the basis of U.N. resolutions concerned, the
land-for-peace principle and the right of the Palestinians for
self determination.
</P>
<P>
They urged the international community, particularly the United
States and Russia, the co-sponsors of the Mideast peace and the
European Union to press Israel in honoring its peace promises.
</P>
<P>
Welcoming U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's visit to
the region earlier this month, the final statement described as
"constructive position" her policy on Mideast peace.
</P>
<P>
But the foreign ministers condemned U.S. Congress resolution
passed in June to recognize Jerusalem a capital of Israel, a city
also claimed by Palestinians as the capital of their future
state. They also denounced another U.S. Congress decision to move
the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Owner Denies Selling Ras Amud House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 21 (Xinhua) -- A Palestinian owner of
one of the two disputed buildings occupied by Jews in East
Jerusalem's Ras Amud Arab neighborhood today denied selling it
to American billionaire Irving Moscowitz.
</P>
<P>
Fuad Hadieh, who returned from Romania Saturday, said he had
never sold the house to Moscowitz and he had documents to prove
his claim.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by Palestinian National Authority (PNA) Minister of
Islamic Waqf Hassan Tahboub, Jerusalem's Mufti Ikramah Sabri and
others, Hadieh tried to enter the main building, but they were
prevented by Israeli police who clubbed them.
</P>
<P>
When 15 Jewish settlers took over the two buildings in Ras
Amud last Sunday, they claimed that the Palestinians living
there were paid to evacuate the houses. Moscowitz said he also
intended to build 70 housing units in Ras Amud to create a
Jewish settlement.
</P>
<P>
In his comments, Hadieh said the documents possessed by the
settlers were forged because he had never signed anything to
sell the house.
</P>
<P>
Upon the police's advice, Hadieh is considering petitioning
to Israel's High Court of Justice to retake the house. He would
be likely to file the petition Monday.
</P>
<P>
The takeover of the two buildings in East Jerusalem has
sparked strong protests from the Palestinian side and Arab
countries which warned against the collapse of the peace process
if the settlers would remain there.
</P>
<P>
Under a compromise agreement reached between representatives
of the government and settlers aimed at calming the situation,
the settlers evacuated the houses Thursday night to be
replaced by religious Jews who will open a seminar there.
</P>
<P>
The PNA has denounced the deal as a "trick" aimed at
maintaining the Jewish presence in the disputed Arab East
Jerusalem occupied by Israel since the 1967 war.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinian and Israeli peace activists continued
their daily protests near the site which was under the watchful
eyes of a large presence of Israeli police. The joint peace
movement Peace Now has set up a protest tent near the disputed
houses, demanding the small group of fanatic Jews evacuate the
Arab neighborhood to save the peace process.

<HEADLINE> Iran Confiscates 2 Dutch Vessels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Iran announced here today
that two Dutch vessels were confiscated by the Iranian security
guards at Iman Khomeini port last week.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Madad, head of the Ports and Shipping Organization,
said that his country took the action because the Dutch vessels
violated international regulations.
</P>
<P>
He said that after a Croatian cargo ship sank in Iran's
territorial waters, the Smit Tug Company of the Netherlands was
given the responsibility of pulling the ship out of the sea.
</P>
<P>
Madad said that any movement of the Dutch vessels should have
been with full knowledge and authorization of Iranian
authorities.
</P>
<P>
On August 19, the two Dutch vessels abandoned the mission and
headed for another part of the sea to pull out the debris of a
U.S. helicopter crashed in Iran's territorial waters.
</P>
<P>
Madad said his organization filed a complaint with Iran's
Judiciary against the Smit Tug Company and the judicial officials
issued a warrant for confiscation of the two vessels.
</P>
<P>
He added that the crew of the tugboats would be allowed to
contact their families immediately after completion of the legal
process.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Peter C. Fit, special envoy of Dutch Foreign
Ministry, was quoted by the official news agency IRNA as saying
that the Smit Tug Company had not any malicious intentions
against Iran.
</P>
<P>
Fit offered compensation for the damage the Iranian shipping
organization incurred and expressed the hope that the problem
would be resolved soon.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Should Build its Own Defense Industry: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Turkey should double efforts
to speed up building its own defense industry, Defense Minister
Ismet Sezgin said today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the press in Istanbul, the largest city in Turkey,
Sezgin said that the past lessons demand Turkey should have its
own defense industry, the semi-official Anatolia News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that the allied countries had reduced their
military support to Turkey in recent years due to different
disputes with Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Turkey was greatly angered when the United States suspended
last year the delivery of three frigates ordered by the Turkish
Navy, under strong pressure from anti-Turkish lobbies.
</P>
<P>
Sezgin, also deputy prime minister, emphasized that this
urged Turkey to speed up building its own defense industry in an
effort to enhance its defense capacity in the future.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Industry Support Fund and the Defense Industry
Undersecretariat had been founded just for this purpose, he
said.
</P>
<P>
On the Third International Defense Industry and Civil Aviation
Fair to be held here on September 23-26, Sezgin said that this
will strengthen the exchanges between Turkish and foreign
companies in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, a regional military power, has to import nearly 80
percent of its arms from Western countries to meet the demands
of the Turkish Armed Force, according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Defense experts hold that Turkey, which owns the second
largest force in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, should
raise the proportion of the home-made weapons in its military
equipment by expanding financial input for the domestic defense
industry.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Four staff members of Al Khanka
Hospital here were detained today for investigations of the escape
from the hospital of a man who carried out a fatal attack on a
tourist bus here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Attorney General of the Higher State Security
Prosecution Hisham Saraya issued the order today that Nessim Abdel
Malak Nessim, director for psychological and nerve diseases and
Sayed Ahmed Al Qot, director of psychological health, and two male
nursing attendants be taken into custody for 15 days.
</P>
<P>
The four people were charged with accepting cash bribes from
the attacker and aiding his escape from the hospital, Egypt's
Middle East News Agency (MENA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Saber Mohamed Farahat reportedly escaped from the hospital
three days before launching his attack, killing nine German
tourists and the Egyptian driver and wounding at least 24 people,
including seven Germans.
</P>
<P>
Farahat was one of the two suspects detained at the scene of
the attack.
</P>
<P>
MENA said the Prosecution will question Farahat's mother about
the circumstances surrounding his life, his behavior towards his
family members and neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak issued an order to
transfer the supervision of the five Hospitals of Khanka,
Abbassia, Heliopolis, Helwan and Alexandria for Psychological and
mental diseases from local administrations to the Ministry of

<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The Sudanese government and
and the third largest rebel faction of the southern Sudanese rebel
movement have reached a peace agreement, the Sudan news agency
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached with the People's Liberation Movement
of the Sudan (United Faction) led by Lam Akol, in the town of
Fashuda, southern Sudanese Upper Nile Province, Saturday after
three days of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The agreement ensures the legal status of the Akol faction
during the four-year transition period which will begin as soon as
the constitutional organs in southern Sudan are formed, according
to the official Sudanese newspaper "Al Akhbar" today.
</P>
<P>
Such agreements were also reached with four or five other rebel
factions. They stipulate the right of each faction in southern
Sudan to express its views and prepare for the plebiscite which is
due to take place by the end of the transition period on unity or
secession.
</P>
<P>
Returning to Khartoum today, the head of the Sudanese
government delegation Dayak Mashar who is also the chairman of the
Coordination Council of the Southern States, has disclosed that
Akol will visit Khartoum in a week's time.
</P>
<P>
The Akol faction which belongs to the Shuluk tribe ranks third
in the rebel movement as far as member numbers are concerned.
</P>
<P>
The second place is that of Rayak Mashar faction which belongs
to the Nouer tribe. The John Garang faction of the Dinka tribe
ranks first and is in fact the principal one in southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The Garang movement has persistently refused to negotiate with
the Sudanese government, but it has recently announced its
intention to joint a peace meeting due to convene in Nairobi
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is to be attended by the region's foreign
ministers, to pursue the efforts to end the civil war in southern
Sudan which erupted in 1983 over the ethnic and religious issues
between the north and the south in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese government has welcomed the participation of the
Akol group in the peace process. Speaking to newsmen upon his
return to Khartoum, Ali Haj Mohamed, Sudanese Minister of Federal
Agency and member of the government negotiating team, hailed the
agreement with Akol, attributing the success to the mediation
efforts of the Shuluk tribe spiritual leader between the
government and Akol parties.
</P>
<P>
Akol had joined the Garang-led People's Liberation Movement of
the Sudan in 1986, but seceded in the early 90s on account of
differences with Garang. He then formed the "United Faction".
</P>
<P>
Several months ago, he announced his alliance with Abdul Aziz
Khalid, leader of the northern Sudanese armed opposition. Later
he issued a unilateral declaration proclaiming ceasefire against
the Sudanese government armed forces.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Vows to Block Delivery of Missiles to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Turkish top military officer
said here today that Turkey will use all necessary means to block
the transfer of Russian-made missiles to the Cypriot government.
</P>
<P>
"We will evaluate the issue politically, militarily and
internationally. We will do what our interest requires." Ismial
Hakki Karadayi, Chief of General Staff of the Turkish Armed
Forces, told the press at the Ankara airport upon returning from
visits to Belgium, Canada and the United States.
</P>
<P>
He said the missiles have constituted a serious threat to
Turkey's state interests and that Turkey will not remain
indifferent to it.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus signed with Russia an agreement in January to buy
hundreds of anti-aircraft missiles.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish government repeatedly accused the Cypriot
government of endangering its state interests by buying the
missiles. But Cyprus argued that the missiles are for defense,
not directed against any country.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus was divided into two communities of Greek Cypriot and
Turkish Cypriot in 1974 when Turkey landed its troops on the
eastern Mediterranean Sea and took over the northern third
following a failed coup by Greek Cypriots seeking union with
Greece.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared in 1983 a breakaway "Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus" which is recognized only by Turkey.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 22 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan today expressed optimism about the overall state of the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 52nd session of the General Assembly, the U.N.
chief said, "The past year's progress includes the adoption of the
agenda for development, expressing a new consensus to guide our
activities in this critically important field."
</P>
<P>
It included major achievements in disarmament, particularly the
Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, the Chemical Weapons
Convention, and the Ottawa process to ban anti-personnel
landmines, he added.
</P>
<P>
In the area of peacekeeping, Annan said, "Significant movement
is taking place among a group of countries towards forming a
standby high readiness brigade within the framework of the United
Nations."
</P>
<P>
"Responding to ever-more frequent requests from member states,
we have expanded our programs in support of good governance,
democratization and strengthening national capacity to promote
human rights," said the secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging the disappointments, Annan said, "The benefits of
economic globalization remain too concentrated to profit the vast
majority of developing countries, enen as official development
assistance continues to decline."
</P>
<P>
"The achievements in disarmaments do not yet encompass the
remaining nuclear stockpiles. Nor have they combined the
proliferation of light weapons and small arms," said Annan.
</P>
<P>
"In a growing number of conflicts, civilian population have
become the explicit targets of factional combatants, and
humanitarian missions have been impeded," added Annan.
</P>
<P>
Annan stressed that violence against women had become the most
pervasive human rights violation, respecting no distinction of
geography, culture or wealth.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Secretary-General of
the United Nations Kofi Annan today called on U.N. member states
to make the U.N. General Assembly a "reform assembly."
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 52nd session of the General Assembly here this
morning, he urged member states to "move expeditiously to consider
the package of reforms" that he put forth on July 16.
</P>
<P>
The package gives priority to U.N. institutional
simplification, personnel cutdown and development assistance.
</P>
<P>
Annan said his reform scheme is to meet U.N. objectives "by
promoting at all times the particular needs of the most
disadvantaged societies through the creation of the U.N.
Development Group, a new Office of Development Financing, a new
system of multi-year pledges for development cooperation."
</P>
<P>
He said his reform proposal also includes the strengthening of
the role of the Economic and Social Council, especially in the
area of the macroeconomic policy dialogue.
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes that member states will reach political
consensus before this session ends in mid-December and start
implementation of the reform measures soon after.
</P>
<P>
He also called on them to pay their U.N. assessments "in full,
on time and without condition."

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Kazakhstan, China to Upgrade Friendly Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA-ATA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Since they established
diplomatic ties in 1992, relations between China and Kazakhstan
have developed steadily on the basis of their traditional
friendship, thus greatly promoting their cooperation in politics,
economy and culture.
</P>
<P>
China and Kazakhstan have exchanged frequent high-level visits
and agreed that their relations geared toward the 21st century
should be developed on the basis of mutual respect for sovereignty
and territorial integrity and non-interference in each other's
internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan is now expecting the second visit to the country by
Chinese Premier Li Peng which will further upgrade their bilateral
ties.
</P>
<P>
Li first visited Kazakhstan in 1994 and signed an agreement on
the Sino-Kazakh border. Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev paid
visits to China in 1993 and 1995, which led to joint statements on
strengthening and deepening friendly relations between China and
Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, China offered Kazakhstan nuclear security guarantee,
which was considered by the Kazakh side the most powerful proof of
Sino-Kazakh friendship.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also contributed to an agreement on the
reduction of military forces along their border in April 1997 and
an agreement on strengthening trust in the military field in April
1996, by China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
In July 1996, Chinese President Jiang Zemin's successful visit
to Kazakhstan opened a new page in Sino-Kazakh relations geared
toward the 21st century. The presidents of the two nations issued
a joint declaration, reaffirming the importance of improving
bilateral ties based on the five principles of peaceful
co-existence.
</P>
<P>
China and Kazakhstan, which share more than
1,700-kilometer-long common border, are highly complementary in
their economies and have great potential in economic and trade
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In June, China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) obtained
60 percent shares of Aktobemunajgaz, a major Kazakh oil and gas
company.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Chinese government highly praises Kazakhstan for
its commitment to the "one China" policy and considers this stand
an important base for the smooth development of its relations
with Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
The Kazakh government has said it opposes any activities that
attempt to split China and will not have ties with Taiwan in any
form in support of the cause of the Chinese reunification.

<HEADLINE> Swedish Prime Minister Visits NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Swedish Prime Minister Goran
Persson today hinted that his country still wants to stay outside
the North Atlantic alliance for a while.
</P>
<P>
After talks with NATO Secretary General Javier Solana in a
closed session, the Swedish prime minister told the press that
each country has its own right to decide its destiny.
</P>
<P>
But it is important for an outsider to have close talks with
NATO, said Persson whose NATO visit has been postponed due to
scheduling plans.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said that dialogues between NATO and
non-NATO countries are very important.
</P>
<P>
Sweden, however, has been an active participant in the NATO
Partnership for Peace program which incorporates 28 countries
throughout Europe from outside the alliance.
</P>
<P>
When asked how he sees the possible incorporation of the Baltic
states through further NATO enlargement, Persson said that he does
not perceive a new dividing line drawn between the Baltic states
and Russia.
</P>
<P>
"Both the Baltic states and Russia have had good dialogues with
NATO," said the prime minister who regarded the Baltic region as
one of the most prosperous in Europe due to its rapid economic
development.
</P>
<P>
A prosperous Baltic region will in return boost the Swedish
economy, Persson added.
</P>
<P>
NATO chief Solana spoke highly of Sweden's role in the NATO-led
Stabilization Force (SFOR) in Bosnia during his meeting with
Persson. He also briefed the Swedish prime minister about the
latest developments in that country.
</P>
<P>
When asked to comment on Sweden's neutrality by remaining
outside the 15-nation alliance, Solana would not define what
neutrality means nowadays.

<HEADLINE> WB Report Urges Reform of China's Pension System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 22 (Xinhua) -- China's pension system
faces the long-term problem of a rapidly aging population and the
immediate and urgent problem of funding pensions for employees of
state-owned enterprises, a World Bank report said here today.
</P>
<P>
The report, Old Age Security, one of the bank's China 2020
series, said the number of China's elderly will rise from about 76
million in 1995 to 300 million by 2050.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the ratio of workers to pensioners is
projected to decline from 10 to 1 in 1995 to about 3 to 1 in 2050.
</P>
<P>
Pension outlays are currently funded from current worker
contributions, which, if continued, would place an immense burden on
future generations, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The more immediate and urgent problem is the pension crisis in
the state-owned enterprise sector, which inherited heavy pension
obligations from the central planning era. With the transition to
a market economy, employment in the state enterprise sector is
declining, while the number of pensioners is rising rapidly, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
It charts four essential principles for sustainable reform.
</P>
<P>
-- Firstly, unifying the pension system, bringing together
enterprises and workers currently covered under separate plans
into a single system with common standards.
</P>
<P>
-- Secondly, reducing the pension burden by gradually
increasing the retirement age, lowering the wage replacement rate
and indexing pensions to prices rather than wages.
</P>
<P>
-- Thirdly, introducing funded individual accounts to end the
problems associated with the current pay-as-you-go system.
</P>
<P>
-- And fourthly, ensuring an adequate real rate of return on
pension funds.
</P>
<P>
The report further recommends that the unified pension system
include both mandatory funded individual accounts and a social
insurance scheme.
</P>
<P>
China today has a golden opportunity to move toward a
sustainable, unified pension system that combines a defined
benefit basic public pillar with funded individual accounts, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Although the reforms do carry transition costs, China's such
costs are lower while its capacity to bear these costs is higher
than in other countries that have made similar transitions, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
There are four factors behind it -- the benefits to be reaped
from unification of the pension system, rapid economic growth,
structural change in the economy, and expected capital gains.

<HEADLINE> China's Nationwide Campaign to Study Party Congress Documents (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese across the country
are saying that a stronger, improved Party leadership is the key
to building socialism with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
Comments like these have been heard during a nationwide
campaign to study the documents of the 15th National Congress of
the Communist Party of China (CPC), which ended last week.
</P>
<P>
To lead China into the 21st century, an effort must be also
made in promoting cultural and ethical progress, in consolidating
the Party and in strengthening unity among China's various ethnic
groups, and in maintaining political stability, people say.
</P>
<P>
The report delivered by General Secretary Jiang Zemin at the
Congress has gotten enthusiastic response from intellectuals like
Prof. Li Chonghuai of Wuhan University, who says, "It is essential
that the Party's nature as the vanguard and its purity be
maintained and its solidarity and fighting power increased to
continue China's modernization drive into the next century."
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zemin said that the Party's sole purpose is to serve the
people wholeheartedly and that an effort should be made to open
more channels for democracy. "This is especially important for
Party work at the grassroots level in rural areas," said Li
Zunying, Party secretary of Xintang county in Hebei province.
</P>
<P>
Some people, lured by the prospect of material benefits, have
departed from the basic moral standards, and this deterioration is
having an important influence in causing corruption in society.
</P>
<P>
"It is encouraging that the report emphasized building a
socialist culture with Chinese characteristics, and making a new
effort to improve cultural and ethical progress," said Shu Yi, a
member of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC).

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti, Bahraini Stock Markets Move Towards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait Stock Exchange
today started showing live daily trading deals in the Bahraini
bourse via special devices in a step towards the all-round linkage
of the two markets.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti bourse Director General Hisham Al-Otaibi said the
measure is aimed at getting Kuwaiti investors acquainted
themselves with the daily developments in Bahraini stock market
ahead of the linkage of the two bourses.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait announced Sunday the stock exchanges in the two Gulf
countries will sign an agreement Saturday to open the way for
cross trading between the two markets.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, expected to become effective early next year,
aims to link clearing houses and brokerage firms of the two
markets that will ease the way for cross trading.
</P>
<P>
A clearing house or similar body is also expected to be built
in Bahrain that will play the same role as the Kuwait Clearing
Company which guarantees share transactions here.
</P>
<P>
The agreement would be the second of its kind among stock
markets of the Gulf Cooperation Council's (GCC) states. GCC
groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Oman,
Qatar and Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
Oman and Bahrain have already linked their floors and a
number of companies from the two countries have been listed in
both exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Exchange officials believe that the joining together of the
Kuwaiti and Bahraini markets would encourage cross-listing of
companies and the flow of capital between the two countries, thus
boosting the economic cooperation among them.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait stock exchange has been performing well since last
year and so far more than 70 companies have been listed on the
market.
</P>
<P>
On January 6, the stock exchange markets of Kuwait, Egypt and
Lebanon were linked together via a computer network displaying
daily deals in each country.

<HEADLINE> Krajicek Pulls out of Grand Slam Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, Septtember 22 (Xinhua) -- Former Wimbledon champion
Richard Krajicek pulled out of the 6-million-dollar Grand Slam Cup
on Monday, opening the way for Australian Mark Woodforde to join
the field at the elite 16-man event which opens in Munich Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Officials said the Dutchman withdrew with an Achilles tendon
problem which has plagued him since the summer.
</P>
<P>
Woodforde moved into Krajicek's Tuesday first-round match
against Chile's Marcelo Rios, flying in from India after a Davis
Cup loss.
</P>
<P>
Swede Magnus Norman assumed the next replacement spot after
both South African Wayne Ferreira and Briton Tim Henman declined
it.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere on the injury front, Frenchman Cedric Pioline
confirmed to officials that he will be ready to compete at the
event, which brings together the top performers at the four Grand
Slams.
</P>
<P>
The Wimbledon finalist was unable to complete his opening
singles in France's Davis Cup relegation round tie against Belgium
on Friday, quitting in the fourth set with a knee problem against
Johan Van Herck.
</P>
<P>
He did not play the reverse singles on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Pioline is set for an opening match against Filip Dewulf, a
replay of the French-Belgian Davis Cup hostilities which the
Belgians won at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Britain's U.S. Open finalist Greg Rusedski was one of the few
entries with just a quick commute to reach Munich after resting
last week.
</P>
<P>
The New York losing finalist plays a Tuesday first-round
contest against Australia's Todd Woodbridge in the rich knockout
competition, being held in September for the first time in its
eight-year history after moving from a December date.
</P>
<P>
Also Tuesday, former French Open champion Yevgeny Kafelnikov
takes on Spain's Sergi Bruguera, who earned his place in the field
by reaching the French Open final.
</P>
<P>
Rusedski qualified by becoming the first British man to make
the top ten after his New York showing and after gaining a
semi-final place a week later in Britain on clay.
</P>
<P>
World No. 1 Pete Sampras and U.S. Open titleholder Patrick
Rafter were expected in Munich Monday after a flight from the
United States, where Sampras clinched a 4-1 Davis Cup final place
for his country against Sweden with a reverse singles win against
the Aussie.
</P>
<P>
Both men have a day off Tuesday, with Sampras playing Spain's
Felix Mantilla and Rafter opening against former world No. 1
Austrian Thomas Muster, all on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The tournament is an undisguised payday for the game's elite. A
first-round loser can get 100,000 dollars, while losing in the
final is worth a consoling 750,000.
</P>
<P>
Sampras, who took the title in the inaugural year of 1990, has
claimed more than five million dollars in prize money from this
event alone, competing in five editions.

<P>
WASHINGTON, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times
</P>
<P>
-- Asian leaders used a world finance meeting in Hong Kong to
vent frustrations against global markets, asserting that foreign
investors and Wall Street-style trading had triggered a crisis in
Southeast Asia. Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad of Malaysia
accused the "great powers" of pressing Asian countries to open
their markets and then manipulating their currencies to knock them
off as competitors.
</P>
<P>
-- The Arab League voted to defy United Nations sanctions
against Libya by allowing a plane carrying Muammar el-Qaddafi to
land and permitting some other flights, reflecting rising
animosity, especially toward the United States, for what the group
regarded as unevenhanded support of Israel in the latest Middle
East crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post
</P>
<P>
-- The Clinton administration and American oil companies are
intensifying a campaign to end Russia's century-old dominance over
the vast oil and gas riches of the Caspian Sea region, an area
potentially crucial to the strategic U.S. goal of securing major
new energy sources outside the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
-- After the story of Vice President Gore's fund-raising calls
from the White House broke last March, President Clinton said he
didn't remember making similar solicitations himself, but was
careful to leave himself some wiggle room.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal
</P>
<P>
-- IMF members agreed to chip in about 285 billion U.S. dollars
to boost the agency's capital base by 45 percent, responding to
the rapidly escalating cost of global financial rescues. The move
was overshadowed by a provocative condemnation of currency
traders and western governments by the Malaysian prime minister,
as well as by tension between the U.S. and Japan.
</P>
<P>
-- Westinghouse Electric agreed to buy American Radio Systems
for 1.6 billion dollars, plus 1 billion dollars in debt. The
Justice Department said it would do an antitrust review.

An estimated 100,000 people fell victims to the radioactive
fallout after the 1986 disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power
plant in the former Soviet Union, now near the border between
Belarus and Ukraine.

<HEADLINE> World Bank/IMF Development Committee Meeting Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The Development Committee
of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) ended
its 56th meeting here today after reaching agreement on a number
of pressing issues, according to a communique.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, World Bank President James
Wolfensohn and IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus addressed
the four-hour plenary session. Speakers also included a number of
government ministers and chief bankers.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the meeting agreed that corruption and weak
governance undermine macro-economic stability, private sector
activity and sustainable development objectives, and may erode
international support for development cooperation.
</P>
<P>
They emphasized that corruption is a global problem that
requires complementary actions by all countries, said the
communique issued after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
While stressing that member governments shoulder the primary
responsibility for combating corruption and strengthening
governance, the participants welcomed the more active involvement
of the World Bank and the IMF, each within their respective
mandate, in responding to member governments' requests to
strengthen their institutions and performance in these areas, the
communique added.
</P>
<P>
The ministerial-level committee, the only
broadly-representative group of key policy makers under the World
Bank and the IMF, focuses specially on developing country issues
and fosters resolution of critical problems for the mutual benefit
 of all countries.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the participants reiterated their support for
Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency's (MIGA) continued growth
 in response to the expanding demand for its services, the
communique said.
</P>
<P>
They also welcomed the World Bank Group Action Program designed
 to strengthen the Group's ability to increase private
participation in infrastructure in the context of its overall
objectives to support poverty reduction and sustainable
development, and stressed the importance of coordination in the
Group based on agreed country frameworks and strategies.
</P>
<P>
The Implementation of the Debt Initiative for Heavily Indebted
Poor Countries (HIPC) was another topic at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The ministers welcomed the progress in implementing the Debt
Initiative to support governments that show strong commitment to
reform, and encouraged eligible countries to undertake the policy
actions necessary to put them on the path to securing debt relief,
 the communique noted.
</P>
<P>
They also noted the importance of macroeconomic stability in
strengthening the financial systems of developing countries, as
recent events including the financial crisis in Southeast Asia
have shown, and viewed enhanced cooperation between the World Bank
 and the IMF as "an urgent priority."
</P>
<P>
The participants also praised the recent agreement guiding
increased collaboration to help member countries strengthen their
financial systems, said Driss Jettou, chairman of the committee
and finance minister of Morocco.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that the ministers expressed their deep
appreciation for the warm hospitality provided by the Chinese
government and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, and decided that
the committee's next meeting will be held on April 17, 1998 in
Washington, the United States.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Embassy Sealed Off after Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 22 (Xinhua) - Jordanian police stepped up
security around the Israeli embassy here after two Israeli
security guards were lightly wounded by a gunman outside Israeli
ambassador's residence about three kilometers away.
</P>
<P>
The streets near the embassy were blocked off and this would
remain until tomorrow morning, a patrolling police officer who
refused to be named told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Although the shooting took place near the ambassador's
residence, which was the former Israeli embassy, Jordanian police
still decided to tighten security around the embassy in case of
new violence, the officer said.
</P>
<P>
At about 7:30 local time (04:30 GMT) this morning, a man on a
vehicle passing by the ambassador's residence took out a gun and
shot at the security guards of the residence who were on routine
inspection duty.
</P>
<P>
Altogether four guards were lightly wounded, two of them were
Israelis and the other Jordanians, according to Jordanian Minister
of State for Information Affairs Samir Mutawe.
</P>
<P>
The attacker fled the scene. Jordanian police traced the vehicle
only to find the empty van near the U.S. embassy here at the sixth
circle, not far from the Israeli embassy, the police said.
</P>
<P>
Mutawe condemned the incident as an act of terrorism. No one
has claimed responsibility.
</P>
<P>
Israeli embassy spokesman Roey Gilad, told the press that the
two wounded Israeli diplomats received preliminary medical care in
Amman and then were transferred back to Israel for further
hospitalization.
</P>
<P>
Jordan signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994 despite
strong domestic opposition.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the Jordanians are of Palestinian origin, and
the shooting came at a time of heightened tension between
Palestinians and Israelis as the Mideast peace process remain
deadlocked.
</P>
<P>
In July, a Jordanian soldier was sentenced to life in prison
for shooting to death seven Israeli schoolgirls and wounding seven
others on March 13 near the border with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The sentence, regarded as unjust by some Jordanians, triggered
demonstrations in both Amman and the soldier's home town.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Africa Attracts More Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Foreign direct
investment inflows into Africa reached 4,949 million U.S. Dollars
in 1996, 5.3 percent more than that of 1995, said The World
Investment Report 1997 released by the United Nations Conference
on Trade and Development.
</P>
<P>
This indicates that the African continent, which is under
economic recovering, is attracting more foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
According to analysis made by the report, there are five
characteristics in the foreign investment inflows into Africa.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, the share of north Africa in Africa's total inflows
has declined from an average of 44 percent during 1986-1990 to 38
percent during 1991-1996.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the corresponding share of sub-Saharan Africa has
risen slightly from 56 percent to 62 percent within the two
periods.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, investment flows into Africa have become less
concentrated. The five largest recipients during 1991-1996 --
Nigeria, Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia and Angola -- accounted for 78
percent of all investment inflows to the region. But the
corresponding share during 1981-1985 of the top five recipients
--Egypt, Nigeria, Tunisia, Cameroun and Angola -- was 93 percent.
</P>
<P>
Fourthly, the share of investment for oil exports in Africa's
total inflows has increased marginally, from 71 percent during
1986-1990 to 73 percent during 1991-1996.
</P>
<P>
Fifthly, the share of Africa's investment inflows accounted
for by the least developed countries in the region has remained
almost the same, an average of 18 percent during 1986-1990 and an
average of 17 percent during 1991-1996.
</P>
<P>
The investment made by developing countries in Africa is
declining by more than a half, from 11 percent during 1986-1990
to 5 percent during 1991-1996, although foreign direct investment
inflows into the continent increased during the past decades.
</P>
<P>
Of course, the absolute level of foreign direct investment
flows into Africa is increasing, from an annual average of 800
million U.S. Dollars during 1975-1980 to 3.9 billion Dollars
during 1990-1996. Although rising from a low level, foreign
direct investment inflows into Africa grew by fivefold between
the periods 1975-1980 and 1990-1996, compared with 4.7 times for
Latin America and sevenfold for developed countries as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Foreign direct investment has played a significant role in
Africa's economic rehabilitation and development. Africa's
foreign direct investment stock was 13 percent of the region's
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 1995. If only sub-Saharan Africa
is considered, the share is as much as 17 percent, compared to
about 13 percent for western Europe, 14 percent for Asia, and 18
percent for Latin America and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
In relation to gross fixed capital formation during 1990-1995,
foreign direct investment flows to Africa accounted for 5.4
percent, compared with nearly 5.5 percent for Asia, 8.4 percent
for Latin America and the Caribbean and 5.9 percent for western
Europe. There are a number of countries in Africa which by this
measure, received more foreign direct investment than major
developing countries in Asia and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
It is noteworthy that although western industrialized
countries are main sources of foreign direct investment flows to
Africa, Asia's developing countries have become important
investors for Africa.
</P>
<P>
It is important that a number of firms from Africa are
themselves beginning to become outward investors. Although these
firms remain relatively rare and small in size with an outward
foreign direct investment stock of 26 billion U.S. Dollars in
1996, it shows that there are firms in Africa that can be
competitive internationally, not only through trade but also
through production in foreign markets.
</P>
<P>
Now, international community believes that the prospect of
improvements in foreign direct investment in Africa is bright.
First, there is a favourable economic growth performance in the
region. Africa's economic recovery, which started in 1994, was
strong in 1996, with domestic output rising by 4.4 percent, the
greatest increase since 1988. This performance compares
favorably with the 2.7 percent GDP increase in 1995, and
represents a turn-round in the per-capita income growth rate.
</P>
<P>
Second, foreign direct investment and trade liberalization in
African countries. In an effort to improve their investment
regimes, several countries in Africa have removed ownership
restrictions, reduced taxation rates and abolished price
controls. As of January 1, 1997, some 45 African developing
countries had concluded at least one bilateral investment treaty
and in total, had signed 267 bilateral investment treaties, of
which 17 were with countries in the continent.
</P>
<P>
Third, privatization in Africa. Sub-Saharan African countries
continued to sell off state-owned enterprises to foreign
investors. They raised 544 million U.S. Dollars in 1995, compared
with only 74 million in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Lastly, regional integration agreements and links with other
region. The convergence of economic policies in many African
economies is improving prospects for enhanced regional
cooperation. Governments are harmonizing their investment codes
and customs duties. Meanwhile, African countries are
strengthening their links with other regions.
</P>
<P>
Overall, prospects for an improved foreign direct investment
during the second half of the 1990s appear favourable. For
example, oil and mining companies have announced investment plans
for Africa in 1997 which total some 5 billion U.S. Dollars.

MANILA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos here today called on the Filipinos to follow the
government's lead in facing the challenges of poverty and economic
development to move the country to the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
Renewing his call for national unity, Ramos said the country
could become a more powerful economy by the 21st century "if we do
not compromise national gains we have already won together and not
allow them to be eroded by politically inspired divisiveness and
factionalism."
</P>
<P>
After Sunday's peaceful mass rally against charter changes
seeking to extend his term, Ramos has called on the people to heal
the wounds and bind the nation together to "go back to work and
move on."
</P>
<P>
In the past few months, charter change moves have caused
political divisiveness and uncertainties in the country, prompting
about half a million people to attend Sunday's rally in Manila.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said the government must now focus on fighting poverty
and sustaining economic development by raising productivity and
attracting more investments through various programs.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, he has urged the Philippine Congress to set aside the
debates regarding constitutional amendments and work for the
passage of laws urgently needed to make the country and the
Filipinos more competitive.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng: China to Maintain Long-term Cooperation with WB, IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng
said here today that the Chinese government wishes to maintain
long-term and stable cooperative relations with the World Bank
(WB) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
Li made the remark at a banquet given here in honor of the
finance ministers and central bank governors who are here to
attend the annual meetings of the World Bank Group and the IMF
which will open tomorrow, as well as their spouses.
</P>
<P>
He said that since 1980 China has been enjoying close
cooperation with the WB and IMF, which have provided helpful
assistance to China's economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
He said the two monetary bodies meanwhile have increased their
knowledge of China and accumulated some experience in conducting
cooperation with member states, especially developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HK
SAR) of China has been chosen as the venue for this year's WB/IMF
annual meetings "demonstrates that the international community
values Hong Kong as an international financial center and
testifies to their good-will in enhancing their cooperation with
China and their great trust in the HK SAR headed by Mr. Tung Chee
Hwa," Li said.
</P>
<P>
The premier noted that the recent 15th National Congress of the
Chinese Communist Party identified the Deng Xiaoping Theory as the
guiding ideology for China, elected the central collective
leadership with President Jiang Zemin at the core and drew up a
cross-century program for China's modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
"We will stick to and develop our all-directional,
multi-layered and cross-sector opening-up pattern, and maintain a
sustained, rapid and healthy economic growth, which will afford us
more opportunities for cooperation with other countries," Li said.
</P>
<P>
At present, he went on, the trend towards multipolarity is
gaining momentum. Great changes have taken place in the
international economic and financial arena, he added.
</P>
<P>
All these developments have presented both opportunities and
challenges to the WB and IMF, Li stated.
</P>
<P>
"It is both our hope and belief that the two institutions will
be able to adapt to the changing situation, look into the 21st
century, and give more consideration to the interests and needs of
the developing countries in the overall interests of world peace
and development," he said.
</P>
<P>
The two bodies will "give full play to their respective
advantages and make fresh contribution to regional and global
economic development in the spirit of mutual respect, equal
treatment, mutual benefit, reciprocity and seeking common ground
while reserving differences," the premier said.
</P>
<P>
Li concluded his speech by wishing the annual meetings a
"complete success."
</P>
<P>
Nearly 500 guests attended the banquet including WB/IMF Annual
Meetings Chairman Mohammed K. Khirbash, WB President James
Wolfensohn, IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus, and Chairman
of the Group of 24 Ministers Antonio Casas Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
HK SAR Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa and his wife Betty Tung,
and principal officials of the HK SAR government were also present.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji was also present.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Army Exchange Heavy Fire with S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, September 22 (Xinhua) -- State radio and television
in Sierra Leone reported that shells fired from a Nigerian alpha
jet on Saturday evening have caused structural damage to the main
building of the Electricity Power House in the capital.
</P>
<P>
Shells also destroyed a nearby police hospital, putting both
staff and about 100 patients to flight, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
State radio reported that no one was killed in the attacks but
Senior Electrical Engineer Yembeh Mansaray sustained serious
injuries on the face.
</P>
<P>
"We are appalled over what has turned out to be reckless
bombings of selected targets by the Nigerian air force," Hassan
Barrie, under secretary for energy and power, told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Damage to the building was put at 100,000 U.S. Dollars. A
Lebanese resident near the power house said he was using
binoculars when he saw the jet "coming at full speed as if it
intends to crash on the building."
</P>
<P>
"It was actually targeting an oil tug which was anchored at
the power house jetty. It is apparent they suspected the tug,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
Officials said the tug has been lying idle at the jetty for
two months now because of the blockade imposed by west African
leaders in their summit in Abuja, Nigeria last month. The
leaders aimed to force the military regime to return power back
to the civilian government.
</P>
<P>
"We were only enforcing the blockade and sending a warning to
would-be violators that we shall not hesitate to destroy any boat
or vessel attempting to ignore the embargo," a Nigerian captain
based at Jui, 13 miles east of the capital Freetown told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, heavy fire were traded between Nigerian troops
occupying Sierra Leone's international airport and soldiers of
the Sierra Leone army early today, residents in the area told
Xinhua in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
The airport is located 10 miles from the Sierra Leone River
and is accessible by ferry.
</P>
<P>
One resident said both sides began shooting at each other at
about 8 am local time, initially with small arms fire before
resorting to a series of bombardment.
</P>
<P>
Both sides blamed the other for the fighting in which each
side said they suffered "only slight injuries."
</P>
<P>
A Nigerian colonel at the airport reached by telephone said,
"We have been harassed since Saturday by rebels linked with the
Sierra Leone army. We have to defend ourselves when we are
attacked so this is why we fired back this morning."
</P>
<P>
Military sources in Freetown disputed the account saying, "a
group of Nigerian soldiers were moving from their positions
towards the area where the Sierra Leone army is based. We asked
them to halt but they ignored the warning. So we fired warning
shots."
</P>
<P>
The bombing caused slight panic in the capital but calm
returned by 8.45 am.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, two multinational companies resumed operations
today, three months after the May 25 military coup.
</P>
<P>
Ivan Varroll, manager of Sierra Leone Brewery, a subsidiary of
Heineken of Holland and Guiness of Scotland, told Xinhua, "We are
working on limited production until we repair our damaged
machines and bring in additional raw materials."
</P>
<P>
The brewery suffered extensive damage to its bottling plant
and laboratory after the coup.
</P>
<P>
Workers of the other company, the American-run Seaboard Flour
Mill, turned up in "full force" today to start production.
</P>
<P>
"The mill has enough raw materials to produce flour for the
next six months," said head miller John Williams.
</P>
<P>
Observers said the resumption of production means the size of
a loaf of bread, which had shrinked considerably over the past
months, will be increased.

<HEADLINE> China on Road to Build New Social Security System  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Health care and pension
systems in China have been restructured in recent years, but there
is still a long way to go to set up a new social security system
which can meet the demand of a market economy.
</P>
<P>
Guo Shuqing, secretary general of the State Commission for
Restructuring Economic Systems, made the remark here today at a
seminar on "Household Security in China: Health and Pensions",
part of a series of China-focused seminars organized by the World
Bank today.
</P>
<P>
The health status of the Chinese people has reached a
remarkably high level compared with many other developing
countries, with life expectancy at birth standing at about 70
years, Guo said.
</P>
<P>
But the old mechanism of providing medical care is facing great
challenges: the cost has increased much faster than the national
income growth and, at the same time, the efficiency has gone down,
the Chinese official said.
</P>
<P>
The key point of the old medical care system in urban areas, is
that state-owned enterprises or governmental institutions covered
all expenses of their employees, and the government covered all
expenses of these public units.
</P>
<P>
While in rural areas, a collectively-owned cooperative medical
care system paid for their members as much as possible, Guo told
the seminar.
</P>
<P>
With the advance of market-oriented economic reform, the
government has become much less responsible for the health care
system of the enterprises while the cooperative medical care
system has collapsed in many villages, he said.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, the State Council, China's cabinet, has selected
several pilot cities to conduct health care reform experiments,
establishing a city-based medical care system, with both employees
 and employers contributing to it, Guo said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Help Indonesia Extinguish Forest Fires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
has accepted Malaysia's offer to dispatch 1,500 firefighters to
help the country put out forest fires that have been raging in the
islands of Sumatra and Kalimantan, a senior official said here
today.
</P>
<P>
"Some 1,210 of them are for Sumatra," Coordinating Minister for
People's Welfare Azwar Anas said after meeting with Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the 1,210 firefighters for Sumatra, Malaysia has
also offered to send paramedics and military officers, Azwar said.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the neighboring country also
prepared three Hercules C-130 aircraft for cloud seeding, which
will come from Malaysia's airports in Subang, Labahan and Sabah.
</P>
<P>
At least 300,000 hectares of forest, mostly in Sumatra and
Kalimantan, have been destroyed by fire in Indonesia this year.
</P>
<P>
The haze caused by fires has reached an unhealthy level here,
Malaysia and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Officials here said that about 20 million people are in danger
of respiratory problems due to the thick smoke.
</P>
<P>
The haze has also caused the delay of 800 flights and at least
seven boat collisions on Central Kalimantan's Mahakam River in the
last few months.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Indonesian government ordered 176 plantation
firms, which accused of using fire for land clearing, to stop
firing forest within 15 days.

<HEADLINE> WB Publishes Report on Financing Health Care in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 22 (Xinhua) -- China's dramatic
improvements in health care have begun eroding but if the country
returns to a policy of vigorous finance and support for public
health, it could meet the needs of present and future generations,
a World Bank report suggests.
</P>
<P>
The report -- Financing Health Care -- which is part of the
China 2020 series prepared at the request of China, explains
policy changes which can remove disparities in coverage, increase
efficiency and ensure public financing to address the demands of a
more affluent and aging population.
</P>
<P>
In 1950, life expectancy in China was less than 40 years; by
1982, it had risen to 69 years. This shift reflects dramatic
improvement in the overall health of China's population, linked to
policies that by 1975 had brought health care to nearly 90 percent
of the population and that contained costs despite the vast gains
in health coverage.
</P>
<P>
Despite its remarkable achievements, China's health care system
today faces deep problems. The gap in access to health care has
grown, particularly between urban and rural areas, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
Inefficiency has grown in China's health services, for example,
by allowing health care providers to offset losses on
government-set prices by permitting them to charge high prices for
drugs and high-tech diagnostic tests, the report said.
</P>
<P>
And health care costs rose by 11 percent a year in real terms
from 1986 to 1993. These costs will continue to rise as China's
income grows and its population ages.
</P>
<P>
The report stresses the need for health spending to target the
poor, and discusses the ways to undo the distortions of pricing
and allocation of health resources that have diminished the
quality and effectiveness of China's health services.
</P>
<P>
The report shows how better control over health-care
investments, and more efficient risk pooling in insurance, can
improve both coverage and quality.
</P>
<P>
To achieve these changes, the report suggests that spending on
strengthened national public health activities should increase as
a share of GDP by 2001.

<TEXT>
<P>
In addition, he said, a variety of other health care systems
have developed in recent years, such as serious diseases security
funds, commercial insurance, as well as charities and donations.
</P>
<P>
Turning to pensions, the Chinese official said that after two
years' experiments, urban pension systems have begun to be
unified. Up to now, almost 90 million people in urban areas have
joined the pension system, he said.
</P>
<P>
But the biggest problem is that there was few accumulation for
the aged in their past working years and worse still, an
increasing number of retired people now are paid by the pension
system, he said.
</P>
<P>
There is some 50 billion yuan (six billion US dollars) in the
pension scheme nationwide, but a majority of cities and provinces
have already run into the red, he said.
</P>
<P>
Thus, household security, health and pensions call for a
"two-pillar system" -- basic security established by the
government, and supplementary security through market, he said.
</P>
<P>
"But now, both pillars are not strong enough, therefore
household savings in bank deposits are still increasing so much.
Last year it increased by 885.9 billion yuan (106 billion US
dollars) or 13 percent of the total GDP," Guo said.
</P>
<P>
With the emergence of pensions and diversified medical care
systems, fund management is becoming more and more important to
China's economy, he added.
</P>
<P>
To prevent risks, all the surplus of the social security funds
has been required to be used to buy government bonds since 1994
and this seems to be the best choice at present. But for
supplementary security funds, a commercialized management of
investment is needed, he said.
</P>
<P>
Among those addressing the 90-minute session were David de
Ferranti, director of the Human Development Department at the
World Bank, and Masahiro Yamada, managing director of Nippon Life
Insurance Company.
</P>
<P>
Yamada summarized the latest developments in Japan's social
security system and hoped that Japanese experience in the field
might be helpful to China.
</P>
<P>
Facing a rapidly aging society, Japan is in dire need of social
security, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ferranti commented that what is done to pensions and health
care has large implications not only on household security but
also on a nation's economy.
</P>
<P>
He expressed confidence that China is "well positioned to meet
the challenges" ahead on the road to build a new and efficient
social security system.

<HEADLINE> S. African Tourism to Double Its Contribution to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 22 (Xinhua) -- South African Tourism
Minister Pallo Jordan has predicted that tourism in the country
could increase its contribution from the present 4.5 percent of
gross domestic product (GDP) to eight percent by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the annual conference of the Airlines Association
of Southern Africa, Jordan said targets set for the next three
years included increasing foreign exchange earnings from tourism
to a rate of 15 percent a year from 2.65 billion U.S. Dollars to
4.88 billion U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's ministry has aimed to raise the number of foreign
visitors to South Africa by an average of 17 percent a year to
2.2 million by 2000, and African visitors by six percent a year
to 4.8 million and domestic holiday makers by 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
This would raise sustainable employment opportunities in the
sector from 550,000 to 860,000, he said.
</P>
<P>
"If we could increase the tourism contribution in the GDP to
10 percent, the industry could generate 40 billion Rand (8.51
billion U.S. Dollars) annually and create two million jobs. No
other industry has such potential," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
A restructured and more effective South African Tourism
Organization would embark on a new marketing drive in the new
year, he added.

LAGOS, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's inflation rate slid
down to 15.7 percent in July, according to latest figures from
the Federal Offices of Statistics (FOS).
</P>
<P>
The figure is 1.8 percent down from June and 0.07 percent
above the goal of 15 percent projected by the government for the
whole year of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, the rate of inflation has
remained moderate, recording a downward movement from 28 percent
at the end of 1996 to the present level.
</P>
<P>
The government's objective is to bring down the inflation rate
to one digit by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The FOS noted, however, there is yet no corresponding
decreases in the prices of goods and services.
</P>
<P>
From June to July, 1997, the composite consumer price index
rose from 2929.0 to 3012.3, up by 2.8 percent.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Road Network to be Managed by Private </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 22 (Xinhua) -- More than 90 percent of
South Africa's road network could be managed by the private
sector in the future, local daily Business Day today quoted
Transport Department Director-General Khetso Gordhan as saying.
</P>
<P>
The South African government wished to move towards the New
Zealand model of greater private sector involvement in the
management of the road network, Gordhan said at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of achieving this was through the national
roads agency, the legislation for which was recently approved by
the cabinet, he said.
</P>
<P>
The new agency would initially manage, construct and maintain
South Africa's 7,000 km national road network, which was likely
to be extended to the 20,000 km of primary roads in the next five
to six years.
</P>
<P>
"Ultimately we would like to set up a holding company for the
national road agency with nine provincial agencies in place as
well," Gordhan noted.
</P>
<P>
The South African Transport Department was planning to make a
major reform, during which about 1,000 of its staff were expected
to be retrenched, said a high-ranking official in the department,
who asked not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
The national roads agency would have a staff of about 150 with
about 30 people in the national head office, the official added.

<HEADLINE> Syria Satisfied With AL Recommendation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq
al-Shara here today expressed satisfaction over the recommendation
by the Arab foreign ministers to freeze further moves towards
normalizing ties with Israel.
</P>
<P>
In a final statement, the two-day 108th Arab League (AL)
ministerial council meeting recommended that AL member states
freeze further moves towards normalizing ties with Israel and
suspend multilateral talks.
</P>
<P>
"Issues related to normalization and multilateral negotiations
should not be raised except after making a basic headway in the
peace drive," he told foreign reporters.
</P>
<P>
The headway must primarily involve issues like Israeli troop
withdrawal from occupied Arab territories, freeze in Jewish
settlement building and achieving peace, according to Shara.
</P>
<P>
Syrian-Israeli peace talks broke down 18 months ago after a
spate of suicide bombings hit Jerusalem. Syria refused to return
to negotiations, accusing the Israelis of not honoring the
commitment of the former government to return the occupied Golan
Heights.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian official also lashed out at views that the decision
on attending the fourth Middle East and North Africa (MENA)
Economic Summit should be left to each individual country.
</P>
<P>
"These words lack accuracy," he said, in a vague reference to
some Arab countries' insistence on convening the regional economic
forum that involves Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Doha summit was not mentioned in the final statement.
</P>
<P>
However, discussions at the Cairo gathering Sunday shows "an
inclination that the convocation of the Doha conference will hinge
on tangible progress to be made on all Mideast peace tracks," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Shara anticipated that only three or four Arab countries would
attend the summit if it is ever convened in the Qatari capital in
November.
</P>
<P>
He further said that the only means through which Israel can
be persuaded to achieve peace is by clinging to a solid Arab
attitude and refusing to offer any concessions.
</P>
<P>
As a direct spinoff of the Mideast peace process, the annual
MENA conference had been held in Casablanca, Amman and Cairo since
1994.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia and Syria flatly rejected the conference that
involves Israel, while Qatar insists on hosting. Egypt had been
saying that its participation hinges on progress on the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Jordan are the only Arab countries that have peace
treaties with Israel, with which Qatar has limited trade ties.

<HEADLINE> East African Coffee Producers to Raise Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Coffee producing countries
in east Africa have agreed to start a series of cooperation
programs aimed at improving bean quality and raising coffee
production, The East African reported today.
</P>
<P>
The weekly newspaper said that at a two-day meeting held
recently in Tanzania, officials from Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda,
Tanzania and Uganda pledged to work together to fight coffee
pests, implement breeding programs and coffee quality
improvement.
</P>
<P>
Wilson Opile, a coffee scientist from Kenya told the meeting
that the potential is there in east Africa, adding that "if we
pull the resources together, we can increase production and
quality."
</P>
<P>
For instance, he said, "in Tanzania, they are struggling to
find disease resistant varieties and in Kenya we already have all
the information."
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Ted Lingle, Executive Director of the
Speciality Coffee Association of America, as saying that "if they
(east African coffee nations) get their act together and
cooperate on how to improve husbandry and raise yields, they
could easily double, if not quadruple the total output."
</P>
<P>
Leading world coffee organizations also predicted that east
Africa could become a significant market player on the
international coffee market within the foreseeable future, the
paper added.
</P>
<P>
The average yield in east Africa's coffee producing countries
is only some 250 kilograms per hectare while many Latin American
and some Asian countries harvest an average of more than one ton
per hectare.
</P>
<P>
The east African region produces close to 840,000 tons of
mostly arabica coffee, enough for the region to be a competitor
of Colombia, which is the world's second largest coffee producer.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan police has confirmed
that 31 people including nine raiders were killed on Saturday
when armed rustlers attacked Turkana District, west Kenya, the
Daily Nation reported today.
</P>
<P>
Police sources said the raiders believed to be from Uganda
attacked Lorengipi in Turkana District on Saturday morning,
killing five herdsmen and taking away hundreds of animals.
</P>
<P>
Seven of the raiders were also killed in the attack, two of
them wearing uniforms similar to those issued to Kenya Police
reservists.
</P>
<P>
During another attack, five women and eight children were
killed and more than 200 camels and 40 head of cattle were
stolen.
</P>
<P>
Police sources said that the animals were recovered after
heavy fighting between Kenyan security personnel and cattle
rustlers just as the latter were about to cross the border into
Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Reuben Rotich, Turkana District Commissioner was quoted as
confirming the attacks, adding that the security personnel were
still on the ground.
</P>
<P>
The daily newspaper said that security personnel travelling in
a lorry to the conflict area were ambushed Sunday at Loya, near
the border between Kenya and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Police re-enforcement had to be brought in from Baringo and
Nakuru to prevent the raiders from crossing into Uganda, the
paper pointed out.
</P>
<P>
More than 60 people have died in raids between security
personnel and cattle rustlers in Turkana and Pokot district over

<HEADLINE> Theory of China Threat to Food Security Refuted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The prediction that China
will pose a threat to the world food security is "totally
groundless," a Chinese official said here today.
</P>
<P>
"With a small amount of grain imported, China will by no means
be a threat to the world food security," Sun Xiaoyu,
vice-president of the Development Research Center of the State
Council of China, told a World Bank seminar.
</P>
<P>
"In a historical perspective, China did not rely much on the
international grain market," Sun said at the seminar entitled
"China: Food Security and the Rural Economy."
</P>
<P>
For example, China had been a net exporter of food between 1985
and 1995 when its total exports of food reached 75.6 billion US
dollars while imports stood at 34 billion US dollars, he said.
</P>
<P>
The theory of grain threat from China is "totally groundless,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Lester Brown, in his book "Who Will Feed China?" published in
1996, alleged that with rapid economic and population growth,
China may have to import all the grain in the international market
by the year 2020, and as a result, may starve people in Africa
and other regions.
</P>
<P>
Sun said that in the 21st century, China will continue to rely
on its own resources to be largely self-sufficient in grain
supply. In a normal situation, the self-sufficiency rate of grain
is no lower than 95 percent, and the net import does not exceed
five percent of domestic consumption, he added.
</P>
<P>
China uses only seven percent of the world's arable land to
feed 22 percent of the world's population. Its total grain output
reached 490 million tons in 1996, up five percent from the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
At today's seminar, Justin Yifu Lin, director of the China
Center for Economic Research at Beijing University, agreed with
Sun's view, saying that Lester Brown's prediction was not
accurate.
</P>
<P>
"Land is not the most important issue, the more important issue
is how much you can produce from per unit of land," said the
Chinese scholar. He forecasts that China's grain output would be
doubled in the coming 20 to 30 years, if the government could
invest sufficiently in agricultural research and irrigation
systems.
</P>
<P>
He further noted that "if China can increase its grain import,
that will be a main contribution to the peaceful environment in
the world since many disputes between North America, Europe and
Australia arise from grain surplus."
</P>
<P>
The World Bank published a report here today, predicting that
China can continue to feed its population over the next two or
three decades and domestic food production can largely keep pace
with population growth.
</P>
<P>
China can overcome obstacles to growth in agriculture by
improving agricultural research, upgrading irrigation systems, and
developing more arable land, the report said.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Standing Committee Held Meeting in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The 22nd meeting of the
Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) was held here
today, placing the study and implementation of the essence of the
15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China at the top
of the agenda.
</P>
<P>
Li Ruihuan, member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and chairman of the CPPCC
National Committee, presided over the meeting and delivered an
important speech.
</P>
<P>
Wen Jiabao, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central
Committee and member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central
Committee, briefed participants on the essence of the 15th CPC
National Congress, entrusted by the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
The 15th Party National Congress was very successful, concluded
Wen, adding that Jiang Zemin's report is a political declaration
and call to action for people to forge ahead into the new century.
</P>
<P>
He said the first Plenary Session of the 15th CPC Central
Committee elected the new central leading body with Jiang Zemin as
its core.
</P>
<P>
The most import work at present is to study and implement the
fundamental issues of the congress, unify the thinking of the whole
party, and gather the strength of the entire nation to realize
various tasks assigned by the congress, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the meeting, Li Ruihuan said the congress, with the
theme of holding high the banner of the Deng Xiaoping Theory for
an overall advancement of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics into the 21st century, drew up a comprehensive
plan for China's reform, opening-up and socialist modernization
drive.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's report is a pragmatic document to guide the CPPCC work,
and the CPPCC bodies at all levels must regard the study and
implementation of the essence of the congress as an important task
now and in the future, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Li emphasized that CPPCC bodies at all levels must summarize
their work over the past years and also direct their future work,
especially the reshuffling of the CPPCC, based on the guiding
theme of the congress, to lay a sound basis for the CPPCC of the
new term.

<HEADLINE> Indian Minister said United Front Government Safe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 22 (Xinhua)-- Indian Union Home Minister
Indrajit Gupta today said that there is not immediate threat to
the United Front (UF) government as the Congress party, outside
supporter to the government, could not afford to withdraw support
at this juncture.
</P>
<P>
Talking to newsmen here on his way back from his two-day visit
to the country's border districts, Gupta said that the Congress
was in no hurry to withdraw support to the UF government.
</P>
<P>
The UF government is a minority government at the Center and it
will not last for a single day without the support of the Congress
party. In the last general election held in April-May last year,
both the national parties of the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata
Party (BJP) failed to win a simple majority in Parliament. In
order to prevent the BJP, referred to as communal party by most of
other political parties, from coming into power at the Center, the
Congress supported multi-regional parties, which later formed the
UF, to form a Union government last year.
</P>
<P>
The Congress withdrew its support to the UF government headed
by Deve Gowda at the end of March this year accusing Gowda of
trying to weaken the Congress. The Deve Gowda government fell
since then and Inder Kumar Gujral replaced him as the UF
government new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
In the past few weeks, Congress President Sitaram Kesri has
time and again said that the present UF government could not last
long as the regional parties had inherent differences. The
Congress party would not allow the government to pass another
budget in February next year. He has asked his party men to
prepare for mid-term elections. He even said that facts have shown
that the coaliton government at the Center was a failure.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether the UF would remain united in the event of a
mid-term poll, Gupta said it was too early to anticipate.

<HEADLINE> China Seeks International Cooperation to Control Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Beijing is to host the
International Cooperation Conference on Environmental Protection
Projects from November 20 to 21.
</P>
<P>
China has prepared nearly 70 priority projects on pollution
control for the conference, which is the country's first meeting
of the kind seeking international cooperation in environmental
protection, officials said.
</P>
<P>
They added that it will help overseas funds and enterprises
enter China's environmental protection market, and push forward
the implementation of the country's environmental protection plans.
</P>
<P>
The projects cover water and air pollution control, disposal of
urban waste and hazardous waste and protection of ecology and
biodiversity.
</P>
<P>
Carefully selected from the nearly 2,000 key projects in the
China Trans-Century Green Project Plan, the 70 programs are not
only urgently needed, but also well-prepared, officials said,
adding that the projects have gained support from the State and
local planning commissions.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Kunmin, deputy-director of the National Environmental
Protection Agency, said in today's news conference that to seek
extensive and concrete international cooperation has always been
an important way for China to attain its environmental protection
goals.
</P>
<P>
He hopes that the international community, such as the World
Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the United Nations Development
Program, the United Nations Environment Program, foreign
governments, trans-national financial institutions and enterprises
could take active part in China's environmental protection work.
</P>
<P>
China still faces a serious environmental situation. Pollution
in the urban areas is extending to the countryside, and in some
regions, pollution has become a leading obstacle to local economic
and social development.
</P>
<P>
To control pollution and improve the environment, China has
announced the Trans-century Green Project Plan. In the first phase
(1996-2000) of the plan, the country plans to spend some 22.5
billion US dollars on pollution control.

<HEADLINE> Australia Pledges More Assistance to PNG </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister John Howard
today pledged further Australian assistance to the drought-ravaged
South Pacific country of Papua New Guinea (PNG) on top of the
360,000 U.S. dollars already committed by his government.
</P>
<P>
Haward told the parliament that he had made the pledge during a
meeting with PNG Prime Minister Bill Skate at last week's South
Pacific Forum in the Cook Islands.
</P>
<P>
The PNG prime minister estimated that 700,000 of his country's
4.3 million people are suffering as a result of the drought that
is caused by the El Nino weather pattern, according to earlier
reports.
</P>
<P>
"I had a discussion with the prime minister of PNG about this
issue late last week and I indicated that after further assessment
had been made it would be the intention of the Australian
government to give further assistance," Howard said.
</P>
<P>
"I think we do have a special obligation to our neighbor in
this time of particular need," he added.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Alexander Downer also told the parliament
today that Australia had responded immediately to a request from
the PNG government on September 10 for drought assistance.
</P>
<P>
Reports said a Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) Hercules today
landed in the PNG capital of Port Moresby to begin a four-day
operation to provide relief supplies for remote villages.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the RAAF flight, Australian experts have also
been sent to that country to assess the extent of damage caused by
drought.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Embarks on Moscow Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak today embarked on a three-day visit to Moscow that is
aimed to reinvigorate economic ties, the Egyptian Middle East News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The visit, at the invitation of Russian President Boris
Yeltsin, is the first by an Arab leader in six years to Moscow
after the former Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri and Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa as well as 24 businessmen are accompanying the president on
the tour.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak has urged Russia to promote its role in salvaging the
stalled Mideast peace process. Russia, together with the U.S., is
the co-sponsor of the process that started after the 1991 Madrid
peace conference.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak and Yeltsin will sign a package of pacts on eliminating
double taxation, protecting investment and scientific, security and
judicial cooperation.
</P>
<P>
They are also expected to deal with the issue of enlarging the
U.N. Security Council. Egypt is angling for a permanent membership
on the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The presidents will co-chair the Higher Egyptian-Russian
Committee to probe bilateral issues in the political and economic
domains, as well as the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Trade and Supply Minister Ahmed Goweili is already in Moscow
for meetings of the joint committee which will thrash out a number
of proposals to give a push to the bilateral trade.
</P>
<P>
The proposals comprise the establishment of a joint trade, an
marketing company, a joint Egyptian-Russian bank to fund trade
transactions between the two sides and a large exhibition in
Moscow showcasing Egyptian exports in October.
</P>
<P>
At the close of their ministerial committee meetings Sunday,
Egypt and Russia have approved the establishment of three joint
companies to work in the fields of agricultural, industrial
exports and marine transport.
</P>
<P>
Trade volume between the two countries during the first six
months of the year reached 172.4 million dollars, 18.8 million of
which are Egyptian exports. Cairo and Moscow expect to expand
their trade to one billion dollars from the current 380-400
million dollars a year.

<HEADLINE> Zhu Rongji Pledges Eventual Full RMB Yuan Convertibility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Zhu
Rongji today pledged that China will certainly make the Renminbi
yuan fully convertible in the future, but said it needs time to
achieve such a goal.
</P>
<P>
Zhu told participants of a World Bank seminar on China's
economy here this afternoon that the Chinese authorities have been
advised by all international friends to be extremely careful in
considering to make the yuan convertible under the capital
account.
</P>
<P>
The yuan has become convertible under the current account since
last December but is still regulated under the capital account.
</P>
<P>
China will eventually make it fully convertible when the
nation's industrial structure is rationalized and supervision over
the banking sector by the central bank is improved, Zhu said when
answering questions from the audience after delivering a speech.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that China's foreign exchange reserves have hit
131.6 billion U.S. dollars to date, and is expected to surpass 140
billion U.S. dollars by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of China's banking sector, Zhu reiterated China's
commitment to further opening the sector to foreign businesses,
noting that more than 500 foreign banks have set up representative
offices in China.
</P>
<P>
A number of foreign banks have established branches in the
country and nine of them have been approved to conduct RMB yuan
business in Shanghai, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also welcomed foreign insurance companies to develop
business in China, saying that the Chinese authorities are
considering to approve British and Australian insurance companies
to enter the Chinese market, after a few companies from the U.S.,
Canada, Switzerland and Germany have already won the approval.
</P>
<P>
"You are welcome to China. That will be conducive to China's
economic development, but you should take into account the market
capacity," Zhu said.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Calls on U.N. to Back Sanctions on Sierra </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS) has called on the international community
to back its sanctions against Sierra Leone to force out the
military government of that country.
</P>
<P>
ECOWAS's appeal was voiced by Nigerian Foreign Minister Tom
Ikimi at the weekend at the U.N. Security Council on behalf of
the ECOWAS Committee of Five on Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
ECOWAS approved sanctions and blockade on Sierra Leone on
August 30, after negotiations failed to persuade Major Johnny
Kromah to return power to elected President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah,
whom he overthrew in a coup on May 25.
</P>
<P>
Ikimi condemned the Kromah government of having "shown little
sign of flexibility, accommodation or a disposition to
compromise" and held it responsible for the breakdown of the
Abidjan talks.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the fear that the inflow of arms and ammunition
to Sierra Leone is a sign that Kromah is fortifying himself for a
prolonged engagement.
</P>
<P>
Ikimi also expressed regret over the worsening situation in
Sierra Leone, where the number of refugees are multiplying,
social infrastructures are being stretched to their limits,
foreign nations are constantly harassed and ECOWAS personnel are
frequently attacked.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he urged the Security Council to take decisive
actions on the Sierra Leone crisis by applying the regime of
sanctions and embargo imposed by ECOWAS.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has reportedly pledged his
support for the efforts of ECOWAS in a meeting with the ECOWAS
team, according to media reports.

<HEADLINE> Australia's AIDS Threat From New Guinea: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The most direct threat of
HIV/AIDS spreading from the neighboring region to Australia was
from the southern coast of the island of New Guinea, Australian
Health Minister Michael Wooldridge said today.
</P>
<P>
The coastal Irian Jaya village of Merauke had an infection rate
second only to the Indonesian capital Jakarta and the spread had
been "very rapid" in Papua New Guinea's Daru/Fly River region, the
minister told reporters at the World Health Organization (WHO)
Western Pacific Region's annual conference in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
There were 30,000 visits a year from that region to Australia
under international treaty obligations, presenting a threat to the
Aboriginal population in particular, the Australian Associated
Press said.
</P>
<P>
"That is where a potential threat lies and the Aboriginal
Health Strategy ... is focusing very much on sexual health,
largely targeting northern Australia, and trying to prevent what
could be a problem in the future," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The number of Australians with AIDS or HIV virus is relatively
low and stable compared with other countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
He pointed to some good results in the AIDS war in the region,
particularly in Thailand and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
"As to the threat to Australia, yes there is a threat from
travel, and we have been working very hard in our AusAID projects
with sex workers in parts of the region, " he said. AusAID is
Australia's official overseas assistance agency.
</P>
<P>
WHO Western Region Director Sang Tae Han said the "powderkeg"
for AIDS in South-East Asia would be Cambodia, Vietnam and part of
Laos, as well as Thailand, Burma and India further west.
</P>
<P>
"In the (Pacific) region I don't think it will be as serious as
in our neighboring region," the director said.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 22 (Xinhua)-- Malaysia's currency --
Ringgit today ended lower against the U.S. dollar, hitting a
27-year low.
</P>
<P>
The unit ended at 3.0950/10 to the dollar against 3.0280/20 at
last week's close. The rate was the lowest since 1970 when the
local unit was traded at a low of 3.0775.
</P>
<P>
Dealers attributed the weaker ringgit to continued absence of
buying support against a backdrop of a stronger greenback.
</P>
<P>
The sentiment of the currency market was also affected by
lackadaisical performance on the stock market whose 100-stock
Composite Index closed today at 760.50 points, 27.34 points or
3.47 percent lower than last week's closing.
</P>
<P>
The local currency also ended easier against other currencies,
at 2.0271/17 to the Singapore dollar from 1.9943/83, at 2.5199/50
against the yen from 2.4881/24, at 1.7316/48 against the mark from

<HEADLINE> Explanation on Amendments to CPC Constitution (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 22 (Xinhua) -- A leading official with the
Secretariat of the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party
of China (CPC) recently explained in an interview with Xinhua the
Amendments to the Party Constitution approved by the 15th National
Party Congress, which closed on September 18.
</P>
<P>
The official said the revisions mainly focused on more clearly
defining Deng Xiaoping Theory as the guiding ideology of the Party.
</P>
<P>
At the Seventh National Congress of the Party, Mao Zedong
Thought, the integration of the theories of Marxism-Leninism with
the practice of the Chinese revolution, was named the prominent
ideology of the Communist Party of China. Doing this was of the
utmost importance for the success of the Chinese revolution and
construction, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Party
Central Committee, the 12th, 13th and especially the 14th National
Congresses of the Party, the 15th congress has established Deng
Xiaoping Theory, a continuation of Mao Zedong Thought, as the
Party's guiding ideology.
</P>
<P>
This decision, made at a national Party congress after the
theory had been tested for nearly two decades during the reform
and opening up and following the death of Comrade Deng Xiaoping,
is bound to play an extremely important role in the successful
development of the cause of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The 15th National Congress pledges to hold high the great
banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory for an all-round advancement of the
cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics into the
21st century.
</P>
<P>
Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping Theory
constitute a unified scientific system. In present-day China,
adhering to Deng Xiaoping Theory means genuinely adhering to
Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and Holding high the
banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory means holding high the banner of
Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, the official said.

<HEADLINE> Explanation on Amendments to CPC Constitution (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to a question on the revision on the General
Program of the Constitution of the CPC, the official said the
amended constitution stipulates: "The Communist Party of China
takes Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping
Theory as its guide to action."
</P>
<P>
Following the original expositions of Marxism-Leninism and Mao
Zedong Thought, the General Program of the amended Party
Constitution made some readjustments and additions to the theory
of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, thus forming
the exposition of Deng Xiaoping Theory:
</P>
<P>
"Since the Third Plenum of the 11th Party Congress, the
communists, with Comrade Deng Xiaoping as their chief
representative, have reviewed the experience gained through their
successes and failures since the founding of the People's
Republic, liberated their minds, sought truth from facts, shifted
the focus of the work of the whole Party to economic development,
introduced reform and opened China to the outside world, thus
ushering in a new period of development of the socialist cause.
</P>
<P>
"They have gradually formulated the line, principles and
policies for building socialism with Chinese characteristics,
clarified the fundamental issues concerning how to build,
consolidate and develop socialism in China and created Deng
Xiaoping Theory.
</P>
<P>
"This theory is a product of the integration of the fundamental
tenets of Marxism-Leninism with the practice in present-day China
and the features of the times and is a continuation and
development of Mao Zedong Thought under the new historical
conditions.
</P>
<P>
"It represents a new stage of development of Marxism in
China. It is a Marxist theory for present-day China and a
crystallization of the collective wisdom of the Communist Party of
China and is guiding China's socialist modernization drive
forward."
</P>
<P>
The official also said that since the revised Party
constitution has stipulated in the General Program that "the
Communist Party of China takes Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong
Thought and Deng Xiaoping Theory as its guide to action,"
amendments were made accordingly to Clause 1 of Article 3, Clause
2 of Article 31 and Clause 1 of Article 34, stipulating that the
Party members and the leading Party officials should
conscientiously study Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought and
Deng Xiaoping Theory.

<HEADLINE> Senior Banking Official on China's Two Financial Systems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The monetary relationship
between the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong can be best summarized
as one country with two currencies, two monetary systems and two
mutually independent monetary authorities, Chen Yuan, deputy
governor of the People's Bank of China, said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a World Bank seminar on the 21st Century Economic
Outlook, Chen said Hong Kong will continue to maintain its own
system of currency issuance and management and that the HK dollar
will continue to circulate as the legal tender in Hong Kong, as
the Renminbi in the mainland.
</P>
<P>
The HK dollar will be treated as a foreign currency in the
mainland, he said. Likewise, he added, the Renminbi will be
treated as a foreign currency in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The three note-issuing banks in Hong Kong will continue to
issue Hong Kong dollar bank notes, with 100 percent backing by
U.S. dollars under the linked exchange rate system, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The co-existence of the two currencies in China reflects the
existing differences in the economic systems in Hong Kong and the
mainland and is called for by the ongoing economic reform and
opening-up in the mainland," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) shall independently
conduct the monetary policy in Hong Kong and be accountable solely
to the Hong Kong government. The People's Bank of China will not
take the place of the HKMA," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
He said the HKMA will continue to supervise financial
institutions in Hong Kong, including those from the mainland, and
such supervision will continue to be performed in accordance with
international rules and practices.
</P>
<P>
The financial institutions established in the mainland by Hong
Kong investors will continue to be treated as foreign financial
institutions and enjoy the same preferential treatment as other
foreign financial institutions, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is very important for Hong Kong as an international
financial center to continue to develop its international monetary
relations and participate in the activities of international and
regional financial institutions as well as central bank forums,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Basic Law stipulates that the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region may, using the name of "Hong Kong, China",
maintain and develop financial relations and handle external
financial issues with other countries and regions.

<HEADLINE> Zhu Rongji Confident About HK Dollar Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Zhu
Rongji today voiced his confidence in the stability of the Hong
Kong dollar despite the recent currency turmoil in Southeast Asian
countries.
</P>
<P>
Answering questions after his speech at a World Bank seminar on
China's economy here this afternoon, Zhu said that the authorities
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HK SAR) are fully
capable of defending the HK dollar.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has a robust economic growth with relatively less
bubble factors and its foreign exchange reserves total 86 billion
U.S. dollars, therefore its currency enjoys a stable position, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Although the HK dollar was affected to a limited extent by the
recent turmoil, "we haven't seen any big changes," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. dollar-pegged currency system has been working in Hong
Kong for over 13 years, and "I have learned from well-positioned
sources of the HK SAR government that they do not intend to change
such a system in the short or medium term," he said.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Little Changed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar
finished little changed today, with the market bereft of any fresh
news to trade off.
</P>
<P>
The local unit closed at 71.93 US cents, compared to 71.90 US
cents previously.
</P>
<P>
Traders said the local unit had been sidelined today as market
attention focused on the U.S. dollar following the meeting of
Group of Seven finance ministers and central bank governors in
Hong Kong on the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The market were still digesting a communique released after the
gathering which was interpreted as indicating a preference for a
stronger yen.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar rose to 88.08 yen, from 87.58.
</P>
<P>
Looking ahead for the Australian dollar, market watchers said
further downside movement in the currency against the U.S. dollar
in the near term appeared limited.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was at 1.2773 marks, down from 1.2807.

<HEADLINE> U.S.-Israel-Turkey Joint Maneuvers Condemned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami today condemned the forthcoming joint military maneuvers
by Turkey, Israel and the United States in the Mediterranean,
calling the move a threat to the whole region.
</P>
<P>
Addressing large crowds of people in the capital's Azadi
(Freedom) Square on the occasion of the Defense Week, Khatami said
the joint maneuvers were aimed to create tension in the area.
</P>
<P>
The joint military maneuvers involving troops of the three
countries will take place in mid-November in eastern Mediterranean
for the purpose of what Ankara said research and rescue training.
</P>
<P>
"Under pressures from the U.S., the Turkish government totally
ignored the concerns and anger of the Arab and Muslim states and
has submitted to this humiliation," he said.
</P>
<P>
This is indicative of the enemies' resolve to create tensions
in the region and to impose threat to regional stability as well
as Iran's security, he added.
</P>
<P>
"The Islamic Iran abstains from conflicts but will not
tolerate interference in its internal affairs (by foreign
countries)," said Khatami, "the country is fully prepared to
defend its territorial integrity and independence."
</P>
<P>
"The independence- and freedom-seeking nations, including Iran,
are continuously threatened by the hegemonic and expansionist
powers of the world, which mandates us to strengthen our armed
forces," he said.
</P>
<P>
Highlighting the role of country's armed forces in confronting
the threats, Khatami said Iran owes its independence to the
sacrifices of the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Eight years of "sacred defense" in the war with Iraq has
solidified the country's independence and it is incumbent upon the
nation to keep the memories of these struggles alive, said the
president.
</P>
<P>
Khatami called on the armed forces to continuously endeavor to
fulfill the nation's goal of preserving its independence.
</P>
<P>
Iran's armed forces staged a grand parade in the square in
commemorating the beginning of the 1980-88 war between Iran and
Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Transnational Accounting Firm Moves Forward With Business in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The World-renowned accounting
firm, Arthur Andersen, has been gearing up to make the most of
business opportunities in China, including Hong Kong and Taiwan,
which have appeared as a result of Hong Kong's return to the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
The company recently appointed Albert Ng, a senior partner in
the firm, as managing partner of its China business and the
executive responsible for implementing the strategy.
</P>
<P>
The firm hopes to expand its business by treating interior
areas, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Taiwan as a
single market by making rational use of technological forces and
labor resources, and further improving coordination of businesses
in these areas, according to a report from the company.
</P>
<P>
In a move to secure its position as a leading professional
service agency in the Asia-Pacific region, the accounting firm
expects to double the size of its practice in China by the turn of
the century.
</P>
<P>
"With Arthur Andersen's success and growth in China, and our
vision of the China strategy, I have decided to pass on my
responsibilities as managing partner in China. Our China practice
has grown to a point where it demands the full attention and focus
of a dedicated leader," said John Burrows, Arthur Andersen
Asia-Pacific regional managing partner.
</P>
<P>
Ng joined Arthur Andersen's Hong Kong office in 1981. He was
transferred to the Sydney office in 1989 where he remained for two
years as a manager. In 1994, he moved to Shanghai as managing
partner, a position he will continue to hold in addition to his
China-wide responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
Ng said: "China will become a place with the fastest growth in
our global business expansion, and as events unfold, China,
including Hong Kong and Taiwan, will become a more integrated
market unit."
</P>
<P>
Arthur Andersen has pioneered professional services in China
since 1979, and established the first Sino-foreign certified
public accounting firm, Arthur Andersen-Huaqiang, in 1982.
</P>
<P>
Arthur Andersen currently has offices in Beijing, Shanghai,
Shenzhen and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), with
a total of 1,100 employees.
</P>
<P>
The company has led the profession in helping China approach
the international capital markets by assisting 39 enterprises from
interior areas of China to list their securities on domestic and
overseas bourses, with a total value of about five billion
U.S. dollars, and has also served over 50 power plants in ten
provinces in China.

<HEADLINE> Opinion Poll Shows Corruption Is Rampant In Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Ninety-five percent of
Bangladeshi people consider the police department as the most
corrupt organization, according to a country-wide opinion poll
conducted recently by Bangladesh Unnayan Parishad (BUP).
</P>
<P>
The results of the poll were published today by local newspaper
the Daily Star.
</P>
<P>
The BUP poll said that the customs department comes next with
91 percent, and tax department, secretariat and judiciary rank
third, fourth and fifth respectively.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-two percent of the respondents believed that government
officials are mainly responsible for all such corruption, the poll
continued.
</P>
<P>
According to another recently-made study on the corruption, the
Bangladesh's economy crippled with corruption i.e., the
'underground economy' in the country consists of 23 percent of
formal GDP.
</P>
<P>
The unrecorded part of export and import sectors consists of
1.7 percent and 9.1 percent of GDP, and 12 percent and 39.4
percent of formal export and import sectors respectively, the
study stated.
</P>
<P>
The study added that as an import-dependent country of
Bangladesh, import sector is a major source of earning illegal
money through corruption.
</P>
<P>
According to some estimate, the cost of corruption comes to
almost 350 percent of initial official costs of setting up a
garments factory, and when yearly renewal costs are added, this
figure increases to nearly 700 percent.
</P>
<P>
The major portion of this cost of corruption is bribe, the
study said, adding that bribe constitutes 60 percent of the
initial cost and about 95 percent of yearly renewal costs.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Star quoted Humayun Kabir, Assistant Professor of
Department of Economics of Shahjalal University as saying that
corruption has pervaded all the sectors of Bangladesh's economy
and it has rather emerged as a status symbol.
</P>
<P>
Kabir pointed out that the presence of corruption is costly for
the common life of the people and sufferings are unbearable at
individual level.

<HEADLINE> Private Capital Flows to Emerging Markets Hit New High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hong Kong, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Private capital flows to
emerging markets hit a new peak of 235.2 billion U.S. dollars in
1996 from 192.8 billion dollars the previous year, according to a
report released by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) here
today.
</P>
<P>
The factors which helped propel private capital flows to the
emerging markets include the low level of interest rates in Japan
and Germany and the compression of corporate bond spreads in the
United States, the report said.
</P>
<P>
That prompted fixed-income investors in the mature markets to
move down the credit spectrum and search for higher yields on
emerging market debt, said the report, entitled "International
Capital Markets."
</P>
<P>
It also attributed the surge in private capital flows to the
improved economic performance in many emerging market economies
which reduced perceived credit risks.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held here today, David Folkerts-Landau,
assistance director of the Research Department of the IMF, said
the emerging market countries should make significant improvements
in market infrastructure including higher transparency in policies
and regulations to attract more private capitals.
</P>
<P>
The pattern of capital flows to emerging markets suggests that
private financing is still provided on a selective basis, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
These flows have been highly concentrated, with top 10 emerging
markets receiving nearly three-quarters of capital inflows during
the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Asia remained the largest recipient of capital flows totaling
1.068 trillion U.S. dollars in 1996 although the growth of total
flows moderated sharply from 32 percent in 1995 to eight percent
last year.
</P>
<P>
The relatively modest expansions of capital flows to Asia
reflected the slowdown in the growth of both export and output in
the region, as well as the impact of uncertainties created by
financial sector weaknesses in countries such as the Republid of
Korea and Thailand, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Total private capital flows to Latin America rebounded
robustly, more than doubling from their depressed levels in 1995
of 35.7 billion U.S. dollars to 77.7 billion U.S. dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The sharp rebound raised total flows to the region above the
previous peak in 1993, completing the recovery of total flows from
the effects of the Mexican crisis.
</P>
<P>
While capital flows to the Middle East and Europe grew
strongly, flows to Africa and the transition economies declined,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
Since 1995, net foreign direct investment (FDI) has accounted
for the largest proportion of the private capital flows to
emerging markets, and in 1996, it stood at 1.059 trillion U.S.
dollars, accounting for some 45 percent of the total flows.
</P>
<P>
FDI flows to emerging market countries expanded between
1991-1995 at an average annual rate of 37 percent, and continued
to grow robustly during 1996, increasing by 21 percent.

<HEADLINE> Broken Coupler Blamed for Philippine Train Collision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- A broken coupler is blamed for
the collision of two commuter trains during rush hours early this
morning in the southern suburb of Manila, Philippine National
Railways (PNR) spokesman Reynaldo Recede said this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The PNR reported only seven deaths so far, and hundreds
injured, scattered for treatment in various hospitals near the
site of the collision. But earlier report said 10 people were
killed.
</P>
<P>
However, Recede said, the PNR has not yet determined why the
coupler separated from the engine of commuter train 302.
</P>
<P>
Train 302 had just left Sucat station for the next stop at
Bicutan when its three coaches suddenly jerked and started moving
backward, Recede said.
</P>
<P>
The fourth coach, which housed the engine, was left intact in
the middle of the railway tracks, and its driver and conductor
unharmed.
</P>
<P>
At this juncture, train 304, which had left Calamba for Manila,
was coming in to Bicutan station. There was no way out for its
driver, and it crashed headlong onto the earlier train.
</P>
<P>
Both trains have a normal capacity of 106 passengers per coach,
but during rush hours, passengers defy PNR rules and occupy even
the roofs and spaces between coaches.
</P>
<P>
Recede said the PNR has dispatched emergency medical teams to
the scene of the accident, and coordinating the disposition of
bodies strewn all over the place.
</P>
<P>
He also revealed that the commuter trains were fitted in the
early 70's and maintained properly through the years.

<HEADLINE> 40 More Palestinians Arrested by Israeli forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli security forces
have arrested more than 40 Hamas activists in the West bank villages
around Nablus area since Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli authorities have claimed that they were carrying
out the mass arrest after receiving information that Islamic
extremists had been planning to carry out an attack in Nablus,
local press said today.
</P>
<P>
This arrest operation is conducted as a part of the activities
to deter terror and smash Hamas' infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
For this campaign, the Israeli security mobilized the soldiers
of the Golani Brigade, undercover troops, paratroopers and border
policemen. They first clamped curfews and then raided the targets
they planned for.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli security forces Saturday night swept down a village
in the Nablus area. They asked the Palestinian local police to
remain in their station before carrying out their raid on several
Palestinian houses.
</P>
<P>
They surrounded the village, cut off telephone lines and
rounded up hundreds of villagers at a local girl school. 20 to 30
of the villagers were taken into custody by Israeli forces after
questioning.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 Palestinians have been arrested since the
suicide bomb attacks in Jerusalem on July 30 and September 4
that killed 25 people.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National authority (PNA) and the Israeli
government have different explanations over the arrests. The
Israeli side said these Palestinians arrested are suspects
affiliated with Hamas or Islamic Jihad, two Islamic resistance
groups of Palestine. The PNA accused such arrests, saying they
were conducted within the PNA territories without solid
evidence.

<HEADLINE> China to Speed up Infrastructural Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 22 (Xinhua) -- China will accelerate its
infrastructural construction in the next 20-odd years through a
series of new measures, Yao Zhenyan, governor of the State
Development Bank of China, said here today.
</P>
<P>
At a World Bank seminar entitled "21st Century's Economy of
China," Yao said the Chinese government has set special
construction funds for power industry, railways, post and
telecommunication services, highways and ports to support the
development of the key infrastructural projects.
</P>
<P>
The central and local governments will jointly fund the key
projects, and the central government will adopt favorable policies
toward the infrastructural projects in the central and western
regions, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government also encourages foreign investment to
join in China's infrastructural construction, he said, adding that
foreign funds are expected to be put into hydropower projects,
construction of local railways, urban subways and highways, and
civil airports.
</P>
<P>
He said China has set up the development bank to support the
key state infrastructural projects.
</P>
<P>
According to Yao, by the end of 1996, the bank has allocated
284.2 billion yuan (33.8 billion U.S. dollars) for the key
projects in communications and power industry.
</P>
<P>
From 1979 to 1996, China's power generating capacity increased
by 8.3 percent per year. By the end of 1996, the installing
capacity of the power industry reached 236 million kilowatts and
the generating capacity was 107.94 billion kilowatt hours, which
ranks second in the world.
</P>
<P>
On the communication and transportation industry, he said that
in the past five years, the length of China's railways has
extended 4,365 kilometers to more than 60,000 kilometers; the
newly built and re-constructed highways were 100,000 kilometers
with 19,000-kilometer high-grade ones. China now has 406 deep
water berths and 142 civil airports.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, China's infrastructural basis is still weak
compared with the developed countries and it expects to be further
enhanced in the next two decades.
</P>
<P>
Jack Cizain, vice-president of the International Division of
Electricite de France, said his company was very much impressed by
the rapid growth of China's power industry in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
China will create a new situation in its infrastructural
construction to face new finance challenges, he added.
</P>
<P>
He also said he was confident about China's power market and
expects further cooperation with China's power industry.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Ferrigno, president and chief executive officer of
Prudential Asia Infrastructure Investors Ltd., said China has lots
of successful projects in infrastructural construction.
</P>
<P>
He advised Chinese government officials in charge of business
affairs to know more about risks in allocation of financial
resources and to make more efforts in perfecting legal systems.
</P>
<P>
China has the capacity to make its market more attractive to
the world in the future, Ferrigno said.

<P>
BEIJING, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The defense ministers of
China and Gabon held talks in Beijing today, agreeing that recent
years have witnessed successful cooperation between the two
countries in political, economic and cultural areas, and that
bilateral military contacts and cooperation have been satisfying
as well.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Minister of National Defense Chi Haotian, who is also
vice-chairman of China's Central Military Commission and a state
councilor, told Gabonese Defense Minister Idriss Ngari that China
and Gabon share a tradition of friendship.
</P>
<P>
Chi said he believed Ngari's current visit will certainly
deepen mutual understanding and promote the existing friendly
cooperation between the two countries and their armed forces.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the Chinese side has consistently attached
significance to its cooperation and military ties with the
Gabonese.
</P>
<P>
He also extended his appreciation to the Gabonese Government
for its "one China" stand.
</P>
<P>
Ngari said although many global changes have taken place in
recent years, the cooperation of friendship between the two
countries has grown steadily.
</P>
<P>
He said Gabon, as a good friend of China, will not change its
policies toward China. No country in the world could sever Gabon's
friendly relationship with China, he added.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his satisfaction with the sound development of
Gabonese-Chinese military ties and hoped they could be further
tightened.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Vice-Premier Zhu on Reform of State-owned Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 22 (Xinhua) -- China is striving to lead
most of its loss-making enterprises out of their present plight in
three years, Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji said today at a seminar on
China's economic development prospects in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The focus of China's present economic restructuring is the
reform of the state-owned enterprises, Zhu said at the seminar
sponsored by the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
With the adoption of the principle of parallel development of
various economic sectors with the public ownership as the mainstay
after the launching of the reform and opening-up, the non-public
sector has gained rapid development and seen an increasingly
bigger proportion in the national economy without prejudicing the
mainstay status of the public sector in the national economy, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The public sector includes not only the state-owned enterprises
and the collective economy, but also the mixed economy, such as
the state-owned and collectively-owned elements in the
share-holding companies.
</P>
<P>
The mainstay status of the state-owned sector is mainly
reflected in the ability to control the national economy, rather
than the simple proportion. "This new theoretic breakthrough will
surely bring about breakthroughs in a number of major aspects of
the reforms of these enterprises," he noted.
</P>
<P>
After years of reforms, China has formed a thought about the
reform and development of the state-owned enterprises and
identified a number of appropriate measures, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
What is urgent now is to set up a new investment system in
which the roles of the government and the enterprises are
separated, reform and improve the financial system to make it
modern, establish and improve a set of social security system, Zhu
said.
</P>
<P>
The reform of the financial system is of great significance to
the building of a socialist market economy in China and the reform
of the state-owned enterprises, he said. Major steps have been
taken in this field over recent years.
</P>
<P>
China has strengthened the functions of the central bank,
separated policy-based funding from commercial loans, developed
markets in securities, foreign exchange and inter-bank borrowing,
introduced single exchange rates and made the country's currency
of RMB convertible under the current accounts.
</P>
<P>
To step up the reform of the financial systems, China will
strengthen the currency regulation function of the central bank
and the financial supervisory systems and promote the
commercialization of state-owned banks, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
China will also improve the capital structure and quality of
the commercial banks, vigorously but steadily develop and regulate
 the financial market, improve and enact financial laws and
regulations, learn modern financial management expertise to
improve the management, he added.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 22 (Xinhua) -- British Defense
Secretary George Robertson arrived here today on a three-day
official visit to boost British-Kuwaiti military relations.
</P>
<P>
This was the first visit by a British defense minister to the
sensitive Gulf region since Britain's Labor government took office
in May this year.
</P>
<P>
Robertson's visit here was part of his Gulf tour which already
took him to Oman and will take him to the United Arab
Emirates.
</P>
<P>
British diplomatic sources here said that during the visit
Robertson will meet Kuwaiti Emir Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah,
his Kuwaiti counterpart Sheikh Salem Al-Sabah and Kuwaiti acting
Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh Salem Al-Sabah to
discuss defense matters.
</P>
<P>
He will also visit a British ship taking part in the mission of
enforcing international sanctions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>

assumed power in Mary that it would continue the policy undertaken
by the previous administration to ensure Kuwait's stability and
security.
</P>
<P>
The two countries reiterated their determination to strengthen
defense cooperation in all fields during Kuwaiti Defense Minister
Sheik Salem Sabah Al-Salem Al-Sabah's visit to London last
February.

<HEADLINE> Promotion Event To Be Held To Attract More Hong Kong Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 22 (Xinhua) -- An investment promotion event
will be held in Hong Kong early next month for the purpose of
encouraging more investment into China's mainland, especially the
inland area, from this special administrative region.
</P>
<P>
According to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Co-operation (MOFTEC), the organizer of the event, the promotion
and a subsequent investment symposium are scheduled from October
7-11.
</P>
<P>
The annual activity, also the first large trade promotion event
organized by the ministry in Hong King since its return to the
motherland, boasts the largest number of participants as well as
projects since the event was kicked off in 1994, according to
Deputy Director of the Foreign Investment Administration of the
MOFTEC Hu Jingyan.
</P>
<P>
China's 29 provinces, cities and autonomous regions, including
14 from the inland area, will send a 250-member delegation with a
total of 889 projects to the event.
</P>
<P>
Heilongjiang Province in northeast China, with 91 projects,
ranks first in terms of quantity, and the Tibet Autonomous Region
will participate for the first time, bringing along 19 projects.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing and construction projects are on the top of the
list, with totals of 553 and 127 respectively, accounting for 62.2
and 14.3 percent of the entire number.
</P>
<P>
At the symposium to be held following the event, officials from
MOFTEC, the State Planning Commission, and other government
departments will give a thorough explanation of China's foreign
investment policy, the long-term plan for national economic
development and its priority, China's financial market, tax system
for foreign companies, as well as new policies of customs
supervision and control.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Hong Kong, as the mainland's largest
source of foreign investment, had funneled an accumulated 109.5
billion US dollars of funding into the mainland by the end of the
first half of 1997.
</P>
<P>
This event, according to Hu, is expected to further strengthen
the economic and trade ties between China's mainland and Hong
Kong, and enhance Hong Kong people's understanding about the
mainland's policy on drawing direct investment, especially to the
middle and western parts of the country.

<HEADLINE> South Korean President's Son Demanded 7-year Imprisonment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 22 (Xinhua) -- South Korean prosecutors
demanded Monday a seven-year jail term as well as huge fines for
president Kim Young-sam's son, Kim Hyun-chul, on charges of
receiving bribes and tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Prosecutor's office demanded Junior Kim 1.5 billion
won (1.67 million U.S. dollars) in fines on alleged tax evasion
and ordered return of an additional 3,274.2 million won (3.82
million dollars) on alleged bribes.
</P>
<P>
Junior Kim, 38, was arrested May 17 on charges of
influence-peddling and tax evasion. It was found that he received
a total of 6.61 billion won (7.36 million dollars) from six
businessmen from 1993 until the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
In a trial session at the Seoul District Court, the prosecution
stated that the case involving Kim Hyun-chul was an illegal and
corrupt scandal committed by core people within the power group.
</P>
<P>
"Their acceptance of large amounts of money from businesses
over an extended period of time cannot be justified under any
circumstances," the prosecution said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, prison terms ranging from 1.5 to five years were
also sought by the prosecution for other five defendants in the
case, including former senior intelligence official Kim Ki-sup and
Junior Kim's close aide Par tae-jung.
</P>
<P>
The ruling trial for Junior Kim and the other defendants is
scheduled to be held on October 13, according to the court
sources.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets Finnish President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said here today that China is satisfied with the positive
development trend of the Sino-Finish relationship, and thanked the
Finnish government for its efforts to promote bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the comment at a meeting with Finnish President
Martti Ahtisaari, who stopped in China on his way to Japan.
</P>
<P>
Extending a welcome to Ahtisaari, Jiang said it is his first
meeting with a foreign head of state since the 15th National
Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC), at which he was
again elected General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Jiang recalled that the meeting was his fourth with the Finnish
President since 1995, when the two men first met in Moscow to
attend celebrations marking the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
Last year, President Ahtisaari visited China and the two
leaders had productive talks. Jiang said that at the turn of the
century, leaders of the two countries should keep frequent
contacts and exchange of views on bilateral and international
issues, which would be conducive to deepening mutual understanding
and enhancing cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-Finnish ties have been normal and good, Jiang
said. Especially in recent years, the cooperation between the two
sides has continued to develop in political, economic and all
other fields. The bilateral exchanges in cultural, educational and
judicial areas have also been extensive.
</P>
<P>
He said China highly values its economic and trade relations
with Finland, adding that the economies of the two countries are
complementary and hold bright promise for future cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Jiang hoped that the two governments would encourage their
enterprises to strengthen direct contacts and cooperation. He
believed the Sino-Finnish economic ties and trade would develop
further with the joint efforts of the two sides.

<HEADLINE> Haze Blankets Parts of Southern Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- A gray haze has blanketed part
of the Southern Philippines for over two weeks, although a weather
bureau official cannot confirm if this is part of the haze
affecting Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine News Agency reported today that the greater part
of the Southern Mindanao, including the southern city of
Zamboanga, have been blanketed by the haze.
</P>
<P>
The Bureau of Air Transportation has already banned the takeoff
or landing of aircraft in the Zamboanga International Airport
since four days ago due to a "moderate haze" now blankets the city
and the airport, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
With this ruling, only instrument-rated pilots and aircraft
equipped for instrument landing are allowed to land airport.
</P>
<P>
Sarrama Sahi, officer-in-charge of the Philippine Atmospheric,
Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration, said that
the "haze" in Zamboanga is "unusual".
</P>
<P>
But her office cannot check the nature of the haze as there are
no facilities or equipment available to do that.
</P>
<P>
Mindanao and parts of the Visayas are within the same longitude
as these Asian countries which have been affected by the haze
caused by forest fires in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
In Zamboanga, residents have noted the haze as early as two
weeks ago, but took no special notice until the other Monday, when
the haze was not followed by heavy rains, as clouds usually do.
</P>
<P>
Sahi said this is the "first time" she noted this kind of haze
which reduced visibility to as short as a minimum of 5,000 meters
from her office located at the Zamboanga International Airport.
</P>
<P>
While the country's general outlook is that of cloudy because
of an "intertropical convergence zone," she said she cannot
explain why the nearby mountains, usually visible on sunny days,
have been covered by haze since over a week ago.
</P>
<P>
In the morning, the sun is just an orange ball and the average
visibility during the day is that experienced during an eclipse of
the sun.
</P>
<P>
In Basilan Province, the southern Mindanao, residents have
noted the haze for over a week because the Malanawi Island,
located across the local wharf, appears only as a hazy outline, as
if rains are falling across the waterline, although there are no
rains at all.
</P>
<P>
Resident in other part of southern Mindanao also reported that
big mountains about 10 kilometers away have disappeared in the
haze.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Inter-Bank Foreign Currency Trade Goes Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The inter-bank foreign currency
market in Vietnam has traded a total of 4.2 billion U.S. dollars
in the first eight months of this year, local reports said today.
</P>
<P>
The figure shows a remarkable increase of the money flowing
through the market, compared to 2.3 billion U.S. dollars in 1996
and 934 million dollars in 1995, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The inter-bank foreign currency market in the country, almost
trebling its size since its establishment in late 1994, consists
of 58 members including four state commercial banks, 28 joint
stock banks, 20 branches of foreign banks and two financial
companies.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's inter-bank foreign currency market has contributed to
balancing the domestic supply and demand for foreign currencies
and organizing and controlling foreign currency business as well
as preparing for setup of a foreign exchange market, the report
said.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Air Force Planes Join Massive War Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 22 (Xinhua) -- More than 150 jet fighters
and cargo planes took part in the ongoing massive war games near

</P>
<P>
According to the official news agency IRNA today, Brigadier

<HEADLINE> Zhu Rongji Upbeat about China's Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Zhu
Rongji here today told bankers and businessmen from all over the
world present at a World Bank seminar that he is positive that
China's present good economic situation will last.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a keynote speech at the seminar to envisage China's
economy in the 21st century, Zhu said that his confidence was
based on China's many favorable conditions, especially the correct
road that China has found which is suitable to the Chinese
conditions and will, step by step, lead China to modernization.
</P>
<P>
"This is what we call the road of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics" as pointed out by late Chinese leader
Deng Xiaoping, he said.
</P>
<P>
The just-concluded 15th National Congress of the Communist
Party of China (CPC) has laid out an all-round strategy for the
country's reform, opening-up and socialist modernization drive,
Zhu added.
</P>
<P>
He said that according to the plan, China's economy will grow
by eight percent per annum in the final years of this century and
the economy is expected to maintain a seven percent annual growth
rate for the first decade of the next century. This is very
similar to the forecast by the World Bank on China's development
up to 2020.
</P>
<P>
Great changes have taken place in China since the country
launched the reform and opening-up program in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, China has reversed the once-overheating of the
economy and has brought inflation under control, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
The price rise dropped to 1.4 percent in the first eight months
of this year and this year's economic growth rate is expected to
remain at around 10 percent. "We may say that China's economy has
not been so good for many years," he added.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, the annual increase of the grain output
reached over 20 million tons with another bumper harvest of summer
crops this year, Zhu said. Owing to climatic reasons, there may be
a fall in the autumn crop production, but the grain production of
the whole year will not be much lower than that of last year.
</P>
<P>
The adequate grain supply has helped stabilize the food prices
which account for a big portion of the daily consumption of the
Chinese people. This is an important reason for the rapid drop in
the price rise, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The foreign direct investment has amounted to over 100 billion
U.S. dollars in the three years between 1994 and 1996, about twice
that over a period of more than 10 years before 1994.
</P>
<P>
"There has also been a substantial increase in the foreign
exchange reserve from 18 billion U.S. dollars in 1993 to 131.6
billion now," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
"Some foreign friends are wondering whether this good economic
situation in China will last and whether there will be new
inflation," Zhu noted. "I am positive about the former. With the
experience gained in the past three years, we have already found
the methods to guard against and bring down inflation."
</P>
<P>
"So long as we continue to adopt these methods which prove to
be effective, this good economic situation will be consolidated
and last," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Tea Leaf Pilfering Gets Serious in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Safeguarding tea bushes in
the night has become a very difficult task to small tea farmers in
Sri Lanka these days as pilfering of green leaves is on the rise.
</P>
<P>
The local press reported today that stealing green leaves has
become very common in the tea growing areas of Matugama,
Agalawatta and Bulathsinhala, in Western Province.
</P>
<P>
Many pilferers started stealing, even robbing of other people's
tea leaves in the darkness of nights to earn a fast buck.
</P>
<P>
Green leaves are sold at an all time high price of 20 to 24
Rupees (0.34 to 0.41 U.S. dollars) a kilogram in these regions.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the small tea farmers in the area have
complained that safeguarding their plants from thieves has become
a difficult task for them, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Night watchers have been employed in some large tea
plantations.
</P>
<P>
But those small tea growers cannot afford to hire night
watchers. Most farmers keep the midnight oil burning to guard
their holdings.

<HEADLINE> Vice-Premier Zhu on China's Opening-up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Zhu
Rongji reiterated China's basic policy of opening up to the
outside world here today at a seminar sponsored by the World Bank
on China's economic development prospects in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a keynote speech at the seminar, Zhu said that China
will continue to follow unswervingly the opening-up policy and
march to the world even more confidently.
</P>
<P>
He told the bankers and entrepreneurs present at the seminar
that China will reintroduce certain policy incentives towards the
import of equipment needed for the foreign-invested projects.
</P>
<P>
But these projects must conform to the industrial policies of
China and bring about new technologies, instead of repetitive
construction at low technological level, Zhu added.
</P>
<P>
He said that China has recently announced a sharp reduction of
the import and export tariffs effective from October 1, 1997,
involving more than 4,800 duty paragraphs of commodities, or more
than 73 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
After the reduction, the average tariffs will drop from 23
percent to 17 percent, down 26 percent. China has also undertaken
to reduce the customs level to the average level of developing
countries by the end of this century.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier said that China will steadily open up the
market in light of the needs of reform and development.
</P>
<P>
"We will expedite the opening up of such infrastructure
industries as energy and communications and open up the service
sectors such as banking and domestic and foreign trade in a
step-by-step fashion," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
He promised that China will protect the rights and interests of
foreign-funded enterprises according to law and grant them
national treatment so that all enterprises, Chinese or
foreign-funded, may compete on an equal footing.
</P>
<P>
Zhu also promised to improve the foreign-related legislation to
increase the transparency of trade regime, protect intellectual
property rights and improve trade and investment environment.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier said that in the last five years of this
century China will add 80,000 MW to the installed capacity of
power generation, build 16,000 km railway lines and 2,800 km
expressway, lay a total length of 150,000 km of fiber optic lines
and install 80 million telephone switchboards. China's export and
import are expected to reach 400 billion U.S. dollars by the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
He welcomed all the friends from the industry and business
community present at the seminar to make investment in China and
to compete in the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that China has actively participated in regional
economic cooperation and global multilateral trade system and has
made enormous efforts for its accession to the World Trade
Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
But it is unreasonable to make excessive demands on China,
which is a developing country, Zhu added.
</P>
<P>
"China's entry into WTO will benefit not only China's economic
development, but also world economic growth," Zhu said.

HONG KONG, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The Development Committee
of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) agreed
to make further efforts to fight the global problem of
corruption, the committee's Chairman Driss Jettou said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference following the 56th meeting of the
committee here, Jettou said participants at the meeting had
agreed that corruption and weak governance undermine
macro-economic stability, private sector activity and sustainable
development objectives, and may erode international support for
development cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The participants emphasized that corruption is a global problem
that requires complementary actions by all countries, according
to Jettou, who is also Moroccan Finance Minister.
</P>
<P>
While stressing that member governments have the primary
responsibility for combating corruption and strengthening
governance, the participants welcomed the more active involvement
of the Bank and the IMF, each within their respective mandate, in
responding to member governments' requests to strengthen their
institutions and performance in these areas.

<P>
HONG KONG, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Zhu
Rongji said here today that China has attached great importance to
and adopted positive measures in warding off financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Today's China enjoys abundance in its foreign exchange
reserve, stability of the currency value of the RMB and a stable
financial situation with sound development," Zhu told a World Bank
seminar on China's economic development prospects in the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the necessity and usefulness for national and
international financial institutions to increase information
exchange and cooperation so as to "protect us from financial
risks".
</P>
<P>
Recently, he said, some of the Southeast Asian countries have
experienced financial volatility to varying degrees. "They are
taking measures to cope with the situation and the International
Monetary Fund is also vigorously organizing assistance."
</P>
<P>
"As far as I can see, the overall situation is taking a turn
for the better," he noted, saying that "given the rapid economic
development these countries have experienced in the past decade
and more and the industrial basis they have established, I'm fully
confident that they will be able to overcome the present
difficulty, successfully conduct economic restructuring, and
develop their economies steadily."

<P>
JERUSALEM, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Two Israeli embassy
emissaries in Amman, Jordan were attacked today by terrorists and
were lightly injured, Israeli Foreign Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Both the injured emissaries are receiving treatment in a
Jordanian hospital, the ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Jordan policemen are hunting the attackers who opened fire from
a passing vehicle on the Israelis at about 07:30 local time
today. And the Jordanian authorities are cooperating with the
Israeli Embassy in Jordan in handling this matter, the Ministry
added.
</P>
<P>
This is the third terrorist attack on Israelis in Jordan in
the last six months. A Jordanian soldier opened fire and killed
seven Israeli schoolgirls on March 13 and was sentenced to life
imprisonment in July. A Israeli woman tourist was stabbed in
Jordan last April.
</P>
<P>
The assassination attempt came at a time when the Middle East
peace process have been deadlocked for months and the Palestinians
are protesting against Israeli Jews over their occupation of
houses in Ras al-Amud Arab neighborhood in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Jordan signed peace treaty with Israel in 1994 despite
opposition by many Jordanians, especially by those citizens who

<P>
KAMPALA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Poaching appeared in western
Uganda in recent years where a chimpanzee penis sold at 10,000
Ugandan Shillings (some ten U.S. Dollars), a report reaching here
said.
</P>
<P>
Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA) officials said police detained
some suspected poachers in Fort Portal of western Uganda last
week.
</P>
<P>
Kibale National Park in the west of the country reported to
UWA that at least five chimpanzees have been killed since August
1994, four of them this year. The chimpanzees have been killed
both in conflicts with villagers and by poachers around the park.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of poaching, there appeared trafficking of
chimpanzee parts in the bordering areas between Uganda and the
Democratic Republic of Congo, the report said.
</P>
<P>
A skeleton of a chimpanzee sold at 50,000 to 60,000 Uganda
Shillings (some 60 U.S. dollars), the report added.
</P>
<P>
Researchers noted that expanding cultivation reduced the
surviving space for chimpanzees which invaded into plantations of
local peasants for food, causing conflicts between local people
and the beasts.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Help Indonesia Fight Forest Fires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia will send a
fire-fighting team to Indonesia to help put out its forest fires
which resulted in serious haze affecting Malaysia and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The team comprising members of the Special Malaysian Assistance
Rescue Team (SMART) and Fire and Rescue Services Department
personnel would take with them equipment to draw water from
underground wells in the fire-fighting operation, Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad told a news conference here today after
chairing a meeting of the Disaster Management and Relief
Committee.
</P>
<P>
This would be another effort by Malaysia in addition to its
assistance to help Indonesia in its cloud-seeding exercise in
tackling the haze problem.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir, who is the Director of the National Operation
Council, said that the committee studied the overall haze
situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
The haze which worsened recently led the Malaysian government
to declare on September 19 a state of haze emergency in Sarawak,
East Malaysia, which is still in force because of the very high
level of air pollution in the state.
</P>
<P>
The air quality in Sarawak was recorded at "hazardous" level
with an air pollutant index (API) reading of 569 in Kuching, the
state's capital, at 11am today compared with an API reading of 366
yesterday morning, according to an Environment Department
statement.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said, "We have agreed with the Indonesian authorities
that the Kuching airport would be used as the base in the
cloud-seeding exercise."
</P>
<P>
He said that more aircraft would be used in addition to the
existing eight in the cloud-seeding exercise in the country and
the same aircraft would be used to assist Indonesia in its
cloud-seeding exercise.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir told the news conference that the French researchers
sent here to study the haze situation in Malaysia returned to
France yesterday to draw up a form of assistance to be provided to
Malaysia to tackle the haze problem.
</P>
<P>
He said that assistance had also been sought from Japan which
had offered "jet-shooters" for the fire-fighting operation.
</P>
<P>
"We realize the problem cannot be overcome easily but we will
try our best," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir also suggested several measures that could be taken by
the public during the haze, saying that besides using masks, the
public should minimize the use of private vehicles in efforts to
reduce smoke emission.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir also said that the committee agreed that kindergartens
should be closed when the air pollutant index reading reaches 300.
</P>
<P>
He said that besides the closure of schools in the event that
the API reading reaches 400, outdoor activities should also be
reduced to prevent too much exposure to the haze.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir also made another appeal to factories to stop the
burning of wastes to help overcome the problem.
</P>
<P>
According to the API issued by the Environment Department, the
air quality throughout the country worsened with the Air
Pollutant Index (API) for 11am today showing many areas becoming
unhealthy or hazardous.
</P>
<P>
It said that besides Kuching, the air quality over Nilai in the
Negeri Sembilan state and Gombak, Kuala Lumpur's suburb was at a
hazardous level with the API Index of 306 and 301 respectively.
</P>
<P>
The air quality over Kuala Lumpur was recorded at "very
unhealthy" level with an API reading of 233 compared to 197 at 8am
today.

<HEADLINE> Mount Kilimanjaro Fire Put Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 22 (Xinhua) -- An outbreak of fire
ravaging forests on the slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro for the last
two weeks has been put out, according to a news dispatch from
Moshi, northern Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The raging fire was put out owing to the concerted efforts of
the local residents and specialized fire fighting personnel, said
Lorivole Moirana, chief warden for the Kilimanjaro National Park
Authority, when he reported to Vice-President Omar Juma at the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
The fire started on September 4, affecting an estimated 109
square kilometers of bush and forest, which represented 10,900
hectares of forest cover.
</P>
<P>
A Tanzania National Parks plane was used to locate the
boundaries of the ravaging fire after it reached the 3,600 meter
altitude and was spreading towards the slopes of the mountain
which are difficult to access on foot.
</P>
<P>
The fire could have been started by campers since it started
at the Machame tourist camp, Moirana said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Braces for Upcoming Drought Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government,
girding itself for another drought, has set aside 1.5 billion
Zimbabwe Dollars (130 million U.S. Dollars) for the import of
maize to ensure the national strategic grain reserves are full,
and that seeds for drought-resistant crops are readily available.
</P>
<P>
The financing facility will only be used if the drought, which
is expected to hit the whole of southern Africa next season,
occurs.
</P>
<P>
Kumbirai Kangai, Minister of Lands and Agriculture said at the
weekend that Zimbabwe was this time better prepared to combat the
drought than it was in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Food stocks carry-overs were higher than during the 1991/92
season when the severest drought in living memory struck.
</P>
<P>
Most of the country's water reservoirs were almost full, and
if the available supplies were used properly, there should be no
problems, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe had learnt a lesson from the great drought in 1992,
Kangai noted, hence the establishment of the national strategic
grain reserves which have a maximum capacity of 936,000 tons of
maize.
</P>
<P>
The maize was enough to feed the nation for at least four
months, which is enough to prepare for imports if there was need
to do so.
</P>
<P>
"We don't want the 1992 situation to be repeated where long
queues for mealie-meal were a common sight everywhere," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
On maize exports, the minister said, it was government policy
not to export until the stragetic reserve was full.
</P>
<P>
"We always ensure that the strategic grain reserves are filled
at the end of each season before we can start exporting maize,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Farmers Compensated for Slaughtering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has
released 764 Kwacha (about 600,000 U.S. Dollars) to compensate
farmers for slaughtering their cattle infected with contagious
bovine pleuro-pneumonia diease (CBPP) that threatens the
country's economy, Zambia Daily Mail reported today.
</P>
<P>
At a news briefing at the weekend, Edith Nawakwi, Minister of
Agriculture, Food and Fisheries told reporters that 764 million
Kwacha has been released for operations and compensation to
cattle farmers in western province whose animals will be
slaughtered in a bid to curb the spread of CBPP.
</P>
<P>
CBPP, a deadly cattle lung disease second only to rinderpest
in deaths and destruction, was first reported in Botswana, where
it has claimed hundreds of thousands of cattle. The disease now
has spread to Angola, Zambia, Tanzania and Namibia.
</P>
<P>
Since April, the Zambian government has taken urgent measures
to contain the spread of the disease by banning cattle movement
and slaughtering all the infected cattle.
</P>
<P>
Western province is the most seriously affected area where
about 200 herds have been slaughtered and 1,800 more are expected
to be killed in later months.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural minister appealed to farmers to slaughter all
their infected cattle without delay, warning that the deadly
disease is threatening directly the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
Nawakwi assured that compensation for farmers at market value
will be made immediately before the slaughter of infected cattle.
</P>
<P>
She also thanked the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO)
and the Netherlands government for their response to her
ministry's appeal for funds and extension activities to help
eradicate the disease and called for more support from other
cooperating partners.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Backs Reforms in "Transition Countries" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Johannes Linn, the World
Bank's vice-president for Europe and Central Asia, said today that
the bank would support market-oriented reforms in the "transition
countries," or countries of the former Soviet Union and Eastern
Europe.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference here, Linn said that progress in
the transition to market-based economies varies considerably
across the East European and Central Asian countries, as do
countries' policy priorities and resulting economic growth.
</P>
<P>
"The objective of eventual membership in the European Union
(EU) unifies the challenges of many of the Central and Eastern
European countries, and in fiscal 1997 the World Bank's assistance
strategy for these countries focused on supporting them in their
preparations," said Linn, who joined the World Bank in 1993.
</P>
<P>
In response to questions from reporters, Linn said that as
these countries benefit from large private financial flows, the
World Bank's attention is focused on systemic economic issues,
increasingly through non-lending services.
</P>
<P>
For the countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States
(CIS), or the former Soviet republics, "the challenges, and thus
the assistance strategy, are different," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He said: "Here the emphasis is to help these countries make
their fiscal adjustment more sustainable and efficient, strengthen
law enforcement, basic social services, and safety nets, and
accelerate the implementation of the numerous market-oriented
reforms that remain."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he stressed the need for all the "transition
countries" to work out right macroeconomic policies for
accelerating their economic growth. "If policy missed, one will be
quickly punished," he said.

<HEADLINE> UNESCO Urges for Girls' Scientific Education in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 22 (Xinhua) -- UNESCO has urged for
girls' scientific education, saying that negative attitude
towards science subjects and poor teaching methods have adversely
affected girls and women taking up science subjects in Africa.
</P>
<P>
This was of the view of a three-day consultative meeting of
the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization (UNESCO) last weekend.
</P>
<P>
Resolutions adopted at the meeting called for a reversal of
the trend by encouraging girls to pursue science subjects and a
complete view of science and mathematics curricula in schools.
</P>
<P>
Recommendations were made to involve more women teachers in
science subjects and their motivation.
</P>
<P>
It was observed that there is a go slow by some governments in
involving women in science and technology, suggesting an
about-turn is needed to bring scientific and technological
advancement in the new millennium. The meeting recommended for a
gender sensitive policy and commitment by respective governments
to involve women in science and technology.
</P>
<P>
The UNESCO meeting also urged for closer African cooperation
in science and technology and exchange of information. It
encouraged African countries to establish exclusive women
universities to have more female admitted to schools and higher
institutions of studies.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was attended by delegates from the Congo (K),
Ghana, Swaziland, Kenya, Uganda, Cote d'Ivoire, the Sudan and
Tanzania.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Businessmen Urged to Increase Gem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Minister for
Energy and Minerals Abdallah Kigoda has urged the country's
gemstone dealers to increase exports, the local newspaper Daily
News reported today.
</P>
<P>
The government has made efforts to enhance gemstone business
and endorsed waivers to boost the industry, Kigoda said in
Arusha, northern Tanzania on Sunday while meeting with gemstone
dealers.
</P>
<P>
He said the gemstone dealers should embark on aggressive
marketing by opening as many shops as possible and organizing
exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
The minister also urged for "smart partnership" between the
government and the dealers to avert smuggling, graft and
unnecessary red tape.
</P>
<P>
Kigoda cited the example that the government has waived or
reduced three important taxes which are a hindrance to increased
exports, avoiding unnecessary middlemen as well as curbing
smuggling.
</P>
<P>
"We need patriotic dealers who will help to revamp our
economy," Kigoda said, adding that the government is open to any
suggestion to improve the sector.
</P>
<P>
He called on the Tanzania Mineral Dealers Association
(TAMIDA), the Arusha Regional Minerals Association and the
Federation of Minerals in Tanzania to co-ordinate their
activities.
</P>
<P>
"The government's new approach will increase exports and
attract dealers which help to boost Tanzania's economy," said
TAMIDA Chairman Sammy Mollel while commending the government's
drive to improve the gemstone business.

<HEADLINE> Weevils Reduce Hyacinth on Ugandan Lake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The weevils introduced on
Lake Kyoga, central Uganda to control the water hyacinth have
effectively reduced the weed, local daily The New Vision reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Richard Molo from the Namulonge Agriculture Research Institute
near Kampala was quoted as saying that five years after the
weevils were put in Lake Kyoga, the once luxuriant weeds have
been reduced in size and height.
</P>
<P>
He said the height has been reduced from the average one and a
half metres to 60 centimeters.
</P>
<P>
The two species of weevils introduced on the lake in 1993 are
breeding faster than in central America, the countries of its
origin.
</P>
<P>
"Where the weevils have established themselves, there are now
mother plants without daughter plants which are being suppressed
by the weevils aggressively," said Molo.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the plants which have become individuals are
now susceptible to water wave action and are easily destroyed.
</P>
<P>
There was no longer extensive water hyacinth on the lake
because of weevil attack, he added.

<HEADLINE> China Urges Developed Economies to Act for Financial Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Minister of Finance
Liu Zhongli today urged the developed economies to make efforts
for stabilizing the global economic environment and safeguarding
the order of international financial market.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 56th Meeting of the Development Committee of
the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) here, Liu
said regional financial crises have occurred frequently in recent
years and they have caused substantial uncertainties to developing
countries' development and the global economy.
</P>
<P>
"Although the critical instruments for developing countries to
overcome such uncertainties is to strengthen their capacity in
maintaining sound economic fundamentals, the international
community, developed countries in particular, should also be
obliged to stabilize the global economic environment and to
safeguard the order of international financial market," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Minister also noted that "developed countries
should also take into account the implications for developing
countries when formulating their domestic macro-economic policies,
especially financial policies."
</P>
<P>
He said China welcomes the consensus between the World Bank and
the IMF in their cooperation in the financial area.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that when helping the countries concerned in dealing
with their financial crisis, the two institutions could also, on
the basis of their respective comparative advantages, explore the
policy alternatives for developing countries to maintain the
stability of the financial sector in an open economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We urge the two institutions to encourage the joint efforts by
developed and developing countries to protect the soundness of the
global economic integration," Liu added.
</P>
<P>
Touching upon the external environment faced by developing
countries during their process of opening up, he said the
present-day international economic environment characterized by
fast growth, low inflation and low interest rates, is in general
favorable.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the developing countries are taking the
opportunity to accelerate their reforms and integration into the
world economy, he said. However, he added, "Developing countries
are faced with challenges of new risks in further opening up their
economy."
</P>
<P>
The currency turmoil which has hit some Southeast Asian
countries recently is one of the examples, he said.

<HEADLINE>   Japan's Cabinet Member Resigns for Involvement in Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Japan's newly named Management
and Coordination Agency Chief Koko Sato submitted his resignation
today, government spokesman Kanezo Muraoka said.
</P>
<P>
Just 11 days after his appointment to the cabinet, Sato buckled
under intense pressure and offered his resignation during a
meeting with Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto at the premier's
official residence.
</P>
<P>
Sato, 69, convicted of taking bribes in the 1970s Lockheed
payoff scandal, would be the first in the Hashimoto cabinet to
step down before completing his term.
</P>
<P>
Sato was named as a state minister in the cabinet reshuffle on
September 11, three days after Hashimoto won a second two-year
term as president of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).
</P>
<P>
His appointment to the cabinet, arousing fierce reaction that
the LDP did not anticipate, drew anger from the public, the
opposition, the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and New Party
Sakigake which are LDP's two non-cabinet allies, and even some
members within the LDP.
</P>
<P>
Sato, a member of Japan's House of Representatives, is the
first person convicted of a serious crime to join the cabinet in
the postwar period.
</P>
<P>
In May 1986, the Tokyo High Court sentenced Sato a two-year
imprisonment, charged with for taking 2 million yen (about 16,667
US dollars) of bribes in the Lockheed scandal.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Seeks Support to Speed up Privatization Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi government has
sought package assistance from donors for the success of its
ambitious privatization program, which was strongly opposed by
some labor unions and opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the donors make commitments in the next aid group
meeting to assist our privatization program," Privatization Board
Chairman Kazi Zafarullah told a meeting with a group of donors'
representatives here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said that assistance from the donors was
sought for three tasks -- workers' retraining, public awareness
program and payment of liabilities of the mills to be privatized.
</P>
<P>
However, the cost of the three programs, which will be placed
in the Aid Club meeting to be held here early in November, were
yet to be calculated.
</P>
<P>
To allay the apprehension aired by donors that the
privatization process might face a setback due to labor unrest and
political opposition, the government has approved the
privatization proposals of 12 state-owned enterprises (SOEs)
during the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
"These are substantial progress and the donors are extremely
impressed. They have understood that the government is firmly
committed to carrying out the privatization program," said
Zafarullah.
</P>
<P>
The Privatization Board has a target to offload a total of 106
SOEs during the current 1997-98 fiscal year. Of them, 52 were
slated to disinvest during the previous years while 54 new units
added to the list.

<HEADLINE> Belgian Soccer Federation Called for Tough Punishment after </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The Belgian soccer
federation Sunday demanded tough legal action against rowdy fans
who invaded pitches during three top division games this weekend.
</P>
<P>
In all three incidents, fans spilled onto the field after their
clubs conceded the last goal in humiliating losses. The games were
delayed until the fans were driven back into the stands.
</P>
<P>
Jan Peeters, secretary general of the Belgian soccer
federation, said: "These people need to be punished very
seriously."
</P>
<P>
Peeters told a local radio: "We still need a repressive
framework."
</P>
<P>
In the worst incident on Saturday, police had to drive back FC
Antwerp fans, who had demolished a fence and spilled onto the
field in Westerlo after their team conceded the fifth goal in a
5-2 drubbing by the first-division newcomer.
</P>
<P>
At Sint Truiden, several dozen local fans jumped over fences
and moved threateningly to the dugout of coach Barry Hulshoff
after their team conceded the final goal in a 5-0 defeat at the
hands of reigning champion Lierse.
</P>
<P>
Late Friday, dozens of Anderlecht fans scaled the metal fences
and stormed the field of Belgium's most famous club after
Anderlecht conceded a late goal for the third home defeat in a
row, a 2-1 loss to Mouscron.
</P>
<P>
The field invasions were the worst security incidents during
the Belgian season so far. Belgium hosts the 2000 European
Championships, together with the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Peeters said: "It's an indication that Euro 2000 has to devote
attention to that problem."

<HEADLINE> China's Growth Brings Multiple Opportunities, W.Bank Seminar Told </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 22 (Xinhua) -- China's rapid development
has brought and will continue to provide multiple opportunities to
all the countries in the world, senior officials and international
bankers attending a World Bank seminar said here today.
</P>
<P>
The sustained and fast economic growth will give rise to a huge
demand for imports and investments, according to consensus reached
at the seminar titled "China: Challenge and Prospects", which was
the opening session of a full-day program on China's economy on
the eve of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund annual
meetings.
</P>
<P>
Chen Jinhua, Chinese minister in charge of the State Planning
Commission, told more than 300 participants that China will be
able to maintain an eight percent annual growth and limit
inflation to less than five percent till early next century.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident that we can maintain such an economic
situation," he said, adding that there are favorable conditions
supporting the "high growth and low inflation" momentum.
</P>
<P>
China has a very large domestic market, and the growing need of
over a billion population for the improvement of their material
and cultural life will generate new demands which will in turn
stimulate the sustained rapid economic growth, he said.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Stiglitz, chief economist and senior vice-president of
the World Bank, agreed with Chen, citing a latest World Bank
research report that predicted China's hopes for a new century of
growth and prosperity can be met.
</P>
<P>
Forecasting that China's trade volume could reach nearly 10
percent of the world's total by 2020, Stiglitz said its rising
demand for capital and knowledge-intensive manufactures and
primary products will benefit many other countries.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that total demand for investment is estimated at
about 1.3 billion U.S. dollars in China in the next three years,
while the annual trade volume will hit 400 billion U.S. dollars by
the end of the century, with imports and exports basically
balanced.
</P>
<P>
"Such a large demand will greatly drive the growth of world
trade and economy, and provide excellent opportunities for
wide-ranging cooperation between China and the rest of the world,"
Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Holding the same view as Chen's, William Purves, chairman of
the British HSBC Holdings, stressed the importance of investing in
China with a long-term perspective.
</P>
<P>
Participating in the growth of the dynamic nation is "vital to
investors with truly international aspirations," Purves said.
</P>
<P>
Chen said a large number of joint ventures or solely foreign
funded ventures set up in China have rapidly expanded their
operations and increased their competitiveness, thus becoming the
leaders of performance among the globally distributed subsidiaries
of the multinationals.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that 294,000 foreign funded enterprises
have so far been registered in China, with a total of nearly 200
billion U.S. dollars of direct investment by overseas firms.
</P>
<P>
Some two-thirds of those enterprises are now profitable and
over 80 percent of the large and medium-sized foreign funded
enterprises are successful, Chen said.

The EU is also expected to grow more of its own tapioca,
according to Boonchai Srichaiyongpanich, president of the Tapioca
Trade Association of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Tapioca is one of Thailand's main agricultural exports along
with rubber, rice, frozen prawns and sugar.
</P>
<P>
Boonchai put EU tapioca imports at 200,000-250,000 tons per
month next year, compared with the current 300,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Thai tapioca manufacturers face a lack of funds for
buying fresh cassava from farmers, Boonchai said.
</P>
<P>
Commercial banks have lowered the amount of loan money
available to each manufacturer by 50-70 percent while at the same
time raising interest rates beyond 20 percent, the Bangkok Post
today quoted Boonchai as saying.
</P>
<P>
Boonchai urged the government to step in to help manufacturers
secure enough funds before the next cassava crop comes on the
market beginning next month.
</P>
<P>
The association has also urged the Bank for Agriculture and
Agricultural Cooperatives to extend the debt repayment period for
tapioca farmers. This would lessen the burden on farmers if
manufacturers are unable to buy as much cassava as usual.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Minister Urges World Bank to Support Developing Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hong Kong, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Minister of Finance
Liu Zhongli today urged the World Bank to provide direct financial
support to the infrastructure projects in the developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 56th Meeting of the Development Committee of
the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) here, Liu
noted that the Chinese government pays increasing attention to
the global issue of anti-corruption.
</P>
<P>
"We support the World Bank to implement the action plan in an
active and pragmatic way. Having said that, we are of the view
that the bank should continue to maintain and expand its
traditional lending operations, and to provide direct financial
support to the public financed infrastructure projects," Liu said.
</P>
<P>
He said: "Anti-corruption and governance improvement are issues
drawing attention from the governments all over the world
including the Chinese government."
</P>
<P>
However, Liu pointed out that sovereign countries' leading
position in domestic anti-corruption actions and international
cooperation in this field should be respected. The World Bank and
the IMF could provide assistance only upon the request from the
governments of their member-countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he expressed support for the recent actions of the
two international institutions in preventing corruption.
</P>
<P>
Touching upon operations of the Multilateral Investment
Guarantee Authority (MIGA), Liu said: "We have always been
supportive of MIGA's capital increase, and look forward to an
early solution." "The Chinese Government is ready to assume its
due responsibility to this end," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative
(HIPC) has moved into the stage of implementation. "We hope that
the concrete consensus will be reached between the multilateral
creditors and the Paris Club on the burden-sharing modality, which
will be able to reflect the principle of equitable
burden-sharing," he noted.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan is likely to
announce soon a new industrial policy which mainly targets
increase in the production and ultimately leading to export
surplus, a local newspaper reported here today.
</P>
<P>
"The major thrust of the government in the policy will be to
boost exports," the Frontier Post quoted official sources as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Carrying incentives both for increased investment and
production, the policy will not only re-activate the already
established industrial zones, but will also introduce new such
zones, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
"Establishment of a number of Pioneer Industrial Zones is on
the agenda of the government," said the sources.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the Pioneer Industrial Zones would offer
incentive packages on the pattern of the already existing zones.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the new zones will allow trading activity as a hub
of ware housing of imported produce and their re-export in freely
and convertible foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, the new industrial policy will be
followed by a package to lure domestic and foreign direct
investment.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Italian President Oscar Scalfaro
today called on the Italians to work together to confront the
challenges facing the country.
</P>
<P>
"Our country needs everyone, at all level," said Scalfaro in
Verona, a city in northern Italy, urging cooperation along "the
difficult road" that Italy faces toward joining the single
currency, solving the unemployment crisis and realizing
constitutional reforms.
</P>
<P>
"Italy has no need for enmity," he added.
</P>
<P>
As Scalfaro spoke, some 200 protesters of the separatist
Northern League confronted the riot police, advocating the
secession of northern Italy.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the efforts to solve the unemployment crisis and
reform the welfare state, Scalfaro said, "it is not easy to come
up with a concept of the welfare state until the maximum effort
has been made at all levels to erase this plague."
</P>
<P>
The work of parliament and the governments of different
levels was instrumental in this effort, said the president.
</P>
<P>
Scalfaro traveled to Verona for ceremonies commemorating an
Italian unit massacred by the Nazis in Cophalonia. He also urged
Italians to find inspiration in those who fought for freedom and
democracy to find "a new impulse, a new enthusiasm" to work
together for the common good.

<HEADLINE> Italy Lags Behind in Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Italy is the world's fifth
industrial power but only 10th in terms of direct foreign
investment, said a world investment report from the United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), released today.
</P>
<P>
The report reported a 10 percent rise in foreign investment
last year spurred by the accelerating globalization of world
markets.
</P>
<P>
Presenting the report here, UNCTAD's Gilberto Bonalumi, who is
director of the institute for relations between Italy, Africa,
Latin America and the Middle East, said Italy risked lagging even
further behind.
</P>
<P>
"We are the world's fifth biggest exporter but only 10th in
terms of foreign investment, a long way behind Canada," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It appears rather clear that if we Italians do not understand
that we have to start working more and more with foreign countries
rather that just for foreign markets, we risk being cut out of the
globalization process; and the report shows that this process is
very fast."

<P>
HANOI, September 22 (xinhua) -- Excessive numbers of foreign
auto-making joint ventures are competing for limited shares of
Vietnam's domestic market, leading to a large amount of wasted
investment capital, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, 14 such joint ventures with 31 different models have
been licensed by the Vietnamese government.
</P>
<P>
According to official estimates, Vietnam needs about 30,000
automobiles a year. However, the country imports about 20,000 cars,
mostly used, each year and this means that only 10,000 additional
automobiles are left for the joint manufacturers yearly.
</P>
<P>
By the time all 14 joint ventures are working, they will produce
about 800-1,000 cars per month for the local market.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Annual Coal Output Reaches 51 Million Tons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Coal production in Indonesia
currently reaches about 51 million tons per year, making it
capable of assuming the role of an important alternative energy
sources in the near future, an official said.
</P>
<P>
In 1980, national coal production stood at only 0.3 million
tons, while consumption totaled about 0.2 million tons, Soedjojo,
an official from the ministry of mines and energy, said here
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Domestic coal consumption for this year is estimated to reach
13 million tons, which means that the country will experience a
coal surplus of around 38 million tons, local press today quoted
the official as saying.
</P>
<P>
The production surplus will mostly be exported, he said,
referring to recent data which showed that in 1996 Indonesia
exported 36 million tons of coal.
</P>
<P>
Coal is also widely used as an energy source for some power
plants in the country. By the end of 1994, coal had helped
generate 2,100 megawatts of electricity.
</P>
<P>
According to Soedjoko, by the end of 2008, about 24,500
megawatts of electricity in Indonesia will be generated by the use
of coal.

<HEADLINE> HK Investors Rebuilding Dilapidated Bungalows in Tianjin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Investors from Hong Kong have
shown a great zeal toward reconstruction of dilapidated bungalows
in Tianjin, the largest port city in north China.
</P>
<P>
Information from the Tianjin Municipal Commission of Foreign Trade
and Economic Cooperation revealed that HK investors have started
436 real estate businesses, which involve an agreed use of 1.52
billion U.S. dollars of overseas funds, accounting for a half of
their respective total for overseas businesses and for the
contractual use of overseas funds.
</P>
<P>
New World Group and Henderson Properties Co. Ltd. have raced
far ahead of other investors from Hong Kong. On June 25 of last
year, New World Group signed a contract with Tianjin over
demolishing dilapidated bungalows on an area of 42 hectares in
the city's Nanshi District within five years.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, New World Group will also carry out real estate
development on 160 hectares of land in Tianjin's other districts.
Before this, it has cooperated with Tianjin in constructing 1.2
million sq m of flats under the Comfortable Living
Project, which is aimed at providing urban families with low and
moderate incomes. So far, a village of flats for teachers, with a
combined floor space of 240,000 sq m, has been completed.
</P>
<P>
Henderson Properties Co. Ltd. has also signed a contract with
Tianjin to make investment for rebuilding 2.24 million sq m of
dilapidated bungalows in Tianjin's old city area.
</P>
<P>
As the largest old industrial city in north China, Tianjin has
a lot of dilapidated bungalows that need to be reconstructed.
Owing to a lack of funds, the Tianjin Municipal Government decided to
mainly rely on overseas investment to reconstruct all dilapidated
bungalows in the city in five years beginning from 1994.
</P>
<P>
The city government has drafted a wide range of preferential
policies to encourage investors from overseas to make investment
in this aspect. The policies include exemption of fees for
government-provided supporting facilities and its responsibility of
pre-stage removal work.

<HEADLINE> China's Economy Becoming Increasingly Open: Vice-Premier Zhu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 22 (Xinhua) -- China's economy has become
increasingly open and it is still expanding its opening-up program
faster and more extensively, Chinese Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji said
here today.
</P>
<P>
"In today's China, the policy of reform and opening-up has been
deeply rooted in the hearts of the people and is irreversible,"
Zhu said in English at the 56th Meeting of the Development
Committee of the World Bank/International Monetary Fund in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
Zhu, who arrived in Hong Kong Sunday, said the reform and
opening-up have not only brought about a much stronger economy in
China, but also helped the country integrate itself gradually with
the world economy.
</P>
<P>
In the past 19 years, China's economy has all along maintained
a momentum of rapid growth with an average annual GNP growth rate
of 9.8 percent, he said. The planned target to quadruple the GNP
of 1980 by the year 2000 was achieved in 1995 ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to China's strenuous efforts, the poverty-stricken
population in the country was reduced from 250 million to about 50
million, he said, adding that the Chinese government is fully
confident about and capable of wiping out absolute poverty by the
end of this century.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, China's total foreign trade volume reached 290 billion
U.S. dollars, over 36 percent of the year's GNP, ranking 11th in
the world against the 32nd in 1978 when China began its reform and
opening-up program.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that China's trade volume will be further expanded to
400 billion U.S. dollars by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, with the improvement of China's investment
environment, a total of over 280 billion US dollars of external
capital has been actually used in China, of which over 170 billion
dollars are foreign direct investment.
</P>
<P>
China has been the largest foreign capital recipient among the
developing countries over the past three years, Zhu said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The Minsheng Bank
Corporation, the first non-government banking institution in
China, has decided to use more democratic and scientific methods
in future.
</P>
<P>
Bank executives will be limited in power and an examination and
supervision system will be set up in major departments, according
to Cai Lulun, who recently replaced Dong Yinzeng as president.
</P>
<P>
It was founded early last year, as a result of the country's
reform and opening-up drive and the rapidly developing private
economy, as a stock-issuing commercial bank with 85 percent of its
capital coming from private companies, Cai told Xinhua in a recent
interview. Its main clients are private businesses, which are a
rapidly-growing part of the national economy.
</P>
<P>
Minsheng now has 12 billion yuan in assets, according to
Cai. "The capital is small, but the key is the quality," he noted.
</P>
<P>
As a new bank, it needs to give priority to its share-holders,
he added, and should safeguard their interests, while they in turn
should act in accordance with the commercial bank law.

<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarian Writers' Association
Chairman Nikolai Khaitov said today that the decisions adopted
by the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China
(CPC) are "of world significance."
</P>
<P>
Khaitov, 78, who has been following the developments of the
socialist cause in China, said that China led by its outstanding
leader Deng Xiaoping has made great progress during the last two
decades.
</P>
<P>
One of the most important decisions of the CPC congress is to
put Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics into the party constitution as "a guiding
thought." It will not only guide the way for China's economic
modernization but also for its cultural advance, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Now that we have come to know the answer to 'what is socialism
and how to build socialism,' there are new prospects to spread
socialism in political practices in the whole world," he said.
</P>
<P>
Khaitov, who had a deep impression on the report given by
General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee Jiang Zemin at the
congress, said he really appreciated China's idea to build a world
of multi-polarization.
</P>
<P>
He believed that China's creative experience in politics and
economic development will reduce the differences between countries
of different sizes, strength and wealth, saying that this is the
biggest comfort that the CPC congress resolutions have offered to
people.

JAKARTA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The number of victims who
died of starvation and cholera rife in some subdistricts of
Indonesia's Irian Jaya province, has increased to 251, local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Jayawijaya district head Jb. Wenas said last night that till
Sunday afternoon the number of the victims rose to 251 people.
</P>
<P>
The worst-hit villages are Silimo, Pasema, Tangua, Siru, Soba,
Kurupu, Mapenduma and Mbua in Jayawijaya district, all of them
situated in remote areas, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
The breakout of cholera and food shortage started in mid-August
following a lingering drought in the country.
</P>
<P>
The number of the victims was predicted to increase as the
local people drank dirty water making them affected by cholera
because they lacked clear water for drink.
</P>
<P>
The local government had tried hard to send relief assistance
in the form of among other things foods and medicines as well as
physicians but it failed due to the thick smoke making the
aircraft carrying the relief aid unable to land on the disaster
sites.

CAIRO, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Brazil trounced Ghana 2-1
Sunday to carry away the gold cup at the 4th Under-17 World
Championship, avenging its loss to the African powerhouse at the
1995 final.
</P>
<P>
Since the kickoff, the sturdy Ghananians overpowered the
Brazilians with a storm of long shots and clipped their edge in
delivering fast passes.
</P>
<P>
In the 39th minute, Wisdom Abbey converted a short pass to a
left kick, passing over goalkeeper Fabio Maciel and slipping the
ball into the net.
</P>
<P>
The first half ended with the African title-holder taking a 1-0
lead. After the half time, Brazilians considerably sped up their
offensive and equalized 16 minutes into the second half.
</P>
<P>
In the 61st minute, Osel Boateng stopped a long shot only to
push it to Brazilian Matuzalem Silva, who dodged the defenders and
kicked it into the net, leaving the Ghanian goalie running for the
ball.
</P>
<P>
Boosted by the 1-1 tie, Brazilians went on a shooting spree and
could have well scored if the Ghanian guardian had done his job
less attentively.
</P>
<P>
But the crushing avalanche soon turned into a defensive game,
as Fabio Pinto, Brazil's winning-card, was given the only red card
of the match and fouled out.
</P>
<P>
Only three minutes before the final whistle, and after the
Ghanians flexed their muscles, the Brazilians netted their second
unexpected goal, by Andrey Mayr.
</P>
<P>
The South American samba dancers finally avenged their twice
defeat to the African talents.
</P>
<P>
In their two encounters at the Under-17 World Championship,
Ghana beat Brazil 2-1 in the quarter-finals in Italy in 1991 and
closely shaved Brazil 3-2 in the final in Ecuador in 1995.
</P>
<P>
In another match played Sunday before the final, Spain beat
Germany 2-1 to take the third place.
</P>
<P>
In the 31st minute, Ander Aranceta Lucena scored the first goal
for Spain with a header provided by Franquelo Sousa.
</P>
<P>
Germany got even in the 44th minute from a penalty kick by
Silvio Adzic.
</P>
<P>
Five minutes before time, German goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller
managed to stop a penalty kick from Sousa but failed to catch the
ball. Sousa retook the ball and pushed it into the net.
</P>
<P>
Altogether 16 teams played 32 matches at the Under-17 World
Championship, which started since September 4 in four Egyptian
cities.

purchased about 3 million kilograms of new cotton. The majority
from Xinjiang, Hubei, Henan, Sichuan and Jiangsu, the country's
leading cotton producers.
</P>
<P>
Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, the
nation's top cotton-producing region, is expected to harvest a
total of 11.5 million kilograms of cotton this year, all of which
will be bought by the state, according to the federation.
</P>
<P>
The federation has issued a set of rules to standardize cotton
purchase, safeguard the interests of cotton growers and ensure the
quality of the cotton purchased.
</P>
<P>
Under the rules, cotton purchasing stations and processing
factories are under the direct leadership of county and city-level
cotton and linen companies and they must obtain permits from
companies at provincial or regional level before they begin cotton
purchases.
</P>
<P>
The main tasks of cotton purchasing units include
implementation of official policies and purchase standards,
fulfilment of purchasing quotas on time and with good quality, and
promotion of a new scientific approach, new skills and fine new
cotton seeds.

<P>
BUENOS AIRES, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Diego Maradona played 89
minutes for Boca Juniors in the Argentine championship on Sunday,
then went back on his threat to make the game the last of his
career.
</P>
<P>
Maradona had said last week that he may quit the game
because he feared the constant media attention he was attracting
could affect his father's health.
</P>
<P>
However, after helping Argentina's most fanatically supported
team beat San Lorenzo 2-1 at home, he added yet another about-face
to his stop-start career.
</P>
<P>
Maradona, who was provisionally suspended after failing a
doping test taken after the first game of the championship against
Argentinos Juniors, had played five games into his fifth
comeback.

<HEADLINE> China Witnesses Stable Increase in Tax Revenues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 22 (Xinhua) -- China netted 54.05 billion
yuan (6.51 billion US dollars) of revenues from industrial and
commercial taxes in August, a rise of 12.9 percent over the same
period last year, "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
In August, business taxes climbed to 9.79 billion yuan, up 49.5
percent, while stamp duty rose to 1.97 billion yuan, up 39.2
percent. Out of the total stamp duty collected last month, duty
from stock trading was 1.79 billion yuan, up 42.1 percent from the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Individual income taxes also registered a fast growth of 24
percent to 2.09 billion yuan last month.
</P>
<P>
However, the domestic value-added and consumption taxes, two
major taxes in China, totaled 29.83 billion yuan in August, showing
a slight 5.7 percent growth rate, which is six percentage points down
from the average growth rate in the previous seven months of this
year, the newspaper quoted information from the State
Administration of Taxation as saying.
</P>
<P>
Poor efficiency of State enterprises, especially in key tax
sources sectors, and growing delayed taxable payments are blamed
for the slowdown of the increase in the two taxes.
</P>
<P>
The taxation agency urged tax authorities at different levels
to intensify their efforts to collect taxes and strengthen tax
audits to avoid tax evasion and ensure the tax target is met.
</P>
<P>
Tax collectors are required to pay special attention to key
tax sources such as cigarettes, rolled steel and building
materials sectors.
</P>
<P>
By the end of August, the industrial and commercial tax revenue
reached 477.34 billion yuan, 18.6 percent more than the same
period last year and finishing 68.7 percent of the annual plan.
</P>
<P>
The goal for industrial and commercial tax revenues for the
year of 1997 is set at 695 billion yuan, according to the
information.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Pledges to Improve Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 22 (Xinhua) -- China's capital has pledged
to meet state pollution standards by the year 2000 and improve its
environment.
</P>
<P>
Municipal departments say that Beijing will improve the 60 key
industrial polluters in the urban area this year and that those
that fail to meet requirements will have to stop production or be
closed.
</P>
<P>
The city has also demanded that 600 boilers above 10 tons
reduce the amount of coal used and the emission of dust and smoke
by using energy-saving methods and efficient dust removers and
desulphurization methods.
</P>
<P>
All boilers in the downtown area will have to use natural gas
from a pipeline from northwest China to decrease the discharge of
sulphur dioxide and smoke.
</P>
<P>
Since June 1, the city has banned the use of leaded gas and
Automobiles that fail to meet exhaust standards are not allowed on
streets, officials say.
</P>
<P>
The city has spent 63.6 billion yuan (about 8 billion US
dollars) on urban infrastructure over the past five years for
sewage and garbage treatment plants and heating supplies.
</P>
<P>
The city's rate for waste-water treatment is now 21 percent,
and garbage treatment rate 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
Beijing spent 1.5 billion yuan on controlling industrial
pollution in the past five years, relocating 78 heavy polluters
and closing a number of factories and workshops with serious
pollution problems.
</P>
<P>
Although 330,000 residents and more than three million migrant
people have been added to the city's population, and the number of
automobiles has doubled over the past five years, Beijing's
environmental quality has not deteriorated, officials say, and
they believe the city can meet its goals.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Beijing television viewers
have a lot more selection on their tubes these days, according to
today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The local cable system can now broadcast programs produced by
Zhejiang, Shandong, Sichuan, Hunan and several other provincial
television stations.
</P>
<P>
And Beijing doctors can now see patients in other major Chinese
cities, consult with counterparts in other regions and direct
complicated operations -- without ever leaving the city.
</P>
<P>
It's possible due to communications satellites.
</P>
<P>
Experts and executives from more than 60 Chinese and 30 foreign
satellite-related-manufacturing companies teamed up with research
institutes and organizations which use satellites to try and find
answers to these questions.
</P>
<P>
They converged on Beijing last week for the international
technical exchange seminar on satellite communications,
broadcasting and television (China Satcom '97).
</P>
<P>
The seminar's purpose was to prepare Chinese satellite users
for potential technical problems, market competition and various
other issues they may face next century, said Yang Qianli, a
deputy chairman of China Users Association of Satellite
Communications, Broadcasting and Television (CUASCBT).
</P>
<P>
The organization co-ordinated the four-day seminar, which
concluded on Friday.
</P>
<P>
During the seminar, the participants discussed lastest
developments in satellite communications technology.
</P>
<P>
There are presently five major satellite communications players
in China and competition has intensified.
</P>
<P>
The five firms include two Hong Kong-based companies, AsiaSat
and APT Satellite Holdings Ltd, and three mainland companies,
China Telecommunications Broadcast Satellite Corp (ChinaSat),
China Orient Telecommunications Satellite Co Ltd and Sino
Satellite Communications Co Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Large American firms -- including Motorola, TRW, Loral and
Qualcomm -- are now developing their own satellite-based mobile
communications systems such as Iridium, ICO, Odyssey and
Globalstar. enditem

MOSCOW, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Aslan Maskhadov, president of
the Chenchen Republic, met delegations from Britain and Germany
Sunday to arrange the founding of a London-based Caucasian Fund,
said a report reaching here from Grozny, Chechnya's capital.
</P>
<P>
The British delegation, whose country will participate as
co-founders in the Caucasian Fund, told Maskhadov that they lack
information about the state of affairs in Chechnya coming on a
permanent basis.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of kidnaps in Chechnya, Lord Alister McAlrain, a
member of the House of Lords, also a member of the British
delegation, said this problem exists throughout the world. No
country has the right to give advice to Chechens on how to settle
it until it settles this problem on its own territory, he added.
</P>
<P>
The German delegation said they need to have more information
about Chechnya and that they wish to develop friendly relations

<P>
HARARE, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe joined the World
Group of tennis nations Sunday after defeating a Thomas Muster-led
Austria 3-2 in their Davis Cup qualifying round.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time for the southern African nation to qualify
for the World Group since their first competing in the Davis Cup
34 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Victory was assured in the final reverse singles when Wayne
Black, lagging from behind, outplayed Gerald Mandl 6-3, 6-3, 6-0.
Mandl replaced Austrian number two, Gilbert Schaller, who had
stomach cramps.
</P>
<P>
The 27-year-old Austrian, playing only his third Davis Cup
match, became unsettled after several foot faults.
</P>
<P>
In the other reverse singles, Muster was shocked by Byron
Black, finding himself down 1-2. But his greater power and
improving cross-court play finally beat his opponent 3-6, 6-3,
2-6, 6-3, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
In the round's previous matches, Muster beat Wayne Black, Byron
Black beat Schaller and the Blacks beat Mandl and Georg Blumayor
in the doubles. All those matches were concluded in straight
sets.

<HEADLINE> Northwestern People Benefit From Water Tapping Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 22 (Xinhua) -- China's water-tapping program
in its arid northwestern area has located a number of significant
underground water sources this year, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
A newly discovered underground water source in Tongxin county
of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region provides the local
inhabitants with 30,000 cubic meters of water each day, according
to the Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources.
</P>
<P>
Another high yield well, which was drilled by geological teams
in Fuping county of northern Shaanxi Province, can produce 13,300
cubic meters of potable mineral water a year.
</P>
<P>
The ministry earmarked 18 million yuan (2.1 million US dollars)
to tap the area's underground water this year.
</P>
<P>
To help tap 10 such projects, the State Planning Commission has
approved providing another 20 million yuan (2.4 million US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The money was taken from the compensation fees collected from
the country's mining units to be spent on the protection of the
country's mineral resources.
</P>
<P>
Other new discoveries include five underground water locations
with a daily water supply of 3,000 cubic meters in Qinghai
province.
</P>
<P>
That is enough water to irrigate 13 hectares of vegetables and
66 hectares of grain, while at the same time meeting the water
needs of the 2,400 local inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
In the midst of the drive to tap new water sources, the
geological teams also are concerned with the development of
already discovered water supplies.
</P>
<P>
A geological team discovered three underground water sources in
xinjiang and set up a shareholding farm with the Agricultural
College of the region.
</P>
<P>
Under their joint management, the farm has planted 66 hectares
of crops with an estimated annual output value of 300,000 yuan
(36,000 US dollars).

<HEADLINE> China Becomes World's Second Largest FDI Recipient </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 22 (Xinhua) -- China attracted a record 42.3
billion US dollars of foreign direct investment (FDI) last year,
remaining the second largest recipient of foreign capital in the
world, according to a report of the United Nations Conference on
Trade and Development (UNCTAD).
</P>
<P>
The report, which was released in Beijing recently, said that
the figure accounts for about half of the foreign direct
investment in Asia last year.
</P>
<P>
It attributes the increase of the FDI in China to the
ever-growing market, successful overall economic reform measures,
smooth "soft-landing" of the national economy and China's
preferential policies for foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Another important reason is that foreign investors rushed to
launch investment projects before the Chinese government abrogates
some of the preferential treatment, like customs tariff and tax
reduction in the first half of last year.
</P>
<P>
After China, the report said, Singapore was the second largest
recipient of FDI in Asia, attracting nine billion US dollars in
1996.
</P>
<P>
Last year more than 120 billion US dollars of FDI flew into the
developing countries, and some 200 billion US dollars went into
the developed countries. Of the latter, 84.6 billion US dollars of
FDI was invested in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The report also noted that Asia has emerged as an important
source of FDI. FDI from Asia amounted to 47 billion US
dollars. Hong Kong alone invested 26 billion US dollars in other
places.

<HEADLINE> Non-Trade Foreign Exchange Up in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The amount of non-trade
foreign exchange in China's economic center in the first half of
the year increased nearly 38 percent from the same period in 1996.
</P>
<P>
This comes from the rapid development and opening up of the
local tourism, finance, and real estate industries. These three,
along with culture and arts now contribute 34 percent of the local
non-trade foreign exchange, 0.6 percentage points higher than for
the same period in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Every day in Shanghai, tourists exchange a large amount of
foreign currency for renminbi with a third of which coming from
credit cards, helping commercial banks get income from service
charges.
</P>
<P>
Foreign banks in the Pudong New Area are now allowed to do
renminbi business, a move that has encouraged many foreign banks
to move into the area, giving a boost to real estate as a channel
for more non-trade foreign exchange locally.

<P>
BEIJING, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Funding for China's
scientific and technological development maintained a good pace,
swelling beyond blast year's figures, Today's China Daily said.
</P>
<P>
Research and Development Funding for institutes, enterprises
and colleges and universities rose to 33.2 billion yuan (4 billion
US dollars) in 1996, a 13.6 percent increase over 1995, the State
Statistics Bureau reported over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The Basic research and High-tech Department, under the State
Science and Technology Commission, attributed the rise in
investment to the government's emphasis on basic science
development during the past few years.
</P>
<P>
The State allocated 60 million yuan (7 million US dollars)
annually on average, during the Ninth Five-Year Plan Period
(1996-2000) to support training for scientists involved in basic
research.
</P>
<P>
More than 90 percent of the funds are being used and will
continue to be used for establishing training centers. And the
remaining money will be allocated to train scientists involved in
major projects.
</P>
<P>
The bureau's statistics indicate there is now a multichannel
funding process for scientific and technological
development. Previously, such projects received money solely from
the government.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Premier Explains Reform Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hong Kong, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Zhu
Rongji said here today that China's reform should be conducted in
phases, starting with easy areas and proceeding to difficult ones.
</P>
<P>
China's reform and opening-up over the past 20 years have
brought about enormous tangible benefits to the Chinese people and
a much stronger economy in the country, and also helped the country
integrate itself gradually with the world economy, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu was making an address in English at the 56th Meeting of the
Development Committee of the World Bank/International Monetary
Fund in Hong Kong, a special administrative region of China.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese vice-premier stressed that the policy of reform and
opening-up has been deeply rooted in the hearts of the Chinese
people and is "irreversible". He also referred to the reform as
something unprecedented in terms of both complexity and scale.
</P>
<P>
A method of "gradual advance" should be adopted in China's
reform efforts rather than a "particular reform measure going
ahead in isolation," he said. "Experiments should be carried out
before popularization."
</P>
<P>
Explaining other aspects of the basic experience China has
gained in the reform, the vice-premier said political and social
stability is a precondition for the reform and opening-up and
economic reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
"We have all along given equal importance to reform,
development and stability and properly handled the relationship
among the three through a series of effective measures," he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China has succeeded in maintaining a steady
economic growth through improved macroeconomic regulation and
control and economic restructuring, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government also adheres to the principle of being
practical and realistic, proceeding from China's specific national
conditions rather than blindly copying from textbooks or other
countries' models, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that "gradual advance" does not mean delaying,
nor following a beaten track or losing good opportunities.
</P>
<P>
"We give people time to observe and encourage them to carry out
experiments. Once we have obtained experience and reached
consensus, we will unswervingly advance the reform in a timely
manner," Zhu stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese vice-premier, who arrived here Sunday at the
invitation of World Bank President James Wolfensohn, will deliver
a keynote speech at an international seminar later today on
China's economic prospects in the 21st century.

<HEADLINE> Parisien Returns to U.S. Ski Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Former world champion
Julie Parisien quit the Pro Race tour on Sunday to return to the
U.S. Ski Team.
</P>
<P>
The move would mostly extend the U.S. chances of winning the
gold in the Nagano Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
Parisien was the world slalom champion in 1992. In the
Albertville Olympics that year, she led after the first run, but
finished fourth. She quit the ski team in 1994 to turn pro, and
has dominated the pro tour ever since.
</P>
<P>
While Picabo Street and Tommy Moe are champion downhillers, the
U.S. ski team has no current international winners in slalom or
giant slalom. Street and Moe are both returning from injuries,
which leaves their Olympic medal hopes in question.
</P>
<P>
Parisien may be the best U.S. hope for a gold in the slalom and
giant slalom.

<HEADLINE> Mystery of Cliff Coffins in Southwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists have
finally solved the mystery of the cliff-hanging coffins in
Gongxian County in southwest China's Sichuan province.
</P>
<P>
There are over 200 cliff-hanging coffins that date from the Jin
Dynasty to the middle of the Ming Dynasty (3rd to 16th century
A.D.). They were placed on a rock face or in caves from 50 to 150
meters high, and caused people to wonder for a long time about how
people hung the coffins at such a height.
</P>
<P>
Ding Tianci, a historian from the Culture Bureau of Sichuan's
Yibin city, has developed a new theory to solve the mystery, which
has been accepted by various historians. Basically he says that
people got the coffins there by building a plank road along the
face of the cliff.
</P>
<P>
Ding said that archaeologists have found many holes, chiseled
in the cliffs in orderly fashion near coffins. He explains that it
was the custom to hang coffins on cliffs and was an effective
means of keeping the corpses from being disturbed by animals and
other people.
</P>
<P>
Historians used to take it for granted that hanging coffins on
the cliff face was the custom of the Bo people, but new research
has shown that it was the Liao, another ethnic group that has
disappeared. But, further studies are required to solve this
problem.

MANCHESTER, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The four-day 1997 World
Sports Abrobatics Championships ended at Manchester's National
Cycling Center this evening, with China winning five of the 21
world titles.
</P>
<P>
At the all-around final of the men's pairs competition, China's
world champions Song Min and Li Renjie, who collected two
individual mens pairs titles, successfully defended their
all-around honor. Although Russia's pair competitors tried every
means to upset the Chinese duo, the almost perfect Chinese
performance sent Russia's gold dreams crashing.
</P>
<P>
After winning their first women's pairs balance title, China's
new pair combination Lao Peiling/Liao Xinxin snatched their
all-around gold medals by convincingly beating their Ukrainian
arch-rivals with a 10-point score.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Chinese team also won another bonze medals in
the finals of men's tumbling, men's groups and women's groups
events.
</P>
<P>

medals.

<HEADLINE> German Opposition Suffers Setback in Local Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Germany's main opposition party
Social Democratic Party (SPD) suffered a major setback today in
the Hamburg local parliament election which was viewed as a test
of voters's sentiments in the run-up to Germany's 1998 national
elections.
</P>
<P>
According to preliminary television projections, the SPD won
just 36.8 percent of the vote in the election on Sunday, 3.6
percent less than in the last local election four years ago and
its worst result in the post-war era.
</P>
<P>
Although the SPD still retained its position as the strongest
party in Hamburg, the veteran SPD mayor, Henning Voscherau,
quickly announced that he would quit his post to take
responsibility for the setback. Voscherau have been mayor of
Hamburg, Germany's second largest city, for the past ten years.
</P>
<P>
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union
(CDU) got a lift from the Sunday election after scoring 30.6
percent of the vote, some 5.5 percent more than in the last
election in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The Greens, which is the second largest opposition party in
Bonn, came in third in Hamburg with 13.6 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
The far-right German People's Union boosted its score to about
4.8 percent but would still be excluded from parliament.
</P>
<P>
Under Germany's proportional representation voting system, a
party must win at least five percent of the vote in order to enter
the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The Statt Party, which has served as the coalition partner for
the SPD in Hamburg during the past four years, as well as the Free
Democratic Party (FDP), the junior partner in Kohl's ruling
coalition in Bonn, also failed to clear the five-percent hurdle to
win parliament seats in Hamburg.
</P>
<P>
German media predicted that the SPD was now likely to link with
the Greens to form the next local government in Hamburg, though
the CDU had also expressed its willingness to form a grand
coalition with the SPD.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman of the Greens said in Bonn that the results of
the Hamburg election boosted the chances for a SPD-Greens
coalition government in Bonn next year.
</P>
<P>
The Greens have ruled with the SPD in several German states in
recent years and have expressed the hope to join hands with the
latter to remove Kohl from power in the next German national
elections due in September next year.
</P>
<P>
However, Kohl's CDU party, which have been trailing the SPD in
popularity in all opinion polls recently, was apparently
encouraged by the Hamburg election. CDU General-Secretary Peter
Hintze said in Bonn that the SPD was punished today for blocking
government's proposals for major reforms in Germany.

<HEADLINE> Acute Skill Shortages In UK Fuels Inflation Fears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Declining unemployment in
Britain is causing acute skills shortages, with more than three
quarters of firms struggling to find suitable staff to fill
vacancies, according to a survey published today.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that the survey by recruitment
specialist Reed Personnel Services is likely to ring alarm bells
at the Bank of England which has the power to set basic rates
since Labor came to power last May.
</P>
<P>
Following data last week that showed unemployment fell below
1.5 million for the first time in 17 years and average earnings
rose 4.5 percent in August from 4.25 percent in July, Reed's
report may add to pressure for higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, 76 percent of 555 organizations
