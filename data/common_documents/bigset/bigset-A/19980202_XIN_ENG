<HEADLINE> Li Lanqing: China to Reduce Trade Surplus in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAVOS, Switzerland, February 1 (Xinhua) -- China will move to
reduce its trade surplus in 1998, China's Vice Premier Li Lanqing
announced here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
To reduce trade surplus "will increase our capacity to
withstand the impact of currency realignment taking place in other
East Asian economies", Li said at a plenary session of the ongoing
annual meeting of the World Economic Forum.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the trade surplus of China was over 40 billion
U.S. dollars, with net capital inflows standing at 34 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
As a result, supply exceeded demand on the domestic foreign
exchange market, and the central bank had to buy
34.8-billion-dollar worth of foreign exchange to absorb the
surplus, he added.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he said, China will improve the
competitiveness of its exports by optimizing export structure and
reducing cost through various kinds of hard work, but not by the
devaluation of Renminbi (RMB) Yuan.
</P>
<P>
"Even if the growth rate in our export might be somewhat
dented, we would still maintain the stability of exchange rate of
RMB," he stressed. "This is not only in our own interest but also
a contribution to the recovery of stability and confidence on the
Asian currency markets."

<P>
DAVOS, Switzerland, February 1 (Xinhua) -- China's economy has
been growing steadily since 1979, with an average GDP increase of
9.8 percent over the last 19 years, China's Vice Premier Li
Lanqing said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
China's economic goal is an eight percent increase in the
remaining three years of this century, Li told a plenary session
of an ongoing annual meeting of the World Economic Forum.
</P>
<P>
Talking of the future, Li said, "In the opening decade of the
next century, we shall maintain growth at seven percent."
</P>
<P>
"On that basis, we aim to modernize our economy through another
30 to 40 years of hard work, so that our people can enjoy a
standard of living comparable to that of middle-income developed
countries," he said.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Turns 67 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin,
who has been frequently troubled by health problems, turned 67
Sunday and accepted congratulations from several cabinet leaders.
</P>
<P>
A group of cabinet members headed by Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin flew to the Rus presidential country residence outside
Moscow to congratulate Yeltsin on his birthday, reported the
Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, who was born in a peasant family in the village of
Butka in the Talitsa district of Sverdlovsk region, was elected
Russian president on June 12, 1991, the first president of the
country, which used to be a member of the former Soviet Union. He
was re-elected to the post on July 16, 1996.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin last Friday announced that he won't run for a third
term of the presidency in the year of 2000, saying he would not
violate the constitution by running again.
</P>
<P>
Russia's post-Soviet constitution limits a president's period
in office to two terms.
</P>
<P>
But top aides say Yeltsin could probably run again if he chose,
because he first took office in 1991, two years before the
constitution was adopted, and thus is serving his first full term
under that document.

<HEADLINE> UK's Glaxo, SmithKline Plan Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 1 (Xinhua) - Britain's two leading drug
companies have announced plans for merger to create the world's
largest pharmaceutical company worth 100 billion pounds (160
billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The announcement at the weekend comes less than two weeks after
news that SmithKline was to join force with American Home
Products. That plan has now been abandoned.
</P>
<P>
If the merger between Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline goes ahead,
the world's largest pharmaceutical company would have combined
annual revenues of 26.6 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement, the two said they were considering a deal
in which Glaxo Wellcome shareholders would own 59.5% of the equity
of the combined company and SmithKline shareholders would take the
remaining 40.5%.
</P>
<P>
The deal "represents a compelling strategic opportunity for
both companies to enhance their industry position," they said.
</P>
<P>
"A major and significant benefit of the proposed merger would
be the formation of the largest research and development
organization in the global healthcare industry," they added.
</P>
<P>
The new company would take almost 10% of the international
medicine market. This would be twice the amount of its nearest
rivals, Merck of the United States and Switzerland's Novartis.
</P>
<P>
Glaxo and SmithKline employ about 110,000 people altogether
worldwide and the announcement inevitably sparked fears among
staff of job losses.
</P>
<P>
"The combined company can eliminate 25% of duplicate costs,"
an observer here said.

<HEADLINE> Li Lanqing: China to Make Various Efforts to Keep </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAVOS, Switzerland, February 1 (Xinhua) -- China will make
various efforts to keep its economic growth steady for the next
three years, China's Vice Premier Li Lanqing said here today.
</P>
<P>
"As stability has yet to be restored to the financial markets
in some Asian economies, many may have a question on China's
ability to achieve the goal of eight percent GDP growth in 1998.
To that my answer is positive," Li told a plenary session of the
ongoing annual meeting of the World Economic Forum.
</P>
<P>
He gave several reasons to support his stand:
</P>
<P>
- China will increase investment in priority sectors.
</P>
<P>
These include irrigation and water supply facilities and other
agricultural infrastructure, construction of railways, highways
and transport facilities in both urban and rural areas,
environmental protection projects, development of high-tech
industries, technological upgrading of enterprises, housing sector
development and the development of mid-western areas.
</P>
<P>
Li believes that the rise in investment will no doubt generate
an expansion in employment and consumer demand.
</P>
<P>
- China will tap the purchasing power dormant in the rural
areas.
</P>
<P>
One of the greatest assets underlining China's strong growth is
its huge market potentials in the countryside. With the steady
development of the rural economy, the farmers are growing rich,
driving up the demand for both consumer and capital goods.
</P>
<P>
Measures will be taken to channel merchandise more efficiently
into the rural market.
</P>
<P>
- China will continue to improve its investment environment to
enchance its attractiveness for foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Renminbi Yuan is already fully convertible under
the current account, and the average tariff rate for industrial
products will be brought down to 10 percent by 2005.
</P>
<P>
Starting from January 1, 1998, the Chinese government has
re-instituted tariff and tax waivers on equipment imports for
foreign investment projects.
</P>
<P>
- China will improve the competitiveness of Chinese exports by
optimizing export structure and reducing cost through various
kinds of hard work.
</P>
<P>
"Even if the growth rat in our export might be somewhat dented,
we would still maintain the stability of exchange rate of RMB," Li
stressed. "This is not only in our own interest but also a
contribution to the recovery of stability and confidence on the
Asian currency markets."

documents presented by the majority faction led by Madhav Kumar
Nepal.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
The congress also adopted an amended party statute.

HARARE, February 1 (Xinhua) -- A protocol on forming the Beira
Development Corridor Business Council which aims to promote
trade, investment and employment will be signed in Mozambique on
Monday, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Among other objectives, the council will increase
communication among the business communities of the Beira
Development Corridor (BDC) and their governments.
</P>
<P>
It will also strengthen and promote the integration of the
business communities of the BDC.
</P>
<P>
The BDC is a railway and road network running between the
Zimbabwean eastern border town of Mutare to the Mozambican port
city of Beira.
</P>
<P>
The corridor was established last year after a two-day
conference held in Zimbabwe in 1996 at which Malawi, Mozambique,
Zambia and Zimbabwe signed the agreement for establishment of the
corridor.
</P>
<P>
Recognizing the low levels of investment and trade and the
resultant socio-economic problems within the region, the business
communities in Mozambique and Zimbabwe agreed to the formation of
BDC business council.

<HEADLINE> COMAFIN Approves $46 Million for Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The Commonwealth Africa
Investment Fund Limited (COMAFIN) has approved business ventures
totaling 46 million U.S. dollars over the past 18 months.
</P>
<P>
In an interveiw with the Zimbabwe News Agency Sunday, out-going
Managing Director of COMAFIN, Jeffrey Goddard said that there had
been encouraging progress regarding the investment fund of 63.5
million U.S. Dollars and further amounts will be raised in due
course from financial markets.
</P>
<P>
"We have a number of other projects where we have agreed, in
principle, to an investment, and we shall be reviewing their
progress and deciding on the level of our involvement," he said.
</P>
<P>
Besides other businesses which had been approved, COMAFIN was
looking at another eight businesses which had, in principle, been
cleared for investment.
</P>
<P>
Three new projects in mining, cultivation of grapes and
property development have been approved by the COMAFIN investment
committee with an investment of 14 million Dollars.
</P>

countries are improving, and that, by encouraging the flow of
direct foreign investment, there is an immense potential in the
region which can be increasingly realised," he added.
</P>
<P>
COMAFIN was launched in 1996 with the purpose of contributing
to the economic development of commonwealth African countries by
providing risk capital for investment.

<HEADLINE> Lawyer Says, No Deal "on the Horizon" for Lewinsky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Monica Lewinsky's lawyer
William Ginsburg said Sunday the American people are already tired
of allegations of an affair involving his client and President
Bill Clinton, predicting that Clinton will survive the crisis.
</P>
<P>
"It will go away, it will pass, the president will remain in
office," Ginsburg said Sunday on NBC's "Meet the Press."
</P>
<P>
Ginsburg said the drawn-out immunity talks between his office
and Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr are once again on hold.
</P>
<P>
A deal with Starr "is not... on the horizon," he said. "I don't
know if they are over. I know they have none ongoing."
</P>
<P>
Starr is investigating allegations that Clinton had an affair
with Ms. Lewinsky, a former White House intern, and asked her to
lie about it. Clinton has strongly denied the allegations.
</P>
<P>
Ginsburg also denied that, with his talks with Starr making
little progress, he was now seeking collaboration with White House
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
But he said that if Clinton's attorneys filed a motion to
dismiss the grand jury investigation, "we would certainly look at
that motion, and assess whether or not we wanted to join it. It's
certainly a possibility."
</P>
<P>
"I certainly would like to see the grand jury proceeding shut
down," he said on "Fox News Sunday."
</P>
<P>
Ginsburg described the relationship between Clinton and Ms.
Lewinsky as that of "colleagues." He wouldn't respond to questions
about the alleged affair.
</P>
<P>
"The American people are tired of hearing about the president's
sex life," Ginsburg said. "I think the American people have
focused on the real issues, not the president's sex life."
</P>
<P>
Lewinsky plans to leave Washington this week to visit her
father in California, according to Ginsburg.

<HEADLINE> Azerbaijan Opposes Russian Military Presence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Azerbaijani President Heydar
Aliyev on Sunday expressed his dissatisfaction with the Russian
military presence in Georgia and Armenia, the Interfax news agency
reported from Baku, Azerbaijani capital.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to president of Radio Free Europe Thomas Dine, Aliyev
said "I oppose the presence of Russian military bases in Armenia
and Georgia and I protest against Russia's military union with
Armenia."
</P>
<P>
The Azerbaijani president noted that he had informed Russian
president Boris Yeltsin of his position at the CIS summit held in
Chisinau, Moldova, in October last year.
</P>
<P>
Strongly opposing the military cooperation between Russian and
Armenia, Aliyev pointed out that "Even if Russia acts as a
mediator in the settlement of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict,
it has no moral right to conclude an agreement on military
cooperation with Armenia."
</P>
<P>
According to Aliyev, modern offensive weapons worth one billion
U.S. dollars had been passed to Armenia "through Russian military
bases in Armenia and Georgia". "We have an exact list of weapons
passed to Armenia," he said.
</P>
<P>
Baku is urging Russia to confiscate these weapons from Armenia
and punish those involved in that deal, Interfax quoted Aliyev as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The president also reaffirmed Azerbajian's interest in
normalizing relations with Iran, noting "We are concerned about
Iran's intensive strategic cooperation with Armenia."
</P>
<P>
Russian Federation Council chairman Yegor Stroyev had a tour to
Azerbaijan on January 23, when he said that Moscow remains
committed to a peaceful settlement of Azerbaijan's territorial
integrity.
</P>
<P>
On the expediency of Russian military presence in Georgia and
Armenia, Stroyev noted that Russian bases in these countries will
never be used against Azerbaijan or any third country.

DAVOS, Switzerland, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Premier
Li Lanqing met here today with President of the European
Commission Jacques Santer.
</P>
<P>
During their talks at the occasion of the annual meeting of the
World Economic Forum, Li said that the relationship between China
and the members of the European Union (EU) have been well
developed.
</P>
<P>
Through high-level exchanges of visits and contacts, and active
political consultations and dialogues at different levels, Li
said, the cooperation of the two sides in all aspects has been
constantly broadened.
</P>
<P>
Both sides hold identical or similar views to many of the major
international issues, Li said. China and the EU are mutually
complementary in economy.
</P>
<P>
Santer said that the EU puts much emphasis on developing
relations with China and it admires China's great achievements
since its opening-up.
</P>
<P>
Li is pleased that the European Commission has made a proposal
to exclude China from its list of non-market economies. He
expressed hope that the proposal will be passed soon.
</P>
<P>
Santer said he is convinced that a positive solution will be
found as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
On China's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO), Li
hoped that the EU would take a more flexible, practical and
constructive attitude to solving those suspending issues in order
to conclude the talks at an early date.
</P>
<P>
Santer reaffirmed that the EU supported for China's early entry
into the WTO.

<HEADLINE> French Interior Minister Condemns U.S. Iraqi Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 1 (Xinhua) -- French Interior Minister
Jean-Pierre Chevenement Sunday strongly condemns the policy of the
United States toward Iraq, which he said is no longer a military
threat to any country.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the French media, Chevenement said that it
is "unimaginable" that France join a military intervention
against Iraq for its refusal to cooperate with the United Nations
arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
He described the strategy of the United States toward Iraq as
"prisoner of a kind of imbecile diabolizing (of Iraq) which is
already dated seven or eight years."
</P>
<P>
He said that as a result of this policy, one million Iraqis,
most of them children, could have died because of the economic
sanctions imposed on Iraq since its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
"It is time to lift this ferocious embargo which has probably
led to one million deaths. It is absolutely dishonorable and I
hope that France would make its voice heard," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chevenement also warned that the blockade of the Mideast peace
process and a military intervention in Iraq will "nourish the
blaze of fundamentalism" in Muslim countries, particularly in
North Africa.
</P>
<P>
He said that France is more directly concerned about Islamic
extremism on the southern coast of the Mediterranean, while the
United States has its interests in the Mideast.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice Premier Meets with WTO Director-General </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAVOS, Switzerland, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Premier
Li Lanqing met here today with World Trade Organization (WTO)
Director-General Renato Ruggiero on the occasion of the annual
meeting of the World Economic Forum.
</P>
<P>
Li explained China's stand on its entry into the multilateral
trade system and thanked Ruggiero for his support in this issue.
</P>
<P>
"Now that major progress has been made in recent negotiations,
we hope the issue will be solved as soon as possible," Li said.
</P>
<P>
Along with China's economic development, China's market will be
bigger and bigger, Li pointed out. The saying that China needs WTO
and WTO needs China has become a world cliche.
</P>
<P>
Ruggiero said that the negotiations over China's accession have
made much progress. He believed that it is time to accelerate the
process.
</P>
<P>
He praised China for its "very positive attitude" to the
financial crisis in Asia.
</P>
<P>
"We must encourage China to do that and we must be ready in the
negotiation with China to take the positive attitude that the
Chinese have shown to us now in order to speed up the
negotiation," the WTO head told Xinhua one day before his meeting
with the Chinese vice premier.

<HEADLINE> Albright: U.S. Has Authority to Strike against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright said on Sunday that the United States has the authority
to launch a military strike against Iraq without the need of a
fresh U.N. resolution for that move.
</P>
<P>
"We believe we have the authority for a strike," she told CNN
in an interview from Kuwait where she had just arrived to drum up
support for U.S. possible military actions from Gulf states.
</P>
<P>
She added the Clinton administration does not think it needs
the U.N. Security Council to pass a new resolution before the
United States can use military force against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Albright said the possible military strike may within weeks to
force Iraq to comply with U.N. resolutions on weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
"It's not days and it's not months, so that leaves weeks," she
told CNN about the time frame for the possible strike.
</P>
<P>
The United States prefers to find a diplomatic solution to the
standoff but "that string is running out," the secretary said,
adding "the time on it is shorter and shorter. But we are trying
still to work on a diplomatic solution."
</P>
<P>
Albright expressed confidence that the U.S. Congress would
support any military action taken against Iraq. But she said she
did not think "it's essential" for Congress to approve a
resolution supporting the action.

<HEADLINE> WTO to Celebrate Golden Jubilee of Multilateral </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAVOS, Switzerland, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The World Trade
Organization (WTO) will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the
multilateral trading system on May 20, WTO Director-General
announced here today.
</P>
<P>
"This year is the golden jubilee of the multilateral trading
system," Ruggiero said in a statement issued on the occasion of
the ongoing annual meeting of the World Economic Forum.
</P>
<P>
"On May 20, 1998, we will hold a high profile celebration in
Geneva to mark the golden jubilee and highlight for the citizens
of the world the contribution this system has made to global peace
and prosperity."
</P>
<P>
On January 1, 1948, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(GATT), signed by 23 nations on October 30, 1947 in Geneva,
entered into force.
</P>
<P>
GATT was later superseded by WTO which entered into force on
January 1, 1995.
</P>
<P>
"The creation of this system surely ranks among the greatest
economic achievements of the post-World War II era," Ruggiero
pointed out. "For a war-torn international community, the system
gave substance to a shared dream of a fair and open world trading
system."
</P>
<P>
"More than that, it has led directly to the breaking-down of
barriers not just between countries but between peoples," he went
on. "At the heart of the system is the principle of
non-discrimination."
</P>
<P>
"The multilateral trading system continues to grow in scope and
credibility," Ruggiero said. "Currently, there are 132 member
governments, with an additional 30 negotiating their terms of
membership. It would be difficult to overstate the contribution
the WTO makes to growth and development on a world scale."

<HEADLINE> CEOs of Computer Companies on Challenges of 21st Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAVOS, Switzerland, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Chief executive
officers (CEOs) from U.S. computer software and service companies
Monday discussed here challenges of the 21st century and how the
Internet will change our lives.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 1998 annual meeting of the World Economic Forum,
Bill Gates of Microsoft said that two keys to his company's success
were sharing wealth with employees to build a long-term relationship
that makes best use of their talents and working with partners.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Gates said, his company continuously monitored
what users needed and what competitors were producing in order to
gauge the opportunities and threats facing the business.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Microsoft had shared more wealth than
probably any other company by giving employees stock.
</P>
<P>
On strategies for the 21st century, Gates observed that
interaction costs have now dropped to almost zero. "We are sure
that information technology is changing the rules of the game. We
don't know how that is going to restructure business," he added.
</P>
<P>
Giving his vision of how the Internet will influence people's
lives, Stephen Case of America Online suggested that just as the
1960 U.S. election was said to have been decided by television, "the
next election could be decided on the Internet", because of the
intense involvement of users of the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
He noted that America Online had signed a final agreement to take
over CompuServe and become a business with 13 million customers.
</P>
<P>
Larry J. Ellison of Oracle observed that to have its full impact,
the Internet would need to be as easy to use as the telephone or
television and reach many more people.
</P>
<P>
Oracle and Microsoft now were involved in the production of more
simple machines to hook-up through the television.
</P>
<P>
When the Internet links become universal, Ellison said,
companies will be able to take advantage of instantaneous
information technologies not just in financial transactions but
also in labor, to commission work across the world, or in ordering
supplies.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi National Assembly Reviews Ties with UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi National Assembly
held an emergency session Monday to review Iraq's relations with
the United Nations, the prospect of lifting of U.N. sanctions and
military threats of the
relationship with the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) in charge
of eliminating Iraqi weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that Iraq will continue to cooperate with the
UNSCOM in its inspection mission to help lift the crippling
economic sanctions imposed on Iraq by the U.N. in 1990 after its
invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
He said Iraq is working with "extraordinary efforts" to
implement article 22 of U.N. Security Council Resolution 687,
under which the Security Council will order the lifting of the
embargo once UNSCOM certifies Iraq's total destruction of all
forbidden weapons.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahhaf stressed that Iraq always leans on the legal
justification of the U.N. resolutions while explaining its
position on the resolutions and the lifting of the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iraq is seeking every opportunity to abort
U.S. schemes of military strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Last November, the Iraqi National Assembly recommended that
Iraq stop cooperating with UNSCOM if the U.N. does not lift the
sanctions in six months.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Minister Withdraws Resignation Request </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan Deputy Defense
Minister Anuruddha Ratwatte Monday decided not to resign from his
post as deputy defense minister.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to President Chandrika Kumaratunga, Ratwatte
explained the reasons which led to his withdrawal of his
resignation appeal.
</P>
<P>
He said that due to the trust of the president and the
peace-loving people from all walks of life in Sri Lanka, as well
as his heavy duty to end terrorism and war in his country, he
decided to retain the post.
</P>
<P>
Ratwatte submitted his resignation letter to Kumaratunga last
Wednesday, saying he felt responsible for the serious security
lapse which led to the bomb attack at the Dalada Maligawa (Tooth
Relic Temple) in Kandy, some 115 kilometers east of Colombo.
</P>
<P>
Some rebels of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)
detonated an explosives-laden truck on January 25, killing 17
people and damaging the temple, which is the holiest shrine to Sri
Lankan Buddhists.
</P>
<P>
The president in a letter dated January 29 requested the
minister to retrieve his resignation appeal.
</P>
<P>
Last week, people of different organizations held a string of
demonstrations in Sri Lanka, calling on Ratwatte, who also heads
the Irrigation and Power Ministry, to stay.

<HEADLINE> 1.5 Tonnes of Morphine Seized in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Iran seized 1.5 tonnes of
morphine in the past two weeks in the central provinces of Yazd
and Kerman, local evening newspaper Resalat reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Sanee, provincial commander of Iran's Security Force
in Yazd, was quoted as saying that several smugglers were also
arrested in the actions.
</P>
<P>
But he did not give further details about the drug haul.
</P>
<P>
Sanee said about 11 tonnes of drugs have been confiscated in
Yazd province since March 21, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Iran is one of the key transit route of drugs from the infamous
Golden Crescent bordering Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan. It
reportedly seizes an average of about 160 tonnes of different
narcotics each year.
</P>
<P>
To fight the serious social problem, Iran passed a strict
anti-drug law in 1989, under which anyone caught with 30 grams of
heroin or five kilograms of opium will face the death penalty.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Proposes $270.6 Billion Defense Budget For 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
on Monday proposed a 270.6 billion U.S. dollars military budget
for 1999, including 48.7 billion dollars for high-tech arms.
</P>
<P>
The planned military spending in the fiscal year beginning
October 1 is 3 billion dollars more than the current Pentagon
spending and represents a major slice of the 1.73 trillion dollars
federal budget sent to Congress by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Under the budget, the Pentagon planned to spend more on
procurement of such new weapons as 30 F-18E/F advanced fighter
jets, 66 Army "Apache Longbow" helicopters, two initial F-22
radar-avoiding "stealth" fighters for the 21st century and bigger
stockpiles of satellite-guided missiles and bombs.
</P>
<P>
Also included in the modern arms spending would be more than 2
billion dollars for Army "digital" equipment such as tiny
satellite receivers in the backpacks of soldiers to indicate their
exact positions.
</P>
<P>
The defense budget would also spend 600 million dollars on
protection against chemical or biological attacks, including on
protective clothing, detection devices and establishment of 10
highly trained "chem-bio" military teams to move about the United
States as needed in such emergencies.
</P>
<P>
The 1999 Clinton budget makes available a special 3 billion
dollars outside of regular defense allocations for U.S. troop
deployment in Bosnia beginning in October and military
humanitarian relief in emergencies.
</P>
<P>
But the outlays for the current U.S. military build-up in the
Gulf and for a continued American troop presence in Bosnia between
June and October of this year would be funded by special
supplemental requests to be sent by the Pentagon to Congress at
mid-year.
</P>
<P>
The combined Navy and Marine Corps would get the biggest slice
of 1999 defense spending authority at 81.3 billion dollars,
followed by 78.4 billion dollars for the Air Force, 65.2 billion
dollars for the Army and 37 billion dollars for other defense
agencies.
</P>
<P>
The new military budget includes nearly 4 billion dollars on
defense against missiles, including 300 million dollars for
development of an Air Force airborne laser that one day might be
used to burn up attacking warheads in flight.
</P>
<P>
To save money for modern weapons, the U.S. Defense Department
planned to cut 23,000 troops in fiscal 1999, bringing the active
duty armed forces down to 1.39 million troops, and close more
unnecessary bases that once used to house as many as 2.17 million
troops in the Cold War.

<HEADLINE> Salas Set to Join River Plate on Big Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Argentine league champions
River Plate has reached an agreement with Italy's Lazio on the
transfer of Chilean striker Marcelo Salas for 21 million
U.S. dollars, local reports said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The deal totals 55 million U.S. dollars including a net 17.5
million U.S. dollars in wages for Salas over seven years, and
15.75 million U.S. dollars in taxes to be paid by Lazio in Italy.
</P>
<P>
River will not release Salas until June under the deal, and he
will not be available to play for Lazio until the World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old has become the biggest star in the Argentine
league since joining River from Chile's Universidad Catolica two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
He scored 11 goals in 12 games as Chile qualified for the World
Cup, including hat-tricks against Peru and Colombia.

<HEADLINE> U.S. President Proposes New Budget Promising $9.5 Bln Surplus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Monday submited to the Congress a 1.73 trillion U.S. dollar budget
proposal that could produce a 9.5 billion dollar surplus, the
first for three decades.
</P>
<P>
In addition to draw the prospect of the first federal budget
surplus since 1969, Clinton's plan proposes spending billions more
for such popular programs as child care, education and medical
research.
</P>
<P>
In his budget message, Clinton said his plan "brings to an end
three decades of fiscal chaos, a period in which Americans had
lost confidence in their government and the ability of their
leaders to do the people's business."
</P>
<P>
The 1999 budget, for the fiscal year beginning October 1, this
year proposes a 3.9 percent increase from this year's spending
levels with even bigger increases for scores of favored
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
The president's budget seeks to expand the federal government's
role in providing child care, lower the age limits for Medicare
and help hire 100,000 new teachers to reduce class sizes in the
nation's schools.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who promised during last week's State of the Union
address to produce budget surpluses for as "far as the eye can
see," would start the process with a 9.5 billion dollar surplus in
the next fiscal year. His budget document projects 1.1 trillion
dollars in surpluses over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
While Clinton would achieve surplus three years earlier than
the 2002 deadline set in last summer's balanced-budget agreement
with the Congress, he also wants to boost spending and pay for
that increase by raising taxes by 90 billion dollars, mainly on
tobacco and corporations.
</P>
<P>
Clinton would pay for his new initiatives with 24 billion
dollars in corporate tax increases and 65.5 billion dollars in
higher tobacco taxes, both stretched over five years. The latter
increase would come through enactment of a tobacco settlement that
faces an uphill battle in Congress.
</P>
<P>
Republicans said it was highly questionable for Clinton to
stake so much of his budget on a tobacco agreement uncertain of
ratification. But administration officials defended the spending
blueprint as a faithful effort to adhere to the guidelines
hammered out in last year's balanced-budget deal.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. recorded budget deficits that led to a fivefold
increase in the national debt from less than 1 trillion dollars
when former President Ronald Reagan took office in 1981 to 5.4
trillion dollars today.
</P>
<P>
While the budget deficit hit a record of 290 billion dollars in
1992, it has declined steadily since then, falling to a 23-year
low of 22 billion dollars last year as the strong economy produced
an unexpected flood of new tax revenues.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Sends Envoy to Baghdad: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat sent an envoy to Baghdad
Monday to show support for Iraq over the weapons inspection
crisis, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The report said Azzam Ahmad, who is holding the PNA portfolio
of public works, carried a message of support from Arafat to Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein. There is no confirmation from the PNA
side.
</P>
<P>
The message will also brief Saddam on the Sunday meeting held
between Arafat and United States Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright in the West Bank city of Ramallah, the report said.
</P>
<P>
At the news conference following her talks with Arafat on
Sunday, Albright acknowledged she had discussed the Iraqi crisis
with Arafat. In her words, Arafat called for Saddam's compliance
with all United Nations Security Council resolutions while he
mentioned about the difficulties Iraqi people face under the
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said Arafat had already sent a message to
Saddam via the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) Ambassador
to Iraq "within the framework of attempts to find a peaceful
solution to the crisis and to try to prevent an explosion."
</P>
<P>
Albright is currently on an European and Middle East tour to
solicit support from the U.S. allies and Arab countries to the
U.S. plan on a possible military strike against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and his PLO strongly supported Saddam in the 1991 Gulf
War, thus alienating the PLO from the oil-rich Gulf states such as
Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, and resulting in the loss of huge
economic assistance.
</P>
<P>
Albright, meeting with Israeli and Palestinian leaders, was
trying to achieve progress in the Israeli-Palestinian peace
process so as to make it easier to rally support from Arab
states.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, however, has rejected Albright's idea to accept
Israel's proposal on gradual redeployment of troops from about 10
percent of the West Bank.

<HEADLINE> Latvia Suggests New Measures to Improve Ties with Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Latvian Foreign Minsiter Valdis
Birkavs has put forward several measures to improve the ties of
his country with Russia, the Interfax Agency reported Monday from
Rega, capital of Latvia.
</P>
<P>
Describing the measures as "constructive and pragmatic",
Birkavs said that the two countries "must start with specific,
thoroughly prepared steps" such as signing a border treaty so as
to improve the climate of bilateral relations and tackle the
issues of foremost importance to Russia.
</P>
<P>
He noted that relations between Russia and Latvia have improved
since last month when Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin
attended a conference of the Baltic Sea countries and the three
Baltic countries signed a Partnership Charter with the United
States.
</P>
<P>
The Partnership Charter "gave us more power to speak with
Russia on equal terms," he said.
</P>
<P>
As to Russia's offer of security guarantee for the Baltic
countries, Birkavs said it "can be viewed positively although they
do not fit Latvia's views of security."
</P>
<P>
Russia is criticizing Latvia for the fact that hundreds of
thousands of Russian-speakers in the country have not been
integrated as citizens.

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Europe's Loan Risk From Asia Crisis Manageable: S&AMP;P </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 2 (Xinhua) -- European banks could face a loss
of up to 20 billion U.S. dollars on their lending to Asia,
according to the latest estimates of Standard &AMP; Poor's.
</P>
<P>
The estimation was based on calculation by the credit rating
agency on European bank credit exposure to four Asian countries
affected by the current economic crisis: South Korea, Thailand,
Indonesia and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
S&AMP;P expected that 20 of all European banks exposed to the Asian
turmoil may carry 85-90 percent of an exposure of 110-130 billion
dollars to the four Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
It estimated that 30 percent of the loans to Thailand and 50
percent of those to Indonesia would be "non-performing" in 1998.
</P>
<P>
However, S&AMP;P believed that European banks are strong enough to
weather the shock. "The potential damage is manageable in the
context of the capital strength and indeed the earnings capacity
of the European banking sector," the agency said.

<HEADLINE> Poverty in Zambia on Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's Central Statistical
Office has disclosed that the incidence of poverty in Zambia has
been decreasing steadily from 1993, Times of Zambia reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
People living in poverty in Zambia rose from 69.9 percent in
1991 to 73.8 percent in 1993 and decreased to 69.9 percent in
1996, according to a statement released in the capital Sunday by
the office.
</P>
<P>
David Diangamo, director of the office, said in the statement
that the steady decline in poverty is expected to continue.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the increase between 1992 and 1993 to the
initial implementation of the structural adjustment program which
resulted in a number of people being vulnerable due to
privatization and retrenchments.
</P>
<P>
Diangamo added that the other reason for the increase in
poverty is the severe drought which impoverished a number of
households.
</P>
<P>
He also disclosed that extreme poverty increased from 58.2
percent in 1991 to 60.6 percent in 1993 and steadily declined to
53.2 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The reduction in poverty levels is mainly due to the improved
performance of the informal sector where significant increase in
incomes has been recorded, explained Diangamo.
</P>
<P>
The director also attributed the reduction in poverty to the
shift by rural households from traditional low income crops to
cash crops.

<P>
BONN, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Former German Economics Minister
Juergen Moellemann is heading for Iran Monday to try to save a
German businessman from death penalty for having sexual relations
with a Moslem woman, the German Bild newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
Moellemann is due to hold talks with Iranian government
representatives, trying to help the 56-year-old Hamburg
automobiles and textiles exporter, Helmut Hofer, who were
sentenced to death by an Iranian court a week ago.
</P>
<P>
Moellemann's trip was confirmed later Monday by German Foreign
Minister Klaus Kinkel at a news conference here. But he said the
former minister was not going to Tehran on behalf of the German
government.
</P>
<P>
Expressing his shock at the death sentence, Kinkel also
repeated his call for Hofer's release.
</P>
<P>
On speculations in the German press that there could be
political considerations behind the incidence, Kinkel said that he
did not have the impression that Tehran was attempting to strain
bilateral relations through the death sentence.
</P>
<P>
German-Iranian ties just recovered from a bitter dispute last
year after a German court ruled that Iranian leaders had ordered
the killings of four Kurdish dissidents in a Berlin restaurant in
1992.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Capital To Enrich Poor Farmers In Hilly Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Beijing, the Chinese capital,
has launched a three-year program to help enrich one million rural
people living in its remote hilly areas.
</P>
<P>
This is the fourth scheme of the city government to boost local
economic development in these areas through implementing
large-scale water conservation projects.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, each mountain resident will own 0.12 hectare
of irrigated farmlands by the end of this century.
</P>
<P>
In the hilly areas, which account for 60 percent of the city's
total, local farmers' yearly income is only half that of those who
live on the plain.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the city suffered from a severe drought. Local
authorities feared that the calamity might hinder development in
the hilly areas. However, the drought has become a driving force
for local farmers to build irrigation facilities.
</P>
<P>
The government program has allowed individuals to purchase,
contract, lease, sell, inherit and own small irrigation projects.
</P>
<P>
Individuals can also set up joint ventures with the government
to build the infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Some 130,000 hectares of farmlands will benefit from the
program, and the investment is expected to be recovered within two
years.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, local farmers have invested 18 million yuan in the
program, exceeding the sum invested by the government, for the
first time.

<HEADLINE> Measles Cases Down Sharply in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The number of measles cases
decreased by 94 percent last January compared with the same period
in 1997, the Philippine Health Department said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Only 65 measles cases with no report of death were admitted at
the San Lazaro Hospital, the government referral center for
infectious diseases, last January, compared to 1,048 admissions
with 52 deaths in January 1997, the department said.
</P>
<P>
The low measles admissions last month surprised health experts
since the viral disease incidence peaks between January and April.
</P>
<P>
Health Secretary Carmencita Reodica attributed the drop to her
department's nationwide immunization program.
</P>
<P>
Reodica said routine anti-measles vaccination of all nine-month
old infants has been given free in all health facilities
nationwide since 1983.
</P>
<P>
"Vaccination is the most effective way of protecting our
children from measles considered a severe disease that kills about
3,000 Filipino children every year," the health chief said.
</P>
<P>
To prevent the high transmissibility of measles, she said, the
health department will launch a mass vaccination by September this
year to reach all children aged between nine months and 14 years.
</P>
<P>
"These are the main strategies to interrupt the transmission of
the disease," she said.
</P>
<P>
She further noted that most of the measles cases in 1997 were
unvaccinated and case fatality ratio was significantly higher for
those below nine months compared with those nine months or older.
</P>
<P>
Measles is highly contagious and it could reduce body
resistance and make a patient susceptible to more serious
complications such as pneumonia, otitis media, diarrhea and
encephalitis, which may cause death if not properly attended to.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong's GDP Up in Third Quarter of 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The gross domestic product
(GDP) of Hong Kong had a robust, albeit somewhat decelerated,
growth of 5.7 percent in real terms over a year earlier, the local
Census and Statistics Department said Monday.
</P>
<P>
As to external trade in goods, re-exports increased by 4.2
percent in real terms from July to September 1997 against the
same period of the previous year. Meanwhile, domestic exports
recovered to a growth of 6 percent in real terms, arresting a
declining trend since the fourth quarter of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on these latest GDP figures, a local government
spokesman said growth of Hong Kong's economy was particularly
robust during the first three quarters of last year, especially in
the second quarter, with the GDP growth rate hitting the highest
since the third quarter of 1992.
</P>
<P>
However, he cautioned that a market slackening in growth was
likely to have occurred in the fourth quarter of 1997, as the
contagion effect of the regional financial turmoil spread to the
Hong Kong economy.
</P>
<P>
The preliminary estimates of Hong Kong's GDP for 1997 as a
whole are expected to be released on February 18.

<HEADLINE> Tibet, Once a Province of China in Yuan Dynasty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Scholar Wang Gui has
released the results of research showing that Tibet was a province
of China during the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368).
</P>
<P>
Wang, an expert at Tibetan studies, said that the Yuan Dynasty
government established the Council of Buddhist Affairs to
administer Tibet, an area which at that time was known as Tubo
(Tufan), or ancient Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Wang pointed to the fact that various historical documents in
Tibetan and English clearly referred to Tibet as "Tibet (Tubo)
Province" or the "Province of Tibet (Tubo)", much as they would
refer to Sichuan and Shaanxi provinces.
</P>
<P>
He said that discoveries in the historical documents provide
convincing proof of China's sovereignty over Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Wang said he found the terms of "Tibet Province" and "the
Province of Tibet" mainly in "The Genealogy of Sagya", a classical
Tibetan work, and "The Travels of Marco Polo", the English version
on the life of the Italian explorer.
</P>
<P>
"The Genealogy of Sagya", which records relations between the
Yuan Dynasty and the Sagya Sect in ancient Tibet, says that
Emperor Kublai Khan governed 11 provinces. Tubo, the smallest
province in area, was the home of Grand Master Phatspa, and the
source of Buddhism in China.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that Marco Polo, who was guest of the Yuan Dynasty
court for 17 years, listed Tubo as a Chinese province in his book
entitled "The Travels of Marco Polo".
</P>
<P>
Wang said the English version of the book, published by the
Macmilan Company in 1927, contains the phrase "Province of Tibet",
on page 172. The phrase "the Province of Tibet" is included in
the version published by an American publishing house or the John
Publishing Company in New York in 1948 -- on page 100.
</P>
<P>
"It's interesting that the Tibetan and English books, all
considered highly authoritative historical records, share
identical points of view on the fact that Tibet was a Chinese
province during the Yuan Dynasty," said Wang.
</P>
<P>
Various Chinese historical documents show that the central

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Mediate Over Iraqi Crisis: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- A Turkish official declared
here Monday that Iraq has accepted Turkey's proposal to mediate
on the crisis between the United States and Iraq over the arms
inspection.
</P>
<P>
Necati Utkan, spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, told a
weekly press conference that Turkey has got a confirmative
response from the Iraqi government to the peace initiative.
</P>
<P>
"Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem will go to Baghdad on a
mission aimed at contributing to a solution to the crisis," Utkan
said, declining to say whether a concrete plan has been prepared.
</P>
<P>
He did not reveal the exact date of Cem's trip to Iraq, just
saying that "the foreign minister will visit Baghdad in the coming
days."
</P>
<P>
He also said that Turkey welcomes the participation of other
neighboring countries of Iraq, such as Iran, Jordan as well as
Saudi Arabia, to the peace initiative.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's mediation proposal came after Iraq rejected a demand
from the U.S.-led United Nations arms inspection team that the
Iraqi presidential palace be checked for suspected weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
Utkan said that Turkey is firmly opposed to proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction in the region.
</P>
<P>
He, however, said that Turkey hopes that the confrontation
between Iraq and the United States could be solved through
peaceful and diplomatic means.
</P>
<P>
The sovereignty of Iraq and the well being of the Iraqi people
should also be taken into serious consideration at the same time,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz said that
Turkey would not take an active role in any military action
against Iraq and had reservations about participating passively.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the Turkish government is now also in
close contacts with the U.S. side on any new developments
regarding the Iraqi crisis.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the United States has not made a request of
using the Incirlik air base in southern Turkey for possible
military strike against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Incirlik air base was used by Western allies' warplanes to
launch air raids on Baghdad during the Gulf War following the
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Investment in Guangxi Hits Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region reported record high levels of exports
and overseas investment last year, according to deputy regional
chairman Zhang Wenxue.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that Guangxi's exports rose 9.7
percent to 3.06 billion U.S. dollars in 1997, while its actual use
of overseas investment surged 23.5 percent to 1.26 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Also last year, Guangxi registered a 117 percent increase in
its value of contractual overseas investment, with the total
amount reaching 1.47 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Zhang attributed the significant growth in exports and overseas
investment to Guangxi's increased efforts to improve its
investment environment and open itself wider to other parts of the
world.
</P>
<P>
Since the early 1990s, Guangxi has increased its investment in
infrastructure such as transportation, telecommunication and
energy, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
He added that Guangxi has also taken effective measures to
improve the environment for overseas investors, such as
eliminating unreasonable fees and establishing specialized
agencies to deal with complaints.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Cocoa Export Drops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria recorded a drop in its
cocoa export between September and November last year, the vital
period of the 1997-98 harvest season, according to the Federal
Products Inspection Service (FPIS).
</P>
<P>
The cocoa harvest months in the country range from September
to March every year.
</P>
<P>
An FPIS report said total export in the three months under
review amounted to 29,514 tons, falling by at least 29,407 tons
from that registered a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The figures for December 1997 and January 1998 are yet to be
released, but exporters have given the indication of low trading
since the pre-Christmas period, the Business Concord reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
They said the December 1997 export would be lower than the
33,900 tons in the same month a year earlier as demand for
Nigeria cocoa was being discounted overseas.
</P>
<P>
However, larger volume is expected during this January-March
period as enough stockpile may have been effected during the
Christmas and New Year holidays.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports have projected lower production of 150,000 to
155,000 tons for the 1997-98 harvest season due to slow pace of
research that could have led to cultivation of new cocoa
plantations as the existing ones are aging.

<HEADLINE> HK Welcomes Brazil's End of Textile Restriction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hong Kong, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The government of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) Monday welcomed Brazil's
revocation of quantitative restriction on the import of woven
artificial filament fabrics in compliance with the demand of the
World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
"We are pleased with Brazil's decision as it signifies not only
removal of unwarranted quota restriction against Hong Kong textile
products, but more importantly disciplines in the multilateral
trading system," said Patrick Nip, assistant director-general of
the Trade Department of the SAR government.
</P>
<P>
The revocation of Brazil's quantitative restriction on Hong
Kong textile products is a result of Hong Kong's representation to
the Textiles Monitoring Body (TMB) of the WTO back in 1996, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Brazil had claimed that there was an upsurge in the import of
Hong Kong textile products and that it caused serious damage to
its domestic industry.
</P>
<P>
Invoking the WTO Agreement on Textiles and Clothing's safeguard
provisions which permit temporary restriction on imports up to
three years, Brazil imposed quantitative restriction on the import
of Hong Kong textile products in June 1996.
</P>
<P>
As no mutually satisfactory solution was reached in
consultations with Brazil in July 1996, Hong Kong took the matter
to the TMB in November 1996 and March 1997 respectively.
</P>
<P>
The TMB ruled that the Brazilian action should be terminated by
the end of 1997 at the latest.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Air India facing with an
acute financial crisis has decided to discontinue many of its
existing loss-making international flight routes.
</P>
<P>
Managing Director of Air India M. P. Mascarenhas told a press
conference here Monday that his airline, India's international
flag carrier, would discontinue its services from Seoul of South
Korea where the airlines was incurring huge losses because of the
recent currency crisis affecting Southeast Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Services would also be suspended in Japan from where traffic
and earnings were going down because of a decrease in tourist
traffic and fluctuations of the yen, he said.
</P>
<P>
Air India services to South Africa would also be discontinued
because it is an uneconomic route, he further said.
</P>
<P>
The airline however would increase its services to the Gulf
region, to Chicago, the United States and Manchester, England, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Air India managing director said the currency crisis in
Southeast Asian countries and a fare war started by British
Airways had severely affected the working of his company, bringing
its losses to 1.02 billion rupees (27.2 million U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Dredging Project for Guangzhou Port to Start in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, February 2 (Xinhua) -- A project to dredge and
deepen the sea-bound channel of the Guangzhou Harbor has been
approved by the central government. Work is scheduled to begin in
June.
</P>
<P>
The project should be completed within two years and, by then,
vessels with a capacity of 50,000 dead-weight tonnage will be able
to sail into the Huangpu Port Block.
</P>
<P>
Huang Guosheng, director of the port administration, said that
the port, located in Guangzhou, capital of south China's Guangdong
Province, is the largest of its kind in south China. But the depth
of its sea-bound channel is insufficient to cope with growing
demands.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the ranking of the port regarding the handling volume
dropped to fourth in the country, compared with third in 1996,
though it handled 75 million tons of goods last year.
</P>
<P>
The dredging project will be carried out in two phases, with a
total investment of 1.5 billion yuan to be jointly financed by the
central, provincial and city governments.
</P>
<P>
The depth of the channel will be increased from the current
10.5 meters to 12.5 meters when the project is completed.
</P>
<P>
The completion of the project is expected to increase the
viability of the port, Huang said.
</P>
<P>
In 1997 the port handled 680,000 TEUs of containers, up 20
percent over the previous year, ranking sixth in the
country.

<HEADLINE> Argentinean President Visits Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Argentinean President Carlos
Menem arrived here Monday afternoon for discussions with Lebanese
leaders on various issues, including the Mideast peace.
</P>
<P>
This is the first ever visit by an Argentinean head of state to
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
During his three-day stay, he will meet his Lebanese
counterpart Elias Hrawi and other senior officials on the
situation in the south and the bilateral economic ties.
</P>
<P>
Menem, who is of Syrian descent, has visited Syria and other
Arab nations in the past as part of efforts to reactivate the
Middle East peace talks and also attended the U.S.-sponsored
Madrid talks between the Arab states and Israel in 1991.
</P>
<P>
He has always called on the Arab nations not to abandon peace
talks with Israel despite setbacks in the past two years since
hard-liner Benjamin Netanyahu became Israel's prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Argentina was one of the first nations to recognize Lebanon's
independence in 1945 and was quick to establish full diplomatic
ties.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that more than 1.2 million Argentineans are of
Lebanese origin, making the second largest Lebanese expatriates
community in South America after Brazil.
</P>
<P>
After visiting Lebanon, Menem will proceed to Egypt on February
4 where he is expected to inaugurate an Argentinean-built
non-military nuclear reactor worth 100 million
U.S. dollars.

GUANGZHOU, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Ou Guangyuan, vice-governor
of South China's Guangdong Province, said today that his province
will go on with its work of poverty alleviation, though absolute
poverty has been almost eradicated.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that by the end of 1997, 583,000 out of 600,000
poor people in the province earned more than 1,000 yuan (120
U.S. dollars) as the annual income, which enabled them to make a
living with enough food and clothing.
</P>
<P>
But 40 percent of these poor people, totalling 250,000, still
need help in maintaining their basic living standard, Ou said. The
province also bears the responsibility to help people living in
ethnic minority areas and under harsh natural conditions, he said.
</P>
<P>
The key point of Guangdong's poverty alleviation will shift to
improving the productive force and overall quality of farmers
through science and technology, Ou said.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government will continue to retain its poverty
relief funds and projects, infrastructure construction and
training courses for poverty-stricken areas, he said.

<HEADLINE> Search for Missing Philippine Plane Suspended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Rescue operations for a missing
Philippine passenger plane carrying 104 people were suspended late
 Monday afternoon due to low visibility, rescue officials said.
</P>
<P>
Captain Christie Datu of the Philippine Air Force told
reporters that the Air Force suspended its rescue efforts at 5
p.m. local time due to poor weather conditions and low visibility.
</P>
<P>
He said the search operation will resume early Tuesday morning
and concentrate on a mountainous area northeast of Cagayan de Oro
City, the destination for the ill-fated Cebu-Pacific Air plane, on
the southern island of Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Datu said a helicopter pilot returning from the search mission
said he spotted the plane's wreckage while he was airborne over
Mount Kabantao, some 16 kilometers away from the Cagayan de Oro
City airport.
</P>
<P>
But Datu added that the report has yet to be verified since the
helicopter could not reach the suspected crash site due to the
stiff terrain.
</P>
<P>
Datu also ruled out a possible hijack of the DC-9 McDonnell
Douglas jet plane since no related radio communication was
received.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said all airports and cities near Cagayan de Oro
City had reported no landing of the plane, carrying 99 passengers,
including four foreigners, and five crew members.
</P>
<P>
The 16-year-old aircraft, which took off from the Manila
Domestic Airport at 9:00 a.m. local time, was scheduled to land in
the Cagayan de Oro City airport, some 500 miles (800 kilometers)
south of Manila, at about 11:00 a.m.
</P>
<P>
But the plane made an unscheduled stopover in Tacloban City and
failed to arrive at the destination.
</P>
<P>
Air transport officials said the pilot of the aircraft, Captain
Paulo Justo, made a last radio contact 13 minutes before
approaching the runway of Cagayan de Oro City airport.
</P>
<P>
The plane had asked for an emergency landing about 60
kilometers away from the city.
</P>
<P>
The Cebu-Pacific Air, owned 49 percent by Filipino-Chinese
billionaire John Gokongwei, is one of several new airlines
established after the Philippine government deregulated the
aviation industry two and a half years ago.

BAGHDAD, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz Monday met Russian President Boris Yeltsin's envoy
Viktor Posuvalyuk, who arrived here late Sunday night for exerting
efforts to solve the Iraqi crisis, Iraq News Agency (INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
INA gave no further details of the meeting. It only said the
current visit of Posuvalyuk comes within the efforts made by
Russia to resolve the crisis. This is the second visit to Iraq by
Posuvalyuk in one week.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf has described
the talks held by the Russian envoy with the Iraqi leadership
during his former visit to Iraq as positive, adding that Russian
Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov's current tour of Europe is a
product of the contacts between Iraq and Russia with the aim of
resolving the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Political observers here expect Posuvalyuk to meet Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein and hand him a message from Yeltsin. He
will also become acquainted with the Iraqi president's response to
Russia's proposals for a solution to the crisis over inspection of
Iraqi presidential palaces.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been refusing to allow the U.N. arms inspectors to
enter its sensitive sites, including presidential palaces, where
the inspectors suspect chemical and biological weapons are hidden.
</P>
<P>
INA also reported that Iraq's National Assembly (parliament)
held an exceptional meeting Monday morning to debate Iraq's
relationship with the U.N. Special Commission on dismantling Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction, the U.N. sanctions, and the
U.S. constant threats to take military action against Iraq.

The Assembly has endorsed a statement by the Iraqi leadership
emphasizing that Iraq would not stand pinioned in the face of
continuation of the U.N. sanctions and the U.S. threats.

SHANGHAI, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Women's federations in
Shanghai, China's biggest industrial city, have helped 78,000
laid-off female workers find jobs in the past four years, by
taking a series of measures.
</P>
<P>
Through lectures and artistic performances, women's federations
at various levels in Shanghai have worked to clear up social
discriminations against laid-off women and helped expand their
opportunities to find new jobs.
</P>
<P>
For example, Hu Shuhua, who had been laid off, opened a garment
business together with other women workers. And Wu Zizhong, who
also was laid off, found a new job as a hospital nurse.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, women's federations in Shanghai have opened
more than 200 training courses on such subjects as marketing and
accounting. A computer network was also established to help
laid-off female workers, especially those in older age groups.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the women's federations offered neighborhood
services such as snack bars, canteens and part-time domestic help
to absorb 4,500 laid-off women last year.

<HEADLINE> Albright Carries No Proposals to Arafat: PNA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) said Monday that U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright put up no formal proposals to the Palestinians on her
current tour in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
PNA Minister of Local Government and Municipal and Village
Affairs Saeb Erekat, in a telephone interview with Voice of Arabs
Radio from Jericho, said Albright "did not present any official
suggestions" to PNA President Yasser Arafat when they met Sunday
in the West Bank city of Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
Erekat said that the two-hour talks between Arafat and Albright
last weekend dwelt on a series of ideas and details related to
endeavors exerted to put the peace march back on its normal track.
</P>
<P>
"Arafat underscored to Albright that the Palestinian stance is
based on the fact that Palestinians were ready to cooperate with
any quarter in order to implement signed agreements with Israelis
provided that no party departs from the framework or principles of
these agreements," he said.
</P>
<P>
Peacemaking between Israel and the Palestinians has been
blocked for almost a year, with the sides now deadlocked over the
issues of a long overdue Israeli troop pullback from the West Bank
and Palestinian steps to improve security.
</P>
<P>
Senior Palestinian and Israeli officials reported no movement
towards ending the stalemate as a result of Albright's visit.
</P>
<P>
Her visit followed separate talks U.S. President Bill Clinton
held with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Arafat in
Washington last month which also failed to narrow the gulf between
the sides.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has reportedly rejected Clinton's proposal of a phased
Israeli withdrawal and delaying the rest pullbacks until the
holding of the final status talks.
</P>
<P>
Albright, after her meeting with Arafat, said that Israeli and
Palestinian envoys would go to Washington next week to resume
talks on ways of pushing forward the stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
In her press conference in Ramallah with Arafat, Albright said
U.S. efforts for reactivating the process achieved slight
progress, warning that the current stalemate of the peace process
has lasted for long enough.
</P>
<P>
Albright will fly to Egypt Tuesday morning for talks with
President Hosni Mubarak and Foreign Minister Amr Moussa during her
second visit here in just over a year as secretary of state.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Bank Sells Shares to Asian Buyers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- In a privatization drive,
Uganda Commercial Bank (UCB) sold 49 percent of its shares and
Westmont Land (Asia) Berhad, a Malaysian group, has paid some 10
million U.S. Dollars to acquire the shares.
</P>
<P>
The 49 percent of share-holding money of UCB was deposited in
the bank's account in Citibank, New York on January 27, 1998 by
the Malaysian International Financial Group, to the Ugandan
government, ''the New Vision'' reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian buyers had three months beginning last October
to pay 11 billion Uganda Shillings for UCB shares. The balance of
one billion Shillings will be paid within an extended period of a
month up to the end of March due to restriction resulted from
foreign exchange transfer in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
UCB is the largest commercial bank in the country. the Ugandan
government decided to sell part of its shares and privatize other
important state enterprises such as Uganda Electric Board and its
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
The government will hold 51 percent of the shares of UCB.
</P>
<P>
Leonard Muganwa, the Executive Director of Enterprise
Development Project in the privatization unit, confirmed the
report and said the buyers will submit the names of their extra
staff to Bank of Uganda this month. ''They will begin operations
this month,'' Muganwa said.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Accuses Japan's Fishery Accord Abolition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 2 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's National Assembly
(parliament) Monday unanimously adopted a resolution, denouncing
Japan's recent scrapping of a bilateral fishery agreement.
</P>
<P>
"It is deeply regrettable that the Japanese government
unilaterally abolished the fishery agreement," said the resolution.
</P>
<P>
The parliament said Japan should take full responsibility for
any possible incidents which would occur as a result of its
scrapping of the 1965 accord.
</P>
<P>
It urged the Japanese government to take a sincere attitude
toward future negotiations between the two countries on revisions
of the accord so that friendly relations could be maintained.
</P>
<P>
The parliament also urged the South Korean government to take
all possible measures, including the scrapping of its
self-regulation of the operation of South Korean fishing boats
near Japan's waters.
</P>
<P>
On January 23, Japan announced its decision to invalidate the
fishery pact after the two countries failed to reach a revised
treaty over fishing after 10 rounds of negotiations in the past
two years.
</P>
<P>
Revising the 1965 fishery pact has long been a thorny issue
between the two nations because they have to redraw their sea
boundaries under a U.N. maritime convention.
</P>
<P>
The pact stipulates that it will remain effective one year as
from the time one side notifies the other of its unilateral
invalidation of the pact. The one-year period is designed for
further talks for a revision of the pact.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 2 (Xinhua) -- China is planning to further
promote its cultural image abroad in a variety of ways, including
using the Internet.
</P>
<P>
According to a plan of the Culture Ministry, the country will
urge provinces and cities to join in cultural exchanges with
foreign countries, in addition to strengthening inter-governmental
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
A program introducing China's 5,000-year-old culture on the
Internet is planned, and channels for promoting commercial
performances and exhibitions abroad will be created.
</P>
<P>
However, cultural activities that might degrade the country's
dignity will be banned, according to the plan.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Chinese musicians staged a folk concert in
Vienna, raising the curtain for many international cultural events
with China playing the leading role, including the China
International Fine Arts Year and China International Vocal Music
Contest.
</P>
<P>
The Culture Ministry is planning to stage art festivals in
South Africa, the Middle East and Spain; hold an exhibition in the
United States; and take part in the Asian Art Festival this year.
</P>
<P>
China's increasingly active cultural role in the international
arena has been in proportion to its robust economy and rising
international status, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
The Culture Ministry plan also includes more exchanges with the
Hong Kong SAR (Special Administrative Region), Macao and Taiwan.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Have More Private Phone Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's deregulation
(decentralization) of the telecommunications sector will go
further ahead this week, with five more private telephone firms
expected to start operation.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian newspaper reported Monday that the independent
telephone network is already connected to the network of the
state-owned Nigerian Telecommunications Limited (NITEL).
</P>
<P>
Four others, namely, the Em-International Systems Limited,
Intercellular Nigeria Limited, Mobitel Limited and Communications
Infrastructure Limited is now at the point of interconnection,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
The five companies will be providing 45,000 digital lines in
the Lagos area in the beginning and have the capacity of 280,000
lines in the future, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's liberalization of the telecommunications sector
started with the introduction of decree 75 in 1992, which breaks
the monopoly of the NITEL and encourages private investment in
the sector.
</P>
<P>
The liberalization process took the first solid step two
months ago, with the formal operation of 10,000 digital lines by
the private multi-links telecommunications limited.

<HEADLINE> Chicken Sales Near Normal in Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The sales of chicken have come
near to the normal level over the past week, local chicken dealers
said.
</P>
<P>
Macao imported some 43,000 chickens over the past 10 days, and
sales have risen to about 4,000 a day, about the same in the
corresponding period last year.
</P>
<P>
The Va Kio newspaper said Monday that the rise of chicken sales
was the joint result of the Chinese Lunar New Year, the
announcement of Hong Kong to resume imports of chickens in
February, and the confirmation that no case of bird flu was
detected in Macao.
</P>
<P>
Hit by the fear of bird flu, imports of chickens plummeted to
about 500 a day in the worst time late last year. But the sales
gradually recovered in January.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that if current sales continue next week, the
sales of chicken will return to the normal level of about 7,000 a
day. That will mark the end of the fear of bird flu, it added.

JOHANNESBURG, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The United States has put
more investment in South Africa since the latter abolished
apartheid in 1994, local Business Report quoted an American
research institute as reporting Monday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. presence in South Africa has surpassed the investment
levels of U.S. firms in the early 1980s, Peter De Simone, leader
of the Investor Responsibility Research Center (IRRC), said.
</P>
<P>
The number of U.S. companies with investments in South Africa
has almost tripled from 104 in 1991 to 296 today, according to
the IRRC.
</P>
<P>
SBC Communications, the largest single U.S. investor so far, paid
757 million U.S. Dollars last year for a 30 percent stake in Telkom,
South Africa's parastatal telephone company.
</P>
<P>
Another newcomer to South Africa is McDonald's, which was forced
to wage a copyright fight against a local company which had taken
the same name under apartheid.
</P>
<P>
These newcomers, as well as returnee such as Dow Chemical, have
pushed the level of assets held by U.S. companies to an all-time
high, more than three times in real terms what they held in the
early 1980s, the report said.

MACAO, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Tourist arrivals to Macao reached
seven million last year, down 14.1 percent from 1996.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the Macao Census and Statistics Department
Monday show that a total of 7,000,370 tourists arrived in Macao in
1997.
</P>
<P>
While the number of passengers from Taiwan increased 19.5
percent, those from Japan, Southeast Asia, the Republic of Korea,
Australia, North and South Americas, Europe and Hong Kong all
dropped.

The number of passengers coming from or via Hong Kong declined
20 percent from that in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The largest drop was from Japan, down 43.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Local Analysts say that the decline of arrivals was the result
of the currency crisis in Southeast Asia, the less tourist
arrivals to Hong Kong and a rising crime rate in Macao.
</P>
<P>
Tourism is a leading sector of the economy in Macao, which has
a population of 415,000.

<HEADLINE> South Korea's Overseas Construction Orders Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 2 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's construction firms
won overseas contracts valued at 102 million U.S. dollars in
January, accounting for only 10.1 percent of the same month last
year.
</P>
<P>
The International Contractors Association of Korea said Monday
that the country's construction firms set a record last year by
receiving orders amounting to 14.03 billion dollars from abroad.
</P>
<P>
The association attributed the decrease to the current
financial crisis sweeping South Korea and Southeast Asian
countries which are the major markets for South Korean builders.
</P>
<P>
Among January's construction contracts are five new
small-amount orders from Mexico, the Philippines, Laos, Tanzania
and Britain.
</P>
<P>
The Southeast Asian countries, suffering from financial problem
resulting from sharp devaluation of their currencies against the
U.S. dollar, have been reducing their infrastructure projects
since late last year.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to make up for the declining orders from the
Southeast Asian countries, South Korean builders are exploring new
markets such as Central and South America and Africa, where they
had paid little attention in the past.
</P>
<P>
They are also seeking orders from the Middle East, once the
largest market for South Korean firms in the late 1970s and early
1980s.
</P>
<P>
South Korea predicted last month that this year's overseas
construction order receipts will decline by about 30 percent to 10
billion dollars.

<P>
BEIJING, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Thirty-two production lines
seized by Chinese officials for manufacturing unauthorized CDs are
now making legal merchandise, according to the Press and
Publications Administration.
</P>
<P>
Last year, China seized more than 50 underground CD production
lines, mainly in the southern province of Guangdong. The
crackdowns have curbed rampant copyright infringement.
</P>
<P>
However, a shortage of authorized video and audio products on
the domestic market resulted in the administration's decision in
October to re-open some of the confiscated production lines.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that one of the reasons for copyright violations
is that lawful producers cannot meet the market demand for CDs.
</P>
<P>
The 32 production lines were sold to lawful CD factories in
Beijing, Shanghai and Guangdong, where the local governments have
stationed copyright supervisors and management has been tightened,
according to the administration.
</P>
<P>
The government has also begun establishing state-owned CD
conglomerates as a way to readjust the industrial structure, which
was dominated by privately or collectively owned businesses and
joint ventures.

monetary authorities to halt the yen's drop against the
U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The reserves consist of convertible foreign currencies, gold
and International Monetary Fund (IMF) special drawing rights.
</P>
<P>
Japan was the world's largest holder of foreign exchange
reserves as of the end of November for the 51st consecutive month,
the ministry said.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Chief Arrives in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 2 (Xinhua) -- World Bank President James
Wolfensohn arrived here Monday on a two-day visit to Malaysia as
part of his six East Asian nation tour to hear first-hand from
Asian governments and representatives from civil society and the
private sector about the impact of the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Wolfensohn, who arrived from Singapore, is scheduled to hold
talks with Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister
Anwar Ibrahim Monday night.
</P>
<P>
He is also expected to meet Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Wolfensohn who already visited Thailand and Singapore will also
visit Indonesia, the Philippines and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Just hours before Wolfensohn's arrival here, the World Bank
said in a statement issued in Washington that it is engaged in a
renewed policy dialogue with Malaysia aimed at supporting the
government's own efforts to address the country's financial and
social issues.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in Singapore, the World Bank chief told reporters that
the programs undertaken by Malaysia to deal with the country's
current financial and economic problems have been "effective".
</P>
<P>
He said that Malaysia has got the capacity to deal with the
crisis.

<HEADLINE> Ferrara's Operation Set to be Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Surgeons will not do a rush
operation on Ciro Ferrara with a hope to save the Italy and
Juventus defender to compete in the World Cup finals this summer.
</P>
<P>
Ferrara broke both bones in his leg in a tackle during Sunday's
league game at Lecce and was due for an operation on Monday.
</P>
<P>
But surgeons at the Turin clinic are now expected to wait until
Tuesday, to allow time for swelling to go down.
</P>
<P>
The most optimistic outcome is that Ferrara will be out for
three months -- taking him through to early May. He will then be
able to start training with Juventus.
</P>
<P>
However, it leaves him precious little time to reach match
fitness again, and even less for him to get a few games under his
belt before the Italian squad leave for France.
</P>
<P>
The finals start on June 10, with Italy turning out on June 11
against Chile in Bordeaux.
</P>
<P>
Italy's coach Cesare Maldini said: "It's terrible. Let's just
hope that Ferrara gets fully fit again as soon as possible, for
his benefit rather than the national team's."
</P>
<P>
It would not be the first time, though, that Ferrara missed a
major event.
</P>
<P>
An abdomenal injury shortly beforehand cost him the 1996
European championships, and a torn thigh muscle meant he missed
Italy's 0-0 draw with England last October in their last World
Cup qualifying game.

<HEADLINE> World Market Urged to Open to Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni asked for a mutual beneficial globalization of world
economy in Davos Economic Summit, Switzerland, local media
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The globalization is not new to Africa, but it is connected
with slavery, imperialism and colonialism in the continent in the
past, the president said.
</P>
<P>
What Africa wants now is mutual beneficial globalization, the
president underlined.
</P>
<P>
Some constraints hindering development of African economies
must be removed, Museveni said, referring to problems Africa are
faced with, including inadequate infrastructure, low numbers of
entrepreneurs, inadequate scientific research, debt burden and
agricultural modernization.
</P>
<P>
Africa cannot be intergrated into world economy without
addressing these problems, local media quoted the president as
saying.
</P>
<P>
President Yoweri Museveni was backed by Jerry Rawlings, the
head of state of Ghana, and Daniel Duncan, the Prime Minister of
Cote d'Ivoire.
</P>
<P>
Jerry Rawlings and Daniel Duncan asked last Saturday for
access to European markets for a smooth globalization, reports
reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
President Museveni also met with Newt Gingrich, the speaker of
the United States' house of representative, and Chilean president
Eduardo Fei.
</P>
<P>
Museveni discussed with Gingrich promotion of U.S. investment
and infrastructure development in Uganda. Gingrich informed
Museveni that the U.S. congress is backing the Africa trade bill
which will soon be forwarded to President Bill Clinton for final
approval.
</P>
<P>
Museveni and his Chilean counterpart discussed ways of
cooperation to use Chilean expertise in food processing to help
build up and promote food industry in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents agreed the two sides will issue a joint
communique on cooperation through their diplomatic
representatives in Washington.
</P>
<P>
A Chilean technical team will visit Uganda to lay the ground
work for improving processing foods including fish and fruits.

gross national product grew 5.8 percent last year, more than
predicted following Asia's financial crisis.

With this, the Phisix has risen a stunning 441.63 points or
25.9 percent over the past six trading days.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Plays Key Role in Social Sector: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 2 (Xinhua) -- World Bank President James
Wolfensohn said here Monday that the World Bank is paying special
attention to the social impact the current financial crisis has on
the regional economies and that a balance should be achieved
between financial and social restructuring.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters at a press conference that the purpose of his
current tour in the region is to follow through on those parts of
analysis and restructuring programs that are for the bank to do.
</P>
<P>
They are essentially in two parts, he said. The first is to
follow up on where the government is requested in the
restructuring and strengthening of the financial system and the
capital market.
</P>
<P>
On the other side, very significantly, he said, the bank has
played a key role in working on the social sector.
</P>
<P>
"It is to the social program the bank pays very special
attention," he said, adding that it is a primary function of the
bank to deal with the issues of poverty alleviation and
environment and social issues which, he said, "are our major
thrust".
</P>
<P>
He said that it is for that reason that the World Bank is
directing its attention on two sides of the issue and his
discussions here were to try to get a better understanding of both
the impact on the finance sector and also observations on the
social side.
</P>
<P>
He also said that during his meeting with Asia's trade union
leaders here, they expressed their fears that rising unemployment
resulting from the region's financial crisis will unleash social
havoc for troubled economies.
</P>
<P>
There were concerns that jobs are being lost and that in most
of the countries there is very little social underpinning, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
He gave the news conference after meeting with Prime Minister
Goh Chok Tong and Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong earlier in
the day. Wolfensohn arrived in Singapore Sunday as part of a
week-long tour of Southeast Asia, including Thailand, Indonesia,
the Philippines and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
He also met with Finance Minister Richard Hu Sunday evening. He
said these meetings, along with extensive works by the World Bank,
revealed that the social impact of unemployment was already being
"vigorously and immediately felt".

<HEADLINE> US Prefers Iraqi Changing Course: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The United States prefers
that the Iraqi President Saddam Hussein changes his course to a
diplomatic solution of the current crisis over the U.N. arms
inspection, the U.S. State Department spokesman said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
James Rubin told Xinhua at the Kuwaiti Airport before leaving
for Saudi Arabia that "We will prefer to see Saddam Hussein change
course and accept the requirements of the United Nations and allow
the inspectors to do their job, so that the threat of weapons of
mass destruction can be eliminated."
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been refusing to allow the U.N. arms inspectors to
enter sensitive places, including presidential palaces, where the
inspectors suspect chemical and biological weapons are hidden.
</P>
<P>
"If that (changing course) doesn't happen, we will not rule out
our options and we will do what is necessary to destroy its
ability to acquire and use weapons of mass destruction," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that "as far as the prospect of diplomacy working, we
will open to that possibility."
</P>
<P>
Rubin was accompanying the U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright on her Middle East tour to line up support for a
possible American strike against Iraqi targets.
</P>
<P>
Albright, wrapping up her two-day visit in Kuwait, left for
Saudi Arabia Monday to continue her tour which has already taken
her to Jerusalem and will further take her to Bahrain and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said "Albright was encouraged by her meeting with
Kuwaiti Emir last night and felt that the United States and
Kuwait are united in their determination to see Saddam Hussein
comply with U.N. and give up his weapons of mass destruction."
</P>
<P>
He said Albright and the U.S. Secretary of Defense William
Cohen have made clear that if diplomatic efforts fail to bring
any result, the "use of force would be substantial."
</P>
<P>
Referring the word "substantial," he said that this time "the
attacks would certainly be much more different" from what was
done before.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. was not able to convince Gulf countries of the need
for military reprisals when Iraq triggered the crisis by
expelling U.S. experts working with U.N. Special Commission on
eliminating weapons of mass destruction in Iraq last November.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Shrugs off Bad Trade Data </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar
shouldered worse-than-expected trade figures to close higher
Monday, boosted by a strong rally on the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The local currency finished at 68.19 U.S. cents, up from 67.01
U.S. cents here late Friday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. funds propelled the local currency nearly two U.S. cents
in New York Friday night, to a high of 68.80 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar consolidated its offshore rally in Sydney
Monday morning, only to be knocked back temporarily by news of an
880 million Australian dollars (598.4 million U.S. dollars)
deficit in the balance on goods and services in December.
</P>
<P>
Economists' forecasts for the balance on goods and services had
varied widely, from a surplus of 400 million Australian dollars
(272 million U.S. dollars) to a deficit of 650 million Australian
dollars (442 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Colonial State Bank foreign exchange dealer Nick Volanakis said
it was a bad figure for the Australian dollar, and the market
reacted by selling the currency.
</P>
<P>
The local currency dipped below 68 U.S. cents following the
release, but had regained the lost territory by the close.
</P>
<P>
"Aussie is in a very positive light considering how far it's
bounced since Friday night," he said.
</P>
<P>
"A lot of chartists are talking of a high up towards 69 to
69.50 U.S. cents," he added.
</P>
<P>
But Bankers Trust chief economist Chris Caton said the trade
figures would be interpreted by as many as the first sign of an
Asian effect, and thus may bring the recent rally in the currency
to a halt.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was at 86.19 Japanese yen, up from 85.40
locally Friday.
</P>
<P>
It also was at 1.2506 German marks from 1.2266.

<HEADLINE> Brittan Confident China to Join WTO in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAVOS, Switzerland, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Vice President of
the European Commission Sir Leon Brittan said he was confident
that China would be able to join the World Trade Organization
(WTO) in 1998 if the necessary momentum in the negotiations were
maintained.
</P>
<P>
"The message today is that we are prepared to move as quickly
as China on this matter," Brittan said at Sunday's plenary session
of the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum.
</P>
<P>
Brittan made the comment after China's Vice Premier Li Lanqing
said at the same session that China "will not add fuel to the
flames" at the time of the Asian crisis by devaluing its currency
Renminbi Yuan to keep its competitiveness in exports.
</P>
<P>
Li told the session that China, besides keeping RMB stable, has
offered help and will offer more help to its Asian neighbors to
tide them over the unprecedented crisis.
</P>
<P>
Brittan listed several principles under which China's accession
to the world trade body could be accelerated.
</P>
<P>
"China's membership of the WTO is not meant to be a benefit or
a favor only to China," he said. "The membership will offer China
a transparent, binding set of rules. By joining the WTO, the
country will receive assured, legal access to the world market."

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Surge on Singapore Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Share prices rose sharply on
the Singapore market as the benchmark Straits Times Industrials
Index (STII) surged 173.07 points to close at 1432.99 Monday.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that the STII ended sharply higher as regional
currencies firmed following major breakthroughs in efforts to ease
the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
They noted that shares were led by foreign buying on what was
perceived as an improving economic situation in the region. The
day's gains reflected pent-up demand given the local bourse which
was closed midday last Tuesday through last Friday for the Lunar
New Year and Hari Raya Puasa holidays.
</P>
<P>
Total market volume increased to 740.65 million units, valued
at 1022.04 million Singapore dollars (590.77 million U.S.
dollars). Advances overwhelmed declines by 407 to 21, while 188
other counters remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Renong Bhd was the most actively traded counter as it
registered a turnover of 41.9 million units. It was followed by
MBf Capital which had 35.07 million shares traded. Rekapac was
next with 28.51 million shares changed hands.
</P>
<P>
Local computer sound card maker Creative 50 led the gainers of
the day as it rose by 3.2 dollars to end at 34 Singapore dollars.
DBS (Development Bank of Singapore) Foreign increased by three
dollars to finish at 14 Singapore dollars, while Asean Fund was up
by 2.3 dollars to close at nine dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, ICT was the biggest loser as it declined by 49
cents to finish at 31 Hong Kong cents. OU Trust Foreign fell by 20
cents to close at 1.68 Singapore dollars. Faber 200 was down by
six cents to end at 28.5 Singapore cents.

<HEADLINE> Japan Promises to Continue Fishery Talks With South Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Japan's decision to nullify a
fishery agreement with South Korea is aimed to speed up the
revision of the document, the Japanese embassy here said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The underlying meaning of the notification to put an end (to
the fishery agreement) is to set a timetable to conclude the
fishery talks as soon as possible," said an embassy statement.
</P>
<P>
The two nations failed to reach consensus on revising the
agreement in 10 rounds of negotiations over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
On January 23, one day after Japan's decision to abolish the
pact, the South Korean government announced that it would take
retaliatory measures against the unilateral decision.
</P>
<P>
All South Korean political parties issued strongly-worded
statements accusing Japan of hurting the Seoul-Tokyo relations.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese embassy urged South Korea to be cool-headed over
the move, adding that the Japanese government will vigorously push
ahead with talks this year to reach an agreement on the revision.
</P>
<P>
The current fishery pact, signed in 1965, provides that it will
remain effective one year from the time one side notifies the
other of its unilateral invalidation of the pact.
</P>
<P>
The one-year period is designed for further talks for a
revision of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Revising the fishery pact has been a long-time headache of the
two countries as they have to redraw their sea boundaries under a
new United Nations maritime convention.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea's Monthly Trade Surplus Hit 1.6 Billion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 2 (Xinhua) -- South Korea had a trade surplus
of 1.6 billion U.S. dollars in January, the third month in a row
despite the country's serious financial crisis since last October.
</P>
<P>
Exports totaled 9.16 billion dollars in January, up 1.4 percent
over December, and imports were 7.56 billion dollars, down 39.6
percent, the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The trade surplus marks a high monthly improvement over the
deficit of 3.48 billion dollars in the same month a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The ministry attributed the recent surplus to a nationwide gold
donation drive leading to gold export worth 580 million dollars
and to South Korean won's sharp devaluation depressing the imports.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, once the world's 11th largest economy, badly needs
foreign currency to tide over the crisis caused by the collapse of
some big conglomerates and bad loans of financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
The nation has to pay back a large part of its external debts,
which total 153 billion dollars this year.

<HEADLINE> Israel Prepares for War: Top Officer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Preparation for war is a
priority for Israeli Army in the new year, a top army officer has
said.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Chief of Staff Shaul Mofaz said, in an interview
published on the English daily The Jerusalem Post Monday, that
Israeli army will focus on increasing training, procuring more
weapons and replenishing stocks to prepare for a possible war.
</P>
<P>
As part of such preparation, the army has earmarked 150
million shekels (43 million U.S. dollars) for protecting its
troops in South Lebanon, which is the last active war front for
Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Air Force acquired recently two advanced American-made
F-15I fighter planes which increased Israel's far-distance air
striking capability.
</P>
<P>
Mofaz maintained that Israeli troops should be prepared for a
deterioration of the situation which could possibly leads to war.
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli Defense Force is preparing for the possibility of
a conflict. This doesn't mean that there will be a war, or that we
have any signs that one is imminent. Our assessment says that it
is best to prepare from a starting point of the possibility of a
deterioration."
</P>
<P>
Mofaz said that in the post-Oslo Accord years, it was felt that
war was far off and there was a window of opportunity that allowed
more investment in research and development. But the window now is
smaller and a radical change came last fall when army intelligence
assessed that Syrian troop's redeployment and their enhanced
training was a sign of a higher probability of war, he said.
</P>
<P>
Some of the new weapons expected to be acquired in 1998 include
more F-15I and F-16 fighter planes, Black Hawk and Apache
helicopters, and Merkava III tanks. More units will also be set up
to take the burden off reservists.
</P>
<P>
But Mofaz complained that the approved 1998 budget of 32.6
billion shekels (9.31 billion dollars) for the army falls far short
of needs and the annual working plan has thus been modified.
</P>
<P>
The cut harmed the army's ability to maintain sufficient
supplies, training and better preparation, he added. "Anyone who
harms the conditions of the standing army weakens the army in the
long range," he warned.

<HEADLINE> Hun Sen Ignores Boycott of Elections by Opposition Parties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's Second Prime
Minister Hun Sen said he would not take into consideration any of
his opponents' boycott plan towards the country's next elections.
</P>
<P>
"Up to now, there are 42 political parties, if 10 of those will
not take part in the polls, there remains 32 others to run up in
the polls," Hun Sen told reporters during a local event.
</P>
<P>
It's normal for one or two parties to stay away from the
elections, but whenever they know there might be a victory, they
surely will step up to the polls scheduled for July 26, he said.
</P>
<P>
His remarks came one day after prominent opposition leader Sam
Rainsy made a statement urging all of his party's allies in the
Union of Cambodian Democrats (UCD) to block the general elections.
</P>
<P>
Besides Sam Rainsy's Khmer Nations Party (KNP), the UCD groups
Prince Norodom Ranariddh's royalist FUNCINPEC party, Son Sann's
Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party (BLDP) and Khmer Neutral Party.
</P>
<P>
The UCD was formed after the bloody event in early July last
year, when Prince Ranariddh, son of King Norodom Sihanouk, was
ousted by Hun Sen from his post as the first prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Japan has made a proposal to the two sides for
settling their conflict by peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
To Ranariddh, who has been in exile, the proposal calls for
cutting off relations of his resistant forces to those of Khmer
Rouge group and then integrating into the government's control.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, to Hun Sen, it calls for quick proceeding in the
criminial trial of the accused prince, with the granting of
amnesty by the King immediately after a possible verdict.
</P>
<P>
In essence, it urges Hun Sen, who is to discuss the matter with
the Japanese ambassador to Thailand, to secure the prince's safe
return to Cambodia and free participation in political activities.
</P>
<P>
As a latest development, Hun Sen was quoted by a government
official as telling the Thai ambassador here Monday that he will
not go to Thailand unless Bangkok does not play a mediation role.
</P>
<P>
In late January, Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai reportedly
invited Hun Sen for a visit to Thailand to discuss "bilateral
cooperation."

<HEADLINE> Livingstone Council to Lay Off Half its Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Linvingstone city council of
Zambia will lay off half of its 800 workers this year because the
local authority can sustain the size, Zambia Daily Mail reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper quoted Abraham Mutakila, President of
Zambia United Local Authoritiese Workers Union (ZULAWU), as
saying in the southern city of Zambia Sunday that the union and
the council management have agreed to declare half of the work
force redundant.
</P>
<P>
This will enable the council to only remain with essential
workers it could afford to pay, he told hundreds of the council
workers.
</P>
<P>
The redundancies will involve every one including those in
management because they do not want to have a top heavy
arrangement.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that it is pointless for a council to have 800
workers whom it could not afford to maintain, adding that most of
the workers have become a burden to the council.
</P>
<P>
Some of the workers have not been paid their salaries for six
months, according to him.
</P>
<P>
He said it is better for people to be home and do other things
instead of working for a master who cannot pay them.
</P>
<P>
The council owes everyone money such that they do not even
know how to pay the debt.
</P>
<P>
Among those to be retrenched at the council are those who have
not yet worked for 10 years and those who often go on sick leave,
Mutakila said.
</P>
<P>
Ndola city council in the north of the country has intended to
off-load 100 workers every month until the 2,100 worker force is
reduced to 1,000, Times of Zambia reported last week.
</P>
<P>
In another northern city of Kitwe, council town clerk Ali
Simwinga said a retrenchment exercise targetingese 1,000
employees will start as soon as the funds are available.
</P>
<P>
Last week Finance Minister Ronald Penza said in his budget
report it is clear that the current number of public service
workers cannot be adequately supported by Zambia's economic base
and reinvigorating the process of a public service reform will be
a priority of the economic reform program in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Israel-Egypt Trade Under Pressure, Report Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Israel's exports to Egypt
declined in 1997 due to the stalemate in the Middle East peace
process and other political reasons, local newspaper The Jerusalem
Post reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Israeli Federation of Chambers of Commerce
as saying that Israel's exports to Egypt dropped 5.3 percent last
year to 54.82 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
"There wasn't a single trade delegation from Egypt last year,"
and there were very few visits from Egyptian businessmen, said
Mandy Barak, head of the federation's international department.
</P>
<P>
Economic relations with Egypt began stagnating after the
arrest in late 1996 of Israeli textile worker Azzam Azzam, and the
detention in Cairo last summer of Israeli business-woman Dvora
Ganani, Barak noted. Cairo claimed both cases involved espionage.
</P>
<P>
According to Barak, the Egyptian government issued an order
that importers must show documents proving that Israeli products
are not produced in the occupied territories or the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
"This scared many importers, and is yet another barrier to
trade, " he said. "There are people who are afraid to go there to
make new contacts and deals. "
</P>
<P>
However, Egyptian Ambassador Mohammed Bassiouny to Israel
denied Sunday his government is doing anything to discourage
business with Israel. He said all Israelis are welcome to do
business in Egypt, "as long as they respect the law."
</P>
<P>
He contended that the Egyptian-Israeli trade stagnated in 1997
due to the political atmosphere, after years in which trade volume
doubled annually.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is one of the two Arab countries that have signed peace
accord with Israel. The other is Jordan.
</P>
<P>
"Trade expansion has stopped because there is a stalemate in
the Middle East peace process," he said. "The private sector is
affected by the political situation and the peace process."
</P>
<P>
"There is a big difference between peace and the fruits of
peace," Bassiouny said. "When Egypt made peace with Israel, we did
not aim at a separate peace. It was the first step at a
comprehensive peace. Economic relations will be much better under
the umbrella of comprehensive peace. "
</P>
<P>
Bassiouny said cooperation with Israel in agriculture is going
well, and Egypt is supplying Israel with around 20 percent of its
crude oil.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israel's trade with other Arab countries has also
been declining, Barak said, with exports to Tunisia dropping 88
percent in 1997 to less than 500,000 dollars, and to Morocco by
21.9 percent to 4.8 million dollars.

BANGKOK -- The Thai immigration police have come up with a new
strategy to encourage legal and illegal immigrants working in
Thailand to return to their motherlands voluntarily, according to
local press reports Monday.
</P>
<P>
Instead of launching drastic crackdown on illegal foreign
workers, police now use a psychological approach to deal with
these alien workers who entered the country during the time of the
economic boom.

As of December last year, there were about 900,000 illegal

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's National Miners'
Association (NMAZ) needs three billion Zimbabwean Dollars (170
million U.S. Dollars) to expand operations and create thousands
of jobs in rural areas over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
The Herald daily Monday quoted Giles Munyoro, NMAZ Chairman as
saying that the money would be used to train the miners in modern
methods of mining, research the best extraction techniques, buy
equipment and establish investment initiatives.
</P>
<P>
Jobs would be created from industries directly linked with
activities of small miners in the mining areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
"All of our mineral wealth in this country is found within the
rural communities where the majority of our people live. If this
mineral wealth, which the people are living with but cannot fully
exploit, is developed, then we can solve the country's
unemployment problems," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Munyoro called on the government to review its policy
regarding the small miners, which he said was not conducive to
the growth of the industry.
</P>
<P>
While Zimbabwe was the third largest gold producer in Africa
after South Africa and Ghana, very little benefits had accrued to
the down stream industries, he said, adding only the buyer
countries benefited instead.

<P>
NAIROBI, February 2 (Xinhua) -- An outbreak of acute highland
malaria has killed 33 people in the past three days in Kisii,
about 250 kilometers southwest of Nairobi, the Daily Nation
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Andrew Nyamweya, district medical officer of health, told the
daily newspaper that more people could be dying in their homes as
the El Nino rains washed away many roads in Kisii, Nyamira and
Gucha districts.
</P>
<P>
He noted that more than 1,470 patients were admitted in
various hospitals within the Kisii town and the outbreak of the
killer disease had caused mass panic in the area.
</P>
<P>
The Kisii District hospital is overcrowded with 718 admitted
patients while its bed capacity is 242, the district health
officer noted.
</P>
<P>
Nyamweya said that Kisii District needed more medical and
clinical officers to team up with the local 200 medical staff in
fighting the disease.
</P>
<P>
Although they have enough anti-malaria drugs for now, he
added, there is need for more drugs to combat the rampant malaria
which is spreading in the area.

"In the African context, South Africa is well developed,
having a gross domestic product per capita of 14,760 Rand (2,952
U.S. Dollars) against 3,138 Rand (627 Dollars) for Africa, but in

<P>
MANILA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Air Transportation
Office said Monday a domestic passenger plane was officially
declared missing after it failed to land at a local airport in the
southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching the office said the Cebu-Pacific Airways DC-9
jet plane's pilot captain Paolo Justo made a last radio contact 13
minutes before approaching the runway of Cagayan de Oro City
Airport.
</P>
<P>
The office said the passenger plane failed to land in its
destination Cagayan de Oro City, capital of Misamis Oriental
province in the northern tip of Mindanao Island.
</P>
<P>
The office said that the aircraft could have crashed in
Mindanao Sea south of the island.
</P>
<P>
Diego Garrido, spokesman of the Cebu-Pacific Airways, said that
the plane carried 99 passengers, including four foreigners, and
five crew members.
</P>
<P>
But he refused to give the names and nationality of the four
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
The 16-year-old plane, which took off from Manila at 9:30 a.m.
local time from the Manila Domestic Airport, had asked for a
priority landing about 60 kilometers away from the city.
</P>
<P>
The plane was supposed to arrive at the city at between 11 a.m.
and 11:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Jose Mendoza of the Philippine Air Force said rescue
helicopters were sent to search for the missing plane.
</P>

The Cebu-Pacific Airways is a domestic airlines owned by
Filipino-Chinese billionaire John Guokongwei.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Backs US Position on Iraqi Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait has said it fully
backs the position of the United States on the current crisis over
arms inspection in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
This stance came in a statement issued after the talks between
the visiting U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and
Kuwaiti Emir Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah here Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, Kuwaiti State Minister for Cabinet Affairs
and acting Foreign Minister Abdul Aziz Dakhil Al Dakhil said
Kuwait supports the firm position of the U.S. on forcing Iraq to
respect U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin
said Kuwait agreed with the United States that Iraq's lack of
cooperation with the U.N. weapons inspectors can not be accepted.
</P>
<P>
"Kuwait agreed one hundred percent with the secretary
(Albright)'s belief that (Iraqi President) Saddam Hussein's
continued obstruction of UNSCOM (U.N. Special Commission on
dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction) is unacceptable
and must stop," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
Albright arrived in Kuwait earlier Sunday within a new Middle
East tour to line up support for a possible U.S. military strike
against Iraqi targets.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been refusing to allow U.N. arms inspectors to search
sensitive places where the UNSCOM suspect chemical and biological
weapons are hidden.
</P>
<P>
Albright said the U.S. beefed up its military presence in the
region within a policy of "diplomacy backed up by force" and warned
that military action will be "substantial."
</P>
<P>
She also said the U.S. is one hundred percent committed to the
security of Kuwait against any possible attack by Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Israel-Egypt Trade Under Pressure, Report Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Israel's exports to Egypt
declined in 1997 due to the stalemate in the Middle East peace
process and other political reasons, local newspaper The Jerusalem
Post reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Israeli Federation of Chambers of Commerce
as saying that Israel's exports to Egypt dropped 5.3 percent last
year to 54.82 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
"There wasn't a single trade delegation from Egypt last year,"
and there were very few visits from Egyptian businessmen, said
Mandy Barak, head of the federation's international department.
</P>
<P>
Economic relations with Egypt began stagnating after the
arrest in late 1996 of Israeli textile worker Azzam Azzam, and the
detention in Cairo last summer of Israeli business-woman Dvora
Ganani, Barak noted. Cairo claimed both cases involved espionage.
</P>
<P>
According to Barak, the Egyptian government issued an order
that importers must show documents proving that Israeli products
are not produced in the occupied territories or the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
"This scared many importers, and is yet another barrier to
trade, " he said. "There are people who are afraid to go there to
make new contacts and deals. "
</P>
<P>
However, Egyptian Ambassador Mohammed Bassiouny to Israel
denied Sunday his government is doing anything to discourage
business with Israel. He said all Israelis are welcome to do
business in Egypt, "as long as they respect the law."
</P>
<P>
He contended that the Egyptian-Israeli trade stagnated in 1997
due to the political atmosphere, after years in which trade volume
doubled annually.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is one of the two Arab countries that have signed peace
accord with Israel. The other is Jordan.
</P>
<P>
"Trade expansion has stopped because there is a stalemate in
the Middle East peace process," he said. "The private sector is
affected by the political situation and the peace process."
</P>
<P>
"There is a big difference between peace and the fruits of
peace," Bassiouny said. "When Egypt made peace with Israel, we did
not aim at a separate peace. It was the first step at a
comprehensive peace. Economic relations will be much better under
the umbrella of comprehensive peace. "
</P>
<P>
Bassiouny said cooperation with Israel in agriculture is going
well, and Egypt is supplying Israel with around 20 percent of its
crude oil.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israel's trade with other Arab countries has also
been declining, Barak said, with exports to Tunisia dropping 88
percent in 1997 to less than 500,000 dollars, and to Morocco by
21.9 percent to 4.8 million dollars.

MANILA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- A passenger plane of the
Philippines' Cebu Pacific Airlines with 104 people on board on a
domestic flight was officially declared missing Monday by the

The DZ-9 plane, carrying 99 passengers and 5 crew members,
failed to land at its destination Cagayan de Oro City airport in

feet.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The road between port Mombasa
and capital Nairobi has been closed to all traffic once more
after the Thange Bridge collapsed under the force of raging flood
water, the East African Standard reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The closure of the road which is considered as the country's
life line, comes barely two weeks after the swollen Kambu River
swept away its bridge on January 16 at Kibwezi, about 160
kilometers southeast of Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
The daily newspaper quoted Samson Akute, chief engineer of the
Ministry of Public Works, as saying Sunday that the section is
normally dry but following the El Nino rains, sudden springs from
Kyulu hills have brought down water, leading to excessive erosion
of the road.
</P>
<P>
Personnel from the Kenya Army and the Ministry of Public Works
were at the site trying to erect a temporary bridge for light
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Makueni District Works Officer Julius Mbevi told local
reporters that the temporary bridge would enable vehicles and
people to cross the section as from Monday.
</P>
<P>
A 20-foot-deep dam has formed at the Thange bridge as a result
of a cave-in of the culvert bridge following heavy rains in the
past three months, hampering repair work at the bridge.
</P>
<P>
The Mombasa-Nairobi road is a vital section linking Mombasa
port with sections of the hinterland in Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania,
Rwanda, Burundi and the eastern part of the Democratic Republic
of Congo.

<P>
TOKYO, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Top seeded Martina Hingis misses
the chance to play former world No. one Steffi Graf when she
defends her Toray Pan Pacific Open tennis crown this week.
</P>
<P>
The current world top player is lined up to clash with Iva
Majoli who shattered her Grand Slam hopes last year.
</P>
<P>
Graf, who pulled out of a long-awaited final against Hingis
here last year after aggravating a left knee injury, withdrew from
the Tokyo event on Friday with the knee flared up again.
</P>
<P>
"I would love to play her again," said Hingis, who at 17 years
four months and one day became the youngest player to defend a
Grand Slam title at the Australian Open last weekend.
</P>
<P>
"When she comes back, it is probably not going to be the same
any more as she was on a high. But it is definitely going to be
interesting for me to see her on the other side."
</P>
<P>
Hingis, also the doubles winner in Australia with Mirjana Lucic
of Croatia, will play either Lucic or Elena Likhovtseva of Russia
in the second round of the 926,250-dollar WTA event after a
first-round bye.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho Ruling Party Elected Honorary Life Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho Premier Ntsu
Mokhehle was elected honorary life president of the ruling
Lesotho Congress for Democracy (LCD) Sunday despite his request
to be relieved of the leadership position.
</P>
<P>
Local daily the Citizen said Monday that more than 1,300
delegates at the party's first annual general meeting in Maseru
also re-elected Pakalitha Mosisili as Mokhehle's deputy and chose
a new national executive committee.
</P>
<P>
Mokhehle, 79, did not attend the weekend party conference due
to a recent minor operation in Bloemfontein, South Africa. He
told South African Press Association earlier that he would not be
standing for being re-elected for the premiership of Lesotho.
</P>
<P>
The ailing Mokhehle, in a speech read on his behalf at the
start of the two-day LCD conference, asked delegates to relieve
him of party leadership duties, saying, "my body cannot carry me
anymore."
</P>
<P>
The LCD was formed in June last year after a protracted
leadership battle between pro-Mokhehle supporters and another
faction in the prime minister's former ruling Basutoland Congress
Party (BCP).
</P>
<P>
According to LCD Deputy Secretary-General Monyane Moleleki,
his party was registering 30,000 new members monthly since its
inception in June last year, adding that membership currently
stood at 200,000 card-carrying members.
</P>
<P>
The BCP failed to come up with an amicable solution and the
matter ended up in the country's high court, but it still
remained unresolved, prompting Mokhehle and his supporters to
resign from the party and form the LCD.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the formation of a new party, Mokhehle transferred
governance to the LCD, much to the dissatisfaction of his
opponents.
</P>
<P>
He was accused of "toppling" his own government, and Lesotho's
King Letsie III was asked to intervene, but the king refused,
saying he was not asked to do so by the government.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese Enterprises Pool on Marketing Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Some Chinese enterprises have
pooled resources to establish a marketing network for themselves,
today's International Business Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Named Fudi, the marketing network, supported by large or
medium-sized backbone enterprises in about a hundred cities, has
been approved by the State Economic and Trade Commission to be an
experimental unit in the nation's products sales system.
</P>
<P>
The network has built a market place, 70 thousand square meters
in space, near the site of the Three Gorges, where the great
damming project relocated millions of people and created huge
demands. Fudi has also set up links among its members and
businesses in Asia-Pacific areas through its advanced satellite
communications system. The system provides various kinds of
industrial, commercial and service information on-line to
facilitate businesses.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Guangwu, chief executive officer of Fudi, said the joint
establishment will be able to complish things that individual
enterprises can not do and the enterprises will complement each
other in competing with overseas companies.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Govt in Bid to Stop Price Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government is
trying to stop price hikes by setting up a task force to ensure
ordinary people are not exploited, Minister of Industry and
Commerce Nathan Shamuyarira said Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
"The government is trying to hold prices where they are, so
that they don't shoot up unnecessarily. The government has to
see that ordinary people are not exploited or left in a situation
where basics are not in their reach," he told the Zimbabwe
Broadcast Company.
</P>
<P>
The government was doing its best to see to it that the social
unrest seen last month was not repeated, he said.
</P>
<P>
The government was going to put its house in order by reducing
the budget deficit by as much as it could which has already
dropped to seven percent from 10 percent, to improve the export
drive and industrialize quickly.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question on whether the government had blamed
anyone for the recent food riots, the minister said, "We cannot
blame either the government or the private sector. It's not a
matter of apportioning blame... What we should do is find causes
for the social unrest."
</P>
<P>
From January 19 to 21, thousands of people in Harare and other
small towns staged demonstrations in protest against steep price
increases. Some of them looted shops, stoned cars and destroyed
buildings, causing million of Dollars' losses.
</P>
<P>
"Don't be too negative in the efforts of the government and
the nation, we are doing our best," the minister said, adding the
government wanted to build comradeship among the Zimbabwean
people and integrate the private and public sectors, he said.

<HEADLINE> New Zealanders Urged to Save </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Jenny Shipley
Monday urged New Zealanders to save more to help their country
through a period of economic uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
Shipley was quoted by the local newspaper The Evening Post as
saying that she hoped New Zealanders would use the tax cuts in
July this year as an opportunity to save more.
</P>
<P>
She noted that the government would continue to run budget
surpluses, but individuals needed to reduce their debt as well.
</P>
<P>
She also echoed the view expressed by Reserve Bank Governor Don
Brash last week that increasing savings by New Zealanders was the
key to cutting New Zealand's current account deficit.
</P>
<P>
The current account deficit, measuring what New Zealand spends
and earns overseas, rose to 6.2 billion dollars (3.6 billion U.S.
dollars) in the year ending last September. New Zealand ranked
among the highest in term of deficit ratio to GDP in the OECD
member countries.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, the international credit rating agency Moody's
downgraded New Zealand's credit rating from stable to negative
because of concerns about the big deficit and the impact of Asian
economic crisis on the New Zealand economy.
</P>
<P>
But Shipley said earlier on television that New Zealand was now
 in a better position to deal with shocks like the Asian crisis.

<HEADLINE> New Way to Repatriate Alien Workers in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The Thai immigration police
have come up with a new strategy to encourage legal and illegal
immigrants working in Thailand to return to their motherlands
voluntarily, according to local press reports Monday.
</P>
<P>
Instead of launching drastic crackdown on illegal foreign
workers, police now use a psychological approach to deal with
these alien workers who entered the country during the time of the
economic boom.
</P>
<P>
As of December last year, there were about 900,000 illegal
alien workers in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Immigration Police Bureau Commissioner Police Lt. Gen. Chidchai
Wannasatit was quoted as saying that the immigration police have
been instructed to provide full assistance to alien workers
wanting to return home.
</P>
<P>
Travel expenses and free meals would be given as incentives to
immigrant workers who expressed their willingness to return to
their countries.
</P>
<P>
This new approach is more effective than other measures,
Chidchai said.
</P>
<P>
Chidchai believed the Thai government's policy to repatriate
300,000 illegal alien workers within six months to ease
unemployment would be achieved soon through the new approach.

</P>
<P>
This was another victory the republic's new government won

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's currency of taka has
been devalued against the US dollar by 0.85 taka, effective from
February 2, Bangladesh Bank (BB) said.
</P>
<P>
The new buying and selling rates of the dollar have been fixed
at 46.15 and 46.45 taka respectively, the central bank announced
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The rates were last readjusted downward at 45.30 and 45.60 taka
against the dollar on November 24 last year from 44.85 and 45.15
taka.
</P>
<P>
The adjustment is pursuant to the continuing policy objective
of maintaining incentives for exports and for inflows from
expatriate Bangladeshis, keeping in view the unfolding trends of
currency values of trade partners and competitors of Bangladesh,"
the BB said.
</P>
<P>
The taka has been devalued 12 times since the Awami League took
office in June 1996. It was devalued four times in the second six
months of 1996 and seven times in 1997. There had been more than
6.3 percent devaluation of taka in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Howard: Any Change to Republic to Weaken Australia's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister John Howard
opened the Constitutional Convention Monday with a warning that
any change to a republic would weaken Australia's system of
government.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech to the convention, Howard said he
remained opposed to Australia becoming a republic because the
present system had provided "the rules for governing the nation
with both certainty and stability."
</P>
<P>
He told the 152 delegates gathering in the old Parliament House
that "I oppose Australia becoming a republic because I do not
believe that the alternatives so far canvassed will deliver a
better system of government than the one we currently have."
</P>
<P>
He said a modern government was most workable when the
ceremonial functions of government were separated from executive
responsibilities, with a politically neutral head of state.
</P>
<P>
However, Howard promised to put the republic issue to a
referendum in time for a change by the centenary of federation on
January 1, 2001, if the convention came up with clear support for
a particular model.
</P>
<P>
While at the same stage, Opposition leader Kim Beazley said,
the architects of Australia's constitution had set a republican
agenda which should now be completed.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Labor Party told the 152 delegates gathering in
the old parliament house that he would prefer an Australian head
of state to be elected by a two-thirds majority of a joint sitting
of both houses of parliament.
</P>
<P>
Beazley called again for the issue to be put to a public vote
as soon as possible, "In my view, Australians have long understood
the issues, we can take this opportunity to give those issues a
final push forward, then we must give Australians their say."

<HEADLINE> Soaring Prices in Thailand Contributes to Fragrant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Unscrupulous Thai rice traders
are found mixing low-grade rice into fragrant rice sold in local
supermarkets, the Bangkok Post reports Monday.
</P>
<P>
Industry sources admit that top-grade rice has been gradually
disappearing from store shelves and is being replaced with
low-grade rice packed in bags labeled as Hom Mali (fragrant) rice.
</P>
<P>
Housewives also complain that they pay high prices for
top-quality fragrant rice, but when the rice is cooked, the usual
soft and tender texture and fragrant taste are absent.
</P>
<P>
Rice trading sources admit that the rising prices of fragrant
rice, now at 2,650 baht (50 US dollars) for a 100-kg sack, is "too
tempting".
</P>
<P>
Growing demand of fragrant rice from foreign markets has pushed
fragrant rice prices up considerably, with exports prices now at
about 750-760 dollars per ton, compared with about 450 dollars two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
Even though the Commerce Ministry has set standards to
guarantee the quality of fragrant rice exports, rampant
adulteration continues as the program is voluntary. It is not
mandatory for all rice traders to apply for the quality
certification and labeling.
</P>
<P>
To date, the ministry has granted the top-quality label to nine
companies under 11 brand names.
</P>
<P>
Under the labeling program, introduced since January 1, a bag
of first-grade fragrant rice must contain no more than 5 percent
of other lower grades and 0.04 percent of other mixtures, and that
at least 60 percent of the grains must be at least seven
millimeters long.
</P>
<P>
The label can be revoked if products are found failing to meet
the standards.

<HEADLINE> Poll Shows Clinton Ratings Higher Than Ever </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 1 (Xinhua) -- A nationwide Los Angeles
Times poll shows U.S. President Bill Clinton's job approval rating
is higher than ever, while more than one-third of respondents hold
a low opinion of his accusers in the latest White House scandal.
</P>
<P>
The poll, which surveyed 1,314 U.S. adults by telephone January
29-31, showed 58 percent believe allegations against Clinton have
more to do with partisan politics than "getting to the truth."
</P>
<P>
A record-high 68 percent of those polled said they approve of
the job Clinton is doing, while 29 percent said they disapproved.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 37 percent said they disapprove of the job being
done by independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr. Thirty-two percent
said they approved, while 31 percent said they weren't sure.
</P>
<P>
A contributing factor to Clinton's rising approval rating is
public perception that his private behavior doesn't affect how he
conducts official business.
</P>
<P>
While 42 percent said they believed Clinton had sex with intern
Monica Lewinsky, 45 percent said they don't believe he urged her
to lie about it. Seventy percent also said they believe Clinton is
a decent person with some character flaws.
</P>
<P>
The poll has a sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage
points.

ROME, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Some 52 percent of the families in
Italy owned video recorders in 1996 as against 8.5 percent in
1987, a research institute said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The household possession of personal computers rose from 5.6
percent to 11.6 percent in 1996, the government-funded research
body Svimez said.
</P>
<P>
Nationally, 79.8 percent of the households had one car and
those with more than one climbed from 19.4 percent 1987 to 26.9
percent in 1996, the study said.
</P>
<P>
The cellular telephone, which came from zero possession in
Italy in 1987, rose to 9.5 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
But the households possessing motor scooters and motorbikes
were down from 24.9 percent to 22.3 percent two years ago.
</P>

COLOMBO, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's 600,000 strong
workforce in tea and rubber estates have decided to stage a
nation-wide strike on February 5 following a breakdown in talks
with the Employers' Federation of Ceylon (EFC) over a wage hike.
</P>

Trade unions of the workers said Monday that the strike will
continue indefinitely till their demand is met.
</P>
<P>
The unions want the 23 management companies under the EFC to
raise the daily salary for workers from 83 Rupees (1.34 U.S.
dollars) to 103 Rupees (1.66 dollars). However, the EFC only
agrees to offer 93 Rupees (1.5 dollars).

GUIYANG, February 1 (Xinhua) -- More than 170,000 local farmers
from 40,000 rural families in Zunyi Prefecture, in southwestern
Guizhou Province now drink clean water because of a local
government program.
</P>
<P>
Zunyi was an old base of the Communist Party of China (CPC)
revolution against the Kuomintang in the 1930s-'40s. But local
farmers had no clean drinking water until last June, when the
program was launched by the local government with the help of the
Ministry of Water Resources.
</P>
<P>
Since June more than 16 million yuan has been invested to build
more than 13,000 water cellars.
</P>
<P>
According to local officials in charge of the project, each
household received 500 yuan from the government for digging the
water-pits.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this year, 80,000 more households, or 320,000
people, will have clean drinking water in the prefecture, the
officials said.

<HEADLINE> Bangkok Airport Expansion Costs Too Much: Board </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's national planning
board disagrees with the 6-billion baht (110 million US dollar)
plan for the expansion of the Bangkok International Airport,
according to the Bangkok Post Monday.
</P>
<P>
A source from the National Economic and Social Development
Board said the board considers most of the expansion plan
unnecessary because the current regional economic crisis will
reduce air traffic volumes significantly at least for the next
five years.
</P>
<P>
The former Thai administration approved a budget of 11.69
billion baht for the expansion of the Bangkok airport and delayed
the construction of the second Bangkok international airport
because of economic constraints.
</P>
<P>
The current government reduced the expansion budget to 6
billion baht for the construction of a new control tower, new
office building and new parking lots, and improvement of domestic
and international terminals, runways and piers.
</P>
<P>
The board feels that at the present stage only 2 billion baht
is needed to relieve the bottleneck of traffic lanes in front of
the airport gates.
</P>
<P>
An obvious wastes of money in the expansion plan is the
construction of a new air traffic control tower. The new tower was
proposed only because trees in an adjacent golf course are
blocking the vision of the existing tower.
</P>
<P>
A simple and economical way to clear the problem is to close
the golf course and cut down the trees, as a gold course is a
violation of both security and safety standards of any airport,
the newspaper quotes the source as saying.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright urged Italy to add its weight to diplomatic efforts to
resolve the current Iraqi crisis, the Italian Foreign Ministry
said in a communique issued Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
The communique said that Albright phoned Italian Foreign
Minister Lamberto Dini Sunday afternoon and explained the
United States' position regarding the Iraqi crisis and its plans
to resolve it.
</P>
<P>
Albright called Dini from Israel. She is on a European and
Middle East tour aimed at garnering support for a coordinated
effort to pressure Iraq into removing its block on United Nations
arms inspectors there.
</P>
<P>
In her conversation with Dini, the U.S. secretary of state
urged that efforts to resolve the crisis should be stepped up and
asked Italy to take part in a diplomatic drive to this end.
</P>
<P>
Dini told Albright that Italy would do its part, the communique
said.
</P>
<P>
Albright did not ask for permission to use Italian air bases in
the eventuality of military action against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministry said later that following his conversation
with Albright, Dini sent a letter to Iraqi Deputy Premier Tareq
Aziz.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said the letter had two objectives: firstly to
suggest ways of reducing tensions and overcoming the present
crisis, and secondly, to express hope that in the wake of the
crisis iraq and the international community would be able to
develop their relations.
</P>
<P>
Also today, Dini received a letter from Russian Foreign
Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who echoed Albright in expressing deep
concern over the situation and stressing that for the moment all
options remained open.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Seen to Incur Huge Public Sector Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' consolidated
public sector position is expected to incur a deficit of up to
12.9 billion pesos (300 million U.S. dollars) in 1998 due to
persisting high interest rates and an estimated weak budget
surplus.
</P>
<P>
The consolidated public sector (CPS) position, a key fiscal
barometer, includes the cash positions of the government, the
monitored government-owned and controlled corporations and the
local government units.
</P>
<P>
The CPS is estimated to have a deficit of between 10 and 15
billion pesos in 1997, local newspaper the Business Daily said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted officials at the Development Budget
Coordination Committee as saying the biggest impact on the CPS
this year was the scaling down of the fiscal surplus target from
16 billion pesos to only 1 billion pesos for 1998.
</P>
<P>
The government earlier revised its originally quite ambitious
fiscal surplus target for 1998 to take into account continuing
revenue shortfalls and increased expenditures due to the current
currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
The committee also expressed concern that the government's weak
fiscal position could continue to pressure interest rates to rise
further this year as it might be forced to resort to compete with
the private sector for domestic loans.
</P>
<P>
The government's weak fiscal position is also one major concern
of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
An IMF team is set to arrive here Wednesday to review the
country's economic fundamentals and compliance with the structural
reforms prescribed by the IMF for the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The review will determine whether the country deserves to exit
from the IMF's economic supervision gracefully and enter into a
"precautionary arrangement" to protect it from the current crisis.

<HEADLINE> Italy Opposes Military Actions Against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Italy opposes United States-led
military actions in Iraq and would not offer its air-bases for use
in any such operations, military experts here said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Rome's position is that a military attack would fail to produce
"decisive results" in Iraq, the experts said, adding that Italy
shares France's line that a further effort is needed to achieve a
diplomatic solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
These remarks were made after Italian Defense Minister
Beniamino Andreatta's statement on the previous day.
</P>
<P>
Andreatta told journalists Saturday that "the winds of war are
still some distance away," and Iraq still has several days in
which it could satisfy U.N. demands on the blocked arms
inspections.
</P>
<P>
Also on Saturday, Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini urged
a further push in diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis over
U.N. arms inspectors in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"Not all the diplomatic avenues have been fully explored yet,"
he said, "even though recent developments have created a situation
of grave difficulty in Iraq."
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
reaffirmed in Jerusalem the American position that if diplomacy
proved unable to resolve the crisis, "the U.S. response would be
rapid and substantial."

<HEADLINE> Roundup: NZ Feels Bite of Asian Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The ongoing Asian economic
crisis has begun to bite into New Zealand's economy, whose growth
is now increasingly dependent on Asia.
</P>
<P>
With six of its ten largest trading partners being in Asia,
about 40 percent of NZ's trade is conducted with the region.
</P>
<P>
Export is the first sector to be hit by the Asian crisis.
Latest figures released by Statistics New Zealand showed that
total exports in November 1997 fell by 4.4 percent compared with
the same month one year ago, with exports to Asia slumping by 10
percent and exports to Japan, South Korea and Indonesia all
dropping considerably.
</P>
<P>
Forestry also reported a big fall in export. South Korea, one
of the major buyers of New Zealand timber in Asia, has stopped
importing logs from NZ because business people have found it hard
to get letters of credit from banks.
</P>
<P>
The NZ forest giants, Fletcher Forests and Carter Holt Harvey,
now seem to be at a loss as how to deal with their huge log
stocks, some of which are still left unshipped at sea ports.
Fletcher Forests is reportedly considering to stop cutting trees
if the situation is not improved in South Korea, which bought
about half of NZ log exports before the financial crisis started
in that country.
</P>
<P>
NZ Dairy Board and Meat Board suffered similar losses in doing
business with Asia.
</P>
<P>
Tourism is also crying for help from the government. With
visitor numbers diving 90 percent from South Korea alone, many
tour operators said they could not sustain the losses. The number
of tourists from Southeast Asian countries also dropped
drastically. Some souvenir shops in the tourist city of Rotorua,
which target chiefly at Asian tourists, have closed down because
of lack of customers.
</P>
<P>
Tourist companies now pin their hope on China, which designated
NZ as a tourist destination country for Chinese citizens. They are
urging the government to facilitate the entry into NZ by Chinese
tourists. But Tourism Minister Murray McCuily has warned that NZ
could not expect immediate benefit from the new Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
The international credit rating agency Moody's last week
downgraded the outlook of NZ's Aa1 rating from stable to negative.
Moody's said the adjustment reflected concerns over the increase
in NZ's current account deficit and the potential impact of events
in Asia on NZ's economy.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Treasury advised the cabinet last Monday
that the Asian crisis could cut NZ's growth forecast by about one
percentage point during the coming two years.
</P>
<P>
It also estimated the crisis could lop 300 million dollars (174
million US dollars) off the budget surplus for the next fiscal
year, putting the new round of tax cut promised by the government
in doubt.
</P>
<P>
However, the government still has confidence in Asia. Treasurer
 Winston Peters believes that NZ's economic future is still
bright.
</P>
<P>
He described last week the Asian crisis as "just one more
change in a global economy," saying Asia would recover from the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
He urged exporters not to abandon the Asian market.
</P>
<P>
His view seems to be shared by most NZ's businesses. Many of
them expressed cautiously optimistic and hoped the crisis could be
soon tided out. They also indicated their determination to stick
to the Asian market.

<HEADLINE> Life Expectancy in Xinjiang Rises to 63 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The average life expectancy in
China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has risen from 33 years
in the early 1950s to 63, according to a Saturday report in
People's Daily.
</P>
<P>
China's leading newspaper quoted a source from the region's
department of public health by saying that the increase could be
attributed to the establishment of a region-wide medical care
network.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Xinjiang now has more than 90,000
medical staff members in towns and 10,000 health workers in its
vast rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the established network and sufficient staff,
infectious diseases such as cholera, the plague and hepatitis are
now effectively prevented, said the report.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Prime Minister to Visit Manila </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad will pay a one-day visit to Manila Friday to
explore ways in reviving the economies of the two countries, the
local newspaper Today reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Officials at the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs were
quoted as saying Mahathir will hold talks with President Fidel
Ramos which will focus on the current currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
High on the agenda is the proposal made by the Philippine
government to set up a system that would allow the use of local
currencies in regional trade instead of the U.S. dollar, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
According to Philippine Foreign Affairs Secretary Domingo
Siazon, the government had ordered an interagency body to
formulate a scheme that would allow businessmen in Southeast Asia
to use the local currencies instead of U.S. dollars in trading
goods.
</P>
<P>
Siazon said Malaysia and Thailand would likely support the
Philippines on the proposed trading system.
</P>
<P>
But some businessmen are not enthusiastic about the idea
because the intra-ASEAN (the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations) is not too big to make a significant progress in
stabilizing their currencies.
</P>
<P>
Ramos and Mahathir could also discuss the regional security
that could be affected by the economic crisis, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Slight Output Rise Expected for Metal Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The metallurgical industry has
set a production target of 107 million tons of steel this year
while securing a net profit of 2.5 billion yuan (US$301 million),
said today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Zhang Shuliang, director of the iron and steel
production department with the Ministry of the Metallurgical
Industry, as saying that this year's focus is being shifted from
increasing quantity to quality upgrading, and the rise in profits
mainly will come from cutting costs and turning around more than 12
money-losing companies.
</P>
<P>
Low profit margin last year was widely blamed on falling steel
prices and an upswing of energy costs. "Such a situation forced us
to rely on ourselves to explore profit potential," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
The money-losing companies can expect to make profit this year
by separating subsidiary branches from the main manufacturing
plants. In this way, Anshan Steel Group slashed its deficit by 200
million yuan (US$24.1 million) last year after splitting from its
nine affiliates.
</P>
<P>
"The companies should make efforts to slash energy costs as
much as possible," Zhang said, adding that the industry will save
one billion yuan (US $120 million) a year when it buys 100 million
tons of coal after the price was bargained down 10 yuan (US$1.21)
per ton.
</P>
<P>
He urged companies to bid to obtain the lowest purchase price.
</P>
<P>
Zhang also encouraged the good-performance companies to raise
more capital through the Chinese and foreign stock markets.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 17 large and medium-sized companies were listed,
raising 12.4 billion yuan (US$1.5 billion). About 16 companies
are expected to go public this year.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Australia's Constitutional Convention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The Constitutional Convention
beginning on Monday brought together 152 delegates at the Old
Parliament House for two weeks to debate whether Australia should
become a republic, and if so, what form the republic should take.
</P>
<P>
Half of the delegates to the convention were appointed by the
government including:
</P>
<P>
Twenty members of the federal parliament (12 from the
government, six opposition, one Australian Democrat and one
Independent);
</P>
<P>
Twenty state and territory MPs, (three from each of the six
state and one each from the Australian Capital Territory and
Northern Territory);
</P>
<P>
Thirty-six community delegates representing Aborigines, young
people and other organizations.
</P>
<P>
The other half were elected in a voluntary postal ballot
conducted in December last year.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, 46 of the elected have declared themselves to be in
favor of a republic, 27 are monarchists and three have not
publicly declared their position.
</P>
<P>
The convention opened by chairman Ian Sinclair in the House of
Representatives chamber in the Old Parliament House, followed by
addresses from Prime Minister John Howard and Opposition leader
Kim Beazley.
</P>
<P>
The convention will run from Monday (February 2) to Friday
(February 6), and Monday (February 9) to Friday (February 13).
</P>
<P>
The conference will first debate the question "Whether
Australia should become a republic", but the bulk of proceedings
will be taken up with determining "Which model for an Australian
republic might be put to the Australian people in a vote?"
</P>
<P>
Final votes on these questions will be taken on the last two
days of the convention before the presentation of the final
communique to Prime Minister John Howard.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister wants the convention to come up with a clear
republican alternative, which can then be decided in a referendum
in time for a change by the centenary of federation in 2001, while
the republicans hope to have an Australian president, not the
Governor-General, to open the Olympic Games in 2000.

<HEADLINE> UK Reaffirms Readiness to Use Force Against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The British government today
reaffirmed its readiness to use force against Iraq while the
U.N.-Iraq standoff on arms inspection continued worsening.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a BBC television interview today, British Defense
Secretary George Robertson refused to rule out the use of force,
but he was reluctant to elaborate the concrete military options
which were under consideration.
</P>
<P>
However, Robertson made it clear that "there is absolute
resolution that if he (Saddam) is not willing to comply with the
UN Security Council resolutions, then force is an option, and an
option that will in extremes be used."
</P>
<P>
"If the United Nations is flouted, if the will of the world
community is flouted, if Saddam continued to have these dreadful
weapons of mass destruction, then what future for the Middle East,
for the Gulf Region?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
"That is the question that can only be answered by the fact
that we have to show resolution. There is no option," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saraf has reportedly
criticized British Prime Minister Tony Blair for calling Saddam an
"evil dictator."
</P>
<P>
Saraf noted that Blair had used "cheap adjectives" to describe
Iraqi leader Saddam, but Downing Streets sources refused this
evening to retract Blair's warning by saying "the Prime Minister's
remarks stand."

after a balloting at a party conference saw a majority of party
representatives prefer to change the name.

Philippe Seguin, the president of RPR, arbitrated to keep the
name of RPR, after 49.94 percent of the party representatives
voted for a change of the name into Rally for France.

movement was created by President Charles De Gaulle in 1947, the
party had adopted several names before the RPR was founded by
Jacques Chirac in 1976.
