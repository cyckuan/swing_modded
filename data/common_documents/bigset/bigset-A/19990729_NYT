WHITE SOX CRUSH YANKEES, 11-2 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ There was one out in the fourth inning on Wednesday
night when Joe Torre stepped out of the New York Yankee dugout to
relieve Andy Pettitte, who waited on the mound, sweat dripping over
his eyes and down his cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   Tino Martinez, the first baseman, jogged to the mound and tapped
the left-hander on the side. Pettitte held out the ball for Torre
and as the manager accepted it, Torre patted Pettitte on the back.
The pitcher trudged off the field, sunk onto the bench and stared
ahead, his future uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Scouts from teams considering a trade for Pettitte watched it
all here in Comiskey Park. They saw how he labored badly, how he
threw 90 pitches to get just 10 outs in what turned into an 11-2
loss to the Chicago White Sox that ended the Yankees' seven-game
winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   The scouts saw Pettitte pitch so tentatively that he could have
been mistaken for a rookie in his first outing; Pettitte allowed
eight hits, two walks and three runs in three and a third innings.
</P>
<P>
   The man who has ultimate authority in the Yankees' organization
and must approve any trade _ George Steinbrenner _ presumably
watched on television. With a midnight trading deadline on
Saturday, the Yankees have offers for Pettitte in hand, deals they
can make right now. In the next three days, Steinbrenner will
either agree to trade Pettitte, or hang onto him, in the hope the
left-hander can recapture the undaunting presence he had in his
first few years.
</P>
<P>
   Just 27, Pettitte is 75-43 in this, his fifth season with the
Yankees. ``Andy Pettitte has been a part of this club since I've
been here, and we've won two World Series in three years,'' Torre
said before the game.
</P>
<P>
   But Pettitte is a mystery to the Yankees, an expensive puzzle
who is destined to become more costly next year. He is 7-8 with a
5.65 earned run average and is earning $5.95 million this year, and
because he is eligible for arbitration this winter, he will make
perhaps $7 million or more next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are sure he is healthy, that his back and elbow are
sound; rival scouts who have seen him recently concur. The Yankees
believe his stuff is good, that he is throwing his fastball about
the same as he always has, and his pitches have movement; scouts
who have seen him concur.
</P>
<P>
   But Pettitte is finding ways to lose now, with a strangely
passive approach to pitching, and the Yankees have no idea why.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte loves pitching for the Yankees and has known for weeks
that they have talked about trading him, with Seattle (for Jeff
Fassero), Houston, Philadelphia, Cincinnati, Detroit and others. He
knew, as he took the mound on Wednesday night, that this would be
his last chance before the nonwaiver trade deadline to re-establish
himself, to show his old form.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure it's on his mind,'' said Torre. ``There's no
guarantee everybody's going to be here'' after the deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than demonstrate his former aggressiveness, however,
Pettitte only confirmed the mysteriousness of his ways this season.
He retired Chicago in order in the first inning, throwing 15
pitches, including an unusually large portion of changeups.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte allowed a broken bat single one out into the second
inning, and with a count of 1 ball and 2 strikes, Paul Konerko
reached out and lined a ball into the right-field corner, the
runner scoring and Konerko ending up with a triple.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte reacted like a youngster touching a hot pot: He was
suddenly tentative, as if afraid to throw the ball over the plate.
Brook Fordyce, the next batter and the No. 7 batter in the Chicago
lineup, walked on four pitches, prompting the pitching coach Mel
Stottlemyre to visit the mound.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte nodded and spoke reassuringly to Stottlemyre, but when
he tried to jam Craig Wilson with a fastball, Wilson blooped a
single to right, Konerko scoring. Pettitte gestured to the catcher
Joe Girardi: what luck.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago scored two runs in the inning, but more telling was the
fact that Pettitte threw 37 pitches to get the three outs; he had
thrown 52 pitches in two innings. He threw no fewer than three
pitches to any batter in the first two innings, and averaged more
than five a batter. He was in deep, deep trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox loaded the bases in the third, including a one-out
walk drawn by Magglio Ordonez, before Fordyce grounded out to end
the rally. But Pettitte threw 20 more pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson singled to start the fourth and after going ahead in the
count no balls and two strikes to Mike Caruso, Pettitte threw an
inside fastball and Caruso whacked it over the head of the right
fielder Paul O'Neill. It was Caruso's 12th extra-base hit in 339
at-bats this season.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson stopped at third. Dan Naulty began to warm up in the
Yankees' bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte struck out Ray Durham with a cut fastball. Throwing two
great breaking balls or cutters _ there was that good stuff again _
Pettitte jumped ahead in the count by no balls and two strikeq
against the left-handed hitting Chris Singleton. All he needed was
another strike, and there would be two out and Pettitte would still
be in the game and have a chance for his eighth victory.
</P>
<P>
   It was at this juncture that Pettitte seemingly invented a way
to lose. He could have thrown another of his hard-breaking pitches
that had Singleton befuddled.
</P>
<P>
   He could have wasted a fastball inside. He could have thrown a
breaking ball in the dirt. Instead, Pettitte dropped his arm angle
and threw sidearm, like Orlando Hernandez or David Cone, a pitch he
very rarely throws.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth, with the score tied, a benign breaking ball _
Pettitte's 90th pitch _ hung over the plate, Singleton smacked it
into right field, giving the White Sox a 3-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   A moment later Torre was at the mound and Pettitte was headed
for the dugout, and perhaps Seattle or Houston or Philadelphia or
some other place where Pettitte doesn't want to be.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox battered the relievers who followed and went on to
accumulate 19 hits.  &QL;

 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
SALT LAKE CITY _ For most NBA head coaches, a summer league like
the Rocky Mountain Revue is supposed to be a break, a chance to set
up some tee times, sit and gossip, and maybe watch some basketball.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is somewhat ironic, then, that Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich
chose this venue for his return to work after a hiatus that lasted
almost a month.
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich, who for medical reasons was forced to step down as
coach of the Dream Team that competed in the Olympic qualifying
tournament in Puerto Rico earlier this month, was in the stands
Wednesday to watch the Rockets' Rocky Mountain Revue entry beat
Sacramento 90-73.
</P>
<P>
   It was less than a month ago that Tomjanovich, complaining of
dizziness and weakness, was checked into Memorial Hospital by Dr.
Jim Muntz. Tomjanovich was found to be suffering from ``extreme
physical exhaustion'' and spent the next three days in bed.
Tomjanovich left the hospital July 4, and Wednesday marked his
first full day back on the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels great,'' Tomjanovich said of being back. ``I went to
practice this morning, and just grabbing a basketball I pulled the
team together and grabbed a ball it felt good to be back. We have a
bunch of good guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good to see our veterans, Michael (Dickerson), Cuttino
(Mobley) and Bryce (Drew), but then we have a lot of nice young
players who are trying to make our team. So it was really nice to
get back into the basketball environment.''
</P>
<P>
   And, true to his nature, Tomjanovich dived right in. Instead of
kicking back and gabbing with colleagues, Tomjanovich busied
himself by scribbling plays on scrap paper.
</P>
<P>
   But Tomjanovich swears he has learned his lesson. No more
marathon work sessions. No more studying videotape until he keels
over from lack of sleep. No more pushing himself beyond the limits
of his endurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have priorities, and I got to where there were no
limits,'' Tomjanovich said of his work habits. ``I like to work at
night, away from people, and it got out of hand. I learned a little
bit about those things. When I was a younger guy, I could go two or
three days without sleeping, and it got to where I got worn out.
And if you don't get your sleep, physically and mentally things
just don't work right.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really sort of a helpless feeling that I didn't want to
be in, and that was frustrating because I really wanted to do the
USA (basketball) deal. But there was no way I could have given them
my best effort. And even after I slept a couple of days, my body
was so worn down. And finally, it took awhile to sink in. I figured
that after a day's rest I'd be ready to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to take some of the medications and all that
stuff. I just wanted to get back out and do it (his job). But
finally it was drummed into my head _ `You're really down and you
have to take this time off.' It finally got through my hard head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've taken three to four weeks off, getting away from
basketball,'' Tomjanovich added. ``I went up north to Michigan and
then spent a couple of days in Wyoming. I got some fresh air and
some exercise, and I'm really excited to get back with the team.''
</P>
<P>
   But what still bothers Tomjanovich was having to step down as
head coach of USA Basketball's 1999 Men's Senior National Team,
which went on to win the gold medal at the Tournament of the
Americas Olympic qualifier in San Juan.
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich had been named Dream Team coach after leading the
NBA lockout-weakened United States team to a surprise bronze-medal
finish in the 1998 World Championships of Basketball in Athens,
Greece.
</P>
<P>
   But when his physical exhaustion set in, doctors advised
Tomjanovich to skip the Olympic qualifying tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very difficult,'' Tomjanovich said. ``I have a hard
time even now when I think about it. I enjoyed so much being
affiliated with those people (USA Basketball) the year before (at
the World Championships).''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was troubled by the decision to step down as coach
but grew to understand that fretting over it only exacerbated his
condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I listened to some people about understanding that sometimes
this happens, and you have to take care of yourself,'' he said. ``I
had no doubts at all that things were going to go well with Larry
Brown, Tubby (Smith) and Gene Keady (doing the coaching). There
were no doubts in my mind at all. There are times when you just
have to understand that you have to take care of yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   The odd part, Tomjanovich said, was that he could feel the
exhaustion coming on. But because of the the playoffs, the NBA
draft and then the Rockets' trade discussions with Toronto
concerning Hakeem Olajuwon, there wasn't enough time to step away
from the job and take a proper vacation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me say this: It was a tough two to three weeks,''
Tomjanovich said. ``I had been struggling two to three weeks with a
lot of the work overload and a lot of the things that we had to
look at. There was a big workload there, and a couple of weeks or
10 days before that, I took a break. I sort of had to get away
because I felt it coming on. But when the draft came up, there was
no way I could (stay away). I had felt it coming on earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   And when the exhaustion hit, Tomjanovich was almost floored by
the effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's about balance,'' Tomjanovich said. ``When you
don't keep your balance, things can happen. I really learned a
lesson. I'm not the young guy I used to be, where I'd lock myself
up for three days, grab a whole bunch of tapes and nonstop go over
them until I crashed. I learned a lesson. I got to where I was
staying up real late doing work, and I've always done that, ever
since I was an assistant coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is that I feel I have to do a little better job of
managing those things. There were never limits _ time limits or
times of the day or night _ when I did things. And those things can
knock you out of whack. I just have to understand that I have to
become more disciplined _ there's only so much you can do, and you
have to do it at a certain time.''
</P>
<P>
   That revelation comes at an odd time, considering that Sunday
will mark the start of NBA mayhem _ the first day teams can sign
free agents and make trades. Tomjanovich and his staff will be hard
at work, no doubt putting in long hours as the Rockets try to plug
the leaks from last season's first-round playoff loss to the Los
Angeles Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Barkley is a free agent, as is Sam Mack. And there have
been constant rumors swirling around Scottie Pippen's status, even
though Pippen swears he wants to remain a Rocket.
</P>
<P>
   Amid all the confusion, Tomjanovich has made his return.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we have different people who do different things, and I
have my role in it,'' he said. ``Yeah, I'm going to try and do the
best that I can and take something from the lessons that I've
learned. And I'm sure things will come up later in my career that
I'll have to learn from, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was something that I didn't think would happen, but it
did. It was very frustrating, and I learned that sometimes you have
to put yourself as a priority and take care of yourself, or none of
those real good things are going to happen because you're just
going to wear your butt out.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles is moving into the millennium on a
roll.
</P>
<P>
   Despite impending job cutbacks in the aerospace sector, Southern
California's economy has enough momentum and diversity to keep it
on a strong growth track through 2000, according to a regionwide
forecast to be released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs will be added in all five counties, from the Inland Empire
to the San Gabriel and San Fernando valleys and into Ventura
County, according to the assessment by the Los Angeles County
Economic Development Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The number of jobs in the sprawling region is expected to grow
by 2.8 percent by the end of 1999 and then will slow slightly to a
2.4 percent gain next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very solid outlook. The message is that times are good
and people are feeling euphoric about the economy,'' said Jack
Kyser, chief economist for the LAEDC.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Gibson, chief economist for the California Department of
Finance, said the regional outlook might be even better than the
LAEDC's prediction.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson has just finished reviewing payroll information not
available when the LAEDC study was undertaken, and it shows that
California added about 100,000 more jobs last year than showed up
in the household survey used to compute the monthly unemployment
report.
</P>
<P>
   ``We keep being surprised on the upside, which is where we'd
rather be,'' Gibson said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Gibson said his figures now show that employment in
the entertainment industry last year grew by 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also know that withholding-tax revenue in the first half of
1999 has been strong, so we may have some more good news on the job
front,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the LAEDC report, expanded business through
seaports and airports, an uptick in orders from Asia for raw
materials and home building have been vigorously pushing the
region's economy forward.
</P>
<P>
   This year employers will add 181,000 jobs, an increase of about
2.8 percent. Tempering these gains are the loss of classic
aerospace jobs, associated with airplane manufacturing, and a
projected dip in motion picture production, a hard sector to track
because workers can change jobs several times a year.
</P>
<P>
   The strongest job gains will be in the Riverside-San Bernardino
area, with Ventura County and Orange County next.
</P>
<P>
   The sharp note of job losses in the Long Beach area, as the
Boeing Co. winds down production on two lines of commercial jets,
is the only sour sound in the midyear assessment. About 6,000
people are working on the Boeing programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are going to take a very significant hit. Several
thousand workers will lose their jobs, and right now there is
nowhere for them to go. And if they are a little bit older, it's
going to be tough for them to get resituated. It's a major
challenge,'' Kyser said.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a snapshot of the regional outlook:
</P>
<P>
   _ In the Los Angeles County-Long Beach metropolitan region
nonfarm employment will grow by 2.1 percent, or 84,300 jobs, this
year. Growth will slow to 1.9 percent, or 75,100 new jobs, next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Industries expected to record strong performances over the next
18 months include biomedical, business and professional management,
financial services, home construction, tourism and technology.
</P>
<P>
   Aerospace, apparel manufacturing, health services and motion
picture and television production could experience losses or remain
flat.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Riverside-San Bernardino area will lead the region in the
percentage of job-growth increase with a 4.7 percent gain this
year. The area is vying with San Diego County as the hottest in
California for home building.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturing also is continuing to expand, and 13.6 million
square feet of warehouse and distribution space is under
construction in the Inland Empire. Unemployment is expected to fall
to 5.2 percent by the end of the year, while personal income will
grow by 6.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ventura County has been on a growth tear, with nonfarm
employment gaining 4.1 percent this year. Factors credited with the
strong performance include work on a California State University
campus in Camarillo, residential and commercial construction, and
growth of the technology sector.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Kyser expects permits to be issued for 4,380 new
housing units in Ventura County, the highest number since 1989.

COUNTY, STATE PAY SETTLEMENT IN WOMAN'S DEATH BY EX-BOYFRIEND

<P>
   Michelle Smith's ex-boyfriend was sentenced to life in prison
for her 1995 murder. Now others whose errors led to Smith's death
are paying as well.
</P>
<P>
   Whatcom County and Washington state have agreed to a $1.5
million settlement in a lawsuit brought by the Bellingham woman's
family that charged negligence in the county's oversight of the
ex-boyfriend, Lloyd Monroe.
</P>
<P>
   Monroe, who had been in jail in 1995 for assaulting Smith,
killed her after he was mistakenly released.
</P>
<P>
   The financial settlement will provide lifetime support for
Smith's daughter, which is all the money the family had wanted,
said family attorney Mark Leemon. And the ``stone-age'' procedures
that allowed Monroe to be released from jail also have been changed
as a result of Smith's death, Leemon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Smith's parents) had two goals. ... One was to make sure
their granddaughter was taken care of, and the other was to make
sure this didn't happen to other families,'' he said. ``From the
beginning, that's what was important to them.''
</P>
<P>
   The $1.5 million settlement includes an annuity for Smith's
daughter, which is expected to provide $10 million for the girl
over her lifetime, according to settlement papers.
</P>
<P>
   The family also sought and received one other form of
compensation: a letter of apology from the county for releasing
Monroe from jail on Feb. 22, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Monroe had repeatedly violated no-contact orders obtained by
Smith and was being held in jail that day for allegedly beating and
raping her.
</P>
<P>
   Monroe had told Smith he would kill her if she reported him to
police again, but she did nonetheless and cooperated with
prosecutors who then filed a felony charge against Monroe, Leemon
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They finally had enough of a hold on him that Michelle could
feel safe ... '' he said. ``She did everything right. She did
everything she could to save her own life.''
</P>
<P>
   But Monroe was mistakenly released after a court appearance that
settled a different charge dating back to an earlier violation of
the no-contact order, Leemon said. Whatcom County Jail did not
require a written court order to release a prisoner at that time,
Leemon said. Instead, it relied on reports from jail transport
officers who accompanied the prisoners to court.
</P>
<P>
   Monroe was sentenced to five days in jail on the earlier
misdemeanor charge and was released because he had already been in
jail more than five days. The jail officer asked a prosecutor if
Monroe could be released, and the prosecutor _ who dealt with
misdemeanors rather than felonies _ answered that the hearing took
care of all the charges he knew about, according to Leemon and
court papers.
</P>
<P>
   The jail's own records clearly showed Monroe shouldn't have been
released, and ``it was clear they could have found out six ways to
Sunday that this guy had a felony that hadn't been disposed of,''
Leemon said.
</P>
<P>
   Relying on jail officers for the court record was an unusual
practice and one that both the jail's chief of corrections at the
time and the county undersheriff at the time said in writing was a
bad practice that should be changed, Leemon said in a mediation
letter. The jail now requires written authorization for releasing
prisoners, which must be checked by both a corrections officer and
supervisor, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was terrified when she learned Monroe had been released,
calling police and telling a supervisor she had called the
prosecutor's office as well, the mediation letter said. She was
last seen two days after his release; her body was found the next
day.
</P>
<P>
   Smith died a horrible death, Leemon said _ beaten, raped, then
strangled.
</P>
<P>
   Monroe is serving life in prison without possibility of release
for Smith's murder.
</P>
<P>
   Whatcom County officials refused all comment on the case
Wednesday, but the county acknowledged in court papers that its
employees knew Monroe posed a danger to Smith and should have known
that he was being held on a felony charge and hadn't posted bail.
</P>
<P>
   The county has sued the state in the case, arguing that the
prosecutor who spoke to the jail officer was acting as an agent of
the state, Leemon said. The percentage of the settlement each
agency pays could change after that lawsuit is settled, but
initially the county will put up $775,000, and the state will put
up $750,000, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, 32, worked at Value Village in Bellingham, and
``according to everyone, her daughter was her life,'' Leemon said.
The child, now 12, lives with her father.

UCLA PLAYERS PLEAD NO   CONTEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUGLAS HABERMAN AND ROBERT MONROE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
LOS ANGELES _ Nine UCLA football players pleaded no contest
Wednesday to illegal possession of handicapped parking placards, a
misdemeanor, and were sentenced to 200 hours of community service
and $1,485 apiece in fines and fees.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seven of the players _ and two others who postponed their court
hearings _ will be benched for the first two games of the season,
said UCLA Chancellor Albert Carnesale.
</P>
<P>
   The sentence imposed by Los Angeles Municipal Court Judge Sam
Ohta requires the players to perform half of the community service
with the Special Olympics, which holds athletic events for the
disabled, and half with other organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The players apologized, but more than a dozen people in
wheelchairs jeered the plea bargain and sentences outside the
court.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a slap on the wrist,'' said Lillibeth Navarro of the
California Foundation of Independent Living Centers. ``They're
punished by going to a party _ the Special Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA outside linebacker Ali Abdul Azziz said he and his
teammates regret their actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to apologize to the disabled community,'' he
said in a statement after the sentencing. ``We did not realize the
seriousness of our actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Azziz said they never parked in handicapped spaces with the
illegally obtained placards but used them to park free.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had realized then how offensive our actions were to the
disabled community and to others, we would never have committed
these acts,'' he said. ``We know we have embarrassed our school,
our families and ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Rafer Johnson, 1960 Olympics decathlon champion and board
chairman of Southern California Special Olympics, called the
sentence appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``These athletes made a mistake, and every one of them have told
me that, and have said that to everyone within hearing distance of
them,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Harland Braun, who represented six of the nine
players entering pleas Wednesday, and Deputy City Attorney Brian
Williams said the sentences were fair and appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Braun said average people pleading to the same charges would
have been sentenced to pay $1,300 in fines and fees, with no
community service.
</P>
<P>
   The misdemeanor charges carry a maximum sentence of 6 months in
jail and a $1,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   In return for the pleas, the City Attorney's Office dismissed
one misdemeanor charge against each of the nine for filing false
documents with the state Department of Motor Vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The use of the parking passes by current and former players came
to light after a campus patrolman spotted a car with an improperly
placed placard Jan. 16 and questioned the driver.
</P>
<P>
   Nine Bruins will miss the first two games of the season against
Boise State and Ohio State universities, Carnesale said, and all 14
players charged face additional punishments as students, ranging
from probation to suspension.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has just had their wrist slapped,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Carnesale said federal and state laws will prevent him from
revealing which students received which punishment. He added that
the university will require them to participate in meetings with
disabled students and awareness-raising efforts ``in a meaningful
and extensive way.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruin head coach Bob Toledo said he was very disappointed by the
players' actions but lauded Carnesale's decision and agreed to the
two-game suspension before Wednesday's court action.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a surrogate father. I'm going to love 'em. I'm going to
scold 'em. But I'm not going to throw them out,'' Toledo told
reporters at a press conference on the UCLA campus.
</P>
<P>
   Five of the charged individuals either have graduated or are no
longer on the team.
</P>
<P>
   The nine players sentenced Wednesday were: Azziz, 22, of Sherman
Oaks; Damian Allen, 21, of Van Nuys; Marques Anderson, 20, of Long
Beach; Oscar Cabrera, 21, of Highland Park; Deatra Clinton, 21, of
West Covina; Ryan Nece, 20, of Palms; Ryan Roques, 21, of Mar
Vista; Robert Thomas, 18, of Imperial; and Anthony White, 20, of
Sherman Oaks.
</P>
<P>
   Five other UCLA football players charged in the case will be in
court Aug. 25. Four asked for more time to consider the City
Attorney's plea bargain offer _ Duval Hicks, 23, of Sherman Oaks;
Craig Walendy, 21, of Westlake Village; Durell Price, 21, of
Newhall; and James Ghezzi, 22, of Mar Vista. Mark Reynosa, 20, of
Sylmar, asked the judge for more time to hire an attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks and Walendy are at NFL training camps and were not in
court. They and Reynosa were seniors last year.

<P>
   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
MICHAEL Jordan and Wayne Gretzky quit because there was nothing
left for them to accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Sanders quit _ if indeed he has _ because he will never
accomplish what he hasn't already.
</P>
<P>
   As an individual performer, Sanders deserves same-sentence
mention with both Air and The Great One. Although he may not have
reinvented the fine art of carting a football over, through and
around people, he certainly refined it. For now, or at least until
Terrell Davis puts a wrap on his Bronco-busting career, it can be
safely said that Barry buries them all.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody else has gone 10-for-10 in the NFL, as in 10 consecutive
1,000-yard seasons. Sanders leaves on top, the very top, as the
best back of them all, certainly when you factor in a three-year
college career that saw him set 13 NCAA records and claim the
Heisman Trophy for a so-so Oklahoma State program.
</P>
<P>
   You don't believe Barry is No. 1? It's only because he hasn't
won anything. Which is also why he's going. His paycheck makes him
almost untradable in the hard salary-cap era, and the Lions'
entrenched mediocrity, some four decades in the honing, ensures
there will be no championships in his future.
</P>
<P>
   Arguably, only New Orleans has been a more inept franchise than
Detroit in the post-merger era of the NFL. Walter Payton hung
around Chicago long enough to finally earn a Super Bowl ring while
raising the NFL's career rushing record to lofty new heights. But
Sanders, 31, might not live long enough to see the Lions go the
distance.
</P>
<P>
   And Barry has nothing to prove as far as Payton's numbers are
concerned. He trails Sweetness by less than 1,500 yards, yet he has
run for more than 3,500 over the last two seasons. Barring a
catastrophic injury, which was unlikely considering his established
durability, Sanders figured to leave Payton's prodigious total of
16,726 lost in his wake.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows? The Lion King might have had it in him to push the
20,000-yard barrier.
</P>
<P>
   All the more reason for him to retire? Payton is suffering from
a congenital liver disease and desperately needs a transplant. Did
Sanders, certain to be a first-ballot Hall of Famer, feel any great
need to erase a beloved hero's name from the history books while he
battles for his life?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that's giving Sanders too much credit, and perhaps his
objectives are as greedy and self-serving as the skeptics are
suggesting they are. This could be just another poorly disguised
contract ploy, or a hardball play to force a trade to a contender,
the cap be hanged. Barry does, after all, have a rich history of
such behavior.
</P>
<P>
   He has held out on three occasions during his gold-dusted
career, and he has renegotiated so many times no one seems to be
exactly sure how much he would have made on the deal he's presumed
to be walking away from.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a definite majesty in bowing out at the apex of
one's skills, before the ravages of the aging process take their
humbling toll. Jim Brown did it, slipping away after just nine NFL
seasons to pursue an acting career _ and, in those days, a fatter
income. In baseball, Sandy Koufax begged off after winning 27 games
at age 30, before his fabled left arm fell off.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan? He clearly departed on his own terms, with lots of gas
still in the tank. His decision had to have some impact on Sanders,
who was no doubt already toying with the idea himself after another
season in which he had run to lots of daylight while the Lions
wandered lost in their usual fog.
</P>
<P>
   In Barry's third season _ 1991 _ Detroit reached the NFC
Championship Game. The Lions haven't sniffed at the Super Bowl
since, and there's no reason to believe Bobby Ross' current lugs
have anything more than a .500 season in them, with or without
Barry.
</P>
<P>
   No one can be completely sure, though, what he is thinking, or
when the idea that culminated in Wednesday's farewell statement
germinated. Sanders has traveled to London, where his anonymity
figures to be secure. The Brits wouldn't recognize Barry, who
stands only 5-8 in loafers, if he wore his Lions helmet down Oxford
Street.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, they didn't have a clue who Julius Erving was.
</P>
<P>
   Fact is, Sanders' physique holds the key to what he's really up
to. Jordan's retirement surprised no one because he hadn't been
working out, and the good life was beginning to show on his person,
which turned up regularly on glitzy golf courses and at Las Vegas
gaming tables.
</P>
<P>
   Should Barry still be at his fighting weight _ 200 pounds,
roughly _ he's probably not done with the NFL just yet. But to find
that out, we have to get a good look at him first.

JANITORS HELPED WITH FOOD SERVICE ON SAFECO'S OPENING NIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM PAULSON AND SARAH SKIDMORE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Temporary janitors were shifted to food service duty
during Safeco Field's opening night, public health officials
confirmed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials admit they don't know exactly what took place,
or how many workers were involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they'd been taking out the garbage, we would expect that
they would at least have to have changed their clothes and washed
their hands,'' said Steve Curry, senior food safety inspector for
Public Health _ Seattle &AMP; King County.
</P>
<P>
   Volume Services America Inc., the food vendor at Safeco Field,
has received numerous citations for food safety violations since
the stadium's opening July 15. The company has said concessionaires
at the Seattle Mariners' new ballpark were under extraordinary
pressure on opening night as frustrated patrons waited in long
lines for food.
</P>
<P>
   Curry said Alton Hutcheson, general manager for Volume Services
at Safeco Field, acknowledged that workers hired to do clean-up
around the food stands were transferred ``on the spur of the
moment'' to help with food services. The exact number could not be
determined Wednesday, although a food service worker, who asked
that his name not be used, told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer it
involved about 20 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Hutcheson) said they were all put into the condiment
areas,'' Curry said. This would still require health department
certification, he said, but can by law be done within two weeks of
starting any food service work.
</P>
<P>
   Curry said he told Hutcheson that all of these clean-up workers
transferred to food service should have been given immediate
training in basic hygiene, such as proper hand-washing and using
bleach-water mixtures to clean-up spills. Hutcheson did not say if
the workers had received the training. But because he was assured
that the job shift only involved condiments, Curry said he wasn't
too concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm taking his word on that,'' Curry said. He said this
potential infraction was not as high a priority as the 50 other
``red critical'' violations at Safeco Field that had posed an
immediate threat of spreading foodborne illness.
</P>
<P>
   Hutcheson did not return telephone calls late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``(It's) something we'll look into,'' said Elaine Richner,
spokeswoman for Volume Services at company headquarters in
Spartanburg, S.C. She said Hutcheson had made himself available
earlier for questions from the media and was too busy to answer
further questions Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Volume Services held a news conference Wednesday along with a
food safety training session for Safeco Field concessions
supervisors. Aiming to avoid a costly ``third strike'' on public
health violations, the company is requiring more extensive food
safety training for its work force.
</P>
<P>
   ``The training further emphasizes that these things need to be
taken seriously,'' Hutcheson said at the morning news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Concession stands and kiosks operated by Volume Services at
Safeco Field received 24 ``red critical'' food safety violations on
the first visit by public health inspectors and 26 ``red critical''
violations on the second visit. Seven of the second set of
citations were repeat offenses. These violations require action to
prevent the spread of foodborne illness. If the stands and kiosks
already cited twice earn a third violation within a year, public
health officials say they will be temporarily shut down.
</P>
<P>
   Supervisors and managers have already been through a similar
company training program. Wednesday's ServSafe training was taught
by SYSCO Corporation and was created by the Educational Foundation
of the National Restaurant Association. The class learned about
safe food handling, storing and preparation of foods, temperature
danger zones and potential biological, chemical and physical
hazards of food.
</P>
<P>
   Stand and kiosk workers will go through a condensed version of
the training before the next home game Friday. Some workers have
gone through the company training and all have earned the
certification required by the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a fan comes out here Friday or was out here last Thursday
and had food from Food Services, they should be assured it is as
safe as you can go,'' Hutcheson said.
</P>
<P>
   Hutcheson said one of the primary contributing factors leading
to the violations was the short window of time in which the vendors
had to set up the stands and kiosks. Some of the violations, which
included a lack of paper towels and soap at the washing stations,
were the result of equipment problems. The holders for these items
have been replaced by larger ones so the materials will not run out
during games. However, for the storage and temperature violations,
Hutcheson said, ``there is no excuse for that, but it has been
corrected.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutcheson said Volume Services was originally going to be
allowed access to the stands in April and the date then gradually
slid forward until July.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the whole thing has been blown out of proportion
because the stands were given to us only three days before,''
Hutcheson said. ``Any new facility is like this.''
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged he would keep some of the stands closed if he
had to do it over again.

UCLA FOOTBALL PLAYERS FINED, SENTENCED
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Nine UCLA football players pleaded no contest
Wednesday to illegal possession of handicapped parking placards, a
misdemeanor, and were sentenced to 200 hours of community service
and $1,485 apiece in fines and fees.
</P>
<P>
   Seven of the players _ and two others who postponed their court
hearings _ will be benched for the first two games of the season,
said UCLA Chancellor Albert Carnesale.
</P>
<P>
   The sentence imposed by Los Angeles Municipal Court Judge Sam
Ohta requires the players to perform half of the community service
with the Special Olympics, which holds athletic events for the
disabled, and half with other organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The players apologized, but more than a dozen people in
wheelchairs jeered the plea bargain and sentences outside the
court.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a slap on the wrist,'' said Lillibeth Navarro of the
California Foundation of Independent Living Centers. ``They're

</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to apologize to the disabled community,'' he
said in a statement after the sentencing. ``We did not realize the
seriousness of our actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Azziz said they never parked in handicapped spaces with the
illegally obtained placards but used them to park free.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had realized then how offensive our actions were to the
disabled community and to others, we would never have committed

our families and ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Rafer Johnson, 1960 Olympics decathlon champion and board
chairman of Southern California Special Olympics, called the
sentence appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``These athletes made a mistake, and every one of them have told
me that, and have said that to everyone within hearing distance of

</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Harland Braun, who represented six of the nine
players entering pleas Wednesday, and Deputy City Attorney Brian
Williams said the sentences were fair and appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Braun said average people pleading to the same charges would
have been sentenced to pay $1,300 in fines and fees, with no
community service.
</P>
<P>
   The misdemeanor charges carry a maximum sentence of 6 months in
jail and a $1,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   In return for the pleas, the City Attorney's Office dismissed
one misdemeanor charge against each of the nine for filing false
documents with the state Department of Motor Vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The use of the parking passes by current and former players came
to light after a campus patrolman spotted a car with an improperly
placed placard Jan. 16 and questioned the driver.
</P>
<P>
   Nine Bruins will miss the first two games of the season against
Boise State and Ohio State universities, Carnesale said, and all 14
players charged face additional punishments as students, ranging
from probation to suspension.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has just had their wrist slapped,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Carnesale said federal and state laws will prevent him from
revealing which students received which punishment. He added that
the university will require them to participate in meetings with
disabled students and awareness-raising efforts ``in a meaningful
and extensive way.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruin head coach Bob Toledo said he was very disappointed by the
players' actions but lauded Carnesale's decision and agreed to the
two-game suspension before Wednesday's court action.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a surrogate father. I'm going to love 'em. I'm going to
scold 'em. But I'm not going to throw them out,'' Toledo told
reporters at a press conference on the UCLA campus.
</P>
<P>
   Five of the charged individuals either have graduated or are no
longer on the team.
</P>
<P>
   The nine players sentenced Wednesday were: Azziz, 22, of Sherman
Oaks; Damian Allen, 21, of Van Nuys; Marques Anderson, 20, of Long
Beach; Oscar Cabrera, 21, of Highland Park; Deatra Clinton, 21, of
West Covina; Ryan Nece, 20, of Palms; Ryan Roques, 21, of Mar
Vista; Robert Thomas, 18, of Imperial; and Anthony White, 20, of
Sherman Oaks.
</P>
<P>
   Five other UCLA football players charged in the case will be in
court Aug. 25. Four asked for more time to consider the City
Attorney's plea bargain offer _ Duval Hicks, 23, of Sherman Oaks;
Craig Walendy, 21, of Westlake Village; Durell Price, 21, of
Newhall; and James Ghezzi, 22, of Mar Vista. Mark Reynosa, 20, of
Sylmar, asked the judge for more time to hire an attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks and Walendy are at NFL training camps and were not in
court. They and Reynosa were seniors last year.

INCIVILITY IS TAKING OVER THE WORKPLACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: A phone conversation ends with a loudly slammed
receiver and hissed epithet.
</P>
<P>
   Someone drains the office coffeepot or empties the copier paper,
then walks away without refilling.
</P>
<P>
   Day after day, a boss blows by without so much as a nod to
members of his staff.
</P>
<P>
   Sound like where you work?
</P>
<P>
   Probably. Consensus says workplace civility is in fragile
health.
</P>
<P>
   For some reason, the unruly mob that trashed Woodstock '99
invited comparisons with the rise of incivility in the workplace.
Three decades ago, at the original Woodstock, people were mad about
the lack of facilities, too. But they just crawled under blankets,
blew dope and had sex. This summer, they upended cars and burned
merchants' booths.
</P>
<P>
   This summer _ and don't blame the 100-degree heat _ we rarely
make a half-hour commute without witnessing finger flipping or
other acts of traffic discourtesy. And then we run into work rage.
</P>
<P>
   There always have been boors and bullies. There always have been
testy retorts, raised voices and egotists who think their needs
outrank everyone else's. But in the last two years, workplace
chroniclers say, there is a nasty growth of rudeness at work.
</P>
<P>
   Web sites and consulting businesses have emerged to nip the
trend. Meanwhile, the July cover story in Training magazine, a
publication about ``the human side of business,'' spotlights ``Mean
Streets and Rude Workplaces: The Death of Civility.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a depressing wallop for those who think, as management guru
Peter Drucker said, that civility is ``the lubricating oil of our
organizations.''
</P>
<P>
   Christine Pearson, a researcher at the University of North
Carolina, surveyed hundreds of workers and found that the
lubricating oil is running low. Reports of demeaning harangues and
snippy exchanges far, far eclipsed violence and overt harassment
when workers told her what bothered them at their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Bob Rosner, author of the book Working Wounded, set
up a Web site to find out what bugs workers. His No. 1 finding:
food stolen from office refrigerators.
</P>
<P>
   Training traced the incivility surge to changes pointed out by
Harvard sociologist Robert Putnam in a seminal essay, published in
1995. ``Bowling Alone'' detailed Americans' flagging participation
in all kinds of group activities in favor of solo pursuits (TV and
computers, particularly).
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Rosner contends, ignoring the rights and feelings of
others has become a workplace epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   Some people blame two-career families. Some blame a loss of
God-centeredness. Some blame President Clinton. Others blame the
Clinton haters. Others blame the media.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the cause, too many workers act unaware and unconcerned
about the effect of their words and deeds on others. Unfortunately,
the effect goes beyond the intended target of the rudeness, if
indeed there was a specific target.
</P>
<P>
   More than nine out of 10 targets told the North Carolina
researcher that they describe their unpleasant encounters to
others. Clearly, incivility sends out ripples, polluting
organizations, if not civilization.

CHANGES ARE EXPECTED TO MAKE CHILD CAR SEATS MORE STABLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE EVERLY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The biggest changes in children's car seats
in at least two decades are beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Safety seats made after Sept. 1 must come equipped with tether
straps that will attach to an anchor, which usually will be on the
back shelf under the rear window of the car. Most model year 2000
cars and light trucks will come equipped to handle the tethers.
Retrofit kits also are available for many older models.
</P>
<P>
   And that is just the beginning. A new way to secure the base of
the car seat will start showing up next year. The new method will
dispense with using the vehicle's seat belts.
</P>
<P>
   The result will be a somewhat more expensive car seat, but one
that should be safer and easier to use. The addition of the tether
strap by itself is expected to make the car seat far more stable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Times are changing and this is good,'' said Ronda Barrett, a
child-development coordinator at the University of Kansas Medical
Center in Kansas City, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   The changes come after years of complaints that car seats are
too difficult to use and consequently don't do their job.
</P>
<P>
   Most children ages 6 or under who are killed in traffic
accidents aren't in car seats. But each year about 230 children in
that age group are killed and 66,000 are injured in traffic
accidents even though they're in safety seats. Some of those
fatalities and injuries are due to incorrectly installed seats,
experts said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Highway Safety Traffic Administration, the federal
agency pushing the seat redesign, points to a study in four states,
including Missouri, showing that 80 percent of car seats are
misused or installed incorrectly.
</P>
<P>
   Instructions for installing the seats can be difficult to
follow. Aggravating the situation are features in cars and light
trucks. Seat cushions, for example, often aren't level and make a
child's car seat unstable.
</P>
<P>
   The car seat redesign is expected to go a ``long way to address
these issues,'' said David Campbell, vice president of research and
development for Century Products, a car seat manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Sept. 1, child car seats must be made with tether
straps. The strap will add about $10 to the cost of the seat. The
nylon strap goes from the top back of the seat to an anchor at the
rear of the car. Children will still have a harness to hold them
into the seat.
</P>
<P>
   The tether will hook into an anchor installed on the vehicle. In
a car, the anchor will usually be on the shelf under the rear
window. In a minivan, the tether will probably be draped over the
back of the seat and hooked into an anchor on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   At least 80 percent of the year 2000 models will come with at
least two tether anchors installed as factory equipment. Some of
the 2000 models _ the Ford Windstar and Chevrolet Impala, for
instance _ have already arrived in dealers' showrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We support it (the tether) wholeheartedly,'' said Artie
Martin, a safety engineer for General Motors Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Some details are still being worked out for the remainder of the
car seat redesign. But starting in the fall of 2000 and over the
following three years, a bar will be installed in new vehicles
where the top and bottom seat cushions meet. Instead of using the
vehicle's seat belts, the car seat will clip on the bar. The tether
will continue to be used at the top.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago the tether was dropped as a mandatory feature
of child car seats because it wasn't used. And the car seat as then
designed required the strap to keep it from tipping too far forward
in a crash.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 20 years, most car seats relied on the vehicle's
seat belts to keep them from tipping too far forward _ no more than
32 inches, according to federal regulations. But that required the
seat belts to tightly fit through the car seat, which is often a
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new design, a tethered car seat can tilt forward no
more than 28 inches in crash tests.
</P>
<P>
   That's a substantial improvement, said Stephanie Tombrello,
director of SafetyBeltSafe, a national group promoting the use of
child safety seats.
</P>
<P>
   But there are concerns. One of the biggest is what to do about
people who have older seats and cars without the tether anchors.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that the redesigned car seats will continue to
work without the tether. You'll be no worse off, although you won't
get the improved performance.
</P>
<P>
   Automakers, however, are coming out with retrofit kits to put
the tether anchors in older models. General Motors, for example,
has them for most vehicles back to the 1989 models. It will also
install one anchor free per customer.
</P>
<P>
   A new car seat with the tether can already be purchased. And
some of the car seats already sold came with a hole where a tether
can be attached. The tethers can be purchased at stores that sell
the car seats.
</P>
<P>
   Mike McGinley, general manager of the Superior Chevrolet
dealership in Merriam, Kan., said his dealership had stocked
retrofit kits to install the anchors on older models.
</P>
<P>
   But news about the changes is just beginning to reach many other
dealerships.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Looper of Kearney, Mo., can testify to that. The volunteer
firefighter has seen what a car accident can do to a child. She
takes all the precautions she can for her two children. When it
came to a recent purchase of a new car, she wanted one with tether
anchors. But the car salespeople she spoke to weren't aware of
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had no idea what we were talking about,'' she said. She
finally purchased a Ford Windstar that comes with the tether
anchors.

SUCCESSES - AND FAILURES - IN STATE'S WELFARE REFORM OF TWO YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT GAVIN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OLYMPIA, Wash. _ The welfare reform experiment was failing for
DeAnn Prentice, a 36-year-old single mother. She had found and lost
two jobs, and on a day about a year ago, things took what seemed
another turn for the worse.
</P>
<P>
   On the way to apply for a job at a Yakima hotel, she got lost
and ended up at another hotel. Two months out of work and fearing
she would lose benefits under Washington state's welfare reform
law, she filled out an application, anyway, and went home, feeling
desperate and defeated.
</P>
<P>
   But just 90 minutes later, the hotel called her in for an
interview. Today, Prentice is completing her first year as a night
auditor at the Doubletree Hotel, a job that pays $7.25 an hour,
with health insurance. More important, it offers a career.
</P>
<P>
   Prentice says she is one of the lucky ones, not only for this
fortunate turn, but also because she had the education _ nearly two
years of college _ that made her attractive to employers. Many of
her neighbors in Yakima's 801 Central Street housing project,
Prentice said, lack the skills, education and experience that
helped her make the transition to work after 11 years of welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Prentice and her neighbors represent both the success and
challenges that face Washington after two years of welfare reform.
When Gov. Gary Locke marks the anniversary of WorkFirst in a visit
to a Seattle training program on Thursday, he will tout a record
that includes a 30 percent reduction in caseloads; budget savings
of more than $100 million a year; and a cultural change in the
welfare system that now values work, first.
</P>
<P>
   But even with this long list of accomplishments, lawmakers,
administrators and advocates for the poor say the hard work is just
beginning. Left on the rolls are the most difficult cases _ drug
and alcohol abusers, victims of domestic violence, people without
education or skills, and immigrants who don't speak English _ while
many who have found jobs still live in the margins.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking the cycle of poverty will mean more investments in
education, training, child care, health care and transportation,
many policy-makers and advocates agree. The question facing the
state in this time of prosperity is how many of those investments
will be made, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the time when we have resources to deal with these
issues,'' said Rep. Kip Tokuda, the Democratic co-chairman of the
House Children's and Family Services Committee. ``It's not just
putting them in dead-end jobs in a very good economy. If it is,
then we're basically privately supporting them in poverty, instead
of publicly supporting them in poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington's WorkFirst program, passed by a
Republican-controlled Legislature, went into effect Aug. 1, 1997,
about a year after the Republican-controlled Congress approved the
national welfare reform law.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's program takes a carrot-and-stick approach. It
provides transitional income assistance, health insurance and child
care benefits while also offering job training, placement and
education opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   It also reduces benefits by up to 40 percent for those who fail
to seek or take steps to find work, and sets a five-year limit for
staying on public assistance. About 3,000 recipients are sanctioned
each month, according to the state Department of Health and Social
Services. Critics say it relies too much on the stick, and fails to
allow the flexibility needed to help people succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Dent, a Seattle mother of four, recently completed a
clerical training program and will leave the welfare rolls next
week, even though she has yet to find a job.
</P>
<P>
   Dent, whose days begin at 6 a.m. getting her children off to
school before attending a training program she will soon complete,
said state caseworkers had no understanding of the demands she
faced trying to care for her family.
</P>
<P>
   ``They browbeat you,'' she said. ``They have these classes for,
you know _ life skills, and if you miss an hour, you have to start
over again. You may go for two or three days, and if you have a
sick child, and miss an hour, you start all over again.''
</P>
<P>
   By other measures, however, the program appears a success.
Helped by the booming economy, welfare caseload reductions have far
exceeded original projections.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the number of welfare cases fell to 59,712 _ 30 percent
below the target of about 85,000 set by the Legislature. The figure
also represents the lowest rate of public assistance in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   When WorkFirst began, the state had nearly 100,000 cases, with
each case typically representing a family. Ken Miller, Locke's
welfare policy adviser, points to other indications the program is
working: the average wage paid to former welfare recipients _ more
than $8 an hour _ is among the highest in the nation, and many earn
more money six months after beginning work, according to a
Department of Social and Health Services survey.
</P>
<P>
   The rate of people returning to welfare within a year has also
declined, from about 20 percent to 15 percent, according to recent
statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those kind of factors are real encouraging,'' Miller said.
``Fewer people are coming back to welfare. We have a vision to make
it a lasting change, to stay with people and give them a good
chance to move ahead and make a good life for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Prentice, the mother of two, now believes she has a chance for a
good life. She's had her job for about a year, and soon expects
another raise. Her immediate goal is to get off the overnight shift
and work days, and one day move into management.
</P>
<P>
   Prentice admits the welfare reform law pushed her to get back in
the work force. She also said that without pressure to find a job,
she probably would not have accepted the bookkeeping job _ a job
for which she had no prior training.
</P>
<P>
   ``It forced me to take a chance,'' she said. ``I like the fact
that I'm able to maintain my household without any help from
welfare. I want to stay with the corporation, move out of here and
transfer to a bigger hotel.''
</P>
<P>
   There are any number of success stories like Prentice, but
advocates for the poor say they are only part of the picture. What
remains unknown is where most former welfare recipients end up, and
whether they have merely joined the ranks of the working poor.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Donlea, executive director of Washington Works, a job
training program, said his agency is seeing clients who lack the
most basic skills, such as understanding the need to show up for
appointments.
</P>
<P>
   Beth Dannhardt, executive director of Triumph Treatment Services
in Yakima, said her clients face additional barriers as they try to
break free of welfare: drug and alcohol addiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't want to be on welfare,'' she said. ``But we're
talking about women who can academically perform at the third- and
fourth-grade level.''
</P>
<P>
   Little is known about those who leave welfare and where they end
up. Some point to the effect on private charities as an indicator
that not all are escaping poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Food banks across the state say they've seen little change in
demand despite the booming economy. Northwest Harvest said visits
to 270 food banks and meals programs it supplies have increased
slightly over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   In some counties, however, visits have increased 50 percent and
more. In Mason county the number of people going to food banks has
doubled.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Boutwell, who runs the Hood Canal Food Bank in Hoodsport,
said demand is up 35 percent over the past year. He blames it on a
poor economy that has too many people working in low-wage jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The so-called welfare reform has been more successful where
there are a lot of jobs, not so here,'' Boutwell said. ``It has
worked against us. It just seems there is a larger and larger gulf
developing between the `haves' and the `have nots.'''
</P>
<P>
   Al Poole, director of Operational Emergency Center in South
Seattle, said he has seen the impact of welfare reform in the
number of families coming on `baby day', when center distributes
diapers, formula and other infant care products. The numbers have
jumped from an average of 200 to more than 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in Seattle since 1968, and I've never seen times
better,'' Poole said. ``I'm wondering what will really happen if we
have a downturn.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, the governor's welfare adviser, said the Locke
administration is committed to making welfare reform a way to
improving lives, not just maintaining them in poverty. The state
will spend about $700 million helping welfare recipients over the
next year, reinvesting about half the money saved from reduced
caseloads and expanding programs to help develop skills needed to
succeed in the job market.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a tough row to hoe,'' he said. ``We have only taken
steps to making permanent changes in the welfare system. We have
not yet demonstrated this can be a lasting change.''
</P>
<P>
   Prentice said she hopes she's made a lasting change. But she
also knows how difficult those changes can be.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're scared to death,'' she said. ``You're looking for a
job. If you don't have education, you don't have transportation,
and they're taking what you do have (in benefits) away from you,
it's really scary. It puts you in a really desperate situation.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``I was married 55 years to one woman. I loved
her. What else can I tell you?'' _ Max Odrezin.
</P>
<P>
   Not much, Max. That about says it all. A lot of people search
their whole lives and never find what you and Rhoda had.
</P>
<P>
   You know you were a lucky guy, which explains the picture in the
paper the other day.
</P>
<P>
   Explains why a guy walks into a newspaper office on the second
anniversary of his wife's death, just like he did on the first, and
buys a big spot on the obit page to show the world how beautiful
she was and how much he still misses her.
</P>
<P>
   Class act, Max. There isn't a woman alive who wouldn't want the
same treatment after she's gone.
</P>
<P>
   She was quite a looker, Max, that wife of yours. A real siren.
That picture of her sitting on top of a suitcase _ dressed to the
nines and flashing a smile that could kill _ is a knockout.
</P>
<P>
   She always played the dumb blonde in movies, you told me
Wednesday. Whether it was the role of one of the dancers in
``Around the World in 80 Days,'' or the cashier who fired Doris Day
in ``Love Me or Leave Me'' with James Cagney.
</P>
<P>
   Helene Drake was her stage name. The dumb blonde.
</P>
<P>
   Only she wasn't dumb, was she, Max? No, she was as smart as a
whip, and could see through all the phoniness of Hollywood, and all
the casting couch directors who promised to make her a star.
</P>
<P>
   You two used to laugh about it, didn't you? Come home at the end
of the day and trade war stories.
</P>
<P>
   You'd tell her about how some panhandler got another free meal
out of you over at your Van Nuys restaurant, where the word was out
that you were a soft touch for a hard luck story.
</P>
<P>
   She'd tell you about her day, how some producer wanted her to
fly up to his cabin in the Sierras over the weekend to screen test
for a role. Yeah, right, buddy. Fat chance.
</P>
<P>
   They never could see past the blond hair, could they, Max?
Couldn't see the Rhoda Tomack you fell in love with back in
Brooklyn, not the Helene Drake screen testing in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   The New York doll working as a dancer at the World's Fair when
she walked into the Brooklyn stationery store you managed back in
1941, and headed for the candy counter to buy a Mr. Goodbar, her
favorite.
</P>
<P>
   She slid the nickel across the counter at you, and what'd you
do, Max? You slid it back. On the house, you said.
</P>
<P>
   Got to her heart through her sweet tooth, didn't you, Max? It
worked beautifully.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, you guys were spending more time at Ebbets Field
watching the Bums play baseball than you did at work.
</P>
<P>
   But then the war touched your lives and you two had a big
decision to make in a hurry. You asked, and Rhoda said yes.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of months later, your young wife was kissing you
goodbye, like a lot of young wives.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years later, you were in Europe getting shot up
pretty bad. Bad enough that when you came home in '45, the doctors
told you having your own children was out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   Rhoda welcomed you home, and told you exactly what you wanted to
hear. It was OK. We'll adopt, she said.
</P>
<P>
   And that's what you guys did later, moving to California in 1946
after coming home from the war and finding that your old job at the
stationery store had been given to someone else.
</P>
<P>
   But it all turned out for the best, didn't it, Max? After a
couple of years driving a delivery truck for the old Owl Drugstore
chain out here, you had saved up enough to open your own
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   First it was Drakes on Wilshire Boulevard for about 10 years
until the landlord doubled the rent on you, then the Patio in Van
Nuys for an additional 30, where you got that rep as having a soft
heart for a hard luck story.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Rhoda's modeling was leading to her first movie job
as one of those bathing beauties behind Esther Williams. Rhoda
didn't swim too well, you said, but she had no problem filling out
a bathing suit.
</P>
<P>
   But those movie days ended when the '50s did. It was finally
time to adopt those kids you'd talked about, and start a family.
</P>
<P>
   Helene Drake, dumb blonde, retired.
</P>
<P>
   Rhoda Odrezin, mother, took over.
</P>
<P>
   And now she's gone, and you're still hurting.
</P>
<P>
   Walking into a newspaper office on the second anniversary of her
death to buy space on the obit page to show the world how beautiful
she was, and how much you still miss her.
</P>
<P>
   Class act, Max.

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ You don't have to tell Max Hockemeier about
the fickle nature of, well, nature.
</P>
<P>
   Hockemeier's farm had too much rain this spring, when showers
flooded his Ray County fields and forced him to replant his crops.
</P>
<P>
   Now, when those plants could sorely use the rain, there's barely
a hint of it in sight. Even worse, the heavy spring rains weakened
his replanted crop, which hasn't developed roots deep enough to
find adequate moisture.
</P>
<P>
   While others lament the 100-degree heat, farmers like Hockemeier
fret about the lack of precipitation. Kansas City has received 0.39
inches this month, about one-tenth the normal total.
</P>
<P>
   Nurseries, nature centers, golf courses and lawns _ any places
where green slowly is turning to brown _ feel the stress, too.
</P>
<P>
   But Hockemeier has felt Mother Nature's whims as much as anyone.
</P>
<P>
   He heard forecasts for rain on Wednesday. Although other areas
received a shower, he saw only a tenth of an inch. That evaporated
before lunchtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you farm, you know the one thing you can't control is the
weather. So when the clouds come up and you get that ray of hope
and it just passes you by...'' said Hockemeier, who farms south of
Richmond, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say you ever get used to the disappointment,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But farmers aren't suffering alone, and the oppressive heat wave
is exacting more than an economic toll: It has claimed 49 lives
across the country, 18 in Missouri. St. Louis confirmed five more
deaths on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals in the Kansas City area reported no deaths or serious
heat-related injuries on Wednesday; two deaths have been reported
in the area since the latest heat outbreak.
</P>
<P>
   Temperatures in Kansas City reached 101 degrees downtown on
Wednesday with a heat index of 114 degrees; Wednesday's high at
Kansas City International Airport was 98.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters expect dryness to continue through the weekend. They
note a chance of rain on Saturday but say not to count on it.
</P>
<P>
   In the country, miles away from smog, high-rises and concrete,
living things of other types are feeling the strain, too.
</P>
<P>
   Leaves are wilting, turning brown and falling off. Animals have
to travel farther to find water because their usual watering holes
are probably dried up, biologists say.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Reed, director of the Parkville Nature Sanctuary, said the
ground is cracked and the bugs, mosquitoes and ticks are out. But
the deer, raccoons, turtles, possums and foxes haven't been seen
lately.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they are just resting,'' Reed said. ``It's just so
hot.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not exactly ideal for humans, either.
</P>
<P>
   Because the center has no air-conditioned building, officials
have put July programs, such as hikes, on hold.
</P>
<P>
   Nature sanctuaries and centers are nursing stressed trees,
plants, flowers and grass. Some are watering, others are letting
nature decide.
</P>
<P>
   Even with no relief in sight, all the centers think their plants
will bounce back after some steady rain or cloudy days.
</P>
<P>
   Helene Miller, an urban forester for the Missouri Department of
Conservation's Kansas City office, said trees planted in the past
three years need special attention.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said a tree ideally should receive an inch of rain per
week during its growing season, from April to October. It's best to
soak the tree once or twice a week, she said, instead of watering
it a little every day.
</P>
<P>
   She added that it's a typical summer for this area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have definitely seen worse than this,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the flora at the Martha Lafite Thompson Nature Sanctuary
in Liberty, Mo., isn't exactly embracing the dryness.
</P>
<P>
   A hawthorn tree is so confused that it's producing red berries
that normally don't appear until fall. Visitors can see right
through the usually lush redbud tree, whose green leaves have faded
to orange and brown, now dotting the ground.
</P>
<P>
   But all is not lost.
</P>
<P>
   The turnout at the Excelsior Springs (Mo.) Golf Course is about
a third as high as normal. Those who play find brown grass draping
bone-dry dirt.
</P>
<P>
   But the dry course means drives will bounce on the dry fairways,
carrying them an extra 50 to 100 yards. That could turn Joe Duffer
into Tiger Woods for a day.
</P>
<P>
   At Powell Gardens, between Lee's Summit and Warrensburg, Mo.,
the staff is watering every day. The greenery still looks green.
</P>
<P>
   But another week or two of this heat and ``we might not look as
beautiful as we usually do in the summer,'' said Eric Tschanz,
executive director.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers need relief in a hurry, too.
</P>
<P>
   Statewide in Missouri, 20 percent of the corn crop is reported
in poor or very poor condition, twice as high as last week.
Soybeans are suffering at the same rate.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Townsend already is sure his yield will be down.
</P>
<P>
   As the dryness continues, Townsend said his corn and soybeans
were shutting down. They stop producing seeds in a desperate
attempt to stay alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they're fighting for moisture, they'll stop making ears
(of corn) or growing soybeans. Unfortunately, those are the two
things I need,'' said Townsend, who farms about 2,000 acres near
Orrick, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   Although recent sprinkles have added to the miserable humidity,
Townsend said they help plants, which absorb moisture from the air.
</P>
<P>
   That isn't enough for other farmers. Several said they need
steady rain in the next week to avoid large, irreversible losses.
</P>
<P>
   Again, blame it on the rain.
</P>
<P>
   The above-normal rainfall of May and June pampered the crops,
said Dwight Gigstad of the Farmers Cooperative Association in
Edgerton, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   Because crops received so much rain, they didn't develop the
roots they use to search out water below the soil, Gigstad said.
Now, in the ``critical stage,'' is when the plants could use those
roots, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Townsend is holding out hope.
</P>
<P>
   One good rain and he'd be happy. He'd forget about Mother
Nature's weeks of neglect. He'd overlook the flooding caused by
earlier downpours.
</P>
<P>
   But, after 20 years on the farm, he knows enough that the relief
would last only until the next crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sad part of it is it's totally out of your control,'' he
said. ``This farming thing, we're an unhappy bunch. It's either too
wet or too dry. Very seldom do you find us where everything is just
right.''

ARMSTRONG'S CYCLING TRIUMPH INSPIRES, AMAZES OTHERS WITH CANCER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD RICHMAN  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Throughout the 20 stages of the 1999 Tour de
France, over rocky terrain in the Pyrenees and across the rugged
Alps, American cyclist Lance Armstrong rode as if he had something
to prove.
</P>
<P>
   It was simply this: There's always hope in the fight against
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, 27, won the Tour on Sunday. Cancer survivors
worldwide will sing his praises for years.
</P>
<P>
   Many watched the nearly monthlong race in awe as Armstrong
pedaled 2,292 miles while showing none of the effects of the
testicular cancer that spread to his brain and lungs and threatened
his life three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get back to the point where he is now is truly amazing,''
said Norm Stewart, a cancer survivor and the former men's
basketball coach at the University of Missouri-Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Cancer survivors stick together like family. They're bound by
struggles _ the vomiting, weight reduction and hair loss. Stewart
doesn't know Armstrong, but he has kept an eye on the cyclist the
same way he used to track the Kansas Jayhawks' progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's remarkable how he overcame the physical part of it,''
Stewart said. ``I've been through the chemo. It zaps you. It takes
you down. But he made it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dying occurs to you when you have cancer. I tried to think
about living. You have to be mentally strong.''
</P>
<P>
   The list of cancer victims in sports is long. Dan Quisenberry,
Jim Valvano and Dick Howser succumbed to it. Arnold Palmer and Jim
Colbert are beating it.
</P>
<P>
   Golfer Paul Azinger, who posted his best season in 1993 when he
finished No. 2 on the money list, hasn't been the same since he was
diagnosed with lymphoma later that year. His best finish on the
money list since then was 50th in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Golfer Trevor Dodds, a member of the PGA Tour, returned from
testicular cancer and won a tournament. Kansas City Chiefs Hall of
Fame quarterback Len Dawson is whipping prostate cancer. Yet the
thought of it resurfacing haunts him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going on seven years since surgery, and I'm OK,'' Dawson
said Wednesday. ``I'm assuming it isn't (going to return), but it's
still in the back of my head that what if some of it did get into
my lymph nodes?''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Armstrong was diagnosed with cancer. Some of the tumors
in his abdomen were as big as golf balls. His right testicle was
removed, as were two brain lesions.
</P>
<P>
   The prognosis for Armstrong was 50-50 _ that he'd survive.
Still, he'd bike 30 to 50 miles daily after a weeklong session of
chemotherapy treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong lost 12 pounds, and his hair fell out. It got so bad
that Armstrong was quoted as saying he was ``on his death bed.''
Yet he persevered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lance isn't a miracle. He just reaffirmed there's life after
cancer,'' said Chris Brewer, also a victim of testicular cancer and
now the caretaker of Armstrong's Web page.
</P>
<P>
   Dodds, who plays in the first round of the Canon Greater
Hartford Open, said: ``He (Armstrong) had a worse case than I did.
It just goes to show you people who have gone through hardship can
come back better than they were before.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Geier, a Kansas City, Mo., oncologist, was amazed by
Armstrong's resilience. Geier said a typical testicular cancer
victim wouldn't be himself for at least six months to a year after
the chemotherapy. To then fight back and tackle such a grueling
test as the Tour de France is a testimonial to how far oncology has
come in battling testicular cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Geier said a combination of medicine and Armstrong's fortitude
was the remedy. There's a 2 percent chance Armstrong's cancer will
return.
</P>
<P>
   ``He showed a level of determination I couldn't relate to.
Determination and guts,'' Geier said.
</P>
<P>
   Dawson, who won a Super Bowl, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Off the top of my head, I can't think of anything (that
compares to Armstrong's comeback),'' Dawson said. ``How many days
is that race? That would be grueling enough if you didn't have any
problems. He just showed what one is capable of doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Geier said Armstrong overcame a cancer that carries one of the
most intense types of chemotherapy treatments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Treatments are relentless,'' Geier said.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer, diagnosed with cancer six days after Armstrong, knows
the suffering. The veins in his arms became a pincushion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's shocking when the nurse comes in wearing these heavy
latex gloves and says if she spills the medicine, they'd have to
call in the HazMat (hazardous materials) team to clean it up,''
Brewer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had mood swings, lost my hair. It did increase my sense of
smell. I took every dry-scented flower and threw them in the closet
and said, `If you open it up, I'll kill you.' And fresh-baked
bread...it made me want to puke.''
</P>
<P>
   Brewer and Armstrong linked forces through e-mail during and
after their chemotherapy. Brewer knows how Armstrong was able to
recover and compete at the highest level.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though he appeared very ill, people said you could still
see the fire in his eyes,'' Brewer said.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City businessman Paul Hunt is a former high school
football star and a sprinter on the track and field team at the
University of Kansas. He never cared about cycling until he learned
that he and Armstrong had a link. Hunt was diagnosed eight years
ago with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Hunt suddenly was starved to
read all about Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought of myself when I read about him,'' Hunt said. ``And
I have to say, it's one of the greatest athletic feats ever in
terms of the odds. He should be dead or easily could have been. I'd
love to ask him questions about what he went through. Or at least
I'd like to tell him how much I admire him.''
</P>
<P>
   As he finished his cycling victory, Armstrong mouthed a few
words into the camera as he pedaled toward the Champs Elysees in
Paris.
</P>
<P>
   He was sending a hello to Kelly Davidson, a cancer patient who
helped raise $17,000 for the Lance Armstrong Foundation, a
nonprofit organization that promotes cancer research. The
telephones have been busy at the foundation in Armstrong's home of
Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Haussmann, the foundation's executive director, said one of
the calls this week was a $25,000 donation from Nike. The
foundation netted $400,000 last year and gave $300,000 of it to
research.
</P>
<P>
   ``Including Nike, we've received about $50,000 in the last two
days,'' Haussmann said. ``If I had to get inside his mind, I'd say
Lance sees what he did as a victory for the cancer community. Lance
is committed to this. He just puts his head down, drives forward
and doesn't listen to the naysayers.''

COWBOYS MIGHT SIGN ALONZO SPELLMAN TODAY, SOURCE SAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ The Dallas Cowboys are discussing the
possibility of signing former Bears defensive end Alonzo Spellman
and an announcement could be made as soon as today, a source said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, who said this week that the team
would be pursuing a veteran to bolster their depleted defensive
line corps, declined to comment about Spellman.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Cowboys are always looking to improve their roster,
but he said there was nothing going on right now.
</P>
<P>
   Spellman's agent, Leigh Steinberg, was unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   A source said the Cowboys have actually been looking at Spellman
since he was cut by the Bears last year, but have been treading
carefully because of his past problems.
</P>
<P>
   Spellman, the Bears' No. 1 draft choice in 1992, recorded 24
sacks in six years. But he did not play at all in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   His departure from the Bears before last season came after
several bizarre off-the-field issues that resulted in Spellman
seeking psychiatric help.
</P>
<P>
   Most prominent was a May 9, 1998, incident when he barricaded
himself in the home of his publicist for several hours before being
subdued.
</P>
<P>
   If Spellman has overcome his past issues, his addition would be
an immediate upgrade for the Cowboys' suspect pass rush and give
the team more options in their attempts to make up for the loss of
suspended defensive tackle Leon Lett. PAGE READY TO GO
</P>
<P>
   Despite missing the first day of training because of contract
negotiations, second-round pick Solomon Page said he was able to
catch up pretty quickly when he joined his teammates for workouts
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Page, who will vie for backup time on the offensive line at
guard and tackle, credits quick progress on his presence at the
team's two minicamps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not far behind,'' Page said. ``I learned a lot in the
minicamps, so I was ready to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said the rookie was ``a little rusty''
Wednesday but agreed that the presence of the rookies at minicamps
offset any negatives of missing a day or two of training camp.
McKNIGHT EAGER TO LEARN
</P>
<P>
   Veteran receivers Michael Irvin, Raghib Ismail and Ernie Mills
practice for an hour each day catching passes from quarterback Troy
Aikman. They won't start full-fledged camp work until tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, James McKnight, who has spent the past five years in
Seattle, finds himself as the old man among boys.
</P>
<P>
   His training camp began Monday along with other young receivers,
mainly because he wasn't acquired by the Cowboys until June. That
meant he missed both the team's minicamps and the voluntary
coaching sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish the trade would have happened earlier,'' the 6-foot-1,
198-pound McKnight said. ``I went to four minicamps up there. I
would have liked to get one camp in Dallas under my belt. So, I'm
here just looking to get things done in training camp.''
</P>
<P>
   McKnight did get the aid of quarterbacks coach Buddy Geis, who
gave up a couple of weeks of his vacation to tutor the former
Liberty University star in the nuances of the Cowboys' intricate
offense.
</P>
<P>
   Once he gets the offense down, McKnight will take his place
alongside the big three.
</P>
<P>
   ``They brought me in here to help build a good receiver corps,''
McKnight said. ``Along with Michael, Rocket and Ernie, I hope to
get in there and work this thing out.'' EKUBAN, ZELLNER IMPRESS
</P>
<P>
   What was impressive about rookie defensive end Ebenezer Ekuban
(first round) and Peppi Zellner (fourth round) in college has been
in evidence in camp.
</P>
<P>
   Ekuban, a former North Carolina star, was the fastest defensive
lineman at the NFL combine, running the 40-yard dash in 4.7
seconds. Zellner, out of tiny Fort Valley State, was No. 2,
clocking 4.72 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their quickness has showed up,'' Gailey said. ``A lot of
times, it's not obvious on the practice field. But you can see it
with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ekuban is expected to contribute immediately as a third-down
pass rusher. Zellner, who has played a little more than a year of
football since leaving junior college in 1995, is considered a
project. He played only three games in 1996 at Fort Valley, traded
in his football uniform for a basketball jersey in 1997 before
finishing his senior season in football in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   However, his speed could land him on the field earlier than
expected. PRACTICE CHANGE
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have changed the time and location of Saturday
night's practice. Instead of 8-10 p.m. at Memorial Stadium in
Wichita Falls, the team will practice from 6-8 p.m. at Midwestern
State. nn

HERBICIDE POSES RISK TO INFANTS, REPORT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MANSUR and RUTH IGOE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A common weed killer used on 70 million acres
of corn each year poses a serious health risk to bottle-fed
infants, according to a report released Wednesday by a national
environmental group.
</P>
<P>
   ``This product is a serious threat to infants' health,'' said
Jane Houlihan, an author of the report ``Into the Mouths of
Babes.'' ``The government should be taking decisive action on
it....''
</P>
<P>
   The report was issued by the Environmental Working Group, which
has campaigned for years for a national ban of atrazine, a
suspected carcinogen now under review by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
   The maker of atrazine on Wednesday called the report a bogus
attempt to discredit a safe and reliable herbicide.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Into the Mouths of Babes' might better be titled `Out of the
Mouths of Alarmists,' '' said Dave Whitacre, senior vice president
for Novartis Crop Protection Inc., the largest manufacturer of
atrazine.
</P>
<P>
   Whitacre also criticized the Environmental Working Group for
failing to have its report scientifically peer-reviewed, which
would evaluate whether the group's methodology was sound.
</P>
<P>
   Whitacre said current federal safety standards are so strict
that his company thinks a 22-pound toddler could drink 3,000
gallons of water a day for a lifetime without any health risks from
the herbicide.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington-based Environmental Working Group focused on
seven Corn Belt states, including Kansas and Missouri, where each
spring farmers apply atrazine to fields. The chemical shows up in
the drinking water of farm communities or large cities downstream.
Usually, it's found at levels below federal limits.
</P>
<P>
   But even such low levels pose serious health risks for infants _
especially if they're being fed formula made with tap water, the
Environmental Working Group said.
</P>
<P>
   The group based its calculations on EPA and state data on
atrazine levels in public drinking supplies and EPA data on how
much water infants ingest.
</P>
<P>
   The group estimated that in as many as 40 cities across the
Midwest, infants can exceed their legally allowable lifetime cancer
risk from atrazine by their first birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Larger water utilities, such as Kansas City and Johnson County
water departments, spend millions of dollars to remove the chemical
from drinking water. Both systems comply with federal limits.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA released a brief statement on Wednesday, addressing
atrazine but not the new report.
</P>
<P>
   ``EPA, recognizing that there may be special concerns for
children's exposure to atrazine, has been conducting a careful
scientific review in our pesticide protection program. The review
will be completed by next summer,'' according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
   An EPA official said Wednesday that the agency had not reviewed
the Environmental Working Group's scientific method in producing
its estimates for infant exposures to atrazine. It also had yet to
complete its own scientific analysis for infants, the EPA official
said.
</P>
<P>
   In a few days, the EPA is scheduled to meet a new deadline to
consider tightening the limits on a number of pesticides in food
and water, taking into account how infants ingest large quantities
of certain foods and liquids.
</P>
<P>
   State officials said Wednesday that, until the EPA completes its
special review of atrazine, which could result in tighter limits or
even a ban, they can do little but ensure that communities meet
current federal limits.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, for example, 10 Missouri communities failed to meet the
limit of 3 ]parts per billion, which is based on a annual average
of four samples. Each of the last two years, though, only one
community in Missouri has averaged more than the federal limit. In
Kansas, usually one or two communities fail to meet that limit.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental Working Group's president, Ken Cook, questioned
Wednesday whether it's fair for water utilities to have to pay for
chemical-removal costs and pass that cost on to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atrazine should be banned,'' Cook said. ``It shouldn't even be
in the water.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowering the federal limit, Cook's group added, would only make
it more difficult for smaller utilities to comply.
</P>
<P>
   Even in communities that do comply, the environmental group
found in its report, infants are exposed to too much atrazine. When
the government set its current limit, the report found it
underestimated by as much as 15 times a bottle-fed infant's
exposure to atrazine.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the report estimated that a bottle-fed infant in
Kansas City, Kan., can get a lifetime dose of atrazine in about
nine months. And that calculation is based on just 1.3 parts per
billion of atrazine _ not even half the legal limit _ in the water,
the group's Houlihan said.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas City, Kan., water department officials add powdered
activated carbon to the water during treatment, as needed, to keep
atrazine levels low, said Don Gray, the city's assistant manager
for water operations.
</P>
<P>
   This winter, the Board of Public Utilities will open a new $56.5
million treatment plant that will filter out more atrazine than the
old plant, Gray said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to comply with federal regulations, but until there is
more substantial scientific data to substantiate what they claim
(about the dangers low atrazine levels), I don't know,'' Gray said.
``It's a heck of a debate.''

DIRECT MARKETING FIRM CLOSES THREE OFFICES IN KANSAS CITY AREA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDOLPH HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The Signature Group, a direct marketing
company, has closed its three area service centers and laid off
about 470 employees.
</P>
<P>
   The employees, who were let go last week, will receive two
months' pay, said Fanette Singer, a spokeswoman for the Signature
Group in Schaumburg, Ill. The company, however, is not providing
outplacement services for the workers.
</P>
<P>
   The company's three area offices were in Independence and
Grandview in Missouri, and in Kansas City, Kan. The Kansas City,
Kan., office was the biggest local office, with 250 employees.
</P>
<P>
   The Signature Group is a subsidiary of Montgomery Ward &AMP; Co.,
which is emerging from bankruptcy reorganization. GE Capital Inc.
is in the process of acquiring all of Ward's operations.
</P>
<P>
   Singer said the Signature Group was not closing the offices
because of changes being undertaken by GE Capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had to do with technological efficiencies we're gaining,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The company also closed two call centers in Florida last week.
</P>
<P>
   The Signature Group has about $650 million in annual revenue,
with about half its telemarketing and customer-service business
coming from Ward. The company also handles credit card inquiries
for oil companies and banks. General Electric Co. also is an
important client. Orders by mail also are handled by the Signature
Group.
</P>
<P>
   The company has 25 call centers around the country, Singer said.
</P>
<P>
   Call centers have been a growing industry in the Kansas City
area, employing more than 40,000 people. The demand for
customer-service and telemarketing representatives has been high.
That was one reason America West Airlines recently pulled out of
the market _ it was having trouble attracting and keeping workers
at competitive wages.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, GE Capital Retailer Financial Services cut more than
200 customer-service jobs at its call center in Merriam, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   But along with cutbacks, other companies have been building call
centers in the area. For example, H&AMP;R Block Inc. is building a call
center in Kansas City, Mo., that will employ more than 700 people
during peak seasonal periods.

CITY OFFICIALS DELAY ACTION ON TAX BREAKS FOR FARMLAND,
AMERITRADE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK P. COUCH  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The Kansas City Council's Finance and Audit
Committee on Wednesday delayed action on tax-incentive plans for
Farmland Industries Inc. and Ameritrade Holding Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies are asking the city for exemptions on property
taxes and sales taxes to help finance office buildings in the
Northland.
</P>
<P>
   Farmland is seeking tax breaks worth at least $10 million to
help construct the first building on a headquarters campus near
Kansas City International Airport and to finance road improvements
in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Ameritrade, an online discount brokerage based in Omaha, Neb.,
has requested a tax break valued at about $1 million to help buy a
vacant office building. Ameritrade hopes to convert the building
into a data center employing 23 persons.
</P>
<P>
   Both plans seek to use a rarely used tax-incentive tool that is
becoming more popular with city economic-development leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The companies are asking the city to issue bonds and use the
proceeds to buy land and equipment for the companies. The city
would own the land, buildings and equipment and would lease it back
to the companies. The lease payments would retire the bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Because the city would own the land, buildings and equipment,
they would be exempt from sales and property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Platte County Presiding Commissioner Betty Knight asked city
leaders to develop a policy that would boost the role of county,
school and other elected officials in the process of granting such
tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   The bond plans ``use county taxes at the discretion of the
city,'' Knight said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can take taxes meant for schools, developmentally
disabled, mentally ill, libraries and seniors and use them to
attract business for up to 10 to 20 years, and we have no input,''
Knight said. ``That isn't the way we have worked before.''
</P>
<P>
   Knight said that she thought Farmland was an asset for Kansas
City but that she was concerned about a plan that could become a
model for future incentive packages.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a commissioner, I am always careful in making decisions
that I know will have to be made again and again and again,''
Knight said. ``In these development decisions, precedents are
always set and at times come back to haunt you.''
</P>
<P>
   Farmland is asking the city to issue $40 million in bonds to
assist in the farmer-owned cooperative's relocation to land near
the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Farmland is proposing to construct a six-story building that
would house 925 workers.
</P>
<P>
   The building, scheduled to open in February 2001, would include
a cafeteria, credit union branch office, a product test kitchen and
an employee fitness center.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Miller, a lawyer for Farmland, said it was possible, but
unlikely, that the city would become the owner of kitchen forks or
weight-room equipment in the new Farmland building.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bond proceeds are not being used for everything and not
for anything that's getting moved over,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said most of the proceeds from the bonds would be used to
pay for land and the building.
</P>
<P>
   Miller also explained that the city would not face financial
risk because an independent lender would buy the bonds. Farmland
has already found a buyer for the bonds if they are approved by the
city.
</P>
<P>
   ``The primary benefit is the tax exemption,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   The value of the property and sales tax breaks would be $5.03
million, according to the City Planning and Development Department.
</P>
<P>
   Under the incentive package offered by the city, Farmland's new
development would also qualify for a rebate of up to half the
earnings and utilities taxes paid to the city for 20 years. The
value of that benefit, which would be used for road improvements,
would be as much as $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   A second office building is planned for the year 2005. It would
qualify for a similar earnings and utilities tax rebate from the
city if the project is started by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Ameritrade is asking the city to issue up to $44 million in
bonds to buy and equip a vacant office building. The purchase price
is $8.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   David Fenley, a lawyer for Ameritrade, said the value of the
incentive package was $1 million. Ameritrade would qualify for
property- and sales-tax breaks when the city uses the proceeds to
buy the land and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Fenley said the company preferred the Kansas City site but was
considering leasing an office in an unspecified city on the East
Coast.

PARROT'S SQUAWKS IN RUSSIAN, ENGLISH SEAL A HAPPY REUNION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TROY ANDERSON 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Nearly two dozen people, some from the far reaches
of the county, came to the West Valley animal shelter to claim an
exotic African gray parrot that flew its coop in Porter Ranch last
week.
</P>
<P>
   As proof of ownership, they brought receipts, pictures,
veterinary records, theft reports and sad stories.
</P>
<P>
   But only one person could make the parrot talk _ in English and
Russian _ so Wednesday she got to take her Oscar home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you understand?'' the bird squawked in Russian to Irina
Simmons, 33, as she was reunited with her bird.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very happy,'' Simmons said. ``I was pleased to see how
well he was taken care of here. He was totally content. He didn't
seem to miss anything at home where he lives in a wrought-iron cage
with a tree.''
</P>
<P>
   Simmons lost the 5-year-old parrot July 21 when she was talking
with an animal handler about transporting Oscar and her dog to
Texas where she and her husband are moving.
</P>
<P>
   While she and the animal handler were talking, Oscar pushed open
the door to his bird cage and flew away. She searched for him and
put fliers up in her neighborhood, but had no luck.
</P>
<P>
   After a story about the parrot in the Daily News, a parade of
would-be owners came through the West Valley Animal Care and
Control Center in suburban Chatsworth, said Lt. Richard Felosky.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Valley _ with more than 1 million residents, and half of
them wanted the bird. They wore me out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One person from Pomona, more than 30 miles east of downtown, and
a group of five from Malibu were easy to rule out, he said. Felosky
said he wanted to give Oscar to a 90-year-old woman whose gray
parrot was stolen, but then she took one look at Oscar and decided
it wasn't her bird.
</P>
<P>
   When Simmons heard that an African gray parrot was at the
shelter, she showed up to take home her bird. But once there, Oscar
only whistled and wouldn't talk _ not enough to prove ownership.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hysterical,'' she said. ``I called my husband in Texas.
I called the Better Business Bureau. I felt helpless. I found him,
but I couldn't get him. But I was persistent.''
</P>
<P>
   Simmons returned with pictures of Oscar sitting next to her dog
in the dog's water bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``He let me handle him,'' she said. ``He saw it was probably my
bird because Oscar was real cuddly.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Felosky said he needed more proof. He needed Oscar to
speak. And then, as Simmons was leaving, Oscar said, ``Hi, What's
up?'' in English and ``Do you understand?'' in Russian, she said.
</P>
<P>
   That cinched it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long, drawn-out process, but it was worth it,''
Felosky said. ``The owner is ecstatic. She thinks the sun rises and
sets on us because who would have thought anybody cared about her
parrot.''

$35,000 `BLAIR WITCH' COULD WORK BIG BOX OFFICE MAGIC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``The Blair Witch Project'' will be put to the
test this weekend as the ultra-low-budget horror film moves from
art houses to the nation's multiplexes.
</P>
<P>
   The results could be spectacular for the Santa Monica-based
company that is distributing the movie. ``Blair Witch'' has enough
potential as a mainstream hit that a $100 million domestic gross is
not out of the question, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The heat on `Blair Witch' just keeps building,'' said Steven
Rothenberg, executive vice president for domestic distribution of
Artisan Entertainment. ``Our phones have been ringing off the hook
from distributors wanting to book it. Every year, there's one film
like this that comes completely out of the blue.''
</P>
<P>
   The behind-the-scenes story of ``Blair Witch'' is almost as
compelling as the on-screen action. The movie is a mock documentary
that follows three young filmmakers into the wilderness near
Burkittsville, Md., in search of a 200-year-old witch. It was made
in eight days for a grand total of $35,000.
</P>
<P>
   Artisan paid $1 million for the film when it received favorable
buzz at the Sundance Film Festival. That small investment paid off
when ``Blair Witch'' grossed an astounding $5 million in 10 days at
just 31 theaters across the country. The per-theater average last
weekend was a breathtaking $63,812, or five times the average for
box office leader ``The Haunting.''
</P>
<P>
   What that meant was that at the Nuart in West Los Angeles and
the Laemmle Playhouse 7 in Pasadena, many moviegoers were either
turned away or waited for hours to get into packed ``Blair Witch''
screenings. ``It was our plan to make this a hard ticket early
on,'' said Amir Malin, Artisan's president.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's on to 1,100 theaters this weekend, where it'll face two
major openings _ Samuel L. Jackson shark thriller ``Deep Blue
Sea,'' and the Julia Roberts-Richard Gere romantic comedy ``Runaway
Bride'' _ plus another horror film, ``The Haunting,'' which led
last weekend's box office with $33 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our polling shows that 80 percent of moviegoers want to see
this film and we've never ever seen numbers that high before,''
said Robert Bucksbaum, president of the Reel Source forecasting
service. By comparison, ``Runaway Bride'' has a 56 percent
want-to-see rating while ``Deep Blue Sea'' is at 48 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Malin has said ``Blair Witch'' could take in $75
million by the end of its run; Bucksbaum believes that number could
hit $85 million.
</P>
<P>
   Those forecasts carry credibility because of Artisan's decision
two weeks ago to book the film into a pair of megaplexes _ the AMC
Block 30 in Orange and the Mills 24 in Phoenix _ along with 25
art-house theaters. The AMC generated the top three-day gross in
the country at $164,354.
</P>
<P>
   ``By opening in two big commercial megaplexes, we proved to
exhibitors and other distributors that `Blair Witch' had great
commercial viability,'' Rothenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   And other studios flinched at that point, with Warner Bros.
moving the release date of ``Deep Blue Sea'' forward two days _ it
opened Wednesday at 2,854 theaters _ and Universal delaying
``Mystery Men'' for a week until Aug. 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost unheard of for studios to shift dates that close
to an opening,'' Bucksbaum noted. ``It was done to appease theater
owners because they want `Blair Witch.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``Blair Witch'' will clearly be a serious force this weekend
amid what continues to be a sizzling summer. Bucksbaum predicts
``Runaway Bride,'' which Paramount is opening at more than 3,000
theaters, will lead with $20 million while ``Blair Witch'' could
take in $16 million to $18 million and battle for second with
``Deep Blue Sea'' and DreamWorks' second weekend of ``The
Haunting.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry trackers have been impressed by Artisan's bold
promotional campaign, which simply highlights the film's basic
premise _ that the footage was recovered a year after the
filmmakers disappeared. The Web site, blairwitch.com, never admits
the story is fiction and includes a timeline from the witch's
origin to the search for the missing film crew.
</P>
<P>
   ``The marketing on this film has been just tremendous,'' said
Paul Dergarabedian, president of Exhibitor Relations Co. ``There
are no big stars so they've managed to make the hook _ which is
`Did this really happen?' _ work very well for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fact that the films contains no special effects and
intentionally grainy, herky-jerky footage, audiences find ``Blair
Witch'' to be emotionally satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to believe it's true and it's such a unique idea
that it really doesn't matter whether it is,'' Bucksbaum said. ``If
you didn't know it was a hoax, you'd think it was real. And when
people watch it, people are riveted _ more so than they were for
`Independence Day' or `Jurassic Park.'''
</P>
<P>
   Artisan's original plan was to go to about 300 theaters this
weekend but as the buzz over ``Blair Witch'' built, that figure was
revised upward first to 700, then 900 and now 1,100. By next
weekend, Artisan plans to add 500 or 1,000 more theaters.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to have `Blair Witch' in every theater of
importance,'' said Chandler Wood, head film buyer for the Los
Angeles-based Pacific Theatres chain. ``When a movie is this hot,
you find ways to get it into theaters. I don't know how it's going
to do in Middle America, but I think it will do quite well in our
theaters in California.''
</P>
<P>
   For theater owners, that means either reducing the number of
screens for current releases or saying farewell to holdover films
earlier than expected. That's a tricky line to walk for exhibitors
since they need to maintain good relations with the major studios
that supply most of their films.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in the business of getting the money while you can, so
the best thing to do with `Blair Witch' is to get it on as many
screens as you can,'' said Richard Fay, president of AMC Films.
``We're scrambling as we speak to get more screens. Artisan has
created a tremendous want-to-see buzz for this movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Fay noted AMC's pioneering strategy of building megaplexes, with
as many as 30 theaters under one roof, pays off smartly when a film
like ``Blair Witch'' breaks out unexpectedly. ``We're blessed with
a greater number of screens and seats, so it's not really any
difficulty,'' he said. ``We have a lot of flexibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Can ``Blair Witch'' keep up its seemingly unstoppable momentum
once the first wave of screenings are over? ``I think it's on a
roll now,'' Fay said. ``It's beginning to step out beyond
adolescents and young adults. It's a real pleasant surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Blair Witch'' has already surpassed the performance of other
films made for next-to-nothing, such as 1994's ``Clerks'' and last
year's ``Pi,'' and is now poised to join other bargain-basement
blockbusters, such as ``Scream'' (which cost $14 million), ``Pulp
Fiction'' ($8 million) and ``The Full Monty'' ($3 million).
</P>
<P>
   ``Blair Witch'' has also already transformed Artisan into a
serious player following recent releases such as ``Wishmaster'' and
``Black Mask'' that have had only moderate success.

IHOP PROFITS SWEET AS SYRUP

<P>
   GLENDALE, Calif. _ Restaurant operator IHOP Corp.'s second
quarter per-share earnings are expected to rise nearly 16 percent
compared with the like year-ago period.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts surveyed by First Call estimate that the Glendale-based
company _ the owner and franchiser of the International House of
Pancakes chain _ will earn 37 cents per share. The company is
expected to release its statement for the three-month period
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The company earned 32 cents per share in the comparable
three-month period last year.
</P>
<P>
   IHOP has exceeded analysts' expectations the past few quarters
and seems to be on track for continued earnings growth, said Brandy
Shin, a junior analyst with Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co. in New York City,
which projected 37 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they continue to show good growth,'' Shin said.
</P>
<P>
   The estimate is based in part on the company's monthly
same-store sales _ that is, sales at outlets open at least a year.
</P>
<P>
   For example, while same-store sales were down 0.9 percent in
April, they rose 2.3 percent and 2.4 percent in May and June,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, in the first quarter ended March 31, net income
rose about 40 percent to $6.6 million from the prior year's $4.7
million. On a diluted per share basis, the company earned 65 cents,
up about 38 percent from 47 cents.

CHECO IMPRESSIVE FOR DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ OK, maybe there is hope for the season, or for
next season, or for mankind.
</P>
<P>
   If Robinson Checo, who was hit around worse than a
batting-practice pitcher in his previous stint with the Dodgers,
can turn around his game to the point he did Wednesday against
Cincinnati, anything and everything is possible.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the more improbable events of the season, Checo was
sensational while giving up one run in five innings as the Dodgers
beat the Reds 9-1 at Dodger Stadium for their second win in nine
games. Checo left the game with a tweaked groin muscle, but it
wasn't initially considered serious.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Arnold, who has a five-game suspension in the appeal
process, pitched the last four innings for his first major-league
save.
</P>
<P>
   Before Checo (1-0) was promoted from Triple-A Albuquerque to
make his first Dodgers start, manager Davey Johnson joked about
whether his name was Checo Robinson or Robinson Checo.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't around long enough for me to find out,'' Johnson
said jokingly.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, well, now Mr. Checo will do just fine. This game was so
out of the norm, the Dodgers' Raul Mondesi walked a career-high
three times.
</P>
<P>
   The original plan was to pitch Checo against the Reds, skip him
in the rotation next time around and then make a determination of
what to do the next time a fifth starter was needed.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Checo, who replaced lefty Carlos Perez, all but insured
another start with the Dodgers. And not only did he pitch
splendidly, he also had his first major-league hit. It scored two
in the Dodgers' four-run third as they built a 6-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Former Dodgers lefty Dennys Reyes, making his first start of the
season after making 41 appearances in relief, lasted but 22/3
innings. Reyes (2-2), involved in the Jeff Shaw-Paul Konerko trade,
gave up six runs on five hits and walked five.
</P>
<P>
   Those were the numbers some thought Checo would have, given the
way his other Dodger Stadium appearances went.
</P>
<P>
   After being one of three minor-leaguers acquired in the
salary-dumping Dave Mlicki trade with Detroit, Checo was hit hard
in two outings. He allowed five runs on eight hits in 31/3 relief
innings in his Dodgers debut and then allowed two runs in one-third
of an inning.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Johnson said Checo's fastball wasn't as lively as the
reports he had heard. The 26-year-old right-hander from the
Dominican Republic, once a coveted pitching prospect in Japan, was
sent to Albuquerque with a 17.18 ERA and was supposed to never be
heard from again.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had the same initial reaction I did when he went down,''
Johnson said. ``They worked with him and he's been pitching
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, funny thing. Checo was placed in Albuquerque's starting
rotation, his mechanics were ironed out and his velocity increased
to the mid-90 mph range.
</P>
<P>
   He was still erratic, but that changed lately. In his last two
starts, Checo went 2-0 with a 2.84 ERA and earned the nod to take
Perez's spot. It was Checo's third major-league start and eighth
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Checo, whose only other major-league win came in 1997 when
pitching with the Boston Red Sox, allowed three hits, walked four
and struck out four while lowering his ERA to 8.31. He was also
helped by an early lead as the Dodgers scored on Gary Sheffield's
ground ball out in the first and Angel Pena's sacrifice fly in the
second.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds made it 2-1 in the third when Dmitri Young doubled to
score Mike Cameron.
</P>
<P>
   But Sheffield homered to start the four-run rally in the third.
It was his 18th homer. Eric Karros then doubled, Devon White had an
RBI single and three batters later, Checo stroked his first career
hit to score two runs and give the Dodgers a 6-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Grudzielanek added a fifth-inning two-run homer to make it
8-1.

and now we're the team that people are seeking to help them out,''
right fielder Jay Buhner said Wednesday after first baseman David
Segui was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a good situation to be in. We did it to ourselves. As
a team, you control your own destiny, and this year we're
struggling as a team. It's certainly not over yet ... but we've got
a hell of a challenge ahead of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Two days after trading outfielder Butch Huskey to the Boston Red
Sox for one minor league pitcher, the Mariners sent Segui to
Toronto for two. Right-hander Tom Davey and left-hander Steve
Sinclair, who both had been pitching for Class AAA Syracuse, will
join the Mariners bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Woody Woodward said more moves may be coming before Saturday's
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward, M's vice president of baseball operations, said
Wednesday's deal accomplished his goal of getting players who can
help both now and in the future. He is hoping Davey and Sinclair
can match the success of Freddy Garcia and John Halama, the
pitchers acquired from the Houston Astros last July when ace Randy
Johnson was dealt.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward said he had no concerns about making two trades this
week with the teams leading the wild-card race, Boston and Toronto.
He said there was ``limited interest'' in Segui, and Toronto made
the best proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``These aren't pitchers in A-ball, they are pitchers in triple-A
and they've both had a little taste of the big leagues,'' Woodward
said. ``They can come in and help us win. If we have success with
these kids as we did with Garcia and Halama, then they can help us
immediately and certainly for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   ``And plus, we were not going to be able to sign Segui. We made
an offer to him at the beginning of the season that was a very good
offer, and that wasn't going to work out. Instead of just losing
David Segui, we were able to get some pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   Segui is in the final year of a two-year, $4.75 million
contract. He hired a new agent, Scott Boras, over the winter, and
the Mariners offered an extension for three years and close to $18
million during spring training.
</P>
<P>
   Based on deals for other first basemen, such as Kevin Young of
the Pittsburgh Pirates, who is on a four-year, $24 million
contract, Boras and Segui were seeking a four-year commitment.
Boras said he called Woodward a few weeks ago, thinking Segui's
success this season might have shown the M's he would be a wise
investment for a fourth year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said we were interested in moving this thing along,'' Boras
said. ``The difference was really just the term of years. We were
not eons apart on the dollar issue. Frankly we were within the
ballpark of one another. The issue was really a three-year or a
four-year deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Segui, who packed quickly, said goodbye to teammates and
declined to speak to reporters, was batting .293 with nine homers,
39 runs batted in and just three errors this season. Blue Jays
manager Jim Fregosi said he planned to use Segui at first base,
left field and designated hitter. But if Segui ends up solely at
first base, as expected, Carlos Delgado will become the team's
full-time DH.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to have a chance to play for a team who perhaps can
compete in the World Series this year, and that's what I told
him,'' said Mariners shortstop Alex Rodriguez, a close friend of
Segui's. ``He's going to be a great asset for that team and
solidify their infield immensely.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez was asked if the trade signified anything about how
Mariners management views the direction of the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's pretty self-explanatory,'' Rodriguez said. ``All I have
to do is go out and do my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Was it unexpected?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anything is unexpected around here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Can this team get back in the division or wild-card race?
</P>
<P>
   ``Time will tell,'' Rodriguez said. ``We're responsible for our
own play. Time is of the essence, and we're running out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Rodriguez, center fielder Ken Griffey Jr. has long stressed
the importance of this season, which now could be slipping away.
Griffey mocked the Segui trade after first hearing of it, and later
spent at least a half-hour in private conversation with manager Lou
Piniella. The topic of that conversation was not known, but when
asked his opinion of the trade, Griffey refused comment.
</P>
<P>
   Designated hitter Edgar Martinez said he was sorry to see Segui
go.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a good time of the year, especially when some teams
are looking for players to improve their teams,'' Martinez said.
``It's sad to see Segui go after we know what he brings to the
team. He's a great defensive player and good hitter, and it's sad
to see him go.''
</P>
<P>
   After his own meeting with Piniella, Buhner said he understood
the move.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way things are going, I don't want to be singling out and
pointing fingers at the bullpen, because we're a team and we win
and lose as a team,'' he said. ``But at the same time, too, I think
everybody understands that our bullpen has been a little erratic. I
mean, we've got a (6.54) ERA in our bullpen. So I think it can
certainly help us, no doubt about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Losing Butch and David is tough to replace, no doubt. They
both did an awesome job for us. But we got some help that we
desperately needed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners will use Raul Ibanez and Buhner at first base, with
John Mabry another option. On days when Buhner plays first and the
M's face a left-hander, Piniella said, Ozzie Timmons can play right
field. Shane Monahan will be promoted from Class AAA Tacoma
Thursday to take Segui's roster spot, and more moves will be made
if Sinclair arrives Thursday, as expected, and when Davey joins the
team in Seattle Friday.
</P>
<P>
   One American League scout described the 25-year-old Davey as an
above-average prospect with a ``plus fastball'' in the 94-96 mph
range. Sinclair, the scout said, is a ``fringe prospect'' but has a
chance to be successful if he locates his 88-89 mph fastball
effectively.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-7 Davey was 1-1 with a 4.70 ERA in 29 games for the
Blue Jays this year. He had been considered a potential closer, but
the emergence of Billy Koch in that role and Toronto's abundance of
right-handed set-up men made Davey expendable. He faced the
Mariners twice in May, earning a save by throwing 31/3 scoreless
innings on May 1 but getting hit hard two days later.
</P>
<P>
   ``He throws the crap out of the ball,'' Buhner said. ``He's a
big, huge kid, throws a super sinker and throws the ball real
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinclair, who turns 28 next week and is a native of Victoria,
B.C., pitched in 24 games for Toronto last year, going 0-2 with a
3.60 ERA. He pitched in three games for Toronto this year but
otherwise has been the closer at Syracuse, where he had a 2-2
record, a 2.06 ERA and 18 saves.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last few days we've gotten three good, young arms,''
Piniella said. ``We're starting to stockpile some arms. I don't
know if we're done or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodward said he is talking with two or three clubs, and still
believes there is a ``50/50'' chance of making another move. The
Mariners had a scout watching Andy Pettitte of the New York Yankees
in Chicago last night, and free agent-to-be Jeff Fassero still
could interest New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners did clear about $1.3 million off their payroll by
trading Huskey and Segui, which would make it easier to acquire a
veteran.

YOUNG IS SAFE ON DL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Dodgers second baseman Eric Young won't be traded
before Saturday's non-waiver trading deadline. By baseball rules he
can't be, because he was put on the 15-day disabled list before
Wednesday's game against Cincinnati after an MRI showed
inflammation in his left ankle.
</P>
<P>
   However, it doesn't rule out the possibility that the
32-year-old second baseman will be traded later. Young could clear
waivers and be traded before the season ends, and with $9 million
and two years remaining on his contract, that shouldn't be a
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was traded here Aug. 18,'' Young said. ``Anything can
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The future will take care of itself. The past week, though,
revealed an ugly situation. Young wanted to go on the disabled
list, but Dodgers management didn't want to place him there because
it would rule out an early trade.
</P>
<P>
   It's the outcome Young wanted, but the means at which it arrived
obviously hurt Young.
</P>
<P>
   The situation was further aggravated when Young lost his
starting spot at second base on Friday. Young said he's been
playing hurt and was bothered by a sore hamstring, calf and ankle
at various points of the season. He said it's a reason his average
is .263 and he has stolen just 16 bases in the last three months.
</P>
<P>
   There were also clubhouse rumblings that management lost faith
in Young.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lesson to be learned from this,'' Young said.
``Look at it and respond positive about it. . . . I'm human. I know
I give it my all every time I step on the field. You can't ever
question whether I'm going to go out and give 100 percent. I take a
lot of pride in my work.''
</P>
<P>
   Lefty reliever Jeff Kubenka was recalled from Triple-A
Albuquerque to fill Young's spot. Kubenka is 0-1 this season with
the Dodgers. He was 4-4 with seven saves and a 2.91 ERA at Triple-A
Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   Perez promises return: Demoted $15.5 million pitcher Carlos
Perez worked out Wednesday afternoon before packing his bags and
heading to Albuquerque, where he'll start Tuesday. He also vowed to
return after a few weeks and live up to his end of the exorbitant
three-year deal he signed during the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to get my stuff back and get back into the starting
rotation,'' said Perez, who was optioned to the minors after
Tuesday's game. ``I'm not going to go home and put my head down. I
look around and see a lot of good pitchers struggling.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez is 2-10 with a 7.43 ERA. He hasn't pitched in the minor
leagues since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them I could do the job in the bullpen, but it's the
decision of the manager and general manager,'' Perez said. ``I know
for sure I'm going to be (back) here soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Cromer returns home: Dodgers utility infielder Tripp Cromer, who
was on a rehab assignment with Albuquerque, returned to Los Angeles
on Tuesday to undergo more tests on his heart. Cromer is being
examined by Dodgers team physician Dr. Michael Mellman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just having some more tests done,'' Cromer said. ``I'll be
back playing soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Cromer left the Dodgers on July 6 with an irregular heartbeat.
He was cleared to play July 19 and began a rehab stint with
Albuquerque, where he batted .267 in four games.

QUALIFIER SEKULOV SHOWS QUALITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH HAMMOND  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ James Sekulov thought he needed a brief vacation,
a week away from tennis to keep his confidence from diminishing
even further.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hadn't been playing well in the past couple weeks, so I was
just going to spend the week in Montreal and visit with some
friends before the next tournament,'' said Sekulov, who had lost
his last three matches. ``But my roommate said that I should come
to L.A. because it is a fun place to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Sekulov went beyond merely having fun on Wednesday, when he won
the biggest match of his five-year professional career. Sekulov, an
Australian who is ranked 236th, upset fifth-seeded Thomas Enqvist,
6-7 (1-7), 6-4, 6-3, in the second round of the Mercedes-Benz Cup
at UCLA's Los Angeles Tennis Center.
</P>
<P>
   After winning two matches in three days over the weekend to
enter the main draw as a qualifier, Sekulov beat Martin Damm in the
first round and took advantage of the inconsistent baseline play of
Enqvist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just getting through qualifying gave me a big confidence
boost,'' Sekulov said. ``Obviously, Enqvist wasn't playing as well
as he could. He was spraying a few forehands around, but with the
way I had been playing, I'm very happy to be where I am.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mercedes-Benz Cup is the first ATP Tour event this year for
Sekulov, 22, a regular on the Challenger series. He qualified for
last year's U.S. Open but lost to 50th-ranked Davide Sanguinetti in
the first round, and his previous biggest tournament victory came
against 149th-ranked Luis Herrera in a Challenger event in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Sekulov plays in the shadow of some of his more successful
countrymen, including top-ranked Patrick Rafter, 18-year-old rising
star Lleyton Hewitt and doubles star Mark Woodforde. He is winless
in six career ATP tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can get frustrating, especially when I'm so far away from
home,'' Sekulov said. ``Not many guys can do what (Hewitt) is
doing. A lot of Australians mature later, like Wayne Arthurs, who
didn't start playing well until he reached his late 20s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to keep playing as long as it's still fun for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Who's the winner? After their second-round match, eighth-seeded
Wayne Ferreira and Justin Gimelstob seemed to stage another
contest, to see who could sound more downtrodden in postmatch
interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``I almost feel guilty about winning,'' Ferreira said. ``I was
hitting the ball OK and hitting some winners, but I just don't have
any motivation out there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who makes the last shot deserves to win. He gets to
play another match, I don't,'' Gimelstob said.
</P>
<P>
   Gimelstob's frustration is easier to understand. The former UCLA
star won the first set and had match point at 5-4 in the second,
but Ferreira rallied to win nine of the last 11 sets and the match.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty obvious that I played some terrible shots out
there,'' Gimelstob said. ``He's a great athlete and you can't do
that against him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferreira doesn't hold himself in such high regard these days.
Ranked 38th in the world, the 27-year-old South African has failed
to advance to the quarterfinals of a tournament since April and was
a first-round loser at Wimbledon last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a pretty ordinary time on the court for the past
three years or so, because of injuries and such,'' Ferreira said.
``I tried to play through some things when I maybe just should have
stopped playing, and now I find it difficult to get up for every
single match.''

MARINER FRUSTRATIONS MOUNT AGAINST ROYALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ He has been the Mariners' survivor, lasting
through spring training and through the trades of Matt Mieske,
Butch Huskey and now David Segui _ all of whom played one of this
survivor's positions with the M's and now play them for contenders.
</P>
<P>
   When Segui was dealt to the Toronto Blue Jays for two minor
league relievers Wednesday, Raul Ibanez got his first start of the
year at first base in the Mariners' game against the Kansas City
Royals. He responded with a two-run homer in his first at-bat, a
Segui-like scoop of a throw in the second inning and a Segui-like
bat-slam after a pop out in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the Mariners, the last action was the most
telling.
</P>
<P>
   It was another frustrating night for the M's, who fell to the
Royals, 5-3, before 17,476 at Kauffman Stadium. The loss was the
Mariners' fourth in five games on this road trip, and their 13th in
18 games since July 6.
</P>
<P>
   They failed to gain ground on the Texas Rangers, who lost to
snap a nine-game winning streak and remain 12 games ahead of
Seattle in the American League West. The M's now trail the
Huskey-led Boston Red Sox in the wild card race by 7{ games.
</P>
<P>
   Ibanez's second-inning home run gave the Mariners a 2-0 lead,
and a solo homer by Jay Buhner the next inning increased Seattle's
lead to 3-0. But while the Mariners failed to convert with men in
scoring position the rest of the way, the Royals scraped together
five runs off Freddy Garcia to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't hit with men on base in a long time,'' said
Mariners manager Lou Piniella, whose team stranded 12 runners in
Tuesday's loss and eight Wednesday night. ``We need to get that
component working. ... You get runners on, you've got to get them
in.''
</P>
<P>
   The M's had the bases loaded with one out in the first, but a
strikeout by Buhner and groundout by Russ Davis ended that threat.
A popout by Brian Hunter with a runner on second ended the fourth.
Ibanez's popout and a fielder's choice grounder by Dan Wilson ended
the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Buhner and Davis singled with one out, and David Bell rifled a
liner to right field. But Jermaine Dye made a rolling catch and
threw to second to double off Buhner.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a nice play,'' Piniella said. ``(But) we've made two
baserunning mistakes in the last couple of days late in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia (10-6) held the Royals scoreless through three innings
but surrendered a pair of two-out runs in the fourth and then
surrendered the lead in the fifth when Chad Kreuter led off with a
homer and Carlos Beltran hit a two-run shot with two outs.
Beltran's homer came after a walk to Carlos Febles.
</P>
<P>
   ``(On) 3-2 to Febles, I thought it was a strike, but they didn't
give it to me,'' said Garcia. ``The 1-1 to Beltran was a changeup
up (in the strike zone). I was supposed to throw it away and down,
but when you throw it in the middle, they kill it.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Ibanez, he went hitless after the homer. But his average
stands at .300, and Piniella expects to use him more at first base
with Segui gone. The 27-year-old is in his eighth season in the
Mariners organization, and there should be plenty more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always encouraging when you feel like you're wanted
somewhere,'' Ibanez said. ``I grew up with this organization, and I
like it here. But I'll feel happy at the end of the year if we win
a lot of ballgames and I can contribute. That'll make me happy.''

CHANG DUSTING HIMSELF OFF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH HAMMOND  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Michael Chang, close to being the subject in the
dreaded ``Whatever happened to...'' question, is trying to
recapture the spark that once made him one of the world's top
tennis players.
</P>
<P>
   At 27, Chang is searching for something positive to build upon
after injuries forced him to miss last month's grasscourt season
and dropped him to No.70 in the world, and he might have found it
in this week's Mercedes-Benz Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a while since I've been past the second round of a
tournament, so this feels pretty good,'' Chang said after a 6-4,
6-2 victory over Guillaume Raoux on Wednesday at the Los Angeles
Tennis Center.
</P>
<P>
   One more victory would put Chang, the 1996 champion, in the
semifinals of an ATP tournament for the first time this year.
Waiting for him there would likely be Pete Sampras, who earned a
7-6 (7-5), 6-3 second-round victory over Sebastien Lareau, but
Chang is content to take baby steps right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like this is a good start,'' said Chang, who won the
1989 French Open at age 17. ``It's going to take a while to get my
confidence back. One of the biggest things is just believing in
what I can do out there, and feeling that I am capable of hitting
any shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Chang, hampered throughout 1998 by knee and wrist injuries,
finished the year ranked No.29. He reached the round of 16 at the
Australian Open in January, but back spasms forced him to miss the
past two months.
</P>
<P>
   Playing his first ATP tournament since May, Chang lost only four
games in a first-round victory over Wayne Black on Tuesday, and
showed good mobility against Raoux, a Mercedes semifinalist for the
past two years.
</P>
<P>
   Chang broke serve in the first game and held for a 6-4 first-set
victory. Raoux held four game points in the 10th game, but killed
each chance by leaving lob attempts in the net.
</P>
<P>
   In the quarterfinals, Chang will face Australian qualifier James
Sekulov, who provided the biggest upset of the day by beating
fifth-seeded Thomas Enqvist of Sweden, 6-7 (1-7), 6-4, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when I lost the first set, I thought there was still a
chance,'' Sekulov said. ``If he would have won 6-1 or something, I
probably wouldn't have had as much hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Against Sampras on Wednesday night, Sebastien Lareau had a great
deal of hope in the first set. Lareau handled Sampras' big serve
well and had a chance to serve for the set at 6-5, but Sampras
broke back and eventually won in the tiebreaker. ``Coming back in
that first set was big for me, because I was already thinking about
having to regroup for the second set,'' Sampras said. Lareau broke
Sampras twice in the first set, but Sampras held his first two
serves in the second set and broke to go up 3-2. The players would
hold serve until Sampras broke Lareau to win the match with a
cross-court forehand volley that Lareau could not reach. ``He
really made me work out there,'' Sampras said. ``I've played him
three times now, and I think each time he gets a better look at my
serve. At times he was picking it up pretty easy. The players most
recently met at Wimbledon, where Sampras beat Lareau in the second
round. Sampras will take on eighth-seeded Wayne Ferreira of South
Africa, who beat Justin Gimelstob, 5-7, 7-5, 6-2. Ferreira has
beaten Sampras in their last four meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Gimelstob, a former UCLA star who reached the Mercedes
semifinals last year, had Ferreira at match point in the second
set, but was broken and never recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was pretty obvious that the momentum switched right
there,'' Gimelstob said. ``It hurts more because I wanted a chance
to do well here.''

DENVER _ The Astros continued their climb up the mountain Wednesday
night. Meanwhile, somewhere beneath the avalanche lie the Colorado
Rockies.
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the third straight game, Colorado pitching caved in as the
Astros took turns hitting everything in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Bagwell hit his second career grand slam and the Astros
produced their highest hit total in 23 years in a 16-8 rout at
Coors Field. With their sixth straight victory, the Astros moved 22
games above .500 (62-40) for the first time this season.
</P>
<P>
   And with Cincinnati's 9-1 loss to Los Angeles, the Astros' lead
in the National League Central grew to 3{ games.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros will seek to complete a rare four-game sweep at Coors
Field this afternoon. Before this week, the Astros were 6-23
all-time in Denver. Meanwhile, the Rockies continued to nose-dive,
losing their sixth straight to fall a season-worst 13 games below
.500.
</P>
<P>
   The 21 hits by the Astros were their most since they got 22
against Montreal on July 18, 1976.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point, you start to feel for the other team,'' manager
Larry Dierker said. ``I've never seen both teams score in five
consecutive innings. You almost feel like you don't have enough
runs, but at the same time you feel like, `Don't rub it in.'''
</P>
<P>
   The two teams combined for 18 runs and 30 hits _ from the fourth
inning on.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Hampton earned his 14th victory, tying St. Louis' Kent
Bottenfield, Philadelphia's Curt Schilling and Astros teammate Jose
Lima for the NL lead. Hampton also had a career-high three hits,
including a club-record-tying third triple of the season.
</P>
<P>
   After being held scoreless for three innings, the Astros erupted
for five runs in the fourth, two in the fifth, two in the sixth,
four in the seventh, two in the eighth and one in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Bell went 4-for-6 with two RBIs. Tony Eusebio had three
hits. Glen Barker, Craig Biggio and Bagwell each had two hits. In
three games against the Rockies, the Astros have pounded out 30
runs and 50 hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our offense is starting to come around, and everybody is
starting to feel comfortable at the plate,'' Bell said. ``It's
scary. It's fun to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton (14-3) won his fifth straight decision, allowing five
runs and 13 hits over seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of those nights when we needed some offense and we
got it,'' said Hampton, whose .824 winning percentage is second in
the majors behind Boston's Pedro Martinez (15-3, .833). ``We're
playing well, and everything is working.''
</P>
<P>
   Believe it or not, Colorado held a 1-0 lead in the third inning.
It lasted about 10 minutes until the Astros broke through in the
fourth with five runs _ all coming with two outs.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hidalgo drew a walk, and the Astros followed with five
straight hits off Rockies starter Roberto Ramirez (1-3).
</P>
<P>
   After a single to right by Matt Mieske, Bell followed with his
first of four singles to tie the game 1-1. Eusebio followed with a
broken-bat RBI single to center, Tim Bogar hit a shot past third
baseman Vinny Castilla, and Hampton added a two-run triple for a
5-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton became the first pitcher to collect three triples in a
season since Bob Forsch of St. Louis did it in 1975. The three
triples tied a club record set by Dave Roberts in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit it in the right spot,'' Hampton said. ``One good thing
is I have pretty good speed, so I'm going to go for more triples
than a lot of pitchers would.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Ramirez could retire the side in the fourth, Rockies
manager Jim Leyland had seen enough. Ramirez was gone, but the
relievers who followed allowed 11 additional runs.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros got two in the fifth on Barker's RBI double and a
sacrifice fly by Bogar. In the sixth, the Astros sent eight batters
to the plate, tacking on a pair on RBI singles by Barker and Bell
to increase the lead to 9-2.
</P>
<P>
   Barker has three RBIs in his career _ all in the last two days.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado pulled within 9-4 in the sixth on RBI singles by Jeff
Barry and Terry Shumpert, but the Astros loaded the bases off
reliever Mike Porzio in the seventh and Bagwell cleared them with
his second career grand slam.
</P>
<P>
   It was his 33rd homer, and the Astros' fourth slam of the season
and second in six days.
</P>
<P>
   Daryle Ward hit his first major-league home run, a solo shot in
the eighth, and Russ Johnson followed with one of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen of Colorado's 18 hits were singles, two shy of the club
record. The Rockies scored seven runs off Hampton and two relievers
in the final five innings.

HUSKEY GIVES RED SOX A BOOST 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-BLUE JAYS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Pat Rapp, the Red Sox starter of last resort, and
Butch Huskey, an added starter only two nights ago, made for the
unlikely combination that propelled the Red Sox ahead of the
Toronto Blue Jays again in the wild-card competition with a
stunning 8-0 shutout Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night, completing a two-game sweep
of their Canadian cousins.
</P>
<P>
   Rapp, who has watched while the Red Sox auditioned such untested
rookies as Jin Ho Cho and Tomokazu Ohka ahead of him in the
rotation, allowed just two singles in eight innings and retired the
last 17 batters he faced as the Red Sox won for the eighth time in
nine meetings against Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just stayed ready for every hitter every time,'' Rapp said.
``I didn't even have to turn around to see who it was. I could tell
by the music they were playing who was at bat. Some of it was even
pretty good. The music they play for Jose Cruz, that's what they
play for those wrestlers (New Age Outlaws). And the `woo-hoo,' that
was Shawn Green.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they were going back to the dugout left and right, and the
ballpark played big tonight. The flyballs they hit stayed here.''
</P>
<P>
   The same could not be said for the long flies hit by Huskey.
Serving as DH in a role that would have been filled by Mike Stanley
before his arrival, Huskey borrowed a bat from catcher Jason
Varitek to hit a grand slam off Blue Jays starter Joey Hamilton
that broke a scoreless tie in the sixth inning. He then hit another
home run, his 17th, off John Frascatore leading off the ninth, when
the Sox scored four more runs.
</P>
<P>
   How much help can the Red Sox expect from Huskey, who had three
hits in his Sox debut in Tuesday night's 11-9 win over the Jays?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll put it to you this way, he's helped us so far,'' said
John Valentin, who added a two-run home run in the ninth after
rookie Donnie Sadler, the new starting second baseman, singled and
scored from first on Trot Nixon's double.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is, whenever you get a new acquisition,'' Valentin
said, ``he's definitely going to come over and try to do what he
can to help the team. He's a big guy, so whenever he hits the ball,
it's going to go somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much is he going to help us? It's just wait and see. He's
hit the ball well in these two games, but we've got a long two
months ahead of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Rapp walked just one batter and allowed only one Blue Jay base
runner to advance as far as second base. That was in the third
inning, the only inning in which Toronto had as many as two
runners.
</P>
<P>
   Rapp had made 10 relief appearances since his last start, June
22 in Baltimore, in which he came away with a no-decision in a 5-3
loss to the Orioles. A winner of just two games all season before
Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night, Rapp was resigned to remaining in the bullpen
until Ohka and Cho both flamed out in their auditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty much,'' he said. ``Watching guy after guy after guy
come in and get a start, and I'd been a starter all my career, I
just decided, `Do your job, do your job in the bullpen, and help
this team win any way you can.' But it's been hard, because I
haven't been in too many games that we've won.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays had come into this series winners of nine of their
previous 10 games and with a 1 1/2-game advantage over the Sox, who
hadn't won consecutive games since July 4-5 but have now won the
first two games in which Huskey has put on a Red Sox uniform.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays blew a 7-3 lead in the series opener, won by the
Sox, 11-9, then came away unimpressed by Rapp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't put guys down,'' said Toronto cleanup man Carlos
Delgado, who was 0 for 7 in the series and had his best chance for
a hit taken away by a terrific diving catch by Sadler in the
seventh inning Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night, ``but (Rapp) had a career night.
He's an average pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give him credit for tonight, but he's no Cy Young.''
</P>
<P>
   Rapp gave up a two-out infield hit in the first to Shawn Green,
who tied a club record by extending his hitting streak to 26 games,
and a single to Homer Bush with one out in the third. He walked the
next batter, Shannon Stewart, but retired Willie Greene on a fly
ball and Green on a foul pop to Varitek to end the inning, and did
not allow another baserunner thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   If it were up to Rapp, Green's hitting streak should have ended
Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night. Garciaparra gloved the ball in the hole, but his
throw arrived on one hop to first baseman Brian Daubach, who
couldn't handle the bounce.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, they only had one hit today,'' Rapp said. ``The
hometown scoreboard gave them the other. If the throw is in the
air, he's out. But it bounced, the play looked close on the replay,
so they gave him a base hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they looked to me to throw him the ball, I felt like
throwing it 10 rows into the upper deck. But it's his town.''
</P>
<P>
   The game, however, belonged to Rapp. Asked if he expected to
draw another start Monday against the Indians, he shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' he said. ``I plan on starting Monday, but
you'd better ask somebody else.''

RED SOX LOSES GORDON FOR YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-GORDON-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe

<P>
   TORONTO _ The Red Sox reclaimed their hold on a wild-card spot
from the Toronto Blue Jays Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night, but that became
secondary to three major developments, all of which figure to have
a major impact on whether the Sox will be returning to the playoffs
in October.
</P>
<P>
   --Closer Tom Gordon said he was told by orthopedist James
Andrews that he probably will require season-ending surgery to
repair a torn ulnar collateral ligament in his right elbow. That
news, which came after Andrews reviewed films of Gordon's last
magnetic resonance imaging, taken two weeks ago, erased the faint
hopes that the pitcher would return for the stretch drive this
season while raising fears he may not be back for a full year if he
undergoes Tommy John tendon transfer surgery, as expected. It also
provoked clubhouse grumbling about the quality of team medical
care, with Nomar Garciaparra the most vocal critic.
</P>
<P>
   --Staff ace Pedro Martinez, who has missed two starts,
pronounced himself ready to return to the starting rotation as soon
as next Tuesday, the first day he is eligible to come off the
15-day disabled list. Martinez is scheduled to see Dr. Arthur
Pappas Friday in Boston before getting the green light to face the
Cleveland Indians in Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter if I see him or not, I'm pitching Tuesday,''
said Martinez, who had made 172 consecutive starts until he
strained the muscles in the back of the rotator cuff in his right
shoulder. ``That's how good I feel.''
</P>
<P>
   --All-Star second baseman Jose Offerman, who already had been
kept out of the team's previous two games, said he was told
Wednesday by manager Jimy Williams that he is being benched
indefinitely because of his defense, with rookie Donnie Sadler
becoming the second baseman until further notice. Offerman, signed
to a four-year, $26 million contract last December, was shocked by
the decision, as was his closest friend on the team, Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   ``They pay me too much money to be on the bench,'' Offerman
said. ``I don't want to be in this situation, that's for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, who said he was called by the Alabama-based Andrews
Wednesday afternoon, informed Williams he was flying back to Boston
ahead of the team Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night and hoped to see Andrews
Thursday. The possibility remained, he said, that because Andrews
was leaving Friday on vacation, he would have to wait until next
week to see him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way Dr. Andrews talked to me today, there's a pretty good
chance I will have surgery,'' said Gordon, still miffed that the
doctor he'd consulted for a second opinion had to wait so long for
the results of his tests. ``I wish I had known this a couple of
weeks ago. I wish this had been taken more seriously, and didn't
take so long to get out.
</P>
<P>
   ``He read (the MRI) today and said he didn't like what he saw. I
told him that Dr. Pappas said he saw scar tissue. He said, `From
what I saw, the tear is still there.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon said Andrews, who performed Tommy John tendon transfer
surgery on Red Sox reliever Rheal Cormier two years ago, said the
Sox reliever was displaying similar symptoms. Cormier underwent the
tendon transfer surgery on May 21, 1997, and did not return to the
big leagues until this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Dr. Andrews) said that after five or six weeks (of rest and
anti-inflammatory medication) I should feel better,'' Gordon said.
``I do feel better, but there's still the ache and discomfort.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon's elbow problems first surfaced in spring training in
February, though pitching coach Joe Kerrigan said Wednesday Gordon
told him Tuesday night he may have first hurt the elbow last
November while pitching for a team of major-league stars in an
exhibition series in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me he felt juiced up in the first two games of the
Japan series and by his own admission probably overthrew,''
Kerrigan said.
</P>
<P>
   On April 18, he went on the disabled list for the first time
with what was described as a strained elbow flexor, returned May
10, then made 13 appearances before being placed on the DL a second
time June 11, this time for what was described as an inflammation
of the ulnar nerve and a slight tear of the ligament.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon had a second MRI July 15 and resumed a throwing program,
but reported continued discomfort even as Pappas told him it
appeared, from the buildup of scar tissue, that the ligament was
healing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had taken care of this in spring training, where would I
be?'' said Gordon, who was still throwing as recently as last
Sunday. ``He (Andrews) told me that I was taking a risk of totally
blowing it (if he continued to throw).''
</P>
<P>
   In Tommy John tendon transfer surgery, named after the former
big-league pitcher who underwent the procedure pioneered by Dr.
Frank Jobe, a tendon is taken from the opposite wrist and attached
to the torn ligament. It usually takes a player at least a full
year before he returns.
</P>
<P>
   Pappas has said that if Gordon needed surgery, it would be the
Tommy John procedure. Gordon said he wouldn't know for sure until
he saw Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   As Gordon circulated through the Sox clubhouse, informing
teammates of his situation, Garciaparra, sitting in front of his
locker, loudly belittled the time it took to determine that Gordon
probably needed surgery. ``Our doctors are killing us,''
Garciaparra said to teammates. ``This is just like the bone
bruise.''
</P>
<P>
   That was a reference to the original diagnosis made last year of
Lou Merloni's leg injury, which later was found to be a stress
fracture.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters were within earshot in the clubhouse while Garciaparra
made his comments. They were following manager Williams out onto
the field in the middle of the clubhouse when Garciaparra, noticing
that Williams was limping slightly, said: ``What did you hurt,
Jimy? I'll tell you who not to go and see.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra was asked afterward how upset he was. ``I really
have nothing to say about the whole situation,'' he said. ``I'm not
going to say anything. It ain't worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, meanwhile, was in considerably better spirits after
testing his shoulder playing long toss. ``I'm very happy,'' he
said, giving a thumbs-up sign. ``It's excellent. I'm going to throw
on the side, and on Tuesday I'll be on the mound to pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez hasn't pitched since July 18, when he gave up nine runs
(seven earned) in just 3 2/3 innings against the Florida Marlins,
the worst outing of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Kerrigan said Martinez long-tossed from 250 feet for about eight
minutes, then pitched for three minutes from a flat surface. ``He
showed a real healthy arm today,'' Kerrigan said. ``His ball was
alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll see the doctor on Friday, and if all goes according to
what the doctor tells us to do, he'll probably pitch on Tuesday. It
all depends on what the doctor says Friday.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez said the doctor can't tell him anything he doesn't
already know. ``I know my body really well,'' Martinez said, ``and
I'm telling you right now, I'm ready to pitch. I'll give you my
paycheck back, give me my outing.''
</P>
<P>
   On the opposite side of the clubhouse from where Martinez sat,
Offerman told reporters of his pregame meeting with Williams, one
in which he came away convinced that he was out of the lineup
indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just a move he decided to do,'' Offerman said. ``He
said my defense has to improve a little bit. I thought I was
playing good defense. I thought my problem was hitting. But I guess
not.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I can do is (be patient),'' he said. ``I can't
make any trouble. I have to take it as a professional.''
</P>
<P>
   Offerman's average, which was .346 on May 19, has dropped 74
percentage points since then, to .272. In July, he's batting a
team-low .167, and had just one hit in eight at-bats in the first
two games of this trip before being kept out of the lineup the last
three games.
</P>
<P>
   He said Williams told him that he was planning to play Sadler,
recalled Tuesday, ``for awhile. I'll be like everybody else. I'll
be like everybody else, come in here every day and expect to be in
the lineup someday.''
</P>
<P>
   Offerman, who displaced Jeff Frye as the starting second baseman
April 21 in Detroit, ranks next to last in fielding percentage
among American League second baseman, with a .970 mark. The
Yankees' Chuck Knoblauch, who has made 18 errors while trying to
overcome a mysterious throwing problem, is last at .959.
</P>
<P>
   Williams would not say how long he plans to keep Offerman out of
the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed whether the move might be as permanent as Frye's
removal, Williams said: ``No, not necessarily. I'm not going to say
one way or the other, but probably not.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he thought Offerman was out of position at second base,
Williams said: ``This kid has good hands out there. No, he's a good
fielder.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez said he couldn't understand the decision to bench
Offerman. ``Why do you sit a guy like that making all that money?''
Martinez said. ``You got to play him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever (Williams) and (general manager Dan) Duquette are
doing they need to do, but I know he's getting paid a lot of money
to sit on the bench.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez said he didn't think Offerman's defense was a problem.
``I don't think so,'' he said. ``I thought he was playing steady.
He made a couple of great plays. He bobbled a couple, like
everybody does.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jimy better be right about the things he's saying, right about
what he says about his defense. The reason we're not winning is
we're not healthy. And we haven't been playing well. But it's not
one person. The team overall is at fault. Our fault. The whole
team's fault.''

US CAN'T COPE WITH BRAZILIANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUADALAJARA, Mexico _ There was no miracle this time. Kasey
Keller couldn't do a thing after Ronaldinho's header caromed off
the post in the 13th minute. And once Joe-Max Moore's penalty kick
in the 73d was blocked Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night, the US men's soccer team
ended up where it usually does when it plays Brazil _ on the wrong
end of a 1-0 score before 54,000 inside Jalisco Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We deserved at least a draw,'' said Keller, whose mates can
still advance to the semifinals by drawing Friday night with the
Germans, who walked past New Zealand, 2-0, here Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night.
``It's a shame.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, this was the most moral of the collection of 1-0
defeats (five in seven matches since 1992) that the US has suffered
at the feet of the Samba Kings. This time, the Yanks attacked with
confidence and verve. This time, they held the Brazilians to a
handful of chances. This time, they left the field disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three points was our ultimate goal tonight,'' said Moore, who
came in for limping Revolution teammate John Harkes in the 58th
minute. ``I think we actually played better than we did against
them last year. But we lost the game. That's the bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   Though they defeated Brazil, 1-0, at last year's CONCACAF Gold
Cup in Los Angeles, the Americans prevailed only because Keller
played the match of his life (and the best of any keeper in US
history), thwarting top star Romario five times. ``If Brazil gets
that many chances again, we'll lose by four goals,'' predicted US
coach Bruce Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilians, fresh off retaining the Copa America (the South
American championship) two weekends ago, had hammered Germany, 4-0,
in the tournament opener, scoring all of their goals in the final
28 minutes. ``Were we surprised?'' mused US striker Brian McBride.
``With Brazil, you can never be surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet while the Brazilians had beaten the US seven of eight times,
they had never done it by four goals. ``We don't have fear of the
Brazilians,'' Arena said. ``We have great respect.''
</P>
<P>
   As expected, Arena made some changes in a lineup that had
managed only a 2-1 victory over New Zealand Saturday, putting
defender Gregg Berhalter on his four-man back line, along with
fleet Frankie Hejduk on the outside.
</P>
<P>
   But even Hejduk couldn't match the Brazilians' raw speed. Barely
a dozen minutes in, striker Christian dashed past him down the
flank and cracked a soaring cross to Ronaldinho, the gangly
19-year-old artiste with the maloccluded grin who's being touted as
the next Ronaldo. Ronaldinho smartly headed the ball off the right
post and past Keller, and the Samba Kings were on the board.
</P>
<P>
   That spelled trouble for the Americans, who had scored only one
goal on their rivals _ Preki Radosavljevic's 1998 winner _ since
1930. The Yanks had never managed to mount much of an attack on
Brazil; they didn't even attempt a shot in their 1994 World Cup
meeting. And their only two good chances in Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night's
first half came to nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Cobi Jones, alone in the area with nobody between him and keeper
Dida in the 31st minute, inexplicably passed back to McBride at the
top of the box. Then, a minute later, Ernie Stewart popped one over
the crossbar from 8 yards out.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the US was down by only 1-0 at the half. ``We told them,
just stay in the game,'' said Arena. ``We felt if we could get a
push in the last 20 or 25 minutes, we might get the equalizer.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Yanks came out on the run, pushing upfield, getting
numbers into the box. And when Odvan foolishly chopped down Jones
from behind and Swedish referee Anders Frisk whistled for a
penalty, the US had its chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking to put it in the corner, but I didn't get enough
of it, to be honest,'' said Moore. Dida, the keeper, got an early
jump on the ball, dove right and knocked it askew.
</P>
<P>
   Had the Yanks tied the score, they might well have gone on to
win. There were other chances _ a deflected header by Jones that
Dida saved and a shot by Moore that was cleared away. But when the
whistle blew, it was history as usual. A moral loss is still a
loss. ``It's the score that matters,'' said defender Jeff Agoos.
``That's what goes down in the record books.''

CHECO IMPRESSIVE FOR DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ OK, maybe there is hope for the season, or for
next season, or for mankind.
</P>
<P>
   If Robinson Checo, hit around worse than a batting practice
pitcher last time he was here, can turn it around like this,
anything and everything is possible.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the more improbable moments of the season, Checo was
sensational Wednesday night at Dodger Stadium while giving up one
run in five innings as the Dodgers beat Cincinnati 9-1 for their
second win in nine games.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Arnold pitched the last four innings for his first
major-league save.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, what would be a Dodgers game without, at the least, a
minor crisis. That occurred when Checo left the game with a tweaked
groin muscle.
</P>
<P>
   Checo (1-0) said he'd be fine in two or three days. The Dodgers
are also helped by Monday's off day, which means they won't need a
fifth starter again until Aug. 7, which should give him time to
heal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was really feeling it, deep in his groin,'' Dodgers manager
Davey Johnson said. ``But I thought he threw the ball great. By and
large, he still threw some high fastballs. The breaking ball was
sharper, everything was more crisp.''
</P>
<P>
   It was exactly what most people weren't expecting. Before Checo
was promoted from Triple-A Albuquerque, Johnson joked about whether
his name was Checo Robinson or Robinson Checo.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't around long enough for me to find out,'' Johnson
said jokingly.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, well, now Mr. Checo will do just fine.
</P>
<P>
   When he was demoted in April, Dodgers pitching coach Claude
Osteen was Albuquerque's pitching coach. His memory of Checo isn't
flattering.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a body out of control,'' Osteen said. ``There were
legs, elbows, his head; movement in every different direction.
Somebody like that, who has quality stuff, you have to be careful
you don't mess up his nuances. But you have to get some of it under
control.''
</P>
<P>
   Checo, who replaced lefty Carlos Perez, all but insured another
start with the Dodgers when his groin heals.
</P>
<P>
   And not only did he pitch splendidly, he also had his first
major-league hit. It scored two in the Dodgers' four-run third as
they built a 6-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Former Dodgers lefty Dennys Reyes, making his first start,
lasted 22/3 innings. Reyes (2-2), involved in the Jeff Shaw-Paul
Konerko trade, gave up six runs on five hits and walked five.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming into the situation like this, we needed (Checo) to
pitch well and give the bullpen a rest,'' said Dodgers left fielder
Gary Sheffield, who extended his hitting streak to nine with a
third-inning homer. ``We needed that, a good pitching performance.
We scored some runs for him and that was great.''
</P>
<P>
   After being one of three minor-leaguers acquired in the
salary-dumping Dave Mlicki trade with Detroit, Checo was hit hard
in two outings. The 26-year-old right-hander from the Dominican
Republic, once a coveted pitching prospect in Japan, was sent to
Albuquerque with a 17.18 ERA and was supposed to never be heard
from again.
</P>
<P>
   But Checo was placed in Albuquerque's starting rotation, his
mechanics were ironed out and his velocity increased to the mid-90
mph range. He was still erratic, but that changed lately. In his
last two starts, Checo went 2-0 with a 2.84 ERA and earned the nod
to take Perez's spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first inning I was a little nervous, but after that I
settled down,'' said Checo, whose only other major-league win came
in 1997 with Boston. ``I have new mechanics, new height (on a leg
kick). Anytime you throw (your body) open, you throw too many high
balls. Two of the (Reds') hits were on high balls.''

<P>
   Germans are at odds over claims that harsh potty training is to
blame both for Nazism and modern thuggery.
</P>
<P>
   A friend of mine is convinced that the German national character
in all its complexities can be traced back to Germans' rigorous
potty training.
</P>
<P>
   Teutonic infants, he claims, are made to sit on their lowly
thrones for hours on end, until pronounced spiffy clean, usually at
a remarkably tender age.
</P>
<P>
   Out of this early purgatory of life emerges a nation of
precision engineers obsessed with waste disposal, with an
unquenchable yearning for order and authority.
</P>
<P>
   My Jewish friend, referring me to the works of Sigmund Freud,
believes this explains everything in German history, including the
Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Ridiculous. Or so I thought until I opened Die Zeit, Germany's
most intellectual weekly. There it was: a 6,000-word essay on this
very subject.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the Holocaust for one moment. What the author wanted to
establish was whether East Germans were really susceptible to
neo-Nazi views because of the harsh potty-training regime of the
communist era. For that is what a noted Wessi (West German)
criminologist claims.
</P>
<P>
   Christian Pfeiffer, director of the Criminological Research
Institute of Lower Saxony, thinks the xenophobia permeating east
German society can be traced back to the nursery schools.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Pfeiffer had been looking into the reasons why youth
in eastern Germany are four times more likely to commit
racially-motivated crimes than their western counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   It all boils down to ``das Topfen,'' a word which exists only in
the east German dialect, a noun forged bureaucratically from the
word Topf _ ``potty.''
</P>
<P>
   It denotes the ritual of potty training, a sacred act codified
by precise instructions passed down from the Politburo. ``As soon
as the child is able to sit without help, the teacher can begin
with regular potty training,'' the official instruction manual for
nursery schools and kindergartens ordained.
</P>
<P>
   At set times, children were herded into a communal toilet and
made to sit on rows of potties. ``Potty times'' were the nurseries'
main activity, potty training the supreme goal of the institution.
</P>
<P>
   It served an ideological purpose. Through their synchronized
bowel movements, the children of the proletariat shared the
vicissitudes of life. Those who did not perform remained seated,
while the avant-garde left to play. The dunces soon caught on.
</P>
<P>
   Thus did East Germany become the country of world champion
toddlers, faster out of their cotton diapers than any other nation.
</P>
<P>
   But the prodigies, Pfeiffer says, were mentally scarred. They
had been deliberately stripped of their individualism, and their
first encounter with authority ended in humiliation and defeat:
``The children's souls were raped.''
</P>
<P>
   Had not Freud warned about the dangers of tampering with
children's ``anal phase'' of development?
</P>
<P>
   West Germany, on the other hand, has been a beacon of
enlightenment. After the Second World War, its greatest thinkers
put their minds to work on the question of what had made Germans
worship Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   The Frankfurt School philosopher Theodor Adorno blamed the
authoritarian experiences of early childhood. And so, in an effort
to produce a new generation of free thinkers, the Federal Republic
banned potty training and decreed anarchy in the nursery schools.
</P>
<P>
   The kids could defecate wherever they liked, for as long as they
liked. All for the sake of self-expression. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (300-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 550) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I asked around, as discreetly as one could under the
circumstances. The expression ``Topfen'' drew a blank among (west)
German friends. But they were all late developers, there is no
doubt about it.
</P>
<P>
   One friend remembers sitting in her soiled trousers in her
parents' car for what seemed like an eternity, and resolving to do
the big job henceforth in the toilet. She was three years old at
the time.
</P>
<P>
   None of my acquaintances from the east have any recollection of
wet pants. A totally unscientific probe conducted by this newspaper
in one of East Berlin's seats of learning revealed a deep chasm
between Ossis (easterners) resentful of the charge that they are
all proto-Nazis because of their upbringing, and Wessis wallowing
in their infantile liberties.
</P>
<P>
   Westerners all thought potty training was an outdated,
authoritarian, practice. And yes, they conceded, maybe it did
explain Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   A division also emerged between north and south, Lutheran versus
Catholic. One southerner remembered being farmed out to an aunt in
the austere north, who potty-trained the child after a week.
</P>
<P>
   The mother, when she recovered her son, was outraged by this
violation of the child's civil rights. They are still not speaking.
The north, though, caught up with the progressive south in the
1960s.
</P>
<P>
   But that part of northern Germany that became known for a while
as the German Democratic Republic is still stubbornly lagging
behind. That is why Pfeiffer has gone on a tour of the cities of
the former GDR to preach the virtues of disposable diapers. The
reception has been extremely hostile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it really better that the pampered children of the west
turn up at school with their trousers full in the spirit of
anti-authoritarianism?'' asked one irate member of the audience in
Magdeburg. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONCLUDES) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The people in the east talk of little else. Dresden's Sachsische
Zeitung newspaper received more letters on this subject than on the
50th anniversary of the city's firebombing.
</P>
<P>
   Most readers thought that Pfeiffer was, frankly, full of
Scheisse. What about Solingen, they asked, the town near Cologne
where Western youths had burned down a refugee hostel? Or the state
of Baden-Wurttemberg in the south, where far-right Republicans
gained more than 10 percent of the vote in the regional elections?
</P>
<P>
   Let us hope their indignation is not misplaced. For the
traditional East German nursery is very much alive, as West
Berliners forced to move out of the city by soaring rents are
discovering.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these establishments are still run with military
precision. Check-in time at 6 a.m., breakfast at eight, followed by
an hour of ``free play.'' Then comes the highlight of the day:
``das Topfen.''
</P>
<P>
   I shudder to think what these children might get up to in 20
years' time. &QL;

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One of the many archive clips replayed after the
death of John F. Kennedy, Jr. showed his father, the late
president, being asked whether he would like his son to follow in
his political footsteps.
</P>
<P>
   With a speed of political wit now more associated with President
Bill Clinton and a care for gender equality not typical of his
time, JFK flashed back: ``My daughter, too.''
</P>
<P>
   JFK's only daughter, Caroline, at 41 four years her brother's
senior, has steered clear of politics. But her cousin, Kathleen _
the eldest child of the other assassinated Kennedy brother, Robert
_ has quietly won her way through to senior elected office.
</P>
<P>
   Now 48, and convincingly re-elected lieutenant governor of
Maryland last November, she _ rather than any of the new generation
of male Kennedys _ is the one on whom the mantle, and burden, of
the JFK legacy may now rest.
</P>
<P>
   There was even a suggestion last week that she could be a
contender for vice president on the ticket of the current vice
president, Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   In its timing _ immediately after JFK, Jr.'s death _ and its
implication that Gore might not be above exploiting the Kennedy
tragedy for political advantage, the suggestion was extremely
cynical. It was also condescending.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Kennedy Townsend had already been mooted as a plausible
running mate for Gore. She associated herself early on with his
presidential campaign, lining up recently with other prominent
female Democrats to laud him at the inaugural Women for Gore 2000
reception in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   And she would undoubtedly be an electoral asset. Not only is she
supremely well connected _ she was one of only a dozen people
invited by the Clintons to travel on Air Force One to the memorial
service in New York last Friday _ she is also a highly competent
politician.
</P>
<P>
   In one of those eerie Kennedy echoes, Kathleen Kennedy was named
after her father's eldest sister, who had died in a flying accident
in the South of France three years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Like Gore's first grandson, born earlier this month, Kathleen
Kennedy Townsend has the dream birthday for an American politician:
July 4, Independence Day.
</P>
<P>
   She was born and grew up in Greenwich, Conn., and went to
Harvard, where she graduated with honors in history and literature.
Like so many of her relatives, she took a graduate law degree.
Unlike so many of her relatives, however, there has been no whiff
of personal irresponsibility, still less scandal, attached to her
name.
</P>
<P>
   After her marriage to David Townsend, she settled quietly in
Maryland where her husband teaches, had four daughters _ two still
at home, two at college _ and became active in local Democratic
politics.
</P>
<P>
   She became her state's assistant attorney general in 1985,
transferring to head an office in the education department two
years later.
</P>
<P>
   In the first Clinton administration, she was appointed deputy
assistant attorney general, with responsibility for community
policing.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 she ran for lieutenant governor of Maryland on the
winning ticket of Parris Glendening, a professor at the University
of Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   The first female lieutenant governor in the state's history, she
took sole charge of law and order and women and children and
rapidly gained a reputation for eye-catching initiatives, and _
more importantly _ for getting things done.
</P>
<P>
   Her low-key, slightly self-deprecating manner and her sensible
hairdo and suits, set her apart from the openly ambitious
politicians who throng the Washington area.
</P>
<P>
   When Glendening stood for re-election last year, his prospects
were considered marginal to hopeless. His bland, lacklustre manner
was blamed for bringing Maryland less outside investment and fewer
new jobs than neighboring Virginia attracted.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the personal popularity and common-sense style of
his deputy was widely credited with clinching their joint victory.
</P>
<P>
   Her success with female voters would be a definite plus for
Gore's campaign; the ``gender gap'' which worked to Bill Clinton's
advantage currently appears to favor his Republican rival, George
W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   As lieutenant governor of Maryland, she has a strong record in
women's issues, including pioneering initiatives to combat domestic
violence, and is a fervent supporter of tough gun controls.
</P>
<P>
   As a member of Glendening's team, she is also associated with
town and country planning projects designed to tackle one of Gore's
cherished issues: urban sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   All the signs are that Mrs. Kennedy Townsend is grooming herself
to run for governor of Maryland _ unless, of course, she is whisked
away to join Gore's ticket first.
</P>
<P>
   Her track record is impressive and her campaign style effective.
And the resonance of the Kennedy name cannot be underestimated _
especially now. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One of the many archive clips replayed after the
death of John F. Kennedy, Jr. showed his father, the late
president, being asked whether he would like his son to follow in
his political footsteps.
</P>
<P>
   With a speed of political wit now more associated with President
Bill Clinton and a care for gender equality not typical of his
time, JFK flashed back: ``My daughter, too.''
</P>
<P>
   JFK's only daughter, Caroline, at 41 four years her brother's
senior, has steered clear of politics. But her cousin, Kathleen _
the eldest child of the other assassinated Kennedy brother, Robert
_ has quietly won her way through to senior elected office.
</P>
<P>
   Now 48, and convincingly re-elected lieutenant governor of
Maryland last November, she _ rather than any of the new generation
of male Kennedys _ is the one on whom the mantle, and burden, of
the JFK legacy may now rest.
</P>
<P>
   There was even a suggestion last week that she could be a
contender for vice president on the ticket of the current vice
president, Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   In its timing _ immediately after JFK, Jr.'s death _ and its
implication that Gore might not be above exploiting the Kennedy
tragedy for political advantage, the suggestion was extremely
cynical. It was also condescending.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Kennedy Townsend had already been mooted as a plausible
running mate for Gore. She associated herself early on with his
presidential campaign, lining up recently with other prominent
female Democrats to laud him at the inaugural Women for Gore 2000
reception in Washington.
</P>

   And she would undoubtedly be an electoral asset. Not only is she

<P>
   BEIRUT _ You cannot call it ``ethnic cleansing'' _ not quite _
but Israel's campaign of family expulsions from its occupation zone
in southern Lebanon is now so rapid that even human-rights groups
cannot keep pace with it.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, it was 35-year-old Wafa Melhem and her baby daughter,
Norma. In January, 24 civilians living in the mountain town of
Chebaa were driven from their homes by the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of people _ including a baby a few months old and a man
of 99 _ have been thrown off their land in the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Wednesday's excoriating Human Rights Watch report on
expulsions _ released simultaneously in Beirut and Jerusalem _ was
out of date before it was published.
</P>
<P>
   Wafa Melhem's husband had been one of Israel's proxy ``South
Lebanon Army'' (SLA) militiamen, who had himself been thrown out of
his home five months ago; like so many of the Israeli-paid,
Israeli-uniformed and Israeli-armed militia, he was no longer
trusted.
</P>
<P>
   The people of Chebaa were dispossessed _ without trial or
hearing _ after the murder of a local pro-Israeli militia commander
who was involved in tobacco smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, so many of the expellees in the Human Rights Watch
report are related to defecting SLA men _ or to local civilians who
refuse to serve in Israel's cruel little militia _ that the
document is as much an account of the disintegration of the SLA as
it is of expulsion.
</P>
<P>
   In one area of Lebanon alone _ the Arkoub in the southern Bekaa
Valley _ 250 residents are believed to have been driven from their
homes and forced outside Israel's occupation zone in 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   But according to Lebanese government sources, the total figure
could be well over a thousand in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   In some documented cases, homes were looted, burned and
dynamited Serb-style after their occupants were dispossessed by
Israel's forces.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's report includes pitiful evidence of elderly couples
ordered from their homes by Israel's surrogates at five-minutes'
notice, and refused permission to take away any of their
belongings.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 2, 1998, for example, 80-year old Mahmoud Ward and his
70-year old wife, Zahr, were ordered from their home in Hasbaya
after their 37-year-old Druze son, Raja _ a high-ranking SLA
intelligence officer _ turned himself in to the Lebanese
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   A year earlier, a married couple and their son and daughter were
expelled from the village of Markaba because another son had
deserted the SLA and refused to return to the occupation zone.
</P>
<P>
   A 64-year-old woman and her 57-year-old husband were deported
from Chebaa by Israel in 1998 after their son _ who lived outside
the occupation zone _ joined the militant group Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
   A woman whose husband fled the village of Ramieh last year when
he was about to be interrogated at an SLA intelligence office was
forced to stay in her home for two years, ostracized by her
neighbors on SLA orders. Then she, too, was driven out.
</P>
<P>
   If the living are expelled, the dead have been prevented from
returning home.
</P>
<P>
   When Israel visits ``collective punishments'' on villages after
anti-Israeli attacks, SLA militiamen have prevented the bodies of
elderly residents being brought back from Beirut to their homes for
burial.
</P>
<P>
   The remains of 90-year-old Safiya Fouani were turned back by SLA
militiamen at Beit Yahoun when her funeral cortege tried to reach
the village of Houla.
</P>
<P>
   The human-rights group points out that the expulsions are
against international humanitarian law and constitute clear
breaches of the Geneva Convention.
</P>
<P>
   The group says the new Israeli Prime Minister, Ehud Barak, must
end the dispossession of Lebanese civilians at once. &QL;

   BEIRUT _ What is it about the Egyptians? They have censored 94
books from the American University Book shop in Cairo _ from
``Children of the Alley'' by Egypt's own Nobel literature laureate
Naguib Mahfouz to Vladimir Nabokov's ``Lolita.''
</P>
<P>
   But now they have done the impossible and banned one of the most
inspirational works to come from any modern poet in the Arab world:
Kahlil Gibran's ``The Prophet.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibran, a Lebanese Maronite who emigrated to America and died in
New York in 1931, has been compared to William Blake, not only for
his mystical poetry but for his allegorical drawings and paintings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Prophet'' is a 20,000-word exploration of religion and
philosophy, a combination of Christianity and the Sufi Islam.
</P>
<P>
   It is about hope and inspiration and the prophet of the title _
if he can be identified _ is Christ rather than Mohamed, although
Islamic teaching frames part of the poem.
</P>
<P>
   But it's now on the Egyptian censor's list. And the Lebanese,
some of whom appear to worship Gibran as much as admire him _ his
sarcophagus is chained to the stone floor of the hermit's cave in
which he is buried in northern Lebanon lest enthusiasts steal his
bones _ are enraged.
</P>
<P>
   There have been sit-ins by ``The Group of Friends of Kahlil
Gibran'' outside the Lebanese Ministry of Culture and a demand from
Imad Chamoun, a professor of Islamic studies here, that the Beirut
government should respond to Egypt's censorship by banning all
Egyptian books and films from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The diktat of obscurantists,'' is how Chamoun described the
Egyptian Ministry of Information.
</P>

   Enquiries to the American University in Cairo suggest that the
banning of ``The Prophet'' is even more silly than it would at
first appear.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptian censors have been allowed to review 500 books at the
university's book shop _ an interesting reflection on the
relationship between the Cairo government and an institution that
is chartered in Washington _ and decided to ban ``The Prophet'' not
for its words but for its illustrations.
</P>
<P>
   All of the illustrations are Blakian sketches of human forms
and, in the case of the frontispiece, a sketch of a man, eyes
slightly dipped, a broad forehead and a small moustache. It may be
a symbol of Christ or of the unity of human and divine spirit.
</P>
<P>
   The lads in the Egyptian censorship board had no doubt, however:
it was a portrait of Mohamed himself, the prophet whose image must
never be drawn or painted in Islam.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Linz, the press director at the American University in
Cairo, condemned what he called a ``bureaucratic onslaught.'' It
was easy, he said, ``for the controllers to be out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   The Egyptian minister for higher education, Mufid Shihab,
disagrees. Egypt allows free thinking, he claims, ``but rejects
violations of its values and traditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Another book on the banned list is French scholar Maxime
Rodinson's ``Mohamed'' _ censored because the Egyptians claimed it
was trying to prove the Koran was the literary effort of the
Prophet Mohamed rather than the word of God.
</P>
<P>
   Some pretty stupid things have been done in the name of religion
_ crusades, executions, suppression of free speech and free thought
_ but Egypt now seems to qualify as a special case.
</P>
<P>
   Gibran, who wrote ``The Prophet'' in English in 1921 _ it is
said to be the most widely read book of the 20th century _ once
said that he ``kept Jesus in one half of his bosom and Mohamed in
the other.''
</P>
<P>
   He proposed an opera house in Beirut with two domes symbolizing
the reconciliation of Christianity and Islam.
</P>
<P>
   It would be difficult to think of an artist who has done more to
bring two of the Middle East's great religions together. And it's a
wonder those chains around his sarcophagus are not breaking as the
old man tries to get out. &QL;

   BEIRUT _ What is it about the Egyptians? They have censored 94
books from the American University Book shop in Cairo _ from
``Children of the Alley'' by Egypt's own Nobel literature laureate
Naguib Mahfouz to Vladimir Nabokov's ``Lolita.''
</P>
<P>
   But now they have done the impossible and banned one of the most
inspirational works to come from any modern poet in the Arab world:
Kahlil Gibran's ``The Prophet.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibran, a Lebanese Maronite who emigrated to America and died in
New York in 1931, has been compared to William Blake, not only for
his mystical poetry but for his allegorical drawings and paintings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Prophet'' is a 20,000-word exploration of religion and
philosophy, a combination of Christianity and the Sufi Islam.
</P>
<P>
   It is about hope and inspiration and the prophet of the title _
if he can be identified _ is Christ rather than Mohamed, although
Islamic teaching frames part of the poem.
</P>
<P>
   But it's now on the Egyptian censor's list. And the Lebanese,
some of whom appear to worship Gibran as much as admire him _ his
sarcophagus is chained to the stone floor of the hermit's cave in
which he is buried in northern Lebanon lest enthusiasts steal his
bones _ are enraged.
</P>
<P>
   There have been sit-ins by ``The Group of Friends of Kahlil
Gibran'' outside the Lebanese Ministry of Culture and a demand from
Imad Chamoun, a professor of Islamic studies here, that the Beirut
government should respond to Egypt's censorship by banning all
Egyptian books and films from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The diktat of obscurantists,'' is how Chamoun described the
Egyptian Ministry of Information.
</P>
<P>
   Enquiries to the American University in Cairo suggest that the
banning of ``The Prophet'' is even more silly than it would at

   PANCEVO, SERBIA _ The ecological time bomb is ticking. Nobody
knows when or how it will explode.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, the visible effects are almost routine. In
recent weeks many people in the Serbian town of Pancevo have come
out in red blotches and blisters, after lying in the grass for a
few minutes, for example, or after picking vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, it could just be a common batch of allergies.
But, says Zoran Nedic, dermatologist and secretary of the health
committee in Pancevo, ``I've never seen anything on this scale.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of skin problems has doubled in recent weeks. Dr.
Nedic sees this as the tip of an iceberg.
</P>
<P>
   A United Nations mission, led by the former Finnish environment
minister Pekka Haavisto, was in Pancevo last week to assess the
potentially devastating scale of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody in Pancevo, a town of 150,000, shares the fear of what
they describe as the ekologicheska katastrofa _ when NATO bombing
of the town unleashed a poisonous cocktail of thousands of tons of
toxic chemicals into the water, air and soil.
</P>
<P>
   The fertilizer factory was bombed, releasing huge amounts of
ammonia into the air and into the Danube.
</P>
<P>
   The oil refinery was repeatedly bombed: 20,000 tons of crude oil
were burned up in one bombardment alone, and a cloud of black smoke
hung in the air for 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   The petrochemicals factory was bombed: 1,400 tons of ethylene
dichloride poured into the Danube, and high concentrations of vinyl
chloride, the main constituent of PVC, were released into the
atmosphere at more than 10,000 times the permitted level.
</P>
<P>
   And so it goes on. The official list of environmental damage
runs to six closely typed pages, from the first bombing raid on
March 24 to the last on June 8.
</P>
<P>
   Each of these events separately would, in ordinary times, set
environmental alarm bells ringing. When combined in a multiple
cataclysm _ in the early hours of April 18, several factories were
bombed within a few minutes of each other _ the effects are
incalculable.
</P>
<P>
   As Dr. Nedic points out: ``Never in history have a
petrochemicals factory, an oil refinery and a fertilizer factory
all been on fire during a single day.''
</P>
<P>
   He predicts that cancer rates will be ``sharply up'' in the
years to come.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Sava Stajic, of the Pancevo Society against Cancer, notes
that cancer levels were already higher than average in the area
because of the industrial pollution from the factories in previous
years.
</P>
<P>
   But he, too, argues that there will be an ``epidemic increase''
because of the hundreds of thousands of tons of ``highly toxic and
carcinogenic chemicals'' that have been released _ including
uncertain quantities of chlorine, mercury, hydrocarbons, ammonia,
nitrogen and sulphur oxides, phosphorous compounds and hydrogen
halides.
</P>
<P>
   It is a case of name a toxic chemical, and it is on the list.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor of Pancevo, Srdjan Mikovic, deeply resents NATO's
willingness to bomb the town without consideration for the effects
_ what he describes as ``a serious intention to kill the town.''
</P>
<P>
   He and the city council represent the anti-Milosevic opposition.
But he argues that the bombing of the town has done much to destroy
pro-Western feeling.
</P>
<P>
   He points to a cupboard where he has stowed the British and
American flags that he used to keep on his desk. ``We received
their ambassadors here. We never dreamed these countries might bomb
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, there can be no chance to plead ignorance of the
implications. Many factories were built and installed by Western
companies.
</P>
<P>
   After the fires, ``black rain'' fell on Pancevo and the
surrounding area, covering plants with a slimy layer. There was an
official warning against eating fresh vegetables, and a warning to
wash all vegetables with special care.
</P>
<P>
   But most fear that the longer-term effects will be much more
drastic than the problems of coping with greasy lettuce. The water
supply in the Danube may have been affected downstream into
Romania. Crop changes in the surrounding area seem inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   The black jokes abound:``How do children in Pancevo count to 30?
By counting on the fingers of both hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Cedic argues that _ dodgy humor apart _ talk of biological
change is more than just fantasy. ``A lot of the chemicals released
are not just carcinogens but can also cause mutation,'' he said. &QL;

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Aside from the baking heat, the Golan Heights looks
like a piece of Scotland transported to the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   It is a flat heath set on a plateau, bisected by narrow gullies
and deep glens, and overlooked by the peak of Mount Hermon.
</P>
<P>
   The Golan is also the most strategically important territory in
the region. To the north Damascus, the Syrian capital, is only a
couple of hours drive away in a tank. At the foot of the Golan to
the east is Lake Tiberias and the steep hills of northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
   It was captured by Israel in 1967 and held by the Israeli army
in the face of a massive Syrian tank attack in 1973. In parts of
the southern Golan there are rusted tangles of barbed wire from
earlier conflicts with notices warning of old mine fields.
</P>
<P>
   There are less obvious signs of the impact of war: Tumbled piles
of dark rock and cactus, marking the remains of Syrian villages
from which 100,000 people were driven after 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Current inhabitants of the Golan are 17,000 Israeli settlers,
living in capacious red-roofed villas, and the same number of
Druze, an Islamic sect, living mostly in four large villages in the
shadow of Mount Hermon.
</P>
<P>
   The return of the Golan to Syria has always been the price
Israel would have to pay for a peace treaty with Syrian President
Hafez al-Assad.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations with the government of Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli
prime minister assassinated in 1995, made progress but never
decided the final Israeli withdrawal line.
</P>
<P>
   Syria wants the June 4, 1967 border which is slightly in advance
of the frontier agreed in the 1920s. Israel is keen to prevent
Syria occupying the eastern shore line of Lake Tiberias.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the territorial settlement a peace agreement will be
hedged about by elaborate measures for demilitarizing the Heights
and the land to the east and north. Monitors will prevent surprise
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Netanyahu, the previous Israeli prime minister, says
that Syria secretly agreed during his three years in power that
Israeli monitors could stay on Mount Hermon.
</P>
<P>
   There has been no fighting in the Golan since the May, 1974
Separation of Forces agreement under which part of the Golan was
returned to Syria and the two sides separated by a U.N. buffer
zone. During the two invasions of Lebanon by Israel in 1978 and
1982 the Golan front remained quiet.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli settlers are less ideological and militant than in
the West Bank. Many belong to the Israeli Labor Party and would go

   JERUSALEM _ Aside from the baking heat, the Golan Heights looks
like a piece of Scotland transported to the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   It is a flat heath set on a plateau, bisected by narrow gullies
and deep glens, and overlooked by the peak of Mount Hermon.
</P>
<P>
   The Golan is also the most strategically important territory in
the region. To the north Damascus, the Syrian capital, is only a
couple of hours drive away in a tank. At the foot of the Golan to
the east is Lake Tiberias and the steep hills of northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
   It was captured by Israel in 1967 and held by the Israeli army
in the face of a massive Syrian tank attack in 1973. In parts of
the southern Golan there are rusted tangles of barbed wire from
earlier conflicts with notices warning of old mine fields.
</P>
<P>
   There are less obvious signs of the impact of war: Tumbled piles
of dark rock and cactus, marking the remains of Syrian villages
from which 100,000 people were driven after 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Current inhabitants of the Golan are 17,000 Israeli settlers,
living in capacious red-roofed villas, and the same number of
Druze, an Islamic sect, living mostly in four large villages in the
shadow of Mount Hermon.
</P>
<P>
   The return of the Golan to Syria has always been the price
Israel would have to pay for a peace treaty with Syrian President
Hafez al-Assad.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations with the government of Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli
prime minister assassinated in 1995, made progress but never
decided the final Israeli withdrawal line.
</P>
<P>
   Syria wants the June 4, 1967 border which is slightly in advance
of the frontier agreed in the 1920s. Israel is keen to prevent
Syria occupying the eastern shore line of Lake Tiberias.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the territorial settlement a peace agreement will be
hedged about by elaborate measures for demilitarizing the Heights
and the land to the east and north. Monitors will prevent surprise
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Netanyahu, the previous Israeli prime minister, says
that Syria secretly agreed during his three years in power that
Israeli monitors could stay on Mount Hermon.
</P>
<P>
   There has been no fighting in the Golan since the May, 1974
Separation of Forces agreement under which part of the Golan was
returned to Syria and the two sides separated by a U.N. buffer
zone. During the two invasions of Lebanon by Israel in 1978 and
1982 the Golan front remained quiet.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli settlers are less ideological and militant than in
the West Bank. Many belong to the Israeli Labor Party and would go
quietly if a peace agreement with Syria is reached.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Golan wine producers has already started planting
vineyards in Galilee in order to stay in business after an Israeli
withdrawal. &QL;

   All at once it got very serious. Ken Newport looked up from the
600-page document he had printed from the Internet. He had been
ploughing through its interminable ramblings about horsemen and
brides, scrolls and seals, beasts and Babylon, demon armies and
divine punishments. But then something clicked.
</P>
<P>
   What it meant, he realized with a sudden chill, was blazing gun
battles, burning buildings and more dead children.
</P>
<P>
   The survivors of Waco were looking for a repeat of the awful
inferno in which some 80 people died in the siege of their
headquarters in Texas six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   How, he wondered, did an unknown academic from Liverpool like
him go about contacting the FBI? It had all begun innocently
enough.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Newport is a theologian who, for the past two years, has
been gathering material for an academic volume on how groups
throughout history have interpreted Revelation, the final book of
the Bible which is consumed with surreal visions about the end of
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Almost without exception, he discovered, those who became
obsessed with the Apocalypse became filled with the conviction that
it was a timetable of real events and that the end was about to
come in their own time.
</P>
<P>
   The 17th-century Baptist, Benjamin Keach, thought it would
happen in 1689. One of the founders of Methodism, Charles Wesley,
thought Doomsday would be 1794.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most famously, the American preacher William Miller
gathered his followers around him on Oct. 22, 1844, all having sold
their worldly possessions, quit jobs and moved to upstate New York,
which was where Christ was due to return.
</P>
<P>
   The members of the Branch Davidian cult at Waco, under their
wild and charismatic leader David Koresh, were seized with the same
mindset.
</P>
<P>
   But there was something more. From time to time there appeared a
group that was not simply content to wait for Armageddon. They saw
it as their duty to provoke it.
</P>
<P>
   It was in gathering material on the history of the Branch
Davidian cult that he came across evidence that Koresh's
successors, who style themselves the Students of the Seven Seals,
are engaged upon a process whose logic seems to be taking them
remorselessly to the creation of another Waco _ sometime between
now and Friday Aug. 6, when they are convinced that the world will
end.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in his neat modern study at Liverpool Hope University
College, amid racks of box files and a world away from the madness
of Waco, Dr. Newport began to correspond _ by letter and e-mail _
with the new generation of Branch Davidians, who have fled Texas
and are now dispersed throughout the U.S. and UK.
</P>
<P>
   He contacted them through their websites and by writing to the
seven members who are in American jails, serving a total of 238
years between them. Slowly he began to piece together the story
which has so unnerved him. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;

 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The first piece in the jigsaw went back to Oct. 23, 1844 _ the
day after the world didn't end as William Miller had predicted. It
was then that his followers began the long process of coming to
terms with what they dubbed The Great Disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   Among the several new groups which sprang from the disillusioned
Millerites was the Seventh Day Adventists, whose recruits included
one John Kellogg, who developed for his brethren a special
vegetarian breakfast food called corn flakes.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it was a movement doomed to schism. A washing machine
salesman called Victor Houteff led a breakaway called the Davidian
Seventh Day Adventists. And after Victor's wife and successor
Florence gathered the movement's 940 members together for another
unsuccessful Doomsday on April 22, 1959, it split again, with Ben
Roden and his wife Lois forming the Branch Davidians.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the succession should have passed to their son
George. But by then David Koresh was on the scene and things began
to turn from the merely eccentric to the downright dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   To settle the leadership issue, Ken Newport discovered, George
Roden dug up the remains of an 85-year-old Davidian who had died
some 20 years earlier, and challenged Koresh to a Resurrection
Contest.
</P>
<P>
   A gun battle ensued and, though the police arrested everyone, no
one was convicted _ though George was given six months for contempt
of court for threatening the judge with plagues and herpes.
</P>
<P>
   George was later sent to an asylum after drawing a third
Davidian into a row over whether George or Koresh had been chosen
by God to be the seventh and final angel named in the Bible; when
the third man insisted it was neither of them but him, George
chopped him up with an axe.
</P>
<P>
   But it was none of this which prompted the Davidians' letters
and e-mails to Ken Newport suddenly to halt. Nor was it his
questions about the awful events at Waco, at which the FBI
acquitted themselves so poorly. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The cult members began to get wary when Dr. Newport started to
ask about their belief that Koresh is due to return from the dead
in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   Their massive documents on the Web revealed that a code-breaking
of a combination of dates in Revelation and the prophetic book of
Daniel suggested that Koresh would return on Aug. 6, at the head of
200 million horsemen (see Rev. 9:16) to cleanse the earth and
slaughter the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   Those of Koresh's followers who were not consumed in the flames
of Waco were to prepare for the event under the guidance of a
Davidian by the code name of The Chosen Vessel.
</P>
<P>
   It was when Ken Newport began to find out who this might be that
all communication was ended with a final e-mail: ``We perceive now
that you are not a seeker after the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Newport continued to comb through what had already been
made available to him. The conclusions he was forced to make
disturbed him.
</P>
<P>
   For the survivors to join Koresh's divine army they, too, would
have to be dead before Aug. 6.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no reference to self-sacrifice in any of the
documentation. Rather there was the suggestion that the remnant,
under the direction of The Chosen Vessel, would have to be killed
by the same forces who killed Koresh.
</P>
<P>
   ``The logic is clear,'' says Dr. Newport. ``It all makes perfect
sense if you take on board the hypotheses they start with. It is
entirely possible that they are provoking some horrendous
confrontation with the U.S. authorities.'' His estimate is that
around 40 to 50 individuals might be involved in such an outrage.
</P>
<P>
   Across the world, security services have decided they have to
take this kind of thing seriously. The propensity of cults to turn
fantasy into grim reality is evident from a mere recital of names
like Jonestown, the Solar Temple, Heaven's Gate, Aum Shinri Kyo.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities in Israel recently expelled 14 members of a
Denver-based Doomsday sect called Concerned Christians, accusing
them of plans to attack the al-Aqsa mosque in an attempt to spark
off the apocalyptic war of Armageddon.
</P>
<P>
   In the UK, the anti-terrorism squad is alive to fears that a
fanatical U.S. group has targeted the Millennium Dome for attack.
</P>
<P>
   In Montana, the FBI is monitoring groups it fears are storing
explosives for some millennium outrage. &QL;

<P>
   Perhaps they have learned the lessons of Waco. When I contacted
them in Washington recently, their cults department was remaining
taciturn. The FBI knows that its strategists made fools of
themselves over Waco.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had they taken the trouble to find out anything about what was
going on in the heads of those in the Waco compound, they might
have defused the whole situation peacefully,'' says Ken Newport.
Instead, their actions seemed calculated to produce the worst
possible outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``The demonization of the U.S. government which is found
ubiquitously in Seventh Day Adventist sources predisposed members
of the Branch-Davidian movement (nearly all of whom, including
Koresh himself, were drawn from the Adventist church) to view the
siege of their headquarters by the FBI as of apocalyptic
significance,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The law authorities added to such a perception by shining
unceasing lights into the compound, playing demonically loud music
alternately punctuated, one Waco survivor claimed, with the sound
of rabbits being slaughtered and of Tibetan monks chanting.
</P>
<P>
   It all fitted into the weird end-of-the-world scenario of those
final chapters of the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were dealing with a group which believed that, just
before the end of the world, the great Satanic power would seek to
destroy the last faithful remnant of God's people,'' says Dr.
Newport.
</P>
<P>
   ``No wonder that, with all that going on outside their Mount
Carmel compound, Koresh's people thought that the eschatological
dawn had broken,'' he says. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONCLUDES) &LR;  &QC;

   ``The chilling thing is that all the ingredients for another
major incident are in place. And the logic leads uncompromisingly
to Aug. 6.''
</P>
<P>
   Only this time the FBI cannot say that they have not been
warned. &QL;

   ``The logic is clear,'' says Dr. Newport. ``It all makes perfect
sense if you take on board the hypotheses they start with. It is
entirely possible that they are provoking some horrendous
confrontation with the U.S. authorities.'' His estimate is that
around 40 to 50 individuals might be involved in such an outrage.
</P>
<P>
   Across the world, security services have decided they have to
take this kind of thing seriously. The propensity of cults to turn
fantasy into grim reality is evident from a mere recital of names
like Jonestown, the Solar Temple, Heaven's Gate, Aum Shinri Kyo.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities in Israel recently expelled 14 members of a
Denver-based Doomsday sect called Concerned Christians, accusing
them of plans to attack the al-Aqsa mosque in an attempt to spark
off the apocalyptic war of Armageddon.
</P>
<P>
   In the UK, the anti-terrorism squad is alive to fears that a
fanatical U.S. group has targeted the Millennium Dome for attack.
</P>
<P>
   In Montana, the FBI is monitoring groups it fears are storing
explosives for some millennium outrage. &QL;

   Perhaps they have learned the lessons of Waco. When I contacted
them in Washington recently, their cults department was remaining
taciturn. The FBI knows that its strategists made fools of
themselves over Waco.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had they taken the trouble to find out anything about what was
going on in the heads of those in the Waco compound, they might
have defused the whole situation peacefully,'' says Ken Newport.
Instead, their actions seemed calculated to produce the worst
possible outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``The demonization of the U.S. government which is found
ubiquitously in Seventh Day Adventist sources predisposed members
of the Branch-Davidian movement (nearly all of whom, including
Koresh himself, were drawn from the Adventist church) to view the
siege of their headquarters by the FBI as of apocalyptic
significance,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The law authorities added to such a perception by shining
unceasing lights into the compound, playing demonically loud music
alternately punctuated, one Waco survivor claimed, with the sound
of rabbits being slaughtered and of Tibetan monks chanting.
</P>
<P>
   It all fitted into the weird end-of-the-world scenario of those
final chapters of the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were dealing with a group which believed that, just
before the end of the world, the great Satanic power would seek to
destroy the last faithful remnant of God's people,'' says Dr.
Newport.
</P>
<P>
   ``No wonder that, with all that going on outside their Mount
Carmel compound, Koresh's people thought that the eschatological
dawn had broken,'' he says. &QL;

DEPARTURE IS TYPICAL OF SANDERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The most compelling reason for bringing football
back to L.A. wasn't forwarded by Bill Chadwick Tuesday in his
presentation to the NFL owners in Chicago. Rather, it came a day
later from Detroit in the form of a simple statement announcing
that Lions running back Barry Sanders had decided, on the eve of
his 11th NFL season, to retire.
</P>
<P>
   No way should the entertainment capital of the world have missed
being mesmerized by arguably the greatest running back of all
time.It's a crying shame only 43,850 Los Angeles area football fans
can say they saw Sanders play in their backyard.
</P>
<P>
   That was the paid attendance at Anaheim Stadium when Sanders ran
for 91 yards on 26 carries in a Detroit victory over the Rams on
Oct. 24, 1993. It was his only Southern California appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, who surpassed the magical 2,000-yard mark in 1997,
didn't get to play in the Coliseum before Al Davis sent his Raiders
packing. Now it looks as though he never will, regardless of how
favorably the league's owners smile upon the Coliseum deal.
</P>
<P>
   Now the running back is gone and the NFL is poorer for it, no
matter how many hundreds of millions of dollars it commands in
expansion fees from L.A. or Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders was a worthy successor to Gale Sayers and Jim Brown,
O.J. Simpson and Walter Payton. Considered by some to be too small
and too slow to succeed in the NFL, Sanders led linebackers to lie.
</P>
<P>
   He once busted the Carolina Panthers' Lamar Lathon with a move
that left Lathon looking so silly, the linebacker invented a
hamstring injury to explain away the missed tackle.
</P>
<P>
   It reportedly will cost Sanders millions of dollars to break
loose from the Lions, who have him contractually in their clutches
through 2002. However high the sum, the bonus money Sanders will
have to pay back probably won't equal all the endorsement gold he
has left on the table over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders' monk-like repudiation of the material trappings of
success calls to mind another marvelous athlete who retired in his
prime, Sandy Koufax.
</P>
<P>
   Our culture has grown more celebrity-crazed since Koufax's
retreat in the 1960s. And yet Sanders stands as proof that it
remains possible for an extraordinary athlete to lead an ordinary
life. The key, of course, is not going out of your way to draw
attention to yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders can lose himself in a public that is otherwise quick to
put perennial Pro Bowlers on pedestals. He eschews the flamboyant
clothes, flashy cars, extravagant homes, swanky friends and
commercial ventures that would give off the impression he's
something special.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that even after years of being in fame's grip, he
is impossible to pin down.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't dissuade people from trying. Plenty of pundits took
it upon themselves Wednesday to flesh out Sanders' bare-bones
statement by suggesting Sanders doesn't really want out of
football, he just wants out of Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders is so soft-spoken, maybe people just didn't hear him
when he said in early 1996 that he would consider retiring after
the 1998 season because, ``I always felt when I was younger that 10
was a nice number.''
</P>
<P>
   People surprised by the abruptness of Sanders' announcement must
not have caught the playful warning he issued in June of 1997.
``When I quit,'' he said, ``it'll be `See you guys later. Had
enough.'''
</P>
<P>
   That Sanders retires needing only 1,458 yards to supplant Payton
as the NFL's all time leading rusher was shocking only to those
deaf to the beat to which Sanders marches.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, his decision was in harmony with his past. As a high
school senior, Sanders needed 33 yards to overtake a league rival
who had set a season rushing record. One or two more carries and
the record assuredly would have been Sanders' to savor.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he sat out the final few minutes of the regular-season
finale, explaining later that he didn't want to risk injury with
the playoffs looming.
</P>
<P>
   He showed the same shocking disregard for ego gratification in
1989, his first season after getting drafted No.3 overall by
Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Needing just 10 yards to wrest the rookie rushing title from
Kansas City's Christian Okoye, Sanders abstained from re-entering a
game against Atlanta in the fourth quarter because he didn't want
to deny his backup Tony Paige precious playing time.
</P>
<P>
   Other history, not Sanders' own, indicates this is yet another
one of his inspired breaks for daylight. Simpson and Eric Dickerson
were 31, the same age Sanders is now, when their numbers started to
sag. Tony Dorsett was two years older when age (and linebackers)
started to catch up to him.
</P>
<P>
   So Sanders didn't pass Payton and he tripped up on every run to
the Super Bowl. He would appear to have peace of mind and, really,
isn't that what all of us are chasing? &QL;

MCCAIN ADDS A DASH OF LIBERALISM TO CONSERVATIVE GOP STEW
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For a moment, Republican presidential hopeful John
McCain almost sounded like a San Francisco liberal.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona senator said Wednesday that gays and lesbians would
be welcome to serve in his administration. He decried the influence
of money in politics. He endorsed a moratorium on offshore oil
drilling. And he touted legislation to end sugar subsidies _ a
cause championed by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Rep.
George Miller, D-Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   No one familiar with McCain's 17-year record in Washington could
mistake him for Willie Brown's ideological soul mate, however. The
62-year-old lawmaker is an avid supporter of the military who
pledges to uphold the legacy of Ronald Reagan and consistently
receives near-perfect scores from conservative groups.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain's comments during a lunch with California reporters
across the street from the Capitol reveal an independent streak
that he hopes can carry him to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fastest growing registration of voters in California is
independents,'' McCain said. ``I believe I can appeal with my
message to independent-minded Republicans in California.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's refusal to toe the party line, most notably on campaign
finance reform and tobacco legislation, has earned him both respect
and scorn. His strategists believe that it accounts for his
emergence as a leading alternative to Texas Gov. George W. Bush,
who remains the overwhelming leader in fund-raising and public
opinion polls. He added to his maverick credentials Wednesday by
outlining a plan to provide school vouchers for disadvantaged
children at the expense of government subsidies for ethanol, sugar,
oil and gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   McCain proposed that $5.4 billion be spent over the next three
years to provide $2,000 education grants for poor children that
could be used at either public or private schools. He would pay for
the vouchers by abolishing the subsidies that benefit corn
producers and sugar farmers, a stance that many believe is
political suicide in Iowa _ site of the nation's first presidential
caucus in February.
</P>
<P>
   The ethanol subsidy, which costs taxpayers hundreds of millions
of dollars each year, has strong bipartisan support. McCain said
that his attempt to pit ``corporate welfare'' against children's
education is unlikely to prevail.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has about the same opportunity as I do of being on the next
launch into outer space,'' McCain said. ``We need to have people on
the record.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the reaction of Republican leaders: ``They are overjoyed
as usual,'' McCain said sarcastically. ``They voted me again, Mr.
Congeniality.'' The sugar subsidy helps domestic sugar growers,
most of whom are in Florida and Louisiana. The subsidy makes it
difficult for refineries _ like the C&AMP;H sugar refinery in Crockett
- that rely on foreign sugar to remain competitive. Opponents also
contend that it raises the cost of sugar for all consumers.
</P>
<P>
   McCain solidified his renegade reputation when he sponsored,
along with Senator Russell Feingold, D-Wis., a campaign finance
bill that would ban the unlimited donations to political parties
known as soft money.
</P>
<P>
   He said that it is opposition from fellow Republicans that is
preventing the measure from becoming law, but said he has no
intention of leaving the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that the party has been in the past the party of
reform and can be in the future,'' McCain said. ``I believe in the
principles of the Republican Party as articulated by Abraham
Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, Ronald Reagan and others. ... I
believe that my most effective course of action ... is to improve
(the party) rather than to leave it.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he disagrees with Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott's opposition to President Clinton's nomination of Richard
Holbrooke as U.N. ambassador, just as he disagrees with Lott's
opposition to San Francisco philanthropist James Hormel as
ambassador to Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elections have consequences,'' McCain said, acknowledging
Clinton's right to make such appointments.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has been hailed by many in Silicon Valley for his
promotion of legislation that will shield the high-tech industry
from litigation arising from possible Y2K computer bugs.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain made clear Wednesday that he would not pander to the
industry, which is playing an increasingly prominent role in the
2000 campaign. ``We can't have our entire legislative agenda driven
by them,'' said McCain, who is ignoring the pleas of high-tech
leaders who want to make it easier to export encryption technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, look, you can't override the director of the FBI, the
head the CIA, the national security adviser and the secretary of
defense of the United States and expect me to go back to Arizona
and say, `My dear friends, for the sake of encryption, I overrule
the the strong views of those who are entrusted with our national
security.' It's just foolishness,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain understands that he is far behind Texas Governor George
W. Bush both in money and the polls. His staff boasts about his
standing as the second most popular, one referring to him as the
leading the ``non-Bush caucus.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good man, and a good friend in mine,'' McCain said
Wednesday. ``I don't know gov. Bush's positions on a lot of issues.
I know we disagree on ethanol subsidies, probably disagree on
campaign finance reform. It's hard to compare myself to him. That
opportunity will clearly be there.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain plans to spend about 10 days in California next month,
and boasted that he is already quite familiar with the state --
just like thousands of Arizonans who flee the summer heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the months of July and August I am required to got to San
Diego to visit my constituents,'' McCain said.

NEW EU CHIEF TACKLES BREAD-AND-BUTTER ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS _ In the two months he has been president of the
European Commission, Romano Prodi has yet to be on time for an
appointment.
</P>
<P>
   When he was the prime minister of Italy, Prodi was always
punctual. But as he criss-crossed Europe, getting a feel for his
new job, Prodi came to experience firsthand one of the biggest
headaches on the continent: air traffic delays.
</P>
<P>
   The experience was an epiphany for Prodi. He has seized on it as
a problem that affects all Europeans, and one which he is
determined to tackle during his five-year term as the head of the
organization that is trying to turn the dream of a united Europe
into a reality. It is part of Prodi's ambitious plan to make the
European Union, more relevant to the 349 million mostly indifferent
people who live in the 15-nation bloc.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, when Prodi introduced his new 19-member European
Commission to oversee the administration of the European Union, he
sought to distance his team from its predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the European Commission resigned en masse after
several commissioners were implicated in the biggest scandal in the
EU's 42-year existence. Jacques Santer, Prodi's predecessor, and
several of his commissioners were accused of mismanagement,
awarding sweetheart contracts to cronies, and abusing expense
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Prodi was brought in by the leaders of the 15 nations to restore
the EU's integrity. But Prodi, who has four holdovers from the
Santer regime on the commission, has more in mind than improving
the EU's image. He wants to chip away at the apathy evidenced last
month when less than half of eligible voters turned out for the
European Parliament elections. His plan is to focus on issues that
affect the everyday lives of Europeans, from getting the planes to
run on time to improving consumer confidence in food.
</P>
<P>
   Prodi's populist streak is a break from his predecessors, who
saw themselves primarily as international statesmen. While the EU's
leaders have spoken in grandiose terms about European integration
having made war in Europe impossible, Prodi says he is more
concerned about how an increasingly federal Europe can improve the
quality of life for Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Prodi has an international outlook. He sees things in a
global way. But he combines that with a Tip O'Neill view that all
politics is local,'' David O'Sullivan, Prodi's top aide, said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   While European leaders were congratulating each other for
presiding over the greatest example of reconciliation in the 20th
century, many Europeans were complaining about nightmarish airport
delays, contaminated food, and the seemingly endless scandals that
taint sports from soccer to cycling.
</P>
<P>
   Prodi contends that while the European Union has been successful
at addressing the big things, small things have been overlooked.
Europeans have created a single market and a single currency. They
are trying to create a single defense and foreign policy, which
would be even more impressive examples of putting aside national
interests for regional ones.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the air traffic control systems across Europe remain a
confusing patchwork that vary from country to country, inhibiting
the coordination needed to handle the increase in air travel. While
Europe is a single market, it has no single agency overseeing food
quality or testing, and contamination scares like the one last
month that led to pulling Coca-Cola from store shelves in four
European countries are common. The bodies that oversee sports,
meanwhile, are competing fiefdoms whose financial interests often
cloud attempts to police athletes.
</P>
<P>
   In his first speech to the new parliament Wednesday, Prodi
singled out airport delays, consumer fears about food, and the use
of performance-enhancing drugs by athletes as issues he wants to
address. They are hot-button topics across Europe, discussed with
equal fervor in London pubs, Parisian cafes, and Munich beer halls.
</P>
<P>
   ``What people are crying out for is a clear answer to the
problems that matter in their daily lives,'' said Prodi. ``At the
end of the day, what interests them is not who solves these
problems, but the fact that they are being tackled _ that consumers
have confidence in the food they buy, that the public can take to
the skies with confidence, that sport is clean.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to wanting European bodies that can coordinate air
traffic and monitor sports, Prodi proposed an independent body
modeled on the US Food and Drug Administration. His proposal was
made the same week that the United States imposed tariffs on EU
goods because the EU refuses to allow the import of hormone-treated
beef from the United States. Europeans remain bitterly divided over
the wisdom of allowing cheaper, genetically modified foods from the
United States into their market.
</P>
<P>
   While Prodi hopes to fashion a new European Union that better
reflects the ordinary concerns of Europeans, he must first confront
the public cynicism and political factionalism that has hampered
the development of a united Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Hans-Gert Poettering, the German who leads the center-right
European People's Party, the largest group in the European
Parliament, denounced Prodi's 19-member team as being overloaded
with leftists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not believe that this commission is politically
balanced,'' said Poettering, who threatened to block the
appointments at confirmation hearings in September.
</P>
<P>
   O'Sullivan, meanwhile, personifies one of Prodi's tactics for
addressing factionalism. Most everyone expected Prodi to choose a
fellow Italian as his right-hand man. Not only did Prodi choose
O'Sullivan, an Irishman, but he directed his 19 commissioners to
hire aides who are not from their own country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about being truly European, and it's also about avoiding
the appearance of a conflict of interest,'' said O'Sullivan. ``If
you have three Italians or three Germans in one room deciding on an
issue, they may take a decision for the best of Europe, but there
will be a suspicion. We have to confront that.''
</P>
<P>
   Such talk is revolutionary for an institution that critics say
is the epitome of unaccountability. While the 626-member parliament
is elected, most power rests with the commission president and the
19 commissioners, who are appointed by the member nations.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with powers created in the wake of the mismanagement
scandal, Prodi will have a tighter rein on his commissioners. He
secured a promise that they would resign if their integrity comes
under serious question.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Prodi's task of breaking down cynicism was not made any
easier by the unveiling this week of the parliament's opulent new
$500 million home in Strasbourg, 270 miles from the EU's
headquarters here. The parliament already has a bigger, more
expensive building in Brussels that opened two years ago. But in
1992 the French government secured an agreement that mandates the
parliament meet also in Strasbourg.
</P>
<P>
   The 17-story circular building in Strasbourg, where parliament
will sit for about 60 days a year, opened with elevators, air
conditioning, and telephones malfunctioning.
</P>
<P>
   Saying they could not find their way out of the building, some
parliamentarians immediately dubbed their new part-time home
Alcatraz. And many Europeans see it as a temple to the kind of
wasteful spending they associate with the EU.
</P>
<P>
   For Prodi, it is a visceral reminder of the task at hand.

   Janina Demma worked hard, saved religiously, and built her nest
egg for a big investment in her native Poland. She thought the
dividends would build her own dream house back home.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, authorities said, the money helped build the Krakow
business of the man who allegedly swiped her life's savings.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities believe that Marian F. Golemo, who allegedly
swindled Demma and other Worcester (Mass.) County victims out of
$300,000, is using the money to sell cars in Poland, operating a
Peugeot dealership there that may be beyond the reach of US
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just sick over this,'' Demma, 51, said Wednesday. ``I'm
never going to be the same. What he's done is very, very painful.
They should bring him back. I pray to God they do.''
</P>
<P>
   Worcester District Attorney John J. Conte said his investigators
have traced Golemo, who fled across the Atlantic after he was
charged with bilking Polish immigrants in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But efforts to return him to face those charges may be thwarted
by a 1927 treaty barring extradition of criminal suspects from
Poland to the United States. Also, Polish law could shield Golemo,
a Polish citizen, from prosecution there for violating US laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``They won't allow their nationals to be extradited,'' a
spokesman for the US Department of Justice said.
</P>
<P>
   That is distressing news for Golemo's alleged victims such as
Demma, who charges that she entrusted $52,000 to him, money she
earned during nine-hour shifts at a pharmaceutical factory.
</P>
<P>
   She said Golemo promised her the funds would be shipped to her
relatives in Poland and placed in a bank account as part of the
services he offered at his Worcester travel agency.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, authorities charge that Golemo, wanted on warrants
charging him with larceny and fraudulent securities sales, pocketed
the money and took off. Authorities have said they believe that
Golemo may have swindled more than 50 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's made my family suffer very, very much,'' Demma said. She
said three nephews, her sister, and her brother, who also allegedly
lost his life's savings, fell prey to Golemo.
</P>
<P>
   Before he eluded authorities, Golemo was a prominent figure in
the Polish immigrant community in Massachusetts' second largest
city.
</P>
<P>
   He ran a television repair shop, a video store, a food company,
and a local market that he called home to the best kielbasa ``this
side of Krakow.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard Potash, an attorney representing Demma and some of
Golemo's other alleged victims, said Golemo ran a money transfer
business out of his travel agency. He collected a fee to ship the
funds through the National Bank of Poland to his customers'
relatives back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``He also claimed to some of them that he would invest their
money and get them high rates of interest,'' Potash said. ``The
money was never invested.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are basically people who are essentially blue-collar
workers, who worked hard to earn their money and these are their
life savings,'' Potash said. ``And they may never recover their
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Demma said she trusted Golemo because earlier transfers for
smaller amounts made it back to Poland just as he had promised.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was going to send the money like he did before,''
Demma said. ``I signed the check and he cashed it. I wanted to
settle down and life comfortably, not day by day like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Conte's office has said it is seeking the help of the Justice
Department to determine how and whether there is a way to prosecute
Golemo.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's long gone and we just have a very sad situation,'' said
John W. Spillane, the attorney who represented Golemo's wife,
Danuta E. Golemo, when she was acquitted in a related larceny case
in 1977.

GILLEY RELEASES HONKY-TONK'S BEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Say the word ``Gilley's'' and it still summons memories of
the ``Urban Cowboy'' film shot there in 1980, back when John
Travolta followed up his blockbuster role in ``Saturday Night
Fever'' by donning a cowboy hat and taking a ride on the mechanical
bull that made Gilley's such a tourist attraction in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Gilley's was dubbed the ``world's largest honky-tonk'' and was
registered that way in the Guinness Book of Records. It was a
6,000-capacity, 48,000-square-foot club in suburban Houston _ and a
``must'' stop for country performers from Faron Young and Ernest
Tubb, to Loretta Lynn, Emmylou Harris, and Rosanne Cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it was or wasn't the largest honky-tonk didn't
matter,'' co-owner Mickey Gilley says with a laugh. ``I submitted
the listing and I got it.'' He concedes that Billy Bob's in Fort
Worth ``could have been bigger,'' but it's an academic argument
because Gilley's burned down 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But not before Gilley, a nationally known entertainer and a
cousin of Jerry Lee Lewis, saved 1,000 rolls of 24-track tape
filled with performances that had aired on the ``Live at Gilley's''
radio show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took them home and stored them in my garage, where I kept my
buses,'' says Gilley, who is hoping to open a new Gilley's in
Dallas someday.
</P>
<P>
   After years of tracking down licensing approval from the artists
and finding the right record label fit, he has managed to transform
his tapes into a one-of-a-kind boxed set, ``Live at Gilley's,'' on
Q Records (distributed by Atlantic). It's a four-volume set
lovingly compiled by producers Alan Rubens and Clark Enslin, who
rightly call it the largest collection of previously unreleased
country music in the world _ and all of it done on the same
recording console at Gilley's.
</P>
<P>
   The new box has everything from Willie Nelson's classic ballad
``Crazy'' and Jerry Lee Lewis's ``Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On,''
to Ed Bruce's ``Mamas Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys''
and Loretta Lynn's ``Out of My Head and Back in My Bed.''
Lesser-known artists Razzy Bailey, Moe Bandy, and Dave and Sugar
are represented, as are legends like Carl Perkins and Fats Domino.
And, of course, honky-tonkers such as Johnny (``Take This Job and
Shove It'') Paycheck and Gilley himself (with ``Roomful of Roses'')
are in the mix.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the boxed set the last word on Gilley's. Individual live
albums from Paycheck, Domino, Perkins, and the Bellamy Brothers
have also been released. And two more live albums by Lewis and
Bobby Bare come out Aug. 3.
</P>
<P>
   All of this from a club that has been gone for a decade _ much
to the regret of Gilley, whose days there ended in a feud with a
partner whom he couldn't persuade to spend more money on
maintaining the property.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that Gilley's would have ever run its course, if
more money had been invested,'' he says. ``The parking lot had
holes in it and the building had deteriorated. And the lighting and
sound systems were outdated.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, in its glory days, Gilley's was the place to go in Texas;
witness the sign on the door that read: ``Through these doors pass
the greatest entertainers and customers in the world.'' Gilley
often played there and his band featured former Boston guitarist
Rocky Stone, a onetime mainstay with Boston's Chuck McDermott and
Wheatstraw. (Stone, who originally came from Rhode Island, was
immortalized in ``Urban Cowboy'' when Gilley said ``Take it away,
Rocky Stone'' during a solo. Stone died of a stroke last year.)
</P>
<P>
   The peak for Gilley's came with ``Urban Cowboy,'' the 1980 film
whose story was developed from an Aaron Latham piece in Esquire
magazine. Gilley was skeptical that a film would ever come of it,
but ``I became a believer when I saw those trucks roll in from
Paramount.''
</P>
<P>
   While some observers later felt that ``Urban Cowboy'' had a
mixed impact on country music (attracting trendies who didn't stick
around), Gilley still waxes ecstatic when he talks about the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``It brought a lot of people into country music that would never
have heard it,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   As for the historical impact of Gilley's, the club is often
viewed as the transition point where the more traditional country
music gave way to the crossover country-rock that is popular in the
'90s.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Gilley, who just turned 63, rarely tours because he
owns his own theater in Branson, Mo., where he prefers to perform.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pulling in 800-1,000 people a day,'' he says. ``There's
no point for me to go out on the road. This way, I don't have to
pay an agency and I don't have to worry about buses breaking down.
I'm very happy with the way things are.''

THERE IS A NEW, HOPEFUL CLIMATE IN THE MIDEAST A new era is
announcing itself in the Middle East. It may be that the yearning
to get on with the effort for peace and development has inflated
hopes. But the belief that there really is a new chance is itself
an important part of the climate change. The focus is on Israel's
new Prime Minister, Ehud Barak. By Flora Lewis. 800 words.

BELLYDANCING FEVER SPREADS AT GYMS Belly dancing usually has its
place in dimly lit clubs, thick with incense and the beat of drums.
It is believed to have originated in what is now northern India and
spread throughout eastern Europe and into northern Africa 700 years
ago, mixing with indigenous dance forms. Now urban gyms have
tailored the dance into a legitimate workout, good for
coordination, endurance, balance and toning. By Amanda Hesser. New

 &HT;    There are few better ways to make a living
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ There are four professions whose
practitioners generally take pride in what they do, though the rest
of humanity views them in a somewhat lesser light.
</P>
<P>
   _ Politicians.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cops.
</P>
<P>
   _ Journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians are considered to be at the bottom of the heap among
these four professions. The word itself, ``politician,'' is used as
an insult, second only to calling someone a liberal. The worst
insult these days is ``liberal politician.'' Candidates try to win
election by avowing that ``I'm not a politician,'' a contradiction
in terms since the very act of seeking elective office defines one
as a politician. Perversely, I admire people who view politics as a
noble calling, even when I don't agree with them. If devoting one's
life to playing some small part in running the greatest country on
earth isn't a noble calling, then what is?
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean there aren't scalawags in politics, probably
too many. But I'm not sure there are any more scumbags in politics
than in plumbing, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers. Bless their hearts. Search the Internet sometime for
lawyer jokes. Even Aggies don't have as many jokes told about them.
Most are pretty darned funny, too.
</P>
<P>
   Some of my best friends are lawyers. They work hard arguing
cases, protecting clients' interests, recovering damages when
warranted, and prosecuting or defending those who have been accused
of committing crimes. I know many fine people who are lawyers, and
I have known a few lawyers I wouldn't spit on if they were on fire.
Again, it's not much different than the plumbing profession,
percentagewise, in my view.
</P>
<P>
   Cops. Cops and journalists are often at loggerheads. We have
different agendas. Their job is to enforce the law, put the bad
eggs in jail and keep the peace. Our job is to report what
happened. Sometimes that conflicts with what a police officer is
doing. The cop thinks the case might be a bit stronger if we don't
write a story until the officer is ready for a story to be written.
My standard answer is, ``If you won't try to run the newspaper, I
won't try to be a police officer.'' A newspaper is not an agency of
law enforcement, any more than it's an agency of the city
commission, the school board or the football team. We're not the
booster club; we're journalists.
</P>
<P>
   All that said, I have an abiding admiration for police officers.
Like most journalists, they work long hours for mediocre pay _
nights, weekends and holidays. People are always yelling at them.
Their spouses wonder why they don't find a less stressful line of
work.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is that we journalists rarely put our lives at
risk. Most days, we don't worry about getting shot or assaulted.
Cops face that risk every day, and that's why I hold them in high
esteem even when they're mad at me for putting something in the
newspaper they wish had been kept out. Or even when they're jerks.
Refer to the plumbing analogy, if you will.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings me to journalists. I'm proud of having been in this
line of work more or less steadily since I was 13, more than three
decades. Luckily, there aren't many journalist jokes. But maybe
even more than politicians, cops and lawyers, we're fair game
because, at least in the print media, what we write is there
forever for everyone to see. And sometimes we write really dumb
things, or we spell names wrong, get facts wrong, or make
grammatical or spelling errors. As a beleaguered editor for this
newspaper put it about 90 years ago, ``An editor is a man who is
liable to grammatical blunders, toothache, typographical errors and
lapses of memory, and usually he has half a million people watching
to catch him tripping. And yet the world is full of people who want
to be editors.''
</P>
<P>
   And, yes, I have seen more than my share of folks who had no
business working for a newspaper. They couldn't get basic facts
right, or they were lousy writers, or they simply lacked integrity
and fairness. The percentage is not much different from plumbing, I
figure.
</P>
<P>
   Watching a newspaper created from scratch each day, to steal a
phrase from politics, is like watching sausage being made. It's
fast, sometimes ugly, a bit frenetic and too often some adulterated
content slips into the product. Luckily, we get to start anew the
next morning. All we can do is try to do a little better the next
day, aware we'll never be perfect, but that we must be fair and
honest and acknowledge our mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   I can't think of a better way to make a living.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Seedlings of peace growing again under Barak
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Trying to forecast Middle East politics would unnerve even the
most brazen soothsayer, but for what they are worth, the early
portents from the change in Israeli governments are promising.
</P>
<P>
   A caution, however: Even if the good intentions that seem to be
breaking out all around are genuine, don't expect peace on a
platter next week. The issues are real and difficult and won't be
resolved by even a thick salve of warm feelings.
</P>
<P>
   A rapprochement in the region has been elusive for more reasons
than the perversity of the parties titularly involved in the hunt
for it.
</P>
<P>
   That said, some of the players usually busily engaged in making
the difficult impossible are currently on their good behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Syrian hard case Hafez Assad has moved from unapproachable to
hard-to-get, sensing a deal with Israel might finally bring a
return of the Golan Heights. (And by loosening international
sanctions, help an economy that Assad's policies have trashed.)
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah militants at the Lebanon border have stopped harrying
Israeli troops. Lebanon is run second-hand from Syria, and Assad
turns Hezbollah on and off like a water tap. Jordan's new king,
Abdullah, is playing honest broker between Jerusalem and Damascus,
apparently with Israel's encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian President
Yasser Arafat have met three times and if not yet productively _
they don't see eye-to-eye so far even on the threshold issue of
when to implement the Wye River accords _ they are talking free of
the gut dislike that marked sessions between Arafat and the
previous prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   As the Netanyahu government said Arafat could if he would _ and
to that government's credit insisted that he do _ the Palestinian
has kept the yearning terrorists in his population on ice. (Though
some of the worst are scimitar-rattling again.)
</P>
<P>
   Israel, tendering goodwill gestures, has canceled threats to
close Orient House, with its Palestinian offices, in East Jerusalem
and has freed up East Jerusalem residency permits for some
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The Barak government has cut subsidies to ideologically
motivated Jewish settlements in the West Bank and recently acted
forcefully to remove extremist settlers who tried to create an ad
hoc encampment, strong warning to a movement that, under Netanyahu,
was allowed to create ``new facts on the ground'' _ each of which
complicated, as all were meant to, any effort to create a coherent
Palestinian homeland.
</P>
<P>
   In that, crucially, Barak is making it clear that Israeli policy
is firmly in hand and will not continue to be the patsy of
pre-emptive Israeli rejectionists. Netanyahu seemed helpless
against his own disparate and unstable coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has asked Washington to back off the role of peace
provocateur that it felt it had to play during Netanyahu's balky
tenure, in favor of letting the region's contenders thrash matters
out themselves. At the moment, there are signs they just might be
able to do that.

 &HT;    Cornwell's character gets close, personal
 &HT;    By Meggen Lindsay
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ While Patricia Cornwell packs ``Black Notice''
with her standard intensity and gore, both are subdued by Virginia
chief medical examiner Kay Scarpetta's lingering grief. It is
Christmas in Virginia, but the spirit is lacking as Scarpetta still
mourns the death of her FBI lover, Benton Wesley (``Point of
Origin,'' 1998).
</P>
<P>
   With her cherished niece Lucy out to prove something in a
perilous undercover police investigation and a power-hungry new
deputy chief trying to take control while bumping her longtime cop
buddy Capt. Pete Marino from his position, Scarpetta hopes things
can't get much worse.
</P>
<P>
   They do.
</P>
<P>
   When she can't identify the cause of death of a body found in a
locked and sealed container aboard a ship, it doesn't strike alarm
_ until the same kind of fine, animal-like hairs that were on the
corpse on the ship turn up on the body of a brutally murdered store
clerk. The killings extend to Europe, and Scarpetta and sidekick
Marino are summoned to Interpol's headquarters in France, where
they receive secret orders and information that could endanger
their careers, not to mention their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Scarpetta's home front turns tumultuous as well, as she
discovers that someone has been sending slanderous e-mails online,
using her name. As office sabotage progresses and the plots mingle,
Scarpetta is at her most vulnerable, yet she holds her head high
and plows through the danger.
</P>
<P>
   This story lets the reader into the more personal side of
Scarpetta and the supporting characters. Love may return for her as
the beginning of a new interest sparks _ business meets pleasure
(sort of) in France. Emotions run even higher as she and Lucy
quarrel and the concerned aunt fears for Lucy's mind-set _ she is
not handling her grief over Benton's death in a ``healthy'' way.
</P>
<P>
   While much of the plot is unbelievable, it's captivating enough
to make the reader suspend disbelief until the book is closed for
the final time. It's as deliciously creepy as Cornwell usually is,
but a lot is going on here apart from the mystery. It's not the
best book in the series, but it's definitely high on the list, and
well worth the read this summer.

 &HT;    Female lead takes the case in `Malice'
 &HT;    By Laura Dempsey
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ It's sometimes tough to wade into a series
midstream, several books after the recurring characters and base
settings have been well established. It can be tough, but it can be
invigorating when the series in question seems worthwhile. That's
the case with ``Acts of Malice,'' the fifth in a series of legal
whodunits written by a pair of sisters _ Pamela and Mary
O'Shaughnessy _ under the pen name Perri O'Shaughnessy.
</P>
<P>
   The focus is Nina Reilly, a workaday lawyer in Lake Tahoe who's
forged a good reputation in her slightly renegade solo practice. A
cynical and stoic secretary keeps things running as Reilly shuttles
from tough case to single motherhood and back again, raising a
teen-age son and a dog the best she can while handling tricky
defenses and mundane paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Acts of Malice,'' Reilly is hired to defend Jim Strong,
whose younger brother Alex died in what was originally ruled a
skiing accident before the rickety old coroner found evidence of
some lethal chest stomping. The case against Jim is shaky _ the
very idea that a man would stomp his brother to death is hard to
stomach _ but his family's refusal to rally around and his wife's
outright accusation make it less clear-cut for Reilly.
</P>
<P>
   But even a morally ambiguous client would be too simple for this
book: Reilly falls in love with the prosecuting attorney, a man who
left town under the cloud of some type of nervous breakdown,
slightly breaking her heart. The defense attorney and the
prosecutor are sleeping together; the defendant is either a
psychopath or the victim of some cruel conspiracy; the secretary is
acting really weird; and the son wants to go to Germany to visit
his dad _ such a bunch of loose ends to tie, but the O'Shaughnessy
sisters manage quite well. They even throw in a sub-subplot
involving an insurance settlement and a woman with a gambling
problem, but that's just to show Reilly's soft professional side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Acts of Malice'' is a good story, well told. It's a fine
summer read with a strong female lead _ that and a glass of
lemonade will get you through a summer weekend.

 &HT;    Mourning the death of a fine attorney
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ A good man died too young this month. John
Mitchell, the district judge in San Augustine, died while on
vacation in Mexico. He was 51. It's unclear if he drowned or
suffered a heart attack. Whatever happened, that little county will
feel his loss, as of course will his friends and family.
</P>
<P>
   My first dealings with John came about a week after I moved
there in 1982 to run the San Augustine Rambler, a tiny weekly in a
town that had two newspapers and 3,000 people. He was city attorney
then, and just a few days after my arrival I covered a city council
meeting where the council blatantly ignored the Open Meetings Act
and went into secret session, just like they'd been used to doing.
I challenged them for doing so, wrote a scathing editorial about
it, and in that editorial pointed out that Mitchell hadn't said
anything to the council about their disregard for the laws of
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   It made a bit of a wave, this wet-behind-the-ears newcomer
raising sand not long after getting the U-Haul unpacked. Further, I
was renting a house from the mayor, who lived next door. Eviction
seemed a possibility, though my fears proved misplaced. I was
nervous, being all of 26 years old, as to how my diatribe would be
perceived, especially when John was the Rotary Club speaker the day
after the paper came out. He was giving a talk on estate planning,
as I recall. I was covering it for the paper, Rotary Club speeches
being newsworthy in a town where not much happens day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   I stood up to take his picture to go with the story, and John
stopped, grinned and drawled that he hoped his coverage in The
Rambler was going to be a bit more favorable next week than it had
been this week. I realized then that I was dealing with someone a
cut above the usual small-town lawyer. The city council, to my
knowledge, never broke the rules after that, and John and I soon
became friends.
</P>
<P>
   Not close friends, understand, but we ran in the same circles
and hung out at various small-town events _ barbecues, the
livestock show, the annual trip to Houston for the rodeo and
cookoff. John and his wife, Lucy, gave the best parties in the
county, held at the old San Augustine railroad depot, which they
had bought and moved onto their farm.
</P>
<P>
   I admired John from somewhat of a distance. He was a hometown
boy who went off, got a law degree from the University of Texas,
married a fine woman and came home to practice small-town law and
help run the family title company. His brother, Charles, now
district attorney, joined not long after. During those dark years
when the Aggies kicked our tails every season, John, Charles, the
Oglesbees and me were the few Teasips in a town dominated in its
college alumni ranks by Aggies.
</P>
<P>
   John seemed to instinctively know how to be a small-town lawyer,
when to hold them and when to fold them. He effected that slow,
Southern speech and deliberate way of speaking and found so much
about life in a small town to be humorous, without being mean or
malicious about it. There was no doubt he genuinely loved that town
and its people, foibles and all.
</P>
<P>
   He and Lucy and their kids lived in town in a fine old house,
and he raised cows on the family place a few miles out of town. I
can blame him and then-County Judge Jack Nichols for me getting a
wild hair and buying cows once in a misguided fit of romanticism,
though it didn't take me long to realize I had about as much
business raising cows as I would have doing brain surgery. They
grew up in the business, and I was a dumb rank amateur.
</P>
<P>
   I rarely saw John in the past 10 years, once or twice as best I
can recall. My life had changed _ a busy job and different family
obligations. I always had it in the back of my head to sneak across
the river sometime and watch him run a courtroom, a job he'd won
since I left 12 years ago. Unfortunately, I never got around to it.
</P>
<P>
   I'm confident he was a fine judge. He had the level-headedness
and intellect, combined with the earthy common-sense that it takes
to dispense justice. I'm sure he found humor in much of what he saw
pass before his bench and that he had compassion when it was
justified.
</P>
<P>
   There's not much else to say, other than I mourn for the pain
his death causes his family and friends. It's a cliche that only
the good die young, but damned if it doesn't seem to be true.

 &HT;    Remember when skates had keys?
 &HT;    By Ernest Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDITOR'S NOTE: Remember when life seemed to be simpler? Before
faxes and e-mail and CDs and VCRs, we traveled at a slower pace.
Here's some readers' recollections of the way we were ...
</P>
<P>
   Gene Currier of Tuscaloosa, Ala., who writes he was ``raised
up'' in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Seattle, proves some things
were universal. He remembers:
</P>
<P>
   _ When we all stood in the schoolyard and recited the Pledge of
Allegiance as our flag was raised each morning.
</P>
<P>
   _ When Burma Shave signs adorned every highway.
</P>
<P>
   _ When a long distance phone call was something special.
</P>
<P>
   _ When roller skates had four wheels, clamped onto regular shoes
and were tightened with a skate key.
</P>
<P>
   _ When neighborhood grocery stores took your order by phone and
delivered it to your kitchen door the same day.
</P>
<P>
   _ When school didn't start until after Labor Day and basketball
season ended in February.
</P>
<P>
   _ When banks closed at 3 p.m. Monday through Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Woods, of Modesto, Calif., remembers:
</P>
<P>
   _ When white sugar was caramelized in an iron skillet to make
``brown sugar.''
</P>
<P>
   _ When the children took turns bathing in the wash tub and used
the same water.
</P>
<P>
   _ When mustard plaster was used for a chest cold and bread
dipped in milk was applied to an infected area.
</P>
<P>
   R. Norrod, of Lufkin, Texas, remembers:
</P>
<P>
   _ When you had to slice your own bread.
</P>
<P>
   _ When you had to color your own margarine.
</P>
<P>
   _ When you might see a Packard, Studebaker, Nash, DeSoto,
Hornet, Edsel, Essex or Model-T driving down the street and no one
thought anything of it.
</P>
<P>
   _ When a web site was where a spider might build her trap.
</P>
<P>
   _ When windshield wipers worked on vacuum and slowed down when
you went up a hill.
</P>
<P>
   _ When you had to wind a watch.
</P>
<P>
   Jynger Garcia, of Riverbank, Calif., will be attending her 40th
high school class reunion in Long Beach, Calif., this October and
remembers:
</P>
<P>
   _ When all drug stores had a soda fountain and chocolate Cokes
were a treat.
</P>
<P>
   _ When girls cold not wear pants to school.
</P>
<P>
   _ When all houses had clothes lines in the back yard and clothes
had to be ironed.
</P>
<P>
   _ When you dialed a phone _ not pushed buttons _ and you knew a
human would answer.
</P>
<P>
   Faye Brown, of Moundville, Ala., remembers:
</P>
<P>
   _ When kids were embarrassed to take a sausage and biscuit
wrapped in a page from the Sears and Roebuck catalog to school for
lunch.
</P>
<P>
   _ When you got your Christmas tree from the pasture instead of a
parking lot or grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   _ When no one ever bought new clothes for wearing for ``play.''
Play clothes started out as church clothes which became school
clothes, which became ``knock-about'' and then did they finally
become play clothes.
</P>
<P>
   _ When there was no pre-sweetened cereal. In fact the cereal of
choice was corn bread crumbled in a glass of milk.
</P>
<P>
   _ When you played baseball among the bitterweeds and cow piles,
and without a uniform.
</P>
<P>
   _ When if you were lucky enough to have a phone, you shared it
with several families and your ring was ``two shorts and a long.''
</P>
<P>
   What do you recall about the ``good old days''? Send your
remembrances to Ernest Murray, managing editor of The Lufkin Daily
News. E-mail: emurray(at)coxnews.com. Mailing address: P.O. Box

 &HT;    It's his job, and he's sticking to it
 &HT;    By Arnold Garcia
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Alex Gonzalez was in a world of pain when he
penned a letter announcing his intent to retire. The West Texan
underwent two surgeries this year to relieve extensive nerve damage
and thought he just wouldn't be able to continue working.
</P>
<P>
   As he recuperated, however, he began feeling better and changed
his mind about retiring. He tried to take the letter back only to
be told he couldn't. Gonzalez vows to go to court to keep his job.
</P>
<P>
   This is one employment dispute with a very long reach. You see,
Gonzalez is no ordinary employee.
</P>
<P>
   He's a state district judge with time left on his term. And the
letter went to Gov. George W. Bush. The governor's staff takes the
position that Gonzalez resigned and his resignation was accepted
and are proceeding with the search for a successor.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez says that once a successor is found, the governor is
going to have to take legal action to remove him, because he's not
leaving.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided to withdraw my retirement and called the governor's
office to let them know. They didn't like it,'' Gonzalez said.
``It's a matter of principle. I'm an elected official and I want to
serve out my term. The governor can't dictate when my term ends.''
</P>
<P>
   The area of Texas over which Gonzalez presides is closest to the
Hollywood image of the state _ lots of mesas, cactus and attitude.
People out there don't take kindly to being pushed around and
jealously guard their right to be left alone.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking for the governor, Linda Edwards replied that the staff
takes the position that Gonzalez's letter was a resignation and
treated as such. He can't take it back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our belief is that a retirement is tantamount to
resignation,'' Edwards said, adding that allowing Gonzalez to
rescind his resignation would set a bad precedent.
</P>
<P>
   What if he doesn't leave once an appointee is selected?
</P>
<P>
   ``If (Gonzalez) chooses not to vacate, the governor or the
attorney general could take legal action.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a situation that has a lot of ramifications beyond the
legal ones. It puts the governor in the position of attempting to
shoo out an elected judge. Bush has been steadfast in his support
of electing judges.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the flavor of this little saga of power, principle and
politics are the facts that Gonzalez is both Hispanic and
Republican. Appointed to the bench by Gov. Mark White in 1984,
Gonzalez switched parties ``about five years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor has gotten a lot of mileage out of the Texas and
national press with his outreach to Latinos. Gonzalez was the first
Hispanic to assume the bench in that part of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez's vow not to go quietly could have a political reach
far beyond the Trans-Pecos country where the 84th State District
court is located.
</P>
<P>
   C/CNN, the Compadre/Comadre News Network that links the Latino
communities around the state will trump whatever spin the
governor's campaign puts on it.
</P>
<P>
   And no doubt, the state's judiciary will be watching closely
events as they unfold. The state's judges have a stake in this as
well.
</P>
<P>
   So, if you look west, you'll see a storm brewing.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Seniors need an Rx for prescription drug costs
 &HT;    For release Aug. 1, 1999.
 &HT;    By HOWARD KLEINBERG
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Inasmuch as the company I have worked for has blessed me with an
outstanding medical plan that includes a significant reimbursement
on prescription drugs, I have been somewhat indifferent to the
plight of senior citizens and poor people.
</P>
<P>
   In the last years of their lives, my parents _ who had no
prescription drug coverage; neither Medicare nor their secondary
insurance provided any _ would cheat on their drugs, as do so many
other senior citizens. If the prescription called for a daily dose,
they cut the pill in half to save money.
</P>
<P>
   As the cost of prescription drugs became prohibitive to them,
and I discovered they were cutting their pills in half, I began
paying for my parents' prescriptions rather than they cheat
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   I never had to cheat myself, and often a doctor would defend his
writing of costly prescriptions by reminding me that I was insured
for them.
</P>
<P>
   The other day, however, I decided to take note of my
prescriptions and evaluate how much a day I would be paying had I
not had insurance.
</P>
<P>
   It was stunning. I wonder how anybody on Social Security, with
no prescription insurance, can make it.
</P>
<P>
   My health is middling for a guy my age. I'm in my second year of
Medicare backed by my company policy. I'm taking medication for
Type 2 diabetes, a cholesterol problem and a digestion situation.
At this age level, these problems are not uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom-line cost of my prescriptions comes to $15.76 a day.
That's $472.80 a month, $5,752.40 a year! With so many living on a
Social Security payment that provides in the vicinity of $14,500 a
year, there's little left for the rent, food, transportation and
backup medical insurance.
</P>
<P>
   One drug I take, for Type 2 diabetes, is retailing at $4.74 a
pill. Another, for cholesterol, is $3.19 daily, while a stomach
pill is costing $3.98 a day. Throw a few others in for allergy and
such, and the adding machine stops at $15.76 a day.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has been a major advocate of prescription drug
funding for Medicare beneficiaries. In a speech in July in
Michigan, Clinton said that 75 percent of elderly Americans
``either have no drug coverage at all, or coverage that is
unstable, unaffordable and rapidly disappearing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican tax-cut bill offers a bone to prescription drugs
for Medicare beneficiaries _ a small tax writeoff.
</P>
<P>
   Drug companies, meanwhile, are fighting the president's
position. Knowing full well that Medicare will not pay the
outrageous prices being charged for medication, they argue that any
dimunition of drug profits will arrest their abilities for
research.
</P>
<P>
   I would agree that such might be the case. I wonder, however,
how much money could be diverted from ballyhoo to research. For
more than a couple of years, a particular antihistamine has been
advertised heavily in national publications, including offering a
$5 discount for getting your doctor to prescribe it for you.
Likewise, a capsule to keep your stomach calm.
</P>
<P>
   Those who take the drugs say it works wonders for them; I take
the one for the stomach and can attest to its potency. But what I
would challenge is how much the pharmaceutical companies spend on
advertising and promotion for some of their drugs (and how many
rewards they give doctors for prescribing them), as opposed to how
much they might lose if Medicare payments _ i.e., if rational
prices were applied to prescription drugs _ became a significant
factor in the income.
</P>
<P>
   Shifting some of that heavy advertising over to research might
be a consideration.
</P>
<P>
   The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America
recently noted that America's aging population _ growing rapidly _
is the target for almost 600 new drugs reaching the market.
</P>
<P>
   If drug manufacturers need to spend money on research,
development and promotion, they simply include it in the cost of
the drug. But the patient has nowhere to turn. And, as the patient
ages, his or her income begins to decline in most cases. Soaring
drug costs against diminishing income is not a formula for what are
supposed to be the Golden Years.
</P>
<P>
   For those of us fortunate to have reimbursement for our drugs,
the Golden Years are a lot more palatable than for those who don't;
those who cut their pills in half, take them maybe once every three
days, or can't afford them at all.
</P>
<P>
   Heed the president on this one.

 &HT;    What does John Cornyn's future hold?
 &HT;    By Dave McNeely
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ If you went to Central Casting for someone tos
up in 2002, and while he certainly hasn't said he's quitting, it
would not be completely surprising if, after 18 years, he decided
to do something else.
</P>
<P>
   As for governor, if current Gov. George W. Bush wins the
presidency, Lt. Gov. Rick Perry would become governor and,
presumably, seek re-election in 2002. Cornyn probably wouldn't look
at a race for lieutenant governor as a step up, but running for
governor or senator in 2006 would by no means be out of the
question.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn, as do most good incumbents barely sworn in, says he
loves his job. So that means the only race he'd consider would be
for re-election?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' Cornyn said, slowly smiling, ``never say never.''

 &HT;    What's ahead for travel? Let's trek into the future
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ In the last century, travelers explored
the world by boat and horse, often at great risk.
</P>
<P>
   Huge ocean liners appeared in the early part of this century _
the Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mary, the S.S. France _ and those
with money and wanderlust traveled in style.
</P>
<P>
   Air travel came in the 1940s, and only one grand liner, the
Queen Elizabeth 2, was left to travel between continents.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the super mega-liners are back, although most don't roam
the globe. Travelers are getting adventurous. They're scaling rock
cliffs, kayaking and hiking in far-flung places.
</P>
<P>
   What possibly could be next in the 21st century? Here's a peek
at the possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   OUT OF THIS WORLD: You've gone white-water rafting down the
Zambezi, and you've scaled mountains in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
   What's left to explore in the new millennium?
</P>
<P>
   The next step is space.
</P>
<P>
   Don't laugh. NASA is serious about space tourism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly the market demand is there. A lot of people would
like to go to space,'' says John Mankins, manager of NASA Advance
Concepts Studies.
</P>
<P>
   NASA has conducted studies to see how much people are willing to
spend to be space travelers. They found that a lot of people would
pay $1 million, but if the price went down to $100,000 or less,
there would be ``tens of thousands'' of people who would take that
giant leap for touristkind.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, NASA is trying to figure out how to bring the
costs down.
</P>
<P>
   NASA would like nothing better than to be host to a lot of
paying customers.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial development of space travel would help pay the bills,
Mankins says.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly when will the first tourists be free of gravity?
</P>
<P>
   ``If money were no object,'' says Mankins, ``it could be done in
a few years, but if they really wanted to make it a lot cheaper,
it's probably going to be at least 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   E-HOTELS: The two main amenities of hotels in the past have been
a nice firm bed and a window with a view.
</P>
<P>
   Guests at hotels in the next century may be able to choose their
view with computer-generated scenery. Want to see a beautiful
beach? Press a button.
</P>
<P>
   And the firmness of the bed will be adjusted electronically.
</P>
<P>
   Bedside ``butlers'' will allow guests to adjust window curtains,
room temperature, TV, and even the bathtub water.
</P>
<P>
   Faculty members at the Conrad N. Hilton College of Hotel and
Restaurant Management at the University of Houston are testing ways
to pamper the stressed-out travelers of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   Ideas include mattresses that are electronically controlled for
firmness and support, white noise, soundproof rooms, virtual
reality entertainment centers, and alarm clocks that will wake
guests up with light.
</P>
<P>
   Special lighting will help long-distance travelers adjust to new
time zones.
</P>
<P>
   FEEL (at) HOME: Other trends sure to be strong in the next
century include a focus on the business traveler and families.
</P>
<P>
   Business suites will feature ``work zones'' that have high
intensity lighting, easily accessible data ports and electric
outlets, high-speed Internet access, free local calls and
long-distance access.
</P>
<P>
   Families often were ignored in the past. Now they're sought out.
Travelodge's Bear's Den rooms, a concept introduced in 10 cities,
offers kid-friendly amenities such as a child's chair, Sleepy Bear
bedspread, VCR, and a Sleepy Bear toy to take home.
</P>
<P>
   Women also are another largely untapped market. The Arizona
Biltmore in Phoenix started a Ladies Choice package when research
showed women like to have a timeout from jobs, husbands and
children. The package includes spa services, cooking classes, golf
clinics and more. Other hotels are sure to follow.

 &HT;    Bright flash of Columbia helps carve away much darker image
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ I've told the story many times to impress children
about how quickly information moves. With each passing year they're
less impressed.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of Jan. 28, 1986, I was in the newsroom when a
pressman brought the unbelievable: ``The space shuttle blew up.''
</P>
<P>
   At the nearest terminal I pulled up The Associated Press. There
was the first bulletin. We hustled to the newsroom TV. There on CNN
was a patch of ocean and shards of white splashing into it.
</P>
<P>
   Challenger _ or its pieces _ wasn't out of the sky yet and news
of its demise had sped around the world. That's how fast
information travels, kids.
</P>
<P>
   For all these years the fatal plume of that obliterated ship has
been bookmarked in our minds. Now I have another image that won't
be dislodged.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night just past 10, gawking Central Texans got a most
spectacular scene _ shuttle Columbia speeding through Earth's
atmosphere on its way to a Cape Canaveral landing.
</P>
<P>
   A full moon still awaiting mankind's return helped light the
way.
</P>
<P>
   Over Central Texas, Columbia came from the west, shedding heat
and light like a giant pop-bottle rocket. Only this rocket didn't
pop, didn't stop at its apex. It made a giant croquet wicket above
us, a jet-trail-like path. Horizon to horizon, it took 30 seconds,
or less.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty minutes later it had touched down. I didn't have to rush
downtown to the newsroom for the latest. I pulled up the news on
the home computer. No wonder speedy-information tales don't hold a
young audience anymore. But scenes like these in the sky do. My
youngest son was talking about it far into the night.
</P>
<P>
   People fortunate enough to see Columbia streak across the sky
were experiencing something tribal and primal. You could almost see
chariot wheels and winged steeds pulling the traveler.
</P>
<P>
   One was reminded of other moments when human endeavors in space
made us tingle: The night 30 summers ago when we trained binoculars
and junior telescopes on a moon with fresh human footprints. Twelve
summers earlier we'd tracked ominous Sputnik across our skies.
</P>
<P>
   No, we haven't been back to the moon since 1972. But space
travel is becoming something routine, akin to the wire-service
transmissions that don't impress so many. The mission of Columbia
was aimed at placing an X-ray telescope into orbit. Future shuttles
will deliver parts of the International Space Station.
</P>
<P>
   It's not as romantic, but any 1980s notion that the space
program has run aground are long debunked.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there will be budget skirmishes. And there should be.
Republican budget writers in the House voted to allocate NASA 10
percent less next year. President Clinton's proposal is essentially
a freeze.
</P>
<P>
   NASA has to accept limits, just as do other federal functions.
Space efforts are becoming international and collaborative, not us
vs. anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the Columbia crew have two women, including the
first female commander, Eileen Collins, it also had a French
mission specialist.
</P>
<P>
   The space program may be costly, may dabble on the fringes of
what we need to know to survive. But it's something we do because
we can't help it. It's who we are, what we do. We explore.

and publisher of the Nacogdoches Daily Sentinel.) EMBARGOED for

<P>
   GARCIA-COLUMN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ This is one employment dispute
with a very long reach. You see, Alex Gonzalez is no ordinary
employee. He's a state district judge with time left on his term.
And the resignation letter he wants back went to Gov. George W.
Bush. The governor's staff takes the position that Gonzalez
resigned and his resignation was accepted and are proceeding with
the search for a successor. (Arnold Garcia is editorial page editor
of the Austin American-Statesman) MOVED

   MCNEELY-COLUMN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ If you went to Central Casting
for someone to play a United States senator, you might well pick
John Cornyn. Gray hair, square jaw, big smile, tie in place over
starched collar, gold state-seal cufflinks _ and better yet, he's a
Texas attorney general. (McNeely, Austin American-Statesman) MOVED

   YOUNG-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ People fortunate enough to see
Columbia streak across the Texas sky to its landing the other day

 &HT;    LORD MAYOR OF LONDON TO VISIT SOUTHEASTERN U.S. FINANCIAL
CENTERS
 &HT;    With Photos.
 &HT;    For Use Sun., Aug. 1 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service(at) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Seeking better ties between the British capital's
financial community and the booming American Southeast, the lord
mayor of London will travel to Atlanta this week(8/5-6) to meet
with business and political leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Levene, also the lord of Portsoken, said last week(CQ)
that it is essential for London to reach out beyond the familiar
turf of New York City if it is to retain its position as one of the
world's foremost international financial center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe the United States begins and ends in
Manhattan,'' said Levene during an interview at the official
mayoral residence, Mansion House. ``We regard the (U.S.) Southeast
with Atlanta at the center of it as being enormously powerful and
very important. If you took the Southeast of the United States and
just ring fenced it, that in itself would probably be one of the
largest most important countries in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Levene intends to stop in Charlotte, N.C., to meet with
NationsBank Chairman Hugh McColl before arriving in Atlanta, where
he will meet with Gov. Roy Barnes. He also will meet with
executives from Wachovia and SunTrust banking companies, Insurance
Commissioner John Oxendine and representatives of the regional
transportation authority.
</P>
<P>
   The lord mayor said his message is simple: ``We want to persuade
banks, companies, financiers -- anyone who's interested in
international trade -- that they should look at London as the first
stop in the international financial world.''
</P>
<P>
   Also chairman of European investment for Deutsche Bank, Levene
is one of the most experienced business and political leaders to
serve in the largely ceremonial post of lord mayor. He was former
British Prime Minister John Major's adviser on efficiency and
effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   He is using his high profile to reassure the business world that
London has lost none of its luster even though Britain is the most
conspicuous European player to reject joining the unified currency.
The euro was initiated for banking and other electronic
transactions last January.
</P>
<P>
   Levene said the city's financial center has been affected little
by the Euro. ``The reason is that London is by far the most
important financial center in Europe, and we trade here whatever
financial instrument is trading, be it euros or dollars or yen or
anything else,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling with the lord mayor will be Max Taylor, the chairman
of Lloyd's of London; and Tim Carroll, the chairman of the
International Underwriters Association of London.
</P>
<P>
   After his business trip, which also includes stops in Miami and
San Francisco, Levene said he will vacation at his home on Sea
Island, where he has been a part-time resident for 14 years. ``I
have quite strong ties with Georgia because we also have a home
there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Levene is the last of his ancient line of lord mayors to hold
the post without the presence of an elected mayor, who will preside
over the city of 7.2 million beginning next year. London has never
before had a directly elected mayor or the level of autonomy
contemplated in its proposed new government.
</P>
<P>
   The election, a source of considerable political friction here,
will be held next May. Among the candidates is Jeffrey Archer, the
blockbuster novelist and member of the House of Lords.

POVERTY
 &HT;    With Photos.
 &HT;    EDs: For purposes of a locator map, Um Bateen is about 5 miles
northeast of Beersheva in the northern Negev desert.
 &HT;    For Use Sun., Aug. 1 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service(at) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UM BATEEN, Israel _ The Bedouin in the Abu Kaf family raise
camels and goats, grow their own food and value the
self-sufficiency they have on their desert hillside.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are satisfied with our lives. We just want to stay on our
land,'' said 52-year-old Talal Abu Kaf, seated on carpets on the
land where his family has lived for hundreds of years.
</P>
<P>
   About 3,500 Bedouin live in here in Um Bateen, where the water
arrives in black tubes that snake from house to house and
barefooted children fly kites fashioned from scraps of trash.
</P>
<P>
   But, as far as the Israeli government is concerned, Um Bateen
barely exists. The village is one of about 45 Bedouin settlements
in the Negev Desert that remains unrecognized by the government and
therefore denied its own local government or services such as
electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Bedouin leaders hope Israel's month-old government will
give the 70,000 villagers in unrecognized settlements equal status
with their neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   They back a $123-million plan to recognize 16 additional
villages in Negev and upgrade the medical, educational and utility
services for them and others.
</P>
<P>
   Parliamentary candidates in the spring elections gave tentative
backing to the plan, but it is too early to tell if they will
implement it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every election they come here. After the election, everything
vanishes,'' said Alasam Atiah, chairman of the Regional Council for
the Unrecognized Negev Arab Villages. ``Now, we have some
connections, so maybe we can do something.''
</P>
<P>
   A key backer of the improvement plan was Labor Party
parliamentarian Yossi Beilin. More than 90 percent of the Bedouin
voted for Labor's Ehud Barak in his election as prime minister, but
Beilin's personal endorsement expressly did not bind his party to
the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``How fast we can deal with it, I cannot tell you,'' said Amir
Avramovitch, Beilin's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's Bedouin -- a Muslim Arab sub-group -- have long had
trouble fitting in with the modern Jewish state. For generations,
they roamed the Negev and Sinai deserts, traveling the feeding
routes of their camels and goats while authorities of the old
Ottoman Empire or British Colonial rule cared little about their
arid land.
</P>
<P>
   But, since they took over in 1948, Israeli authorities have
actively settled and industrialized the Negev. The desert's
development has been important as it comprises more than half of
Israel, a country about the size of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Bedouin need government permits to travel the routes of
their livestock and most have abandoned their nomadic ways. Many
rely on farming or, if they are not among the 50 percent of Bedouin
unemployed, they work in Israel's cities. Hundreds serve in the
Israeli army.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has taken most Bedouin land and knocked down their tents
and block homes. Technically, 16,000 Bedouin homes in the
unrecognized settlements are under threat of demolition. The
authorities usually just target occasional new structures, but that
has lead to near riots.
</P>
<P>
   The Bedouin say the government has taken 98 percent of their
land, sometimes offering paltry compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Their hold on the land is often more traditional than legal.
Clinton Bailey, who has studied them for more than 30 years, said
the Bedouin often fail to register their land because they crave
privacy and fear government taxation. Often, the land was not in
demand, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Conditions for the Bedouin lag far behind the rest of Israel.
According to a study by an Israeli think tank, the Negev Bedouin
infant mortality rate is 19 per 1,000 compared to just four per
1,000 for Jewish infants. Half the families live below the poverty
line.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Israel recognizes seven out of 52 Negev Bedouin
cities and only two of those are allowed Bedouin leadership. The
government gives them services in hopes other Bedouin will move
there rather than stay spread out where, the government maintains,
it is too hard to provide services.
</P>
<P>
   For moving to the recognized villages, the Bedouin can receive
modest subsidies, such as an acre of land and a few thousand
dollars. But, the recognized towns have high unemployment and
frequent disputes between families over their small plots of land.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Bedouin fear that the city life means forfeiting their
land, privacy and tent compounds, and exposing their traditions --
such as polygamy -- to possible extinction.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, unrecognized villages such as Um Bateen struggle with
a lack electricity, steady water supplies, high schools and
adequate health care centers. The Association for Civil Rights in
Israel, the country's largest independent civil rights group,
called last month(July) for better health care for the Negev
Bedouin.
</P>
<P>
   Moti Zaken, adviser to the Israeli government on Arab affairs,
noted that the government recently started a five-year, $154
million plan to improve services for 50,000 Bedouin in northern
Israel. He said it is time to take care of the Negev, but the
Bedouin there are more dispersed and more attached to traditional
land claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much more complicated,'' he said. ``It's confronting the
Old World with the New World.''

   CHARLOTTE AMALIE, U.S. Virgin Islands _ These islands, bathed in
the warm tropical waters of the Atlantic and the Caribbean, are one
of the world's most popular tourist destinations. They boast
undulating verdant slopes, a host of duty-free shops and old
Danish-style buildings lining picturesque waterfronts.
</P>
<P>
   But there are sites locals are well aware of that -- hopefully
-- no tourist will ever see: the Bovoni and Anguilla landfills.
</P>
<P>
   The Bovoni Landfill, on the south side of St. Thomas island, is
an unsightly spectacle of junked cars, discarded appliances and
other garbage. Methane gases smolder underground, so much so that
pockets have exploded, spitting fireballs 30 feet into the air.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Anguilla Landfill on St. Croix towers 70 feet
high and is less than a half-mile from the Henry E. Rohlsen
International Airport. Aviation officials say birds attracted by
the garbage are endangering airplanes during take-offs and
landings.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do the landfills pose a risk to air travelers,
according to environmentalists, they also threaten local residents
who for years have complained of coughs, nausea, and stinging eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everyone here agrees on the need for new landfills.
That's not the problem. The problem is money. This U.S. territory
is broke.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to mismanagement, hurricane damage and falling tourism
revenues, the Virgin Islands government is burdened with at least
$1 billion in debt, an extraordinary sum for a population of
110,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``This government has been a notoriously big spender and, at the
same time, a poor planner,'' said Adlah Donastorg, chairman of the
territorial Senate Committee on Planning and Environmental
Protection and a critic of the lack of progress in addressing the
waste problem.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Gov. Charles Turnbull, who inherited a budget
deficit of more than $100 million, as well as a long-term debt of
$1 billion, when he took office last January, said the government
is searching for alternate sites to build landfills but that, so
far, no sites have been located.
</P>
<P>
   He said Turnbull has vowed to chip away at the debt with a
five-year ``austerity plan'' to be unveiled by September.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the three-island chain are saddled with an
extraordinary amount of trash.
</P>
<P>
   According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the
Virgin Islands generate 9.2 pounds of garbage per person per day,
more than double the U.S. mainland average of 4.4 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Excessive trash is partly the result of day-trippers who visit
the islands via cruise ship, as well as all the imported products
packaged in boxes and crates that must be disposed of.
</P>
<P>
   But the government has never implemented a recycling program,
nor has it charged dumping fees at the landfills that might have
incited residents to monitor the garbage generated.
</P>
<P>
   All this has left the landfills overwhelmed with garbage, so
much so that they attract birds that can smash airplane windscreens
and dent propellers.
</P>
<P>
   The landfill in St. Croix violates Federal Aviation
Administration rules that state any site attracting wildlife should
be kept five miles from any airport.
</P>
<P>
   To build a new landfill could cost as much as $70 million,
experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Not a small sum when the Virgin Islands government is struggling
to pay its utility bills. The debt-ridden U.S. territory owes $16
million for electricity and $17 million for water, according to the
Virgin Islands Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   The government can't even afford to maintain its fleet of public
buses, forcing locals to take the nicer, but more expensive tourist
buses.
</P>
<P>
   Irate at this, some critics blame the government _ which has a
budget of about $466 million _ for mismanaging its money.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Donastorg said the islands are represented by 15
senators, an unnecessarily high number. He said millions of dollars
could be saved by cutting the number to nine.
</P>
<P>
   Other observers say a bigger culprit to blame for the islands'
financial fix -- at least partly -- is a decline in the number of
overnight visitors, and the money they spend.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in 1994, before Hurricane Marilyn hit, visitors
spent $919 million. In 1996, after the hurricane, they spent only
$781 million.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the number of overnight visitors to the U.S.
territory fell from 555,000 in 1988 to 410,000 last year, a decline
of 26 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time the government is being robbed of essential
tourist dollars, it has spent some $250 million to rebuild on
hotels and other tourist facilities alone over the last four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Hurricane Marilyn, which damaged 80 percent of the
islands, we lost quite a lot of business, and it is taking time to
build that business back up again,'' said Beverly Nicholson,
executive director of the St. Thomas/St. John Hotel Association.
</P>
<P>
   Still, money or no money, Jim Casey, EPA's coordinator for the
Virgin Islands, insisted that some government action must be taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``The landfills don't comply with EPA rules,'' he said. ``These
are really dumps, and not landfills.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the government monitors what comes in to the landfills,
but that the waste is not screened. He said trash is not separated,
nor is it adequately covered.
</P>
<P>
   Casey said that, under an agreement with the FAA, the Anguilla
Landfill must be closed by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Bovoni Landfill will reach capacity within the
next five years. The EPA ordered the government in June to clean up
the site, which is in violation of the Clean Water Act because of
its damage to sensitive tidal salt flats and nearby mangrove
wetlands.
</P>
<P>
   ``These landfills really should have been closed in 1996, but
the money just hasn't been there to find an alternative,'' Casey
said. ``And it's also not easy to find alternative sites on such
tiny islands, so I'm not sure what the government is going to do.''

ELIMINATE THE IMMORAL MARRIAGE PENALTY

 &HT;    
 By MIKE McMANUS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Last week House Republicans pushed through a huge $792 billion
tax cut, largest since the Reagan era. It repealed the tax on
inheritances, paid by only one percent of taxpayers, but hardly
made a dent in the marriage tax penalty.
 &HT;    That has sparked outrage from a core of the Republican political
base: conservative pro-family groups who have been promised for
years that the tax penalty for married couples would be wiped out.
Some 21 million married couples with dual wage earners pay an
average of $1,400 in additional taxes compared to cohabiting
couples with the same income.
 &HT;    The House bill would only reduce the penalty by $240 year.
 &HT;    ''We at the Family Research Council believe that any tax reform
has to make as its crown jewel, the elimination of the marriage
penalty tax,'' said Janet Parshall, chief FRC spokesperson. ''But
we got very meager table scraps,'' she told me.
 &HT;    Dr. James Dobson, president of Focus on The Family, was furious
after the Ways and Means Committee reported its bill two weeks ago.
On a radio show aired by 2,000 stations, he recalled meeting with
several Republican leaders ''who have made promises they haven't
kept.'' He interviewed Parshall, who said the whole philosophy
behind the marriage penalty tax is ''immoral. It is our
government's way of saying, `We affirm you, cohabitants, over you,
man and wife.'''
 &HT;    Dobson said, ''I am very disgusted with Congress right now and
especially with the Republican Party, because they tell us year
after year that they are pro-family. But then, when it comes time
to vote, they run for the tall grass.''
 &HT;    Together, they urged listeners to call House Speaker Dennis
Hastert, House Majority Leader Dick Armey and others and gave their
phone numbers. The result? ''A deluge,'' reported the Los Angeles
Times. Callers to Hastert's office jammed phone lines.
 &HT;    However, the bill that passed the House contained the same tiny
change, of allowing a married couple to increase its standard
deduction from $7,200 to $8,600, exactly double the amount single
people can claim, $4,300. That would save $240 in taxes.
 &HT;    Left unchanged in the House bill is the major marriage penalty,
the structure of tax brackets which push couples into higher
brackets faster than individuals. For example, a husband and wife
who each have an income of $23,950 would pay part of their income
at a 28 percent rate, for a total tax bill of $8,563. But if they
were cohabiting couples, each would be taxed at 15%, and would pay
$3,592 each in taxes, for a combined tax of $7,184.
 &HT;    The Senate Finance Committee approved a bill last week that
would give married couples the option of filing as single people
after 2004. That demeans marriage but would eliminate that marriage
penalty of nearly $1,400 in the case above.
 &HT;    Rep. David McIntosh, R-Ind., says the present law has ''terrible
social consequences. People tell us that because of the extra tax,
they are not going to get married. Some have said they have gotten
divorced because of it.''
 &HT;    He sent me some of his E-mails from taxpayers: Harold Baird of
Nashville wrote: We are both in our middle 40's and have been
engaged for over 6 years. We decided not to get married due to the
fact that it would cost us almost $3,000 a year in extra tax
liability.
 &HT;    Doug Kirby says, ''My wife and I got refunds during the years we
were living together. When we got married we went from refunds to
having to pay hundreds of dollars in additional taxes.''
 &HT;    Could the marriage penalty be a factor in the nearly 1,000
percent growth of cohabiting couples, soaring from 439,000 in 1960
to 4,236,000 in 1998?
 &HT;    The Wall Street Journal notes that there is a ''marriage bonus''
in the tax code for 25 million couples in traditional households
with one wage earner. They pay $1,300 less than a single taxpayer.
The newspaper calls this ''singles discrimination.'' It would
prefer to lower tax rates for everyone, rather than to have any
preference for marriage in tax law.
 &HT;    America's leading economic newspaper seems ignorant of some
basic economics. First, one income is supporting two or more
people, which deserves some break.
 &HT;    Second, marriage has an economic value that deserves
encouragement. A forthcoming book, ''The Case For Marriage,'' by
columnist Maggie Gallagher and University of Chicago Professor
Linda Waite, notes that husbands earn 10 to 40 percent more than
single men with similar work and education, ''because they work
longer hours and produce more.''
 &HT;    Eliminating the marriage penalty should be the centerpiece of
any tax reform.

TWICE-TOLD TALES: HOLLYWOOD'S ONGOING ROMANCE WITH REMAKES

entertainment column)

 Includes black-and-white photos and color slides of Pierce Brosnan
and Rene Russo in ``The Thomas Crown Affair'' and Vince Vaughn in
``Psycho.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    The technical term is deja vu.
 &HT;    If you were around in l968, you may remember ``The Thomas Crown
Affair,'' a highly watchable romantic thriller starring Steve
McQueen as a bored tycoon who steals Old Masters for kicks and Faye
Dunaway as the single-minded insurance investigator who melts in
his arms. From the wardrobe to the dizzying, constantly moving
camera, it was one of the most stylish movies of the decade.
 &HT;    On Aug. 6, ``The Thomas Crown Affair'' will reopen _ but this
time with Pierce Brosnan, best known these days as Agent 007, in
the McQueen role. Rene Russo, like Dunaway an ex-model, plays his
pursuer.
 &HT;    Which begs the question: Why bother with a remake when the
original was so good?
 &HT;    It's a question that should be posed more often. Hollywood's
track record with recycling is shaky, to say the least. There was
``Sabrina'' _ the l952 version with Audrey Hepburn, Humphrey Bogart
and William Holden, revamped disappointingly with Julia Ormond,
Harrison Ford and Greg Kinnear in l995. ``Lolita'' _ filmed in l961
by the late Stanley Kubrick and redone in l997 by Adrian Lyne with
limited success. ``Meet Joe Black'' _ a l997 remake of ``Death
Takes a Holiday'' (l934) which managed to be a miserable failure
even with Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins.
 &HT;    All of which attests to the fact that a remade classic does not
a hit guarantee. In fact, the video shelves are crowded with these
vain efforts to reinvent the movie wheel.
 &HT;    In a category of its own is one of last year's most ... well,
unusual films. Everyone remembers Hitchcock's masterpiece
``Psycho'' (1960). But, even five years from now, who will recall
the mundane l998 shot-for-shot remake by Gus Van Sant?
 &HT;    It helps if there's a reason for doing a remake. Mike Nichols
thought the 1978 French farce ``La Cage Aux Folles'' deserved wider
exposure in America, for example, so he faithfully translated it
into ``The Birdcage'' (l996), with Robin Williams and Nathan Lane,
and scored a hit.
 &HT;    But for every ``Birdcage'' there are a dozen updates and remakes
that could well have gone unmade, some of them with major names
attached. Certified celluloid genius Martin Scorsese had only
limited success with ``Cape Fear'' (1991), even with Robert De Niro
as the vicious rapist played by Robert Mitchum in the l961 version.
Steven Spielberg struck out with ``Always'' (l989), based on ``A
Guy Named Joe'' (l943), which starred Spencer Tracy.
 &HT;    Of course, some argue that a remake is justified to make an
older film accessible to contemporary audiences. That's the line
taken by Leslie Dixon, screenwriter for the new ``Thomas Crown
Affair.''
 &HT;    ``At first I thought, `Oh, this is going to be easy to adapt to
'90s sensibilities _ I can keep most of it in,''' Dixon says. ``But
what I found was that, while for l968 it was an excellent film and
I admired the screenplay, I only ended up keeping four lines of
dialogue and the idea behind three scenes.''
 &HT;    The primary issue was pacing, he says.
 &HT;    ``The audience's attention span in l968 was so lengthy compared
to that of l999 moviegoers,'' the writer explains. ``At that time
you could begin a movie with a 40-minute heist in which the girl
plays no active part. And then there are cuts back to Steve
McQueen, with him thinking, `I bet they're breaking into the bank
right now _ but I'm here in my office doing nothing.'
 &HT;    ``You can't do that anymore. From that point on, things start to
unravel.''
 &HT;    The new version, accordingly, has Brosnan as a more active
thief, if not quite on the level of Tom Cruise in ``Mission
Impossible'' (l997).
 &HT;    Again, the original ``Thomas Crown'' depicted a seductive chess
game between Dunaway and McQueen, leading to their first sexual
encounter.
 &HT;    ``If you did it the same way,'' Dixon says, ``it would be
considered a ripoff. So you have to come up with something else.
The way it was done in the film was too arch _ her fiddling with
her bra strap works great when you look at it through a l968
telescope. Do it in l999, and you are going to look like a bit of
an idiot.''
 &HT;    Charles Shyer, who directed the 1991 remake of ``Father of the
Bride'' (1950), with Steve Martin stepping in for Spencer Tracy,
says that it's actually a good idea not to pay too much attention
to the original.
 &HT;    ``With `Father of the Bride,''' he recalls, ``we tried to put
Spencer Tracy, Vincente Minnelli's film and Elizabeth Taylor out of
our minds a little bit, because you can get paralyzed thinking
about the original movie.
 &HT;    ``In our movie Steve brought his brand of humor, unique and
brilliant, and he's so different from Spencer,'' he adds. ``If they
had asked us to do it with another actor, I don't think we would
have. Because you say, `Oh, nobody can be Tracy.'''
 &HT;    Hollywood executives say that part of the appeal of remaking the
films of the past lies in the idea _ far from proven, of course _
that it provides some insurance against a flop.
 &HT;    ``Making movies gets costlier every day,'' says one independent
producer who requested anonymity, ``and executives worried about
runaway budgets will do anything to play it safe and avoid
megabudget films.
 &HT;    ``Taking a familiar old film is one way to reduce the odds,'' he
adds. ``If you are redoing a well-known title, it can cut the risk
factor by maybe one-third in what is an annual Hollywood
crapshoot.''
 &HT;    Of course, it comes with risks of its own. As dicey as Van
Sant's ``Psycho'' remake may have been, arguably Turner
Broadcasting is about to take an even greater gamble, remaking an
even more beloved film: Fred Zinnemann's ``High Noon'' (1952), the
seminal Western that starred Gary Cooper and Grace Kelly.
 &HT;    Even some of Turner's own employees have broken ranks on this
remake, set to air in 2000. Longtime Hollywood reporter Robert
Osborne, who also hosts ``Turner Classic Movies'' on TBS, pulls no
punches in denouncing the project.
 &HT;    ``They should leave the classics alone,'' Osborne says. ``I'm
sorry they did `Psycho.' I spent two terrible hours watching it.
They should redo those awful movies based on great books. There's
no point in remaking the classics _ they're just cashing in on the
titles.
 &HT;    ``Who can compete with Gary Cooper? Who can compete with Anthony
Perkins in `Psycho?'''
 &HT;    Turner isn't even the first studio to have the idea. Four years
ago, according to Arnold Kopelson _ who later produced ``The
Fugitive'' (1996) _ he was seriously thinking of redoing ``High
Noon.'' He changed his mind.
 &HT;    ``The consensus was that this is one you don't tamper with,'' he
says. ``It's a classic, and it's there for history.''

`BLAIR WiTCH' OPENS WIDELY ACROSS NATION 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TODD CAMP 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After playing in only 27 theaters nationwide, ``The Blair Witch
Project'' is finally opening widely on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   After creating a buzz at the Sundance Film Festival, this
$20,000 indie about three documentary filmmakers who disappear in
the Maryland woods while researching a local legend has succeeded
well beyond anyone's dreams. Unprecedented crowds have descended
upon Dallas' Inwood Theatre, for example, breaking every record the
theater had set.
</P>
<P>
   ``It brought in a crowd that we're not used to having,'' says
Inwood manager Tearlach Hutcheson. ``It's the multiplex crowd.
We're used to the more academically inclined people who would watch
a foreign-language film.''
</P>
<P>
   But although they expected crowds, Hutcheson says, they didn't
expect the kind of mania they've faced the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we had an exclusive, and there has been such a hype
that you've got to see it, ... we've had a lot of angry people,''
he says. ``Especially when you've got a weekend that's over a
hundred degrees and people are standing outside trying to get in.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael H. Price, director of Sundance Square's Gourmet Cinema
program at the AMC Sundance 11 in Fort Worth, doesn't seemed too
concerned. When ``The Blair Witch Project'' opens in downtown Fort
Worth on Friday, Price says he's ready for the inevitable mob.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had outrageous crowds before this summer, so it's just
business as usual as far I'm concerned,'' he says. ``We need one
indie like this a year to bolster the ones that maybe have an
audience of about 500. I'm looking forward to fighting for a seat
in my own auditorium.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutcheson is looking forward to a chance to catch up on
neglected paperwork, but he admits that all the buildup is
warranted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I watched it,'' he says, ``I think it was the
only time in my life I've actually been chilled to the bone.''

<P>
   We're thinking about going public.
</P>
<P>
   We haven't made a final decision yet, but we are exploring the
idea of making our column, Boston Capital, a public company. We've
been huddling with our investment bankers, mulling the pros and
cons of doing a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Why do we want to go public, you might ask? We can think of at
least four reasons.
</P>
<P>
   1) Like the New York Stock Exchange, we are responding to a
changing competitive landscape. After more than 200 years as a
private organization, the stock exchange recently announced plans
for an initial public offering. ``I don't think there has ever been
a period like this in the history of world capital markets,''
chairman Richard Grasso said by way of explanation for his move.
``Everyone is in everyone else's business today. Whether you sell
stock or sell suits, the Internet has changed the world.''
</P>
<P>
   We couldn't agree more. Exactly how the stock exchange and
Boston Capital will be more competitive as public companies isn't
completely clear, but now isn't the time to niggle over details.
</P>
<P>
   2) Like United Parcel Service, we need a currency to make
acquisitions. UPS, too, recently said it would go public, despite a
long and profitable history as a private business. Company chairman
James Kelly conceded his firm has plenty of money. But he added,
``We need the extra financial flexibility for acquisitions,
including e-commerce opportunities.'' Us too. With our inflated
stock price, we will pay inflated prices for other companies, just
like everyone else. What will we buy? Don't worry. We'll think of
something.
</P>
<P>
   3) Like other entrepreneurs, we want to take advantage of
current market conditions. In case you haven't noticed, this is a
great time to go public. This summer an average of 13 companies a
week have done IPOs, an impressive pace. The current boom has been
likened to the Oklahoma Land Rush. If that's true, we want our 40
acres and a mule before they stop handing them out. Later this
year, markets could be less receptive to new companies as investors
get nervous about Y2K problems. You'll be happy to know Boston
Capital is already Y2K ready.
</P>
<P>
   4) Like the rest of the have-nots, we're jealous. In the spirit
of full disclosure required by the Securities &AMP; Exchange
Commission, we have to be honest here. It's tough to write a market
column, reporting day after day about 20- and 30-year-olds becoming
millionaires overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Just this week there was Chemdex. Two years ago the firm was
just an idea in the head of David Perry, a Harvard Business School
student. Perry drew up plans for the company and entered them in a
school competition. He didn't win. Tuesday Chemdex hit the jackpot.
</P>
<P>
   The business _ which sells something over the Internet, who
cares what? _ had sales of $165,000 last year. The sub shop on your
block probably had bigger revenues. But by the end of Tuesday
Chemdex had a market value of $800 million and 31-year-old David
Perry was worth about $40 million. When is it our turn?
</P>
<P>
   Clearly we have a lot of work to do. We are going to have to
spend heavily to promote our brand name: billboards, radio,
television, maybe even an ad during the Super Bowl. We'll spend
whatever it takes. By the time we're through you'll be seeing the
Boston Capital name in your dreams.
</P>
<P>
   We're going to need a multichannel strategy. Right now we're
available in the newspaper and on the Globe's Web site. In our new
incarnation we'll have our own spot on the Web. Look for the words
``dotcom'' to show up in our name.
</P>
<P>
   It's true that at the moment we don't have any revenue. We don't
see that as a problem. But we don't have any losses either. That
could create a credibility issue on Wall Street. Rest assured we'll
spend enough on marketing to guarantee the kind of robust
seven-figure losses that analysts like to see in an emerging
company.
</P>
<P>
   Chemdex lost $6.8 million last year. That's an ambitious target,
but we're confident we can reach it.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes time to write up the prospectus, we'll have to
inform would-be investors about all the risks this new venture
entails. The biggest one is obvious: One day soon, everyone will
wake up and realize we are in the midst of an incredible
speculative bubble. They'll figure out that even though the
Internet is profoundly remaking the business world that doesn't
mean every Tom, Dick, and Boston Capital is worth all the money
that is being thrown at it.
</P>
<P>
   Hopefully that won't happen until the week after we go public.
Happy investing.

COLLINS VERSED IN THE TRICKS OF THE TRADE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHIRA SPRINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   RAYNHAM, Mass. _ The figure fills the door frame. Silouetted by
sunlight, the weight and bearing of an offensive lineman are clear.
The 291 pounds packed loosely onto the 6-foot-5-inch frame create
an optical illusion, making the player seem shorter and thicker
than his listed measurements. With the exception of muscular
forearms, his strength is disguised as he stands still. When he
walks, the gait is slow and laid-back. The size of his body suits
him.
</P>
<P>
   From all observable indications, Dan Collins has the physical
qualities to play professional football. He also possesses the
pedigree, frequently mentioning his uncle and former NFL
quarterback Matt Cavanaugh in conversation. A copy of the Sports
Illustrated cover that captured his uncle celebrating a national
championship at Pittsburgh hangs above his bed. As part of the
storied tradition of offensive linemen educated at Boston College
and as a student of the current Green Bay offensive coordinator,
Collins developed under the tutelage of men who knew the talent
needed to play professionally.
</P>
<P>
   But Collins has taken an unlikely and unexpected route to
Patriots training camp, which begins Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Burdened with unfulfilled potential, he came close to quitting
his college football team the spring before he earned a starting
position. Converted from defense to offense before his junior year,
his talent and technique need refining. Undrafted, but signed as a
free agent, he enters camp with lots to prove and lots to learn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have liked to be drafted, but I told myself to expect
the worse,'' said Collins. ``I just wanted to get into camp. I
didn't care how I got in, as long as I had a shot. Draft day was
just long. It felt like it was three days. I was sitting around and
the rounds just kept going and going. It would have been nice (to
be drafted).
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to hear your name, but then it doesn't happen. It was
in some ways dissappointing, but at the same time just the thrill
of a lifetime . . . (Not being drafted) doesn't nag at me at all.
It gives you a little extra drive, I think. You're fighting against
guys who are drafted.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins knows more than most would-be rookies about the NFL. He
spent his childhood following the exploits of his uncle. The free
agent visited Foxboro Stadium after the draft and recognized the
weight room and locker room from a childhood visit. His uncle, who
began his 14-year NFL career with the Patriots in 1978, once gave
Collins and his sister a tour of the team's facilities. The stadium
sits just 15 minutes from the Collins family home in Raynham, where
Dan shares a bedroom with his brother Ken.
</P>
<P>
   The Collins family also visited Cavanaugh at training camp,
creating a lasting memory for Dan. Standing in the middle of the
cafeteria with an ice cream cone, a young Collins watched Pete
Brock approach. The center stole the cone from Collins and ate it.
The 23-year-old guard still shakes his head at the recollection. At
the time, the world of pro football players was super-sized and
awe-inspiring.
</P>
<P>
   Collins followed his uncle's stops in San Francisco, where he
backed up Joe Montana, then to Philadelphia and New York. During
his NFL tour, Cavanaugh was a member of two Super Bowl champions
(1984 with the 49ers and 1990 with the Giants) and fostered his
nephew's love of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of kids look up to all these different players that they
really don't even know,'' said Collins. ``I was fortunate enough to
have my uncle who was an actual player. When I was growing up, I
always thought that was cool. I wanted to be like him some day. I
wanted to be the next one in the family to have a chance to play in
the NFL. I never in a million years thought I would follow my
uncle. I always wanted to, but your chances are just so limited.''
</P>
<P>
   Listening to Collins, it sounds as if every milestone in his
career was met with disbelief. When BC coach Tom Coughlin offered
him a scholarship before his senior season at Bridgewater-Raynham
High, Collins thought it was a joke.
</P>
<P>
   When he was told pro scouts had inquired about him at the start
of last season, he asked his position coach, ``Are you kidding?''
After all, who could see potential in a player yet to start his
first college game? When he signed as a free agent with the
Patriots, Collins could hardly fathom the course his career had
taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a while I was thinking about it quite a bit,'' he said of
his rise from one-year starter to pro prospect. ``I just had to
smack myself. I didn't know what was going on. It all happened so
fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Prior to his junior year of college, Collins had received a
scholarship from Coughlin, spent three unproductive years under
coach Dan Henning and his staff and thought seriously about
quitting a year after Tom O'Brien took over. Former defensive
coordinator Phil Elmassian hurt Collins with comments that he was
unfit to play Division 3 football, never mind Division 1. In 1996,
when most of his playing time came on special teams, Collins
received a three-game suspension after it was learned he bet on two
games.
</P>
<P>
   Collins initially hoped to see time his sophomore season and
contribute his final two years. Instead, he barely played his first
two years, did not travel with the team early in his college
career, and thought more about graduation and going home than any
post-collegiate football opportunities. The spring preceding his
fifth year at the Heights, Collins faced a tough decision and had
all but made up his mind before he called his uncle.
</P>
<P>
   Collins told Cavanaugh he was considering not returning to BC;
Cavanaugh hung up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that really wasn't what he wanted to do,'' said
Cavanaugh, who now works as the Baltimore Ravens offensive
coordinator. ``Like a lot of guys in college, he had certain
expectations. I knew he really loved the game. I knew he wanted to
prove to himself that he could play in college.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins needed only one season to demonstrate his talent on the
offensive line and convince NFL teams he possessed untapped
potential. After four years of waiting, the former defensive
lineman started the first time for the Eagles at right guard
against Georgia Tech. His nervousness before the season opener was
increased when his prediction that Mike Cloud would run for 200
yards were publicized and posted in the opposing team's locker
room.
</P>
<P>
   But with the help of Damien Woody and former offensive
coordinator Jeff Jagodzinski, Collins survived the opener and
started all 11 games for the Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   When members of the O'Brien coaching staff arrived, they
announced that several defensive linemen would try to play on the
offensive line. That spring, Collins divided his time equally
between defense and offense. The coaches evaluated his play and
decided Collins would be better suited on offense. The player felt
more comfortable protecting the quarterback and opening holes for
the running back and agreed to the switch. In retrospect, he wishes
the conversion from defense to offense had happened before his
junior season.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Collins got the chance to be part of a record-setting
offensive unit last fall. He helped the Eagles post 4,527 yards in
total offense, with Cloud running for 1,726 and setting the
school's all-time rushing record. The right guard also took pride
in the fact that BC allowed the fewest sacks in the Big East (13).
</P>
<P>
   ``When the changes started, he was shuffled around from place to
place and had a lot of opportunities to say, `Forget it.' I don't
think he had a chance to flourish because he was always bounced
around,'' said Jagodzinski, now the Packers' offensive coordinator.
``If I had been able to work with him for three to four years, he
would have been a drafted player. He never really settled into his
position until his senior year. He did a great job for us. I
thought he had real good feet. He was quick. He played next to
(Patriots first pick) Damien Woody, and I think that really helped
him. I don't think there's a better place in the country to play
offensive line than BC.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Jagodzinski and Cavanaugh have given their protege the same
advice. They emphasize that Collins has a rare opportunity to play
professionally and must make the most of it. His uncle has told
him, ``All you can do is your best and make their decision
easier.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Dave Uyrus, the Patriots' director of team
scouting, the team was attracted to Collins because of his size,
solid work ethic, and close ties to the area that allowed the local
team to become more familiar with the player.
</P>
<P>
   The scouting director recognizes that Collins must work on his
technique and may, like most offensive linemen, need two to three
years to develop. Although he would not predict Collins's chances
of making the team, Uyrus noted that players in Collins's position
generally make the practice squad and then spend time in Europe
acquiring game experience. Cavanaugh believes Collins's ``knack for
surviving'' will help him through training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to something serious like this whole football
thing, I look at it as my only opportunity,'' said Collins. ``I'm
going to do everything I can now to make it happen or it's never
going to happen again.''

BIOHAZARD 
The Chilling True Story of the Largest Covert Biological Weapons
Program in the World _ Told from the Inside by the Man Who Ran It 
By Ken Alibek with Stephen Handelman 
Random House, 319 pp., illustrated, $24.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It may be a fearfully short time before this book becomes a
common reference tool for every Washington policymaker, journalist,
and national-security-minded citizen. We are one terrorist attack
away from knowing the devastating effects of biological weapons. No
wonder we're searching for answers about how the science behind the
weapons developed, and how we allowed ourselves to become
vulnerable to them.
</P>
<P>
   This book provides some of the answers. It also serves as a rude
shock to those who might have thought that the Soviet Union was
abiding by the Biological Weapons Convention that 140 nations
signed in 1972. Instead, Ken Alibek _ a Soviet scientist who
defected in 1992 _ discloses that the convention served as a cover
to allow the Kremlin to develop and stockpile hundreds of tons of
anthrax and dozens of tons of plague and smallpox near Moscow and
other Russian cities for use against the United States and its
Western allies.
</P>
<P>
   Authorized by Soviet Premier Leonid Brezhnev, the development of
the program hid one of the most terrifying secrets of the Cold War,
and Alibek (who changed his name from Kanatjan Alibekov on arriving
in the Unitred States) knows all the details. A native of the
Soviet republic of Kazakhastan, Alibek rose to become the second in
command of BIOPREPARAT, the civilian branch of the Soviet Army that
developed clandestine biological weapons. This secret military
empire, masquerading as a pharmaceuticals company, employed more
than 60,000 people in more than 100 facilities throughout the
Soviet empire.
</P>
<P>
   Among the more sobering disclosures from Alibek's 15 years in
the program are these:
</P>
<P>
   --Convinced that the United States was secretly developing its
own biological weapons arsenal, Soviet scientists worked closely
with its military to arm a range of its missiles with deadly
biological strains that were capable of striking American cities
thousands of miles away. At its peak, the Soviets had reserve
mobilization facilities at seven sites that stockpiled thousands of
tons of agents to cause anthrax, smallpox, and plague.
</P>
<P>
   --While a full-scale attack was never launched by the Soviets,
Alibek reveals that he was informed by a senior military official
that the Soviet military had used germ warfare in Afghanistan.
During the prolonged campaign that turned into the Soviet Union's
Vietnam, its military sprayed Afghan rebels with glanders, a
bacteria that strikes horses and that can be highly lethal in
humans. A US specialist later told Alibek that our government had
detected widespread illnesses among the Afghan military that could
not otherwise be explained.
</P>
<P>
   --While it suspected the Soviets were cheating and conducted
inspection tours during the mid-1980s, the United States did not
begin to learn the details of the Soviet's efforts until the
defection of a top Soviet scientist in 1989. Alibek's own defection
in 1992 _ the details of which are, he says, the only secrets he
refuses to disclose _ confirmed the US's worst suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   By Alibek's account, the United States appears to have abided by
the pledges of a succession of presidents never to develop or use
biological weapons, and concentrated its efforts on developing
anti-germ vaccines. ``At the height of the US offensive biological
weapons program,'' he writes, ``American scientists restricted
themselves to developing armaments that could be countered by
antibiotics or vaccines, out of a concern for protecting troops and
civilians from potential accidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Soviet government decided that the best agents were those
for which there were no known cure. This shaped the entire course
of our program and thrust us into a never-ending race against the
medical profession. Every time a new treatment or vaccine came to
light somewhere, we were back in our labs to figure out how to
overcome its effects.''
</P>
<P>
   In Alibek's view, the collapse of the Soviet Union should
provide the US no relief from its concerns about being targeted by
biological weapons. For one thing, he says, China (another
signatory of the 1972 convention) appeared to be developing a
program similar in scope to the Soviet Union's. In addition,
following his defection, Alibek says, he was approached by several
governments, including France's, and asked if he would be willing
to advise them on biological weapons. A 1995 congressional report
identified 17 countries that are believed to possess biological
weapons. Chillingly, Alibek and Handelman, an investigative
journalist, write: ``More have joined the list since.'' Most
problematic is that several of the countries on the list, including
Libya and Iraq, support international terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the nongovernmental threats. In 1995, a
Japanese cult sprayed sarin gas inside the Tokyo subway station,
killing 12 and injuring more than 5,000 people. With threats like
that, it is understandable why Brigham &AMP; Women's Hospital opened
New England's first hazardous-materials decontamination unit this
month _ why many are beginning to ask whether the government has in
place a comprehensive plan to respond to such a complex medical
emergency.

HIIGHER-ED CHIEF'S BULLDOG STYLE DRAWS BITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- There are six names on Steve Tocco's list of people
who will say nice things about him. The trouble is, five of the six
are also on the list that other people give as Steve Tocco's
enemies.
</P>
<P>
   And his critics don't come from the expected quarters _ unions
he battled as head of the state's port authority, Democrats _ but
from people who served alongside him in the Republican
administration, who in the weeks before Gov. Paul Cellucci named
him as the new chief of the state's higher education system, were
privately lobbying the governor to choose someone else.
</P>
<P>
   The public complaints about Tocco's appointment have focused on
his lack of education experience. Trained as a pharmacist, Tocco's
work within government and now as a lobbyist has mostly involved
transportation and construction projects.
</P>
<P>
   But behind the scenes, it's not Tocco's lack of relevant
experience that's the problem, former colleagues say. It's his ego
and unpredictability _ so notorious that former Gov. William F.
Weld used to warn Tocco in senior staff meetings not to do anything
he hadn't been explicitly authorized to do.
</P>
<P>
   Like his predecessor, James F. Carlin, Tocco is known for
butting heads and infuriating his enemies. But while he may
generate the same headlines that Carlin did, critics say he won't
generate the same results.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's every bit the lightning rod, but not as effective,'' said
one person who served in the administration with Tocco. ``If you
look at Steve's record, he's created an enormous amount of noise,
but no product. A lot of other people ended up cleaning up a lot of
things that weren't that hard to get done.''
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci, though, said he chose Tocco for his aggressive
leadership and ability to push an agenda. And Tocco himself insists
that if he alienated anyone, it was only because he takes on tough
projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always put in positions that were difficult,'' he says
in an interview at his office at the law firm Mintz Levin Cohn
Ferris Glovsky &AMP; Popeo, where he heads a lobbying, public
relations, and consulting unit. ``Could I have had a softer side to
that? Absolutely. If I'm driven by anything, it's trying to
accomplish it. But nothing I did was ever without the mandate of my
boss, either Governor Weld or Governor Cellucci.'' He shrugs.
``It's a style.''
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Buckingham, who worked with Tocco in several positions
in the Weld administration, acknowledges Tocco ``leaves noses out
of joint.'' But, she says, it is only because he is so focused on
getting the job done. ``I see him in the Carlin mode,'' she said.
``He has a clear vision, he's very articulate, he's able to inspire
people with his vision. He's very clear-minded.''
</P>
<P>
   Even his critics agree that Tocco is his own best salesman.
Stocky and feisty, he is upbeat about his qualifications for the
job, proud of his past experience.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Lee King, Weld's chief policy advisor, acknowledges Tocco
can be intimidating. But she admires his forcefulness, saying it
will help him confront aggressive education advocates as he
oversees 29 campuses of the University of Massachusetts and state
and community colleges.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a good manager because he is tough. I Knew his
management style would be what the governor was looking for. I'm
not sure you need to be an education specialist to manage.''
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci brought Tocco into the 1990 Weld campaign, and he
served as a senior aide in the early years of the new
administration, and later as Weld's secretary of economic affairs.
He was handed several significant projects, including an emergency
plan to shrink state bureaucracy during the budget crisis of the
early 90s, an economic development blueprint, and a proposal to
build a new stadium and convention center. But while he gets credit
for taking on the tough jobs, the animosity he generated often
threatened to get in the administration's way.
</P>
<P>
   When Weld put Tocco in charge of Massport in 1993, he also
handed him responsibility for selling the idea for a new sports and
convention center complex that was to be called the Megaplex. But
the deal was dead almost as soon as it was unveiled, largely,
critics said, because Tocco crossed swords with then-Senate
President William M. Bulger over how the deal would be paid for and
designed. Leaders in South Boston accused Tocco of unveiling plans
for the stadium without any consideration for what the community
might want, and suspected him of trying to strong-arm the
commmunity into building a new football stadium on Massport land.
</P>
<P>
   Even some critics of the original plan now say that Tocco was
only acting on Weld's direction, and may have taken more blame than
he deserved when the plan fell apart.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Tocco also failed to secure trust within the Weld
administration, and had to be brought into line, sources said,
after the governor discovered that Tocco had been quietly lobbying
to build the stadium in South Boston, even as Weld _ still his boss
_ was arguing to locate it on a competing site in Roxbury.
</P>
<P>
   A month later, Tocco clashed with Weld again, when he tried to
seize control of the Third Harbor Tunnel. He filed an amendment
during a late night Senate debate to put the tunnel under
Massport's direction, acting against the advice of even aides at
Massport, and in direct opposition to a Weld bill that would have
the tunnel controlled by the state Turnpike Authority. The governor
was reportedly so stunned at the sheer chutzpah of the move that he
put his head on the table and laughed in disbelief. Other aides
said they had to call Cellucci late at night and get him to tell
Tocco to stop the power play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve was always acting like he was the governor, going out
and cutting deals in the governor's name, even if he didn't always
have the authority to do them,'' says one former top aide. ``Weld
was always sort of having to sit on him.''
</P>
<P>
   A few months later, Massport filed a $387 million bond
prospectus that was to pay part of the agency's share of the
Central Artery project. The prospectus said that Massport would
raise tolls on the Tobin Bridge, even though the Legislature had
never authorized such a hike. When Senate President Thomas M.
Birmingham discovered this, he passed a budget rider declaring that
tolls could not be used to pay for Massport projects. The bond
prospectus had to be pulled from the market, costing Massport $16
million, and Wall Street agencies put Massport's bond rating under
review, jeopardizing its ability to borrow money to pay for any
construction projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not phobic about tolls,'' Birmingham says now. ``But he
was completely contemptuous of the Legislature.''
</P>
<P>
   Tocco, again, seemed surprised at the furor he had set off:
while aides tried to reassure Birmingham and Wall Street, he was in
Las Vegas playing golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't spend a lot of time considering how his actions
might be affecting people,'' Buckingham says. ``He's focused on his
goals and he's very good at achieving them, but he's not a pat on
the back kind of person. I don't think that's a bad thing when
you're trying to get stuff done. He can get people to a consensus,
but if he can't, he's not afraid to drive the agenda in the
direction he thinks it should go.''
</P>
<P>
   Tocco says it's too early to say where he will put his energies,
but he is eager to begin. Already, he has expressed concerns that
measures to raise standards at the University of Massachusetts may
end up cutting off access to some students. For those students, he
says it's important the state colleges and community colleges offer
valuable degrees.
</P>
<P>
   As secretary of economic affairs, he saw firsthand the
importance of having a well-trained work force. And that, he said,
is what education is really about, and why he is fit for the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you can make an argument that it makes sense. I think
you have to think about it to have it make sense, but it does make
sense.``
</P>
<P>
   As for critics, Tocco appears undaunted.
</P>
<P>
   ``My persistence is a pretty powerful thing,'' he says.

PBS SCANDAL RAISES OLD ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the Public Broadcasting Service, it was a nasty case of deja
vu. Stunning revelations that public stations _ beginning with
Boston's WGBH-TV _ swapped donor lists with the Democrats not only
triggered Congressional hearings and endangered future funding, it
brought a divisive political issue out of mothballs.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, taxpayer-funded television stands accused of cozying
up to the left.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1992, that issue was so hot that the Republican Party
platform officially deplored ``the blatant political bias of the
government-sponsored radio and television networks.'' A few years
later, House Speaker Newt Gingrich threatened to ``zero out''
funding for public TV. But as the Republican Revolution waned and
PBS programming seemed more palatable to conservatives, the cries
of liberal bias receded into a bare whisper. Now, even as evidence
of list trading with Republicans surfaces, it's public TV's ties to
the Democrats that have reopened an old ideological wound.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in recent years, CPB (the Corporation for Public
Broadcasting) has been aware'' of the bias charge ``and tried to
balance its programs,'' adds Ken Johnson, spokesman for
Representative W.J. ``Billy'' Tauzin, Republican from Louisiana,
who chairs the House subcommittee overseeing public broadcasting.
But this ``blossoming scandal . . . reinforces the old stereotype''
and ``sets the stage once again for a knockdown drag out fight over
funding . . . Santa Claus has fled the building.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This raises the old bugaboo that they tried to put behind
them,'' echoes Robert Lichter, president of the Center for Media
and Public Affairs. ``The irony is that this matter is coming up
just at the moment the issue was fading away.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven years ago, Lichter was a major combatant in the bias
battle when the center released a 160-page study analyzing 225 PBS
documentary programs that aired from April 1987 to March 1988. The
report concluded that ``on the social and political controversies
addressed by PBS documentaries . . . the balance of opinion tilted
consistently in a liberal direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining Lichter in the early '90s chorus of critics was Laurence
Jarvik, then an analyst with the Heritage Foundation, who argued
for the privatization of PBS, which he accused of operating ``like
a government bureacracy.'' A battalion of conservative media
critics _ the Committee on Media Integrity, Accuracy in Media, and
the Media Research Center _ intensified the assault on PBS,
complaining of programming that was too pro-tree hugger and too
anti-military.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I understand, some people objected to specific
programs,'' says PBS vice president of communications Tom Epstein.
But ``there was never a wide-ranging indictment of the schedule as
a whole.''
</P>
<P>
   That might represent a rose-colored assessment of the critics'
views. But in the past several years, their complaints abated. For
one thing, the Center for Media and Public Affairs' studies of PBS
``NewsHour'' coverage of the 1992 and 1996 presidential campaigns
found that in 1992, the ``NewsHour'' gave George Bush a fairer
shake than ABC, NBC, CBS, and CNN. And in 1996, only CBS was kinder
to the GOP nominee _ Bob Dole _ than PBS.
</P>
<P>
   ``My impression is that PBS saw (the bias charge) as a problem
and moved to correct this,'' says Lichter.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the left-wing media watchdog Fairness &AMP; Accuracy in
Reporting released its survey of PBS public affairs programming
ranging from ``Charlie Rose'' to the ``McLaughlin Group.'' It did
not exactly conclude that the network was too conservative, but it
did allege that the mix of PBS voices and sources was skewed toward
the institutional elite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the past six or seven years, the corporate voice on PBS
has gotten much louder,'' says William Hoynes, the Vassar College
professor who conducted the survey. ``The term I use in the study
is public broadcasting has `insider orientation' (that) doesn't
open up the boundaries of public discourse.''
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, when Fairness &AMP; Accuracy in Reporting released a
survey with similar findings, it was a lone voice in the wilderness
countering the cries of liberal bias. But times had changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was not this loud challenge from the right like there
was from 1992 to 1995. That had been quiet lately,'' Hoynes says.
PBS thought it had finally won the bias war, ``and I think they
probably had. And now it's back.''
</P>
<P>
   So all bets are off as Congress currently awaits a report on the
extent of the fund-raising scandal before convening another public
hearing and tackling the politically recharged funding issue. ``We
will not move the CPB authorization forward until we hear a full
accounting of this unsavory practice,'' says Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the scandal has expanded to involve both the
Democratic and Republic parties, Epstein asserts that ``the direct
mail fund-raising had no political motivation whatsoever. It was
strictly to raise money.'' And the Fairness &AMP; Accuracy in Reporting
program director Janine Jackson says ``it would be regrettable if
we sink back to the left-right debate.''
</P>
<P>
   But other PBS funding foes eagerly await that opportunity. Media
Research Center staffer Tim Graham _ who testified at last week's
Congressional hearings that PBS's ``left-leaning image'' was ``well
earned'' _ says that when critics of public funding focused on
programming, they were accused of bashing some of TV's most revered
icons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nice thing about this set of revelations is that it
changes the subject,'' he says. ``It isn't the `fry Big Bird'
issue.''

HIGHER-ED CHIEF'S BULLDOG STYLE DRAWS BITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- There are six names on Steve Tocco's list of people
who will say nice things about him. The trouble is, five of the six
are also on the list that other people give as Steve Tocco's
enemies.
</P>
<P>
   And his critics don't come from the expected quarters _ unions
he battled as head of the state's port authority, Democrats _ but
from people who served alongside him in the Republican
administration, who in the weeks before Gov. Paul Cellucci named
him as the new chief of the state's higher education system, were
privately lobbying the governor to choose someone else.
</P>
<P>
   The public complaints about Tocco's appointment have focused on
his lack of education experience. Trained as a pharmacist, Tocco's
work within government and now as a lobbyist has mostly involved
transportation and construction projects.
</P>
<P>
   But behind the scenes, it's not Tocco's lack of relevant
experience that's the problem, former colleagues say. It's his ego
and unpredictability _ so notorious that former Gov. William F.
Weld used to warn Tocco in senior staff meetings not to do anything
he hadn't been explicitly authorized to do.
</P>
<P>
   Like his predecessor, James F. Carlin, Tocco is known for
butting heads and infuriating his enemies. But while he may
generate the same headlines that Carlin did, critics say he won't
generate the same results.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's every bit the lightning rod, but not as effective,'' said
one person who served in the administration with Tocco. ``If you
look at Steve's record, he's created an enormous amount of noise,
but no product. A lot of other people ended up cleaning up a lot of
things that weren't that hard to get done.''
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci, though, said he chose Tocco for his aggressive
leadership and ability to push an agenda. And Tocco himself insists
that if he alienated anyone, it was only because he takes on tough
projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always put in positions that were difficult,'' he says
in an interview at his office at the law firm Mintz Levin Cohn
Ferris Glovsky &AMP; Popeo, where he heads a lobbying, public
relations, and consulting unit. ``Could I have had a softer side to
that? Absolutely. If I'm driven by anything, it's trying to
accomplish it. But nothing I did was ever without the mandate of my
boss, either Governor Weld or Governor Cellucci.'' He shrugs.
``It's a style.''
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Buckingham, who worked with Tocco in several positions
in the Weld administration, acknowledges Tocco ``leaves noses out
of joint.'' But, she says, it is only because he is so focused on
getting the job done. ``I see him in the Carlin mode,'' she said.
``He has a clear vision, he's very articulate, he's able to inspire
people with his vision. He's very clear-minded.''
</P>
<P>
   Even his critics agree that Tocco is his own best salesman.
Stocky and feisty, he is upbeat about his qualifications for the
job, proud of his past experience.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Lee King, Weld's chief policy advisor, acknowledges Tocco
can be intimidating. But she admires his forcefulness, saying it
will help him confront aggressive education advocates as he
oversees 29 campuses of the University of Massachusetts and state
and community colleges.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a good manager because he is tough. I Knew his
management style would be what the governor was looking for. I'm
not sure you need to be an education specialist to manage.''
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci brought Tocco into the 1990 Weld campaign, and he
served as a senior aide in the early years of the new
administration, and later as Weld's secretary of economic affairs.
He was handed several significant projects, including an emergency
plan to shrink state bureaucracy during the budget crisis of the
early 90s, an economic development blueprint, and a proposal to
build a new stadium and convention center. But while he gets credit
for taking on the tough jobs, the animosity he generated often
threatened to get in the administration's way.
</P>
<P>
   When Weld put Tocco in charge of Massport in 1993, he also
handed him responsibility for selling the idea for a new sports and
convention center complex that was to be called the Megaplex. But
the deal was dead almost as soon as it was unveiled, largely,
critics said, because Tocco crossed swords with then-Senate
President William M. Bulger over how the deal would be paid for and
designed. Leaders in South Boston accused Tocco of unveiling plans
for the stadium without any consideration for what the community
might want, and suspected him of trying to strong-arm the
commmunity into building a new football stadium on Massport land.
</P>
<P>
   Even some critics of the original plan now say that Tocco was
only acting on Weld's direction, and may have taken more blame than
he deserved when the plan fell apart.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Tocco also failed to secure trust within the Weld
administration, and had to be brought into line, sources said,
after the governor discovered that Tocco had been quietly lobbying
to build the stadium in South Boston, even as Weld _ still his boss
_ was arguing to locate it on a competing site in Roxbury.
</P>
<P>
   A month later, Tocco clashed with Weld again, when he tried to
seize control of the Third Harbor Tunnel. He filed an amendment
during a late night Senate debate to put the tunnel under
Massport's direction, acting against the advice of even aides at
Massport, and in direct opposition to a Weld bill that would have
the tunnel controlled by the state Turnpike Authority. The governor
was reportedly so stunned at the sheer chutzpah of the move that he
put his head on the table and laughed in disbelief. Other aides
said they had to call Cellucci late at night and get him to tell
Tocco to stop the power play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve was always acting like he was the governor, going out
and cutting deals in the governor's name, even if he didn't always
have the authority to do them,'' says one former top aide. ``Weld
was always sort of having to sit on him.''
</P>
<P>
   A few months later, Massport filed a $387 million bond
prospectus that was to pay part of the agency's share of the
Central Artery project. The prospectus said that Massport would
raise tolls on the Tobin Bridge, even though the Legislature had
never authorized such a hike. When Senate President Thomas M.
Birmingham discovered this, he passed a budget rider declaring that
tolls could not be used to pay for Massport projects. The bond
prospectus had to be pulled from the market, costing Massport $16
million, and Wall Street agencies put Massport's bond rating under
review, jeopardizing its ability to borrow money to pay for any
construction projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not phobic about tolls,'' Birmingham says now. ``But he
was completely contemptuous of the Legislature.''
</P>
<P>
   Tocco, again, seemed surprised at the furor he had set off:
while aides tried to reassure Birmingham and Wall Street, he was in
Las Vegas playing golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't spend a lot of time considering how his actions
might be affecting people,'' Buckingham says. ``He's focused on his
goals and he's very good at achieving them, but he's not a pat on
the back kind of person. I don't think that's a bad thing when
you're trying to get stuff done. He can get people to a consensus,
but if he can't, he's not afraid to drive the agenda in the
direction he thinks it should go.''
</P>
<P>
   Tocco says it's too early to say where he will put his energies,
but he is eager to begin. Already, he has expressed concerns that
measures to raise standards at the University of Massachusetts may
end up cutting off access to some students. For those students, he
says it's important the state colleges and community colleges offer
valuable degrees.
</P>
<P>
   As secretary of economic affairs, he saw firsthand the
importance of having a well-trained work force. And that, he said,
is what education is really about, and why he is fit for the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you can make an argument that it makes sense. I think
you have to think about it to have it make sense, but it does make
sense.``
</P>
<P>
   As for critics, Tocco appears undaunted.
</P>
<P>
   ``My persistence is a pretty powerful thing,'' he says.

FBI SEEKS LINKS IN UNSOLVED KILLINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM HERRON ZAMORA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, Calif. _ After receiving a flood of
queries about unsolved killings from California law enforcement
agencies, the FBI has agreed to help local cops determine whether
Cary Stayner might be responsible for any other unsolved homicides.
</P>
<P>
   Since news broke that Stayner reportedly confessed to killing
four women in or near Yosemite National Park, the bureau has been
receiving requests from other agencies eager to find out whether
Stayner killed anyone else, especially women whose throats were
slashed or who were beheaded.
</P>
<P>
   FBI agents would not say Wednesday which unsolved deaths were
under investigation. But local investigators have asked the FBI to
look at several cases with similarities to the Yosemite slayings,
including one woman whose burned, mutilated body was discovered at
Don Pedro Reservoir, very near where Stayner has said he killed and
dumped 15-year-old Juli Sund in February.
</P>
<P>
   Among the deaths the FBI will review are a prostitute whose
decapitated body was found in Calaveras County; a headless,
handless woman found near a river in Sutter County; and a
19-year-old decapitated waitress found near Auburn.
</P>
<P>
   FBI spokesman Nick Rossi said part of the effort would be to
document Stayner's life and travels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to follow up on all logical investigative leads,
which includes developing information about his history,'' Rossi
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going back to establish a time line to determine where
he was at certain periods of time to see if, in fact, there are any
unsolved homicides that can be linked to him,'' said Tuolumne
County Sheriff Dick Rogers, whose agency has been part of the FBI
task force since the bodies of Carole Sund, her daughter, Juli, and
family friend Silvina Pelosso were found in two sites within his
jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Stayner has been charged only in last week's killing of
Joie Armstrong, a Yosemite naturalist. Stayner's next court
appearance is scheduled for Aug. 6 in federal court in Fresno,
where he is expected to enter a plea. The FBI said it was building
its case against him in the Sund-Pelosso killings.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers is also looking at Stayner in one cold case of his own.
In December 1994, the charred body of Denese Smith was found
stuffed in a barrel at Don Pedro Reservoir in Tuolumne County.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was stabbed many times before her body was burned and
dumped, investigators said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not too far _ only about 2 miles _ from where Juli
(Sund) was found,'' said Tuolumne County sheriff's Lt. John Steely.
``Her body had been burned and had been stuffed in a 50-gallon drum
burn barrel.''
</P>
<P>
   Next door in Calaveras County, sheriff's Detective Robert
Mortimer said FBI agents had indicated they would question Stayner
about the 1994 death of a 23-year-old prostitute, Sharalyn Mavonne
Murphy, whose severed hands were found near New Melones Reservoir
in October 1994. Her headless torso was found off a mountain road
in Calaveras County two months later. Neither the head nor her
killer has ever been found.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI will also serve as a central repository of new
information and tips in these cases, which could help local
investigators even if it turns out that Stayner has no connection
to their unsolved crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real good thing for us,'' said Detective Sgt. Hal Lamb
of the El Dorado County Sheriff's Department. ``They are giving us
a central place for all of this information.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamb is asking the FBI to look into the 1992 decapitation of 19-
year-old Veronica Martinez, a Sacramento waitress whose body was
found dumped in a steep ravine between Auburn and Placerville.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez was reported missing Jan. 27, 1992. But her body was
not discovered until March, when a person looking for bottles saw
her body near Highway 49.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was tossed off the side of the road,'' Lamb said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators had a suspect: a man in Martinez' life. But they
were never able to link him to the crime. ``We're happy to take a
fresh look at this case in light of the new information,'' Lamb
said.
</P>
<P>
   Stayner reportedly confessed to all four Yosemite area murders
during interviews with the FBI and a TV reporter. In the unrecorded
interview with the reporter, Stayner said he hadn't killed anyone
else.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators suspect that he may be lying, something experts
and other veteran homicide investigators agree is a tendency of
killers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've interviewed numerous killers, and they always lie,'' said
Eric Hickey, a professor of criminology at Fresno State University
and the author of the 1997 book ``Serial Murderers and Their
Victims.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it's about the facts, but always about their
motives,'' Hickey said. ``They always lie about the real issues.
... They like to play games with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts and investigators interviewed for this story said they
suspect Stayner did not start killing with the Sund-Pelosso trio.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they look into his past, I bet they will find others,''
Hickey said.

<P>
   SEAVEY ISLAND, N.H. _ The first time he ventured among the
nesting terns, Drew Trested looked like a victim from Alfred
Hitchcock's classic horror movie ``The Birds.''
</P>
<P>
   The second that the young biologist stepped into the grass where
the birds were tending their young, the terns took to the air,
screeching and pinwheeling around him in a blur of white feathers
and sharp orange beaks. When he knelt to put metal identification
bands on the fluffy little chicks, terns pecked him on the head so
much that his hair was matted with blood.
</P>
<P>
   Adding insult to injury, they bombed him with hot white
droppings, too.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Trested, though sore, was happy. The terns, driven by gulls
and human development from their home on the New Hampshire coast
for 50 years, were back with a vengeance, defending their turf.
</P>
<P>
   ``They get agitated quickly, which is a good thing. It keeps
them defensive,'' said the Audubon Society of New Hampshire
biologist, who learned to stuff a sock in his hat and wear a
raincoat for protection against the hostile birds. ``The ones that
are not aggressive do not do well at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The return of the terns to Seavey Island is part of a broader
recovery of the sleek, fork-tailed birds, whose arrival has long
been one of coastal New England's sure signs of summer. Thanks
largely to intensive human efforts to save them, common tern
populations from Maine to New York have nearly tripled since 1977,
reversing decades of losing ground to gulls, rats, and other
refuse-eating animals.
</P>
<P>
   Today, biologists refer to New York and Massachusetts as ``tern
factories'' because of enormous colonies that are home to thousands
of birds, while Maine has almost as many terns as it did in the
1930s. One species of tern, the roseate tern, is federally
endangered, but even its numbers have increased by 50 percent in
the Northeast since 1977.
</P>
<P>
   On Seavey Island, a beautiful yet stark slab of granite among
the Isles of Shoals, the birds returned almost immediately after
the Audubon Society drove off the gulls that had taken over, then
put out tern decoys and played tern calls to make the atmosphere
more homey. So far, 139 common tern pairs nest on the four-acre
island, compared to none in 1996, giving New Hampshire its first
significant tern colony since the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   Head biologist Diane De Luca ``is doing great things up there,''
said Steve Kress, the National Audubon Society visionary who
pioneered the use of decoys and bird sounds to restore seabird
colonies in Maine. ``I think she got bitten by the `T-bird bug,' ''
a term for the powerful affection some have for terns despite the
head pecks and the droppings.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the birds' progress, however, biologists say the terns'
migratory lifestyle is too harsh and the threat from predators too
real to declare victory. This year, for example, foxes routed
thousands of pairs of terns from their nests on Massachusetts'
Plymouth Beach, leaving the colony practically deserted.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, almost all the big colonies are protected by watchdogs
such as the New Hampshire Audubon Society, which stations two
biologists in an old lighthouse complex adjacent to Seavey Island.
Untended tern colonies tend to get overrun by gulls before the
terns arrive in the spring from their winter homes in Central
America.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is too unstable still to be called a success,''
said Brad Blodget, Massachusetts state ornithologist and director
of regional recovery efforts for the roseate tern. ``Not only do''
terns ``live in a very unstable environment, but they are subject
to storms and predation and they move frequently, so there is no
assurance year to year.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, terns are among the leading victims of people's
love of the coast. Growing coastal populations in the 1930s brought
more landfills, more fishing boats, and other food sources for
opportunistic animals such as gulls, skunks, rats, foxes and other
species that prey on tern young and eggs. Coupled with increasing
human use of tern nesting grounds, the birds went into a
precipitous decline.
</P>
<P>
   In the Isles of Shoals off the New Hampshire coast, up to 2,000
pairs of common terns once lived on Lunging Island, but, by 1950,
gulls had chased the terns away. Meanwhile, a manned Coast Guard
lighthouse on an island connected at low tide to Seavey prevented
significant tern nesting there.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the 1960s, conservationists tried to right the
ecological balance between terns and gulls, poisoning gulls to
clear space for the terns to return. But it was not until the early
1980s when Kress began restoring puffins and other seabirds on
Maine's Eastern Egg Rock that conservationists found both the
techniques and the institutional support to recreate more than a
dozen lost tern colonies.
</P>
<P>
   Just as important, regulators clamped down on open dumps in the
region, depriving gulls of a favorite food source and checking
their extraordinary population growth. ``We're definitely in a
period of gull decline and that has probably been to our
advantage,'' said De Luca of New Hampshire Audubon.
</P>
<P>
   De Luca, who worked with Kress for nine years, finally turned
conservationists' attention to the New Hampshire coast in the early
1990s when the Coast Guard automated its lighthouse near Seavey
Island and prepared to deed Seavey over to the state. Though terns
had never nested in large numbers on Seavey, its windswept rocks
and grass were perfect for the birds.
</P>
<P>
   De Luca followed the decoy-and-bird-sounds formula set down by
Kress, with the exception that late 1990s political reality made it
impossible to kill gulls. Instead, they harassed the animals,
putting bricks in their nests, setting off fireworks and constantly
patrolling the island. Within weeks of the gull harassment in 1997,
the first six pairs of terns returned.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Seavey Island has the hallmarks of a fast-growing new
community as terns from up and down the coast flock there _ and
find it to their liking. In many colonies, the youngest chicks die
for lack of food, but not on Seavey where the hake and other small
fish are so abundant. And, even though gulls continue to hang
around the edges of the colony, Trested and fellow biologist Dan
Hayward continually shoo them away.
</P>
<P>
   By some measures, the recovery at Seavey Island is cheap. At a
cost of about $40,000 a year in public and private funds, the
Audubon Society established the only major tern colony for 110
miles, completing a chain of bird refuges from Maine to New York.
``This is probably one of the last historical sites to get
restoration with the exception of Canada,'' said De Luca.
</P>
<P>
   But biologists warn that, while the amounts of money on any
individual site may be small, money will largely determine whether
the birds continue their recovery or not, because the terns will
always need people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is, terns are now a ward of the state,'' said Tom
French, director of Massachusetts' Endangered Species and Natural
Heritage Program. ``Terns will not make it on their own. Terns'
success is directly related to the level of human efforts to
protect them.''

THE 323I _ UNMISTAKABLY A BMW DESPITE THE $26,400 PRICE TAG

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It looks like a BMW. It handles like a BMW. And it performs like
a BMW. Ergo, it must be a BMW.
</P>
<P>
   But wait, it isn't priced like a BMW _ this vehicle sells for
$26,400 MSRP.
</P>
<P>
   Say hello to the 323i, BMW's entry-level sports sedan.
</P>
<P>
   BMW made its reputation in this category by building drivers'
cars. Over the years, it added the luxury cachet that has earned it
an enviable position in the upscale market.
</P>
<P>
   For BMW, the strategy of offering a designated entry-level car
is clear: Sell a buyer on the 3-series and hope to have him or her
move up to a 5- or 7-series down the road.
</P>
<P>
   My move was a little different. After a week in the new Saab 9-3
Viggen (colleague Royal Ford promises a full road test of that
soon), I jumped into the 323i and experienced culture shock. The
difference in the driving feel from the front-wheel-drive Saab with
its 200-horsepower 2-liter high-output turbocharged four to the
Beemer with its 2.5-liter straight six and rear-wheel drive is
obvious even to this auto-writing novice.
</P>
<P>
   The rear-wheel drive lends a sedate feel, but once you throw it
into a corner, the Beemer sticks like the road tar that always
seems to coat my own car's rocker panels.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this 323i was helped by the presence of bigger tires
(225/50R-16 Dunlop Sport radials) _ part of a $2,400 Sports package
that adds the tires, stiffer suspension, nifty five-spoke wheels,
fog lights, a multifunction leather sports wheel with fingertip
audio, cruise control and telephone controls, and 10-way manually
adjustable seats. (A word on the seats: comfortable.)
</P>
<P>
   This brings us back to our starting point. Yes, it's
unmistakably BMW from its traditional vertically slatted cowl
grille, recognizable roof line, and side ``character lines.'' New
are the free-form headlight treatment and bigger wheel openings
(for those bigger tires), and revamped-but-still-recognizable
rear-deck treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly it handles like a BMW, especially with the
above-mentioned sports suspension. Now here is where the ``but''
comes in. Money had to be saved someplace, and the most obvious is
on interior accoutrements.
</P>
<P>
   If you want the extra goodies, you have to pay. Add the Sports
package ($2,400), metallic paint ($475), Xenon lights package
($500), and single-disc CD player ($200) and you're hovering a few
bucks below the $30,000 mark, $29,975 by my count. That's the level
where our test vehicle checked in.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, I'd have liked to add a power moon roof ($1,050),
onboard computer ($300), heated seats ($500), real leather instead
of the tacky (by BMW standards) leatherette ($1,450), navigation
system ($1,990), and upgraded sound system ($675). Total: $35,940.
You get the picture. And you can call me Lord Plushbottom, because
one does get spoiled by all these toys.
</P>
<P>
   However, you get a lot for your money in the basic car.
</P>
<P>
   Especially when you consider that the 323i is the vanguard of
BMW's redesign program for these 3-series cars. Coming are similar
redesigns of the coupe and convertible. With BMW, buying early in
the series means you might have a long relationship with your car
because designs often last for eight years, and the marque has
proven reliability.
</P>
<P>
   The 323i's 2.5-liter straight six definitely qualifies it as the
little brother to the 2.8-liter six in the 328i. The 2.8 is
slightly more powerful, slightly faster (0-60 in 6.6 as opposed to
7.1 seconds, according to manufacturer's claims _ it just didn't
seem that quick) and a little more expensive ($33,400 base).
</P>
<P>
   But the 2.5-liter is adequate, with sufficient torque at low and
medium engine speeds _ familiar conditions indeed for us
city-dwellers.
</P>
<P>
   The 323i cleanly passed my off-hours commuting road tests.
</P>
<P>
   It effortlessly hit 60 miles per hour coming off an on-ramp to
merge smoothly onto Rte. 93. It also nicely handled Mass. Highway's
surprise lane shift where Rte. 93 north passes the Mass. Pike exit
(if you can't stay in your lane, your car flunks this test).
</P>
<P>
   The BMW also charged straight through Mass. Highway's
across-the-grain bumps stretch that leads into the South Station
Tunnel heading northbound. (Who says you need a hidden test track?)
</P>
<P>
   This was a vehicle that lures you into taking the long way home
or to drive an extra 50 miles for dinner. That tells me BMW has
fulfilled its mission by continuing to provide driving pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   The five-speed manual transmission's gears are nicely spaced,
and the clutch action is so smooth that you can engage first gear
with no pressure on the accelerator pedal. Wind it up through the
gears with the radio off and you catch a pleasingly understated
whine from the drivetrain and exhaust.
</P>
<P>
   The clutch is self-adjusting, a feature BMW promises will
greatly extend clutch life and maintain continuity of performance.
Finding reverse can be a challenge at first _ until you become used
to pushing through the spring-loaded gate.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years ago, only those in the country-club set knew
the term Beemer (it was once excised from a Globe Sports section
story in the '70s because no one on the copy desk recognized it);
now, BMW continues to appeal to the club set by boasting that the
323i's trunk is ``configured for two golf bags transversely; they
don't have to be positioned diagonally.''
</P>
<P>
   If trunk room is good, front-seat space is sensational. A
fair-minded person would say that some of that should be shared
with the rear-seat occupants. There's ``some'' space, but I
wouldn't want to be back there for an all-day trip with two other
normal-sized folks.
</P>
<P>
   I want to be up front at the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Because BMWs are all about driving. From the entry-level on up.

THESE CELL PHONES ARE SMARTER THAN YOU 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We've come to expect that cellular phones would keep getting
smaller. And some of them will.
</P>
<P>
   But others are getting bigger and heavier, as designers cram
them with advanced features that might almost make you forget to
phone home.
</P>
<P>
   Now that half of us have computers at home and the Internet is
part of our way of life, it's not enough for cell phones to be just
phones.
</P>
<P>
   People need ``smart phones'' capable of exchanging data with
their desktop machines and even communicating over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   At least, this is what the phone makers think. So they're
churning out a lot of high-powered hardware that could give your
briefcase a higher IQ than your brain.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of the smartest and biggest portable phones comes from the
Finnish firm Nokia (www.nokia.com). Their 9000IL Communicator isa
cell phone that wants to be a laptop.
</P>
<P>
   The telephonic face of the device flips open to reveal a cramped
but serviceable keyboard and a small black-and-white liquid crystal
screen. From here you can keep track of your appointments, type
notes, and send faxes.
</P>
<P>
   And as you'd expect, the Communicator has address book software
that links up nicely with the cell phone. Just look up the name of
someone you need to call, press a button, and the Communicator
gives that person a ring.
</P>
<P>
   The Communicator also boasts full-service Internet access _ or
as full service as you can get with a slow, wireless modem. If you
already have an account with an Internet service provider, you can
peck your way through a rather gnarly set-up procedure, and wind up
with a device that will collect your e-mail, send replies, and even
do a bit of Web surfing.
</P>
<P>
   You wouldn't want to spend much time browsing on the
Communicator, with its small monochrome screen and tiny keyboard.
But the device has its uses.
</P>
<P>
   It works well enough to let you download news headlines, for
instance. Or you could pop over to the MapQuest Web site and get
driving directions to your next appointment.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, by the time you download them, using a modem with a
top speed of 13,200 bits per second, it'd probably be easier to
find out by calling instead.
</P>
<P>
   All this comes in a package that weighs about a pound. Carry
this in your suit jacket and you'll be walking sideways. Then
again, the reduced weight of your wallet may compensate _ the
9000IL goes for around $700, with cellular activation.
</P>
<P>
   But tuck the Communicator in a briefcase or purse, and you've
got an acceptable laptop substitute for light-duty road trips.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Soon, you'll be able to get your hands on a device that does
much the same stuff as the Nokia Communicator, but which will fit a
little more comfortably in a pocket.
</P>
<P>
   That's because cell phone maker Qualcomm (www.qualcomm.com) has
teamed up with 3Com (www.3com.com), maker of the popular Palm Pilot
electronic organizers. The result is the PDQ, a phone with a
built-in Palm Pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by a prototype we've seen, the PDQ is a sleeker, lighter
alternative to the Nokia phone. It's been cleverly designed with a
thin phone keypad that flips down to reveal a standard Palm Pilot
device.
</P>
<P>
   Qualcomm's PDQ will have a strong advantage over rival products
when it comes to market. There are more than 3 million Palm Pilot
users who are already comfortable with that pen-operated device, so
a PDQ will feel like coming home.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there are lots of auxiliary software programs
designed especially for Palm devices, as well as Web sites that
have created special content for the new Palm VII wireless Web
surfing device. All this stuff will work with the PDQ as well.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the PDQ can't match the crowd-pleasing proportions and
light weight of a Palm Pilot. Just having to include a hefty
battery to power both cell phone and Palm device turns the PDQ into
a brick. A small, light, rather pretty brick, to be sure, but not
the easiest device to tote.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The engineers at Motorola (www.motorola.com) opted for a
different approach _ less brains, but also less strain.
</P>
<P>
   Like Qualcomm, they decided to add an existing pocket computer
to one of their phones. But Motorola picked the smallest, simplest
device of its kind _ Franklin Electronics's Rex (www.franklin.com)
pocket organizer.
</P>
<P>
   The Rex is far less sophisticated than a Palm. You can't enter
text by writing on the screen with a pen, or download new software.
All the Rex will do is store your address book, appointments, and
other such housekeeping data. Attach the Rex to a computer, upload
the data into it, and slip it into your shirt pocket.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola bought Starfish Software (www.starfish.com), the firm
that made the underlying software for the Rex. But then they got
really clever. Instead of designing a new kind of cell phone with a
Rex built in, they designed a clip-on device that lets you attach a
new version of the Rex to one of Motorola's ultra-small StarTAC
flip phones.
</P>
<P>
   It's called the StarTAC Clip-On Organizer and it sells for $250,
not including phone. A StarTAC phone will run around $300 or so
with activation.
</P>
<P>
   It won't surf the Internet or check your e-mail, but it will
dial any phone number in the Rex address book at the touch of a
button. It has limited data entry features that let you add more
names, numbers, or appointments.
</P>
<P>
   And the Clip-On Organizer lets you keep all this important data
right where it will do the most good _ clipped to the side of a
phone so small you could lose it in a well-stuffed purse.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the Clip-On attached, the Motorola weighs only about 6
ounces _ by far the lightest of this trio. Which might make it the
smartest cell phone of all.

pike that not only make your work life go more smoothly, but are
fun to use, too. Here's a look at three we found.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Everyone hates passwords and for good reason. There's a password
for your ATM, a password to get into the company parking lot, a
password to log onto your PC, a password to check your voice mail.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, we forget one password or another at some point.
</P>
<P>
   Polaroid (www.polaroid.com) is one of several companies offering
products that promise to make memorizing computer passwords a thing
of the past, while also offering improved security for your office
or home PC.
</P>
<P>
   The Finger Imaging Scanner PFS-100 uses the science of
biometrics, the study of measuring unique biological traits and
characteristics. A fingerprint is one of those traits.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers have spent considerable time developing a fingerprint
scanner with a minimum of parts.
</P>
<P>
   Polaroid and other companies are negotiating with keyboard
makers to install the scanner along the top of standard boards. It
would add less than $50 to the cost of a keyboard, Polaroid says;
it expects keyboards with built-in scanners to appear on the market
later this year.
</P>
<P>
   How it works: The software to operate the scanner is called
Midas. You establish a password account with Midas and scan a
fingerprint image to be used as your password.
</P>
<P>
   The next time you log on, a box appears on your PC screen
prompting you to supply a fingerprint image. When you place your
finger in the slot, an image of your fingerprint appears on the
screen above a bar measuring the quality of the scan.
</P>
<P>
   If the print is recognized, the box disappears and the start-up
screen appears. If the print is rejected, and several attempts to
fool the scanner fail, a message appears saying the fingerprint is
not registered.
</P>
<P>
   I had a problem after establishing my left index finger as the
password key. The scanner had a hard time recognizing the image in
subsequent scans. Polaroid says about 5 percent of fingers are
difficult to scan. When I established an account with my right
index finger, I had no trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Logging on with the scanner was painless, and after repeated
use, I longed to have this gizmo on my PC. Unfortunately, it was a
demo.
</P>
<P>
   The Midas software goes beyond simply protecting your PC; it
allows you to lock specific files and applications as well. It also
permits multiple users on the same machine, a useful feature in
workplaces where people on different shifts share the same PC.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, biometric proponents envision scanners as a key
component of e-commerce security. Consider the following scenario:
You log on to a Web store and place your order for a book. Next to
your finger scanner is a built-in magnetic card swipe that runs
along the top of your keyboard. You are prompted to run your credit
card through the swipe. Then, to ensure against fraud, you are
asked to provide your fingerprint.
</P>
<P>
   The finger image scanner has obvious Orwellian implications that
are sure to worry privacy proponents. It's one thing to give a
company your credit card number; it's a whole other ballgame when
they have a record of a unique part of you.
</P>
<P>
   The image taken and stored by the Polaroid scanner is not of a
fingerprint, but of fingerprint minutia, the unique characteristics
of a fingerprint. Polaroid links the characteristics using an
algorithm to create a pattern for each user. Even though the image
stored is not of the actual fingerprint, the image itself is
unique.
</P>
<P>
   Polaroid acknowledges the potential privacy concern, but views
its product as a balancing act. ``Some intrusiveness is traded to
achieve security,'' according to the company.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although computers may portend a paperless world, there are
still times when taking notes on pulp products is either
unavoidable or preferable.
</P>
<P>
   A judge, for instance, is unlikely to tolerate a lawyer who taps
away on a laptop while listening to a witness testify. Writing on
paper remains a quiet exercise.
</P>
<P>
   A.T. Cross Co. (www.cross.com) in Lincoln, R.I., came up with a
way to take advantage of the best of the old and new with its
CrossPad portable digital notepad.
</P>
<P>
   This product enables you to upload your handwritten notes to
your PC or laptop and, with some training and effort, translate
your notes into text.
</P>
<P>
   Cross offers two versions: The CrossPad ($299) uses letter-size
(8.5- by 11-inch) notepads. The smaller CrossPad XP ($249) uses
memo-size (6- by 9-inch) notebooks.
</P>
<P>
   The key to the CrossPad is a special pen with a transmitter that
sends digital signals to the tablet underneath the paper pad while
producing traditional ink for your note taking.
</P>
<P>
   The tablet itself is lightweight. A digital display at the
bottom of the tablet indicates which page is being recorded and
menu options.
</P>
<P>
   After taking notes on the digital tablet, the CrossPad can be
connected to a PC through any COM port. A simple menu command
triggers an uplink of the digital notes to the PC.
</P>
<P>
   The notes can be stored as images _ a picture of the page with
your notes scribbled on it _ or the IBM Ink Manager software
packaged with theCrossPad can translate your notes into electronic
text.
</P>
<P>
   This latter process, however, is tricky. When the Ink Manager
software first tried to translate my admittedly difficult-to-read
handwriting to text, the results were poor. Most of the words were
misinterpreted.
</P>
<P>
   The software includes a program to help recognize your unique
writing characteristics. The improved handwriting recognition
exercises, however, are time-consuming and do not guarantee 100
percent accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't need to convert your notes into electronic text,
the software allows you to establish keywords and bookmarks in your
notes for quick retrieval of the page image.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tape recorders have been a tool in workplaces for decades. But
how about a tape-less recorder?
</P>
<P>
   The V-90 Digital Voice Recorder ($99) by Olympus
(www.olympus.com) is one of a new wave of devices that store
recordings electronically.
</P>
<P>
   This device is stunning for both its size and ease of use.
</P>
<P>
   The ergonomically-designed recorder easily fits into the palm of
your hand. The most important buttons, such as play and record, are
where your thumb and index finger rest.
</P>
<P>
   The device is so light that even the instruction booklet
outweighs it.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its size, this recorder comes with many bells and
whistles.
</P>
<P>
   Messages are recorded and stored in three folders. Each folder
can store up to 99 messages or recordings, but the overall combined
maximum recording time is 90 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   An LCD (liquid crystal display) window indicates date, time,
battery life, recording length, and the numbered message being
recorded or played. The recording quality is surprisingly good.
</P>
<P>
   One impressive feature is an alarm. It allows you to select a
message you want played and the date and time you want to hear it.
At the appropriate time, a series of beeps sounds. Press any
button, and the preselected message plays.

UPGRADE WOES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SIMSON L. GARFINKLE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; I upgraded my desktop computer last week, but I didn't really
want to.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, I was forced to upgrade my system _ thanks to the
fast-moving world of microprocessor design, the tyranny of
just-in-time inventory, and the second law of thermodynamics.
</P>
<P>
   It all started last Monday. I had turned off my computer's
screen for the weekend on Friday, but in my rush to leave the
office I had neglected to turn off the computer itself.
</P>
<P>
   Monday morning I found the computer humming, just as I had left
it. But the moment I turned on the monitor, I knew something was
wrong. The computer was frozen in the middle of its power-on
self-test. I hit a few keys, with no response. So I turned the
computer off, waited 15 seconds, and turned it back on. This time,
I didn't even get the self-test: there was nothing on the screen at
all.
</P>
<P>
   Times like these are when trained computer professionals get
that sinking feeling in their stomachs. So with my screwdriver in
hand, I pried the case off my computer's box and peered inside.
</P>
<P>
   What I saw wasn't pretty. Sometime during the weekend, the tiny
fan that sits atop my computer's central processing unit had
stopped spinning. Deprived of its supply of fresh air, the 200 MHz
AMD K6 microprocessor had overheated and apparently
self-destructed. The fan, meanwhile, had melted from the resulting
heat buildup.
</P>
<P>
   The easiest way to fix my computer, I decided, would be to go
out and get a new 200 MHz K6 microprocessor. After all, the data on
my hard drive was presumably still good, and I had spent a lot of
time setting up my computer with just the right combination of
add-ons. Moreover, my desktop had 256MB of RAM. I really didn't
want to buy a new computer.
</P>
<P>
   But when I went to my local computer store, I learned that the
200 MHz K6 chip isn't sold any more. The store could special-order
a 233 MHz K6 chip; it would cost just $35, but it might take a few
weeks to come in. The store did stock a 400 MHz K6-2 chip for $100,
but that chip was no good: my computer's motherboard could only go
up to 233 MHz. So I took out my cell phone, called around to a
bunch of other stores, and even had a friend search on the Web. The
result everywhere was the same: no slow chips.
</P>
<P>
   So in addition to replacing my microprocessor, I ended up having
to replace my computer's motherboard. And since the new motherboard
used a different kind of memory, I had to buy new RAM chips as
well. An hour later I walked out of the store, having spent just
over $400.
</P>
<P>
   I went back to my office, unplugged all the cards and cables
from my old system board, and removed that board. Then I screwed in
the new system board, reattached all the cables, crossed my fingers
and turned it on.
</P>
<P>
   The computer should have booted right up into Windows 98, but it
didn't. After four hours of fiddling around, I discovered why: for
some reason, my antivirus software wasn't quite compatible with the
new system board. I removed the offending program and tried again.
A few minutes later my computer was booting up just like it had
before the disaster, except now it was running nearly three times
as fast.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not the only person I know who has been forced to upgrade
because of the lack of a part. Last year a friend's mother bought a
computer from Compaq. Six months later, the hard drive stopped
working. When the Compaq technician came to replace it, she was
told that her computer's hard drive was so small that Compaq didn't
carry a replacement in stock: the drive would have to
special-ordered.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks later she was told that small drives were simply
unavailable; she would have to get a newer drive with twice the
storage capacity. But alas, when the new drive came, it wasn't
compatible with the rest of her computer. After a few more
frustrating service calls, Compaq ultimately replaced the woman's
entire machine.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few years ago an upgrade was a thrifty way to prolong the
life of an old computer. But today, computer technology is moving
so fast, and new computers are so cheap, that many people are
passing up upgrades and simply buying new machines. Does it still
make sense to upgrade old equipment? The answer depends on what you
are contemplating, your skill, and the kind of system that's on
your desk.
</P>
<P>
   If you are running low on disk space, installing a new hard disk
drive is a fairly easy task and usually well worth the expense.
Although most PCs come with a single hard drive, most cases have
room and the appropriate connectors for two. To add a second hard
disk, all you need to do is open up your machine, screw the new
disk down, and plug it in.
</P>
<P>
   Since you can purchase an 8 gigabyte hard disk for just under
$130, or 20 gigabyte disk for around $200, it is hard to justify
buying a new computer just to get more disk space. Just one word of
advice: as the experience my friend's mother had with Compaq shows,
it's easier to add a second drive than to replace your only drive.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if what you crave is a faster machine,
upgrading can be more complicated than most people want. My case is
typical: today's faster CPUs require faster motherboards, faster
memory, and sometimes better fans or power supplies.
</P>
<P>
   For many people, the convenience of buying a prepackaged system
is worth the added cost. But if you are willing to mess around with
all of the wires and screws, you can save yourself a few hundred
dollars by buying a new motherboard. Just be sure that you buy one
that fits.

INSTANT SENSATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'd love to read the instant messages that must be flying back
and forth between Microsoft Corp. CEO Bill Gates and America Online
Inc. chief Steve Case:
</P>
<P>
   Gates: Hi.
</P>
<P>
   Case: Hi, Bill. Didn't know you used our AIM instant messaging
software.
</P>
<P>
   Gates: I don't. This is a new messaging program our guys dreamed
up. Hope you like it.
</P>
<P>
   Case: Cute, Bill. But our messaging program doesn't work with
anybody else's.
</P>
<P>
   Gates: Yeah . . . we've been waiting for you to fix that bug in
your program. But you took too long. So a couple of our Windows
2000 guys decided to fix it during their coffee break. I think they
did OK. You agree?
</P>
<P>
   Case: You saying your program connects to our messaging system?
You can't do that!
</P>
<P>
   Gates: Why not? This way, AIM users will be able to send
messages to lots more people. And I'm looking forward to having
friendly chats like this with all your millions of customers. It'll
be nice.
</P>
<P>
   Case: Nice? Nice? Those are OUR customers! Go away.
</P>
<P>
   Gates: Make me.
</P>
<P>
   And so on.
</P>
<P>
   To a tech journalist lonely for the days of Web browser wars,
the AOL-Microsoft instant messaging spat is as welcome as a summer
shower. Not only is it a dramatic way for Microsoft to establish
itself in a booming new segment of the Internet business; it's also
a rare opportunity for Microsoft to position itself as the scrappy,
gutsy outsider challenging a mighty corporate oligarch. After
months of public humiliation at the federal antitrust trial,
Microsoft has come up with a way to boost its business and look
like a hero at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   I almost feel sorry for AOL. Here's a company that saw the value
of instant messaging before almost anybody else. Years ago, they
began with the ``buddy list'' feature that let AOL subscribers
shoot messages to each other. Then came AIM, which can be used by
anyone on the Internet, even if they don't subscribe to AOL. To top
it off, AOL last year purchased the Israeli firm ICQ, maker of
another popular instant messaging system.
</P>
<P>
   There was just one little problem. For all its connections to
the Internet, AOL is still a closed computer network that uses its
own software standards rather than the international standards used
on the Net. The company's instant messaging services do the same,
with the result that AOL's 35 million AIM users and their 35
million ICQ users can't even message each other, much less send
messages to anybody else.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness to AOL, there isn't an international standard for
universal instant messaging yet. The Internet Engineering Task
Force should have one in a year or so. But even then, AOL has
little incentive to embrace it. As long as those 70 million people
are locked into AOL-owned networks, then AOL gets a free run at
their hearts, minds, and credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft understands a basic rule of business streetfighting _
never give your rival a profit sanctuary. Attack on all fronts. And
attack they have, in a most ironic way.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has basically hacked the AIM server software, writing
a program that tricks it into granting access to users of the
Microsoft messenger program. A furious AOL has responded by closing
loopholes in the software. But Microsoft engineers keep posting new
versions of their software that defeat the AOL blockade. It's
probably the most fun the Microsofties have had in years, and it's
a pleasure to watch.
</P>
<P>
   AOL is suing for peace, saying that it's willing to work with
Microsoft to make their messenger products compatible. But so far,
Microsoft has responded with a sneer. Good for them. By its action,
Microsoft is forcing the issue not just on AOL, but on
up-and-coming makers of instant messaging products, like Tribal
Voice and Odigo. By taking a hard line, Microsoft is firing off
flash traffic to the whole instant messaging industry: Open up your
networks. Or we might just do it for you.

FOR TOO MANY SITES, BEING FIRST IS FOREMOST

   There it was in print: a picture of three fetuses in amniotic
fluid, blissfully unaware of their imminent change in scenery. And
there was the invitation: ``For the first time ever, you can view
the birth of triplets LIVE over the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Here we go again, another dubious Internet ``first'' brought to
you by the same folks who staged the ``first live birth'' online
last year. The photo was featured in a half-page advertisement that
ran Monday in national newspapers including the Globe (which
charges $20,364.75 for a half page). ``Point. Click,'' the ad read.
``It's a girl, a girl, and a boy.''
</P>
<P>
   The triplets, Deanna, Desiree, and Christopher Diaz, made their
grand entrance on TheHealthNetwork.com, a new entity formed when
Fox Network combined its own Fit TV with ahn.com and America's
Health Network. The folks at ahn.com made headlines last year when
they broadcast the arrival of Baby Sean; days later, Sean's mom was
was arrested on check fraud charges after authorities spotted her
online. Bad news for Mom, great publicity for the network.
</P>
<P>
   This time out, the network was touting its new incarnation in
the Fox family. The archived tape of the Diaz Cesarean section
plays like a slick, soft news magazine, with scripted commentary
and commercial interruptions. See the babies cry. Wait for their
post-natal scores. Watch sneak previews of upcoming shows.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, some medical student may be able to pick up a few
pointers from the surgery, but does the world really need another
Internet ``first''? Funny, the stunt was aired the day before the
30th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing, a bona fide first.
If Neil Armstrong took his small step today, it would only be a
matter of time before Web broadcasters were hawking the first lunar
pas de deux or the first outerspace hop, skip, and a jump. (On the
day of the anniversary, a site called space.com was launched,
billing itself as ``the first mover on the Web'' in the aerospace
category.)
</P>
<P>
   Everyone is one-upping each other online; everybody's stretching
to come up with the first, the only, the ultimate. We've lost all
perspective of what's significant and what's hype. That's not to
say there haven't been genuine online innovations. The first time
an engineer named Ray Tomlinson typed the (at) sign in an e-mail,
he created a global icon. The first time librarian Jean Armour
Polly wrote the words ``surfing the Net,'' she coined a universal
catchphrase.
</P>
<P>
   But really, this is getting out of hand. You've heard about
first editions, the First Amendment, first aid. But the first
virtual bowling game? The first Japanese pizza page? You can find
both of those online. The page featuring squid ink pizza
(www.oakland.edu/mdchachi/jpizza.html) even won an award from
``Sick Site of the Day;'' and it has already spawned copycats, such
as Utah's first Internet pizza camera page, which may or may not
serve a useful purpose at the 2002 Winter Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the innovations are created by regular Joes yearning to
stand out, desperate for distinction. But is there really any great
claim to fame for the first Internet cafe in Latvia or Bucharest?
Does anyone really care about the first home page targeted at beer
collectors in Bucharest? Is there a prize for the first redneck on
the Internet?
</P>
<P>
   I'm not making any of this up; all these pages exist. Ye of
little faith, visit the self-described redneck at www.cledus.com.
Or browse at the first Internet tie store (www.wildties.com), which
features such neckwear categories as oinks, Beatles, and Cirque de
Soleil.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet, after all, is the great equalizer: Now unknowns
are entitled to promote their own fabulousness, just like the admen
on Madison Ave. This sort of self-promotion is essentially
harmless, but what's it all about? Are we all so programmed by the
slick techniques of advertising that we all want to wear some
hyperbolic label? We didn't win the spelling bee or First Prize at
the science fair, so does that mean we have to make up for it by
creating the first Liz Phair fan site?
</P>
<P>
   The individuals staging these firsts are one thing, but the
corporate publicity stunts are another thing entirely. Last year,
the live birth garnered international attention, with 1.4 million
viewers boosting the launch of the commercial health network.
Mission accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   But why did so many people watch? Nobody wants to miss their
chance to be a first-class voyeur. Last year, folks went nutty when
two alleged teenagers promised to become the first lovers to lose
their virginity online, broadcasting their romance on a site called
``Our First Time.'' The whole thing turned out to be a theatrical
hoax orchestrated by two aspiring actors, a filmmaker, and an
online sex shop. Reporters who were perfectly happy to cover this
history-making event went ballistic when they found out that the
venture into virgin territory was actually a scam.
</P>
<P>
   But the race to be first continues. What's next? The Elite
modeling agency just introduced the first virtual model, a lovely
lady known as Webbie Tookay. Maybe she'll marry Buzz Lightyear from
``Toy Story,'' and we'll be treated to the first online birth of
the first virtual baby.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe everyone will stop all this nonsense, and folks will be
happy with second or third or just Honorable Mention. Folks will
stop claiming they're breaking new ground with the most far-fetched
innovation. Now that would be a true Internet first, and you'll
read about it here firs. . . Oh, never mind.

HIS SHINGLES ARE STREAKED AND SPOTTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Three years ago, I put up new red cedar shingles on my
70-year-old, three-story house. A local painter applied an oil
primer, then a brown stain of some kind. There are a lot of streaks
and spots, and the house looks awful, although only a quarter of it
looks that bad. A contractor suggested putting up new shingles.
What can I do about it?
</P>
<P>
   DAVID MILLARD, Needham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Replace three-year-old shingles? That is the ultimate in
folly. It is not the shingles that are acting up, but the stain. I
just wonder if the painter applied a semitransparent stain over the
primer, but that would look horrible from the start, because a
semitransparent stain cannot be put over a primer or old paint. So,
if it is not a semitransparent, it must be a solid stain, latex or
oil. If so, and only one coat was applied, then it is the fault of
the solid stain, which sometimes does get streaked and spotty over
time.
</P>
<P>
   I suggest this solution: If the stain is peeling or flaking,
scrape and sand. If it is not peeling, sand as necessary. Then
apply two thin coats of a solid-color latex stain. Thin coats are
important; I would also change the brand, too, but try not to
change the color too much. Stains usually last about five years
before wearing away or fading; in your case, three years before
trouble is not long enough.

   Q. What are the pros and cons of asbestos-cement siding? I am
thinking of buying a house with asbestos siding. It is in an ideal
location, and I like the house.
</P>
<P>
   CONCERNED OVER SIDING
</P>
<P>
   A. There are no pros on asbestos-cement siding. Well, one
semi-pro is that on the house, it is safe, as long as it is not
drilled, sanded, abraded, broken, or abused in any way; such action
will release asbestos fibers into the air. The cons are numerous:
You cannot power wash, sand, scrape, or anything, but you can use
bleach and water or detergent and water to clean it. If any paint
is peeling, it cannot be removed by any friction method.
</P>
<P>
   Removing the siding is expensive. One choice is to strike a
bargain with the seller, knocking off some of the price to pay for
removal, or having him remove it before the sale.
</P>
<P>
   With all these things in mind, the better part of valor might be
to look elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am thinking of building a 12- by 12-foot tool house in my
yard. What is best for footings?
</P>
<P>
   DAN ANTHONY, Waltham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Before you do anything, I suggest making the house 12 by 16
feet instead of 12 by 12. For footings, you can put concrete piers
3 feet into the ground, creating a foundation that will not heave
in winter. Or, set the house on 4 x 4 or 4 x 6 pressure-treated
posts sunk 3 feet into the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Or, set concrete blocks on the ground, or a few inches into the
ground, and take your chances that the house will not heave and go
out of level. It may stay stable for some years, but if it does go
out of skew, the size and the weight of the house is going to make
releveling it difficult.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons I suggest making the house bigger: 1. People who
plan such things usually overestimate a tool house's storage
capacity. 2. It's easier to build big now than to add on later. 3.
And in your case, the rectangular shape is more practical than a
square one.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The new central air-conditioning system in my
1,200-square-foot addition on the second floor will not cool to 70
degrees; it seems to stop at 74 degrees. The installer said the
system is slightly oversize, and there is nothing wrong. I had the
thermostat replaced without success. How can I get it to cool?
</P>
<P>
   KATHY WILLIS, Plaistow, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   A. Relatively speaking, 74 degrees is not really that warm. I
don't know the answer, for sure, but here is one question for you:
Are there air returns in the rooms of the addition, to bring air
back to the unit? If there are none, they should be installed,
because without air returns the a/c is pumping air into a dead-end
area, and less air can be pumped in a situation like that.
Sometimes, keeping doors closed will help, sometimes keeping them
open will help.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, make sure the addition is separate from the rest
of the house, so the unit does not try to cool the whole house.
</P>

IF YOU CAN REVERSE A DOOR, YOU CAN DO ANYTHING

<TEXT>
<P>
   There was this handyman, you know, who had his screened porch
closed in.
</P>
<P>
   It worked well, except the entry was awkward, so the handyman's
wife, whose idea the enlcosure was in the first place, suggested,
``Why don't we call back the contractor to relocate the entry to
make it less awkward and allow access to two rooms at once?''
</P>
<P>
   ``A great idea, dear,'' said the handyman, who was so excited
and pleased by this project that he offered to pay for everything _
well, nearly everything.
</P>
<P>
   The deed was done, for a fee, and the handyman and his wife were
delighted. The only problem, said the contractor, is that the back
door now opens the wrong way, blocking entry to the newly enclosed
porch.
</P>
<P>
   No problem, said the handyman, ``I'll just reverse the door.''
</P>
<P>
   The contractor looked a little startled but recovered enough to
reply, ``You do know about renovation, don't you?''
</P>
<P>
   Thereby hangs this tale: how to reverse a door, using hand
tools. The handyman knows he can do it, particularly because he has
done it before, or at least hung new doors. Ergo, anyone can do it.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not reversing the door, rather it is relocating the
hinges on the opposite jamb, and relocating the lock and latch to
their opposite jamb, so the door will open to the left, not to the
right.
</P>
<P>
   You can't turn the door around; that would make the outside face
in, and the hinges would be mislocated, making the door open
outward. Turning it end-to-end obviously will not work, either.
</P>
<P>
   So, the hinges both on the jamb and the door edge must be moved.
And all of this is done with hand tools; there is no router
available to cut the mortises (the openings in which the hinge
leaves fit).
</P>
<P>
   To start, transfer the position of the hinges on the opposite
jamb and the door edge. This is best done with the door closed. Set
a level on the top edge of the hinge, and draw a level line on the
opposite side of the door and the jamb. This new line should be
exactly level with the top of the hinge. Do this to all hinges.
</P>
<P>
   Once the new location of each hinge is marked, undo the hinges,
and take down the door. Position one leaf of a hinge (a leaf is
half a hinge) on a new location, and drive all screws in place.
</P>
<P>
   Now, cut around the hinge leaf with a utility knife; this will
provide the exact mortise to set the hinge leaf flush with the door
edge. The leaf will fit snugly once the mortise is cut. Tracing the
hinge leaf with a pencil, then cutting, will not be as accurate,
resulting in a loose fit.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the hinge leaf, and cut the opening as deeply as the leaf
is thick. Make several parallel cuts in the mortise so that you can
chisel out the wood accurately. Use a good, sharp chisel, and chip
away, being careful not to gouge too deeply.
</P>
<P>
   Do this with all the hinges. On an exterior door there are
usually three hinges, making the project a little longer. Once all
mortises are cut, set in the hinge leafs, screw them home, and set
the door on the hinges, fit in the hinge pins and see if it works.
If it does, it means you lined up all the hinge leaves properly. If
it doesn't, then it's back to the drawing board to figure out what
went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   A bad fit may mean that the hinges are too deep or shallow in
their mortises, or they are misaligned. Hope that the hinge leaves
are not misaligned. It is really tough to try to relocate the
hinges; it means you may have to make the mortise higher or lower
to make it meet with its partner on the jamb.
</P>
<P>
   Making the mortise larger will reduce the holding power of the
hinge. A snug mortise fit is important because the edge of the leaf
sits on the bottom of the mortise, which is sort of a shelf. With
this support, there's less tension on the screws.
</P>
<P>
   Once the door works, you can fill in the old, empty mortises
with a thin piece of wood. Glue it in, sand smooth and restain or
repaint.
</P>
<P>
   How about the latch and lock? Most locks are reversible, so it
is simply a matter of removing the lock and striker (the latch
opening on the jamb), drilling the proper holes on the opposite
edge of the door, relocating the striker, and seeing how things
work.
</P>
<P>
   You can fill the holes left by the lock's removal with large
dowels or a disk of wood as thick as the door. Glue them in, sand
smooth, and restain or repaint. The plug will show, but not much.
The strength of the door will not be affected; it will be as strong
as it was originally.
</P>
<P>
   And you will have your reversed door, opening the right way,
ready for everyone to ooh and ah over your brilliance.

 Tying genetic change to growth of cancers
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For years, scientists have known that mistakes, or mutations, in
certain key genes can trigger cancer. But they haven't known
whether these initial genetic changes continue to play a role over
time in helping tumor cells thrive. Now, they do.
</P>
<P>
   Writing in the current Nature, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute
researchers have shown that a mutated form of the ras gene not only
triggers melanoma, a potentially fatal form of skin cancer, but
keeps melanoma cells growing. It does this in part by stimulating
vascular endothelial growth factors that cause blood vessels to
grow near tumors to supply them with nutrients.
</P>
<P>
   Working with mice, molecular biologists Lynda Chin and Ronald
DePinho found a way to turn ras on and off by altering the animals'
drinking water. When they turned it on (by adding a compound to the
water), the animals developed melanomas in two or three months.
When the compound was withdrawn (in essence, when the genetic
``switch'' was turned off), the tumors shrank.
</P>
<P>
   That suggests that ras continues to pump out signals that keep
cancer growing _ and that anti-ras drugs now under development
might be able to stop cancer growth.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Testing newborns' urine for cerebral palsy risk
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Taiwanese researchers writing in the current New England Journal
of Medicine report that a urine test can help identify newborns at
risk for oxygen deprivation in the brain that can lead to cerebral
palsy. CP is a relatively rare, but devastating neurological
disease that affects 3 of every 1,000 babies and can be triggered
by oxygen deprivation during delivery.
</P>
<P>
   For 130 years, doctors have tried to find better ways to spot
the newborns at highest risk, says Dr. Jeffrey M. Perlman , a
pediatrician at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center
in Dallas, who wrote an editorial accompanying the report. Babies
whose blood is acidic, who have sluggish heart rates and
respiration, or who need resuscitation seem to be at highest risk.
</P>
<P>
   Testing the urine within six hours of birth for the ratio of two
metabolic products, lactate and creatinine, can help spot babies at
highest risk, the study indicates. Research is under way to see
whether moderately cooling high-risk babies to 94 degrees
Fahrenheit can minimize brain damage.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; MGH researchers back regular mammograms
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Using a computer model based on tumor growth and spread,
Massachusetts General Hospital researchers confirm what 20 years'
worth of clinical trials show _ mammograms every one to three years
reduce the risk of dying from breast cancer by 30 percent. It also
shows the importance of regular mammograms.
</P>
<P>
   But the model goes further: It suggests that if women had
mammograms every six months, they could reduce their risk of death
from breast cancer by 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The MGH team, writing in the August issue of Radiology, stops
short of recommending mammograms that often, but says this should
be tested. Currently, the American Medical Association, the
American Cancer Society, and others recommend annual mammograms for
women 40 and over. The National Cancer Institute recommends them
every one to two years for women 40 and over.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Aquariums found to aid appetites
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In other medical news . . .
</P>
<P>
   --A Purdue University nursing professor has found that putting
aquariums in nursing homes helps Alzheimer's disease patients calm
down and eat better. Compared to patients who looked at a picture
of a seascape, those who were riveted by colored fish swimming in a
special, tip-proof tank exhibited fewer disruptive behaviors and
ate on average 17 percent more food, the professor reported at a
recent conference in London.
</P>
<P>
   --People with implanted defibrillators can safely walk through
electronic antitheft systems _ if they get through in less than 15
seconds, Indiana University researchers report in the current
Circulation. The antitheft machines use a beam to detect security
tags; defibrillators can interpret this as a rapid heartbeat _ and
try to shock the heart into normal rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   --In a letter to the New England Journal of Medicine, German
doctors told of a 10-year old boy who arrived at the hospital with
stomach pains after eating. After doctors retrieved a toy
flashlight from his innards, the boy was fine.
</P>
<P>
   So was the flashlight, which still worked.

 &HT;    Blouse-shedding sweeping America
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ After a tension-packed race that went down to the
wire, New York's next U.S. senator, Hillary Rodham Clinton,
celebrated her victory by ripping off her blouse, falling to her
knees and screaming for joy.
</P>
<P>
   Showing her support to her supporters, Clinton clinched her
fists and waved her blouse over her head at the news that her
opponent, New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, had conceded defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was wearing a shimmering silver full-coverage, racerback
bra out of Victoria's Secret Second Skin Satin collection that can
be purchased for only $28 at any Victoria's Secret store or over
the Internet at www.VictoriasSecret.com.
</P>
<P>
   By pulling off her top in a sign of triumph, New York's next
senator was following the recent example of Secretary of State
Madeleine K. Albright, who pulled off her blouse after the
televised signing of a new Mideast peace accord between Palestinian
and Israeli leaders in the White House Rose Garden.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Albright was wearing a white seamless All the Time
by Maidenform underwire bra enhanced with stretch satin and Lycra
spandex to give a superb fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always dreamed of signing a major peace accord in my
Maidenform bra,'' said the jubilant Albright, who couldn't stop
waving her blouse in front of the startled Middle East leaders who
evidently had not picked up on the craze that swept the United
States after Brandi Chastain pulled off her shirt when her kick
clinched the women's world soccer title over China.
</P>
<P>
   Because men soccer players often pull off their shirts in
triumph after a winning move, Chastain's shirt-removal was seen as
an act that demanded equality with men.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any man who would complain that women can't pull off their
shirts the same as men do all the time is a sexist pig,''
challenged the editor of Bras for the Millennium, a new magazine
rumored to be funded by an international consortium of brassiere
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   That warning apparently hit home because very few men have
complained about the fad that is showing up in college classrooms,
in business offices, at board meetings and in the nation's bingo
parlors, as well as during sporting matches.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation has never been confirmed that this latest craze was
the result of a successful marketing ploy by the big bra makers as
a way to get back at the drunken Madison, Wis., fraternity boys who
dreamed up bra-burning as a form of feminist expression.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Nike's stock skyrocketed after investors around
the world put all their holdings into brassieres after Chastain
tore off her shirt before a worldwide television audience and
showed the planet that champions wear Nike's new high-end Inner
Active Sports bra that will sell for $40 in stores near you soon.
</P>
<P>
   Chastain served on an advisory committee of athletes who helped
Nike with advice about the bra during its development.
</P>
<P>
   Nike has personal contracts with Chastain and five other members
of the U.S. women's soccer team. The company supplied the team
members with its new sports bra.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen if professional wrestler Dennis Rodman,
who was famous for pulling off his jersey when he played
basketball, now will pull off his top after he flattens an opponent
with his purse and shows the fans his sponsor's newest sports bra.
</P>
<P>
   If Supreme Court Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Ruth Bader
Ginsburg rip off their robes and peel off their blouses after a
narrow victory on the court, most experts believe the trend begun
by soccer player Chastain will become part of the culture that
makes America such a great and perplexing country.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the end is not in sight.

WHAT TO READ TO LITTLE ONES _ AND WHY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At lunch one day with a group of Harvard undergraduates,
researcher and author Ellen Handler Spitz happened to ask if any of
them had brought a favorite childhood book to college. To her
amazement, all six had, from ``Where the Wild Things Are'' by
Maurice Sendak to ``Love You Forever'' by Robert Munsch.
</P>
<P>
   That a childhood book could serve as a security blanket for an
18-year-old may surprise some parents, but for Spitz it highlights
a long-held belief that books have far more than educational
importance to young children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just the book itself that counts,'' she says. ``It's
the experience that goes with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's the sound of Mama's voice, the cozy feeling that
comes with sitting on her lap, or the way a story can tap into a
child's fantasy life, first books carry a big wallop. Even a
6-month-old can have a favorite book, one whose words have the
power to soothe and calm just because they are familiar.
</P>
<P>
   Reading specialists have long recognized that there are many
advantages for children when we start to read to them from birth.
At the very least, snuggling together creates a cozy, pleasurable
sensation that predisposes a child to want more. But in addition,
even if we don't realize it, we're beginning to communicate
book-handling skills, says researcher Barbara Alexander Pan of
Harvard University Graduate School of Education. Watch a 9- to
12-month-old play with a board book, and you'll see him turn the
pages. The sounds he's making are an attempt to imitate your voice
pattern.
</P>
<P>
   With young babies, the best books are simple ones, with one or
two pictures and words per page. ``At this age, the key is to match
your mood to hers,'' Pan says. By 12 months, he's noticing babies
and animals, so Pan suggests books about both, as well as tactile
books like ``Pat the Bunny'' by Dorothy Kunhardt and board books
that can be safely mouthed.
</P>
<P>
   By 15 months or so, some babies are so active they don't sit
still for a book. That doesn't mean we should stop reading, just
that we need to be spontaneous _ reading while he's in the high
chair _ and flexibile. ``Don't make it a struggle: `Reading is good
for you; we started to read this book and we're going to read it!'
'' says Pan.
</P>
<P>
   At about 18 months, reading starts to get more exciting, as a
child's cognitive abilities change. Now a book functions on more
than one level, which is why a toddler or preschooler wants the
same book over and over again, says Beverly Goldfield, an early
language researcher at Rhode Island College.
</P>
<P>
   Because a young child can only focus on one or two things at a
time, she takes in something new at each reading. ``Repetition may
bore us, but it invigorates a toddler,'' Goldfield says. ``When a
child is bored with a book, you'll know. Until then, as long as she
wants it, a book is serving a purpose for her.''
</P>
<P>
   In one study, Goldfield watched a mother and 2-year-old read the
same book over and over for about a year. When they began, the
mother was pointing to pictures and labeling words. A few months
later, they talked about what the characters were doing and, by the
end of the year, about why they were doing what they were doing.
Often, they stayed on the same page. ``Neither mother nor child
ever seemed bored,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Parents facilitate language development when we connect an
illustration, a written word, or both to an actual object by
pointing it out, literally and figuratively: ``We have a red ball,
too, just like the one in the book. Look!'' ``The gate in this
picture is just like the gate at Grandma's house!''
</P>
<P>
   One day, he'll make a similar connection: ``Daddy car!'' This is
a big deal. ``It means a child has made the leap to understanding
that books are representational,'' says Pan. When we validate the
connection _ ``Yes, that car is blue, just like Daddy's car!'' _
he'll be emboldened to make more.
</P>
<P>
   There may also be a psychological component to wanting the same
book over and over. ``Little kids live in a world where they don't
know what will happen next,'' says Spitz. ``When they master a
book, they know what comes next. That gives them predictability
which equals control and security.'' She lectures at Stanford
University and is the author of ``Inside Pictures Books'' (Yale,
1999).
</P>
<P>
   Maria Tatar, a professor at Harvard who teaches children's
folklore and literature, says it was no surprise to her when her
son used a familiar and beloved book to make his transition from
home to day care. ``Every day, as soon as we got there, he would go
to the same book, and we would read it together several times
before I left. It created a comfort level for him,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, there's a reason why a child is attracted to a
particular book or a specific page. It may be something as simple
as a fascination with the colors or with a tiny detail in an
illustration, or because he likes the sound of the words. ``The
more we pay attention, the better window we have into what's going
on in her mind,'' says Tatar.
</P>
<P>
   Spitz tells of a 3-year-old who loved ``The Very Hungry
Caterpillar'' by Eric Carle. One day when they got to the page
where the caterpillar gets a stomachache, the preschooler
announced, ``He's sick because he misses his mommy.'' Her diagnosis
had nothing to do with the story line _ the caterpillar was sick
because he ate too much _ but, says Spitz, it had everything to do
with developmental issues of separation that typical 3-year-olds
are working on. (Just because you get information like this doesn't
necessarily mean you need to deal with it. ``Just tuck it away and
consider yourself enriched,'' says Spitz.)
</P>
<P>
   Of course, early reading has direct benefits to language
development. Pan says some of the classics in childhood literature
provide the best reading for children not just because they strike
universal themes but also because the language works so well and is
so meaningful. ``The repetition, rhyming, and rhythm grabs their
attention and facilitates learning,'' says Lauren Adams, senior
editor of the Horn Book Magazine, a review journal of children's
literature. Her 13-month-old daughter's favorite book is ``My First
Mother Goose'' by Peter and Iona Opie, which is full of rhymes that
have tickled generations of young children. Repetitive sentence
patterns in a book like ``Goodnight Moon'' help a child learn
syntax.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, ``Goodnight Moon'' by Margaret Wise Brown is the one
book professionals point to over and over as a must for every
baby's bookshelf. Here are some other recommendations. Who knows?
One of them could end up at Harvard with your child:
</P>
<P>
   --For babies from birth to 4 months: ``A Child's First Picture
Book'' by Edward Steichen; any of Helen Oxenbury's baby books,
especially ``Tickle, Tickle''; wordless picture books; poetry.

TIPS FOR PARENTS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --When you're reading, take your cues from your child on whether
to stop and talk about the book. Some kids hate an interruption;
others will ask questions as you go along.
</P>
<P>
   --By 12 months, leave books scattered around the house, even in
his crib, so he'll encounter them as he moves about. The books
should be varied, so some have a more challenging story line or
more complicated illustrations.
</P>
<P>
   --If a child doesn't like a book that you love, respect his
wishes and try it again in a few weeks or months.
</P>
<P>
   --Don't insist that every page be read in its entirety.
</P>
<P>
   --Have a reading routine like bedtime, but also read at least
one other time spontaneously during the day.
</P>
<P>
   --To read wordless stories, take turns: ``I'll tell this page
and you tell the next one.'' The idea is to stimulate her
imagination; anything she comes up with is OK.
</P>
<P>
   --When a child tells you, ``You're reading it wrong!'' your
expression may be different than she's used to. Don't get
defensive. Ask her, ``What's the right way? You teach me.''
</P>
<P>
   --We serve as role models: Does your child see you reading?
</P>
<P>
   --Introduce a new book by leaving it on the floor among the toys
for a few days before actually reading it.
</P>
<P>
   --Encourage an older sibling to read to a younger one.

HOLD THE TUNA, PLEASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you are pregnant, or even thinking of becoming pregnant, stay
away from tuna. And, if you know someone who's pregnant, tell her
the Food and Drug Administration recommends not eating more than
one 8-ounce portion of shark or swordfish a month. According to a
recent advisory from the state Department of Public Health,
pregnant women should also avoid eating fish caught in our state's
rivers, lakes, or streams.
</P>
<P>
   The reason? These fish contain elevated levels of mercury, a
poison that attacks the central nervous system. How potent is it?
Well, a drop of mercury the size of an M&AMP;M is enough to contaminate
the entire Quabbin Reservoir or 5 million gallons of Boston Harbor.
While we've been blissfully unaware, mercury, in mounting
concentrations, has been accumulating in the bodies of many of our
commonly eaten fish.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, you won't drop dead 10 minutes after you eat a tuna
sandwich, but according to a recent study by Health Care Without
Harm and the Environmental Working Group, a 140-pound pregnant
woman risks subtle but permanent brain damage to her fetus by
eating half of a 6-ounce can of tuna per day, and the average
4-year old exceeds the EPA's ``safe'' dose if he or she eats one
small can of tuna per week.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA insists that tuna, shark, and swordfish are safe for the
average human being _ think 155-pound male _ ``provided they are
eaten infrequently (no more than once a week) as part of a balanced
diet,'' but the child in utero faces a special threat. The
developing nervous system is highly susceptible to the toxic
effects of methyl mercury, which, once it enters the mother's body,
easily crosses the placenta, ending up 30 percent higher in fetal
blood cells than in the mother's bloodstream.
</P>
<P>
   Shouldn't this be huge news? If items in our food supply are no
longer totally safe for children and pregnant women, shouldn't it
be cause for immediate action by regulatory agencies?
Unfortunately, not when cause and effect cannot be proven beyond a
shadow of a doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Most of what we know about mercury's effects comes from
overdoses in places like Iran, where a mercury-based fungicide in
bread killed hundreds and damaged the health of thousands. Less is
known about the impact of low-level exposure, although a long-term
study of 7-year-olds in the Faeroe Islands recently found that
children with prenatal exposure to one-third of what are now
considered ``acceptable'' levels of methyl mercury later suffered
from impaired attention, language, and memory, as well as higher
blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The findings are sparse, and very much in dispute. FDA
toxicologist Mike Bolger says such fears are exaggerated, and that
the findings in the Faeroe Islands are complicated by other
factors, like PCBs and dioxin. Tuna is safe, he insists, since it
falls below the FDA's current limit of mercury of one part per
million, although you can't help but wonder how US scientists can
be so positive when Canadian scientists have set their standard for
mercury in fish at half our concentration.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to know what to do when the experts disagree and both
sides are making the strongest case possible. I side with the
conservatives. Having lived this long, I've seen the awareness of a
hazard slowly make its way into popular consciousness before. The
early safety estimates are usually far too optimistic, and by the
time standards are revised downward, a great many people have
suffered.
</P>
<P>
   Remember lead? Asbestos? How about radioactivity?
</P>
<P>
   The danger is clear enough that Governor Cellucci, the other New
England governors and the premiers from eastern Canada have signed
an agreement to curtail by half how much more mercury is released
into the environment by the year 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Until there's less mercury in the environment, however, there
are things you can do to protect yourself and your family. Since
seafood is so good for your health, it's sad that limiting and
varying your consumption of fish is one of them. In addition,
never, never discard a mercury thermometer into the trash. Wait for
a hazardous waste collection day at your local dump to dispose of
it, and when you buy a new one, make it digital.
</P>
<P>
   It may turn out that mercury in fish has nothing to do with what
has been described as an epidemic of attention deficits and
learning disabilities in young children today.
</P>
<P>
   My advice? Avoid it anyway.
</P>

 &HT;    Coptic faithful to celebrate church patriarch in Ohio
 &HT;    (For use Saturday, July 31 and thereafter.)
 &HT;    By Meggen Lindsay
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ For many Egyptian immigrants in the Miami Valley,
this is the most important summer of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Pope Shenouda III, the patriarch of the Coptic religion, is
visiting St. Mina &AMP; St. Abunoub Coptic Orthodox Church in
Centerville Aug. 20. It is the first time the patriarch has come to
southwestern Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is really a big event for us,'' said Father John Ragheb,
41. ``We are really excited _ for some it will be their first time
to meet him, and they will be very honored.''
</P>
<P>
   Shenouda III, who was consecrated as pope of Alexandria and
patriarch of the See of St. Mark in 1971, is the spiritual leader
of more than 25 million Coptic Orthodox Christians worldwide,
including 500,000 in the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The Coptic church was established in 40 A.D. by St. Mark the
Apostle in Egypt and split from the Orthodox church in the fifth
century. The Coptic church is one of the founders of the World
Council of Churches and is a member of the African Council Churches
and the Middle East Council of Churches.
</P>
<P>
   ``When His Holiness became pope in 1971, there were only four
churches in North America. Today there are over 80 churches and one
monostary,'' said Ragheb.
</P>
<P>
   Shenouda III is coming to consecrate a new icon, which was drawn
in Egypt and recently delivered to the church. He may lead a Mass
with his accompanying bishops, but plans are not yet final.
</P>
<P>
   This will be the first time many of the local congregation
members will see the leader of their faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people (in the church) are born here, not in Egypt, and
some married into the church, so they have never seen him,'' said
Ragheb. ``They are excited to get his blessing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ragheb is also excited.
</P>
<P>
   ``He ordained me in 1995 in Egypt,'' he said. ``We haved
traveled all over to spend time with him and listen to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Before he was a Coptic priest, Ragheb was a civil engineer in
California.
</P>
<P>
   ``I received a call from God to do this,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   While a Coptic church has been established in the Miami Valley
for 25 years, an official church was not dedicated until 1991.
Previously, priests came form different cities to conduct Mass, and
the congregation rented buildings.
</P>
<P>
   St. Mina &AMP; St. Abunoub Coptic Orthodox Church, which serves
Dayton, Cincinnati, and Kentucky, has about 60 families in its
congregation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of our members are Egyptian, but we also have American
and Ethiopian families who come,'' said Naeim Tadross, 61, a member
of the board of deacons and the church's treasurer. ``Some people
who are from the Middle East attend as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The church will hold its annual bazaar Saturday and Sunday with
Egyptian food and desserts, crafts and literature.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is for everybody to come,'' said Tadross.
</P>
<P>
   For more information about the bazaar or the church, call (937)
866-0622.

WHERE HIGH BROW AND MONTY HALL MEET AND DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like so much PBS programming, ``Antiques Roadshow'' is trash
without guilt. It's the ``Masterpiece Theater'' version of ``Let's
Make a Deal.'' I'm addicted.
</P>
<P>
   I sit there and watch it and tell myself, hey, this is highly
educational, I'm learning about antiques, when all I'm really doing
is getting vicarious thrills and a dose of savage amusement.
</P>
<P>
   The show taps the mother lode of human eccentricity. Some of the
contestants _ excuse me, guests? hopefuls? petitioners? what do we
call them? _ even look as though they could be trying to get on
``Let's Make a Deal.'' Remember how people used to dress up like
chickens and clowns trying to catch Monty Hall's attention? And
what's with all those people toting bundles of stuff and milling
about in the background looking dazed and aimless, like they're in
a George Romero movie, ``Yard Sale of the Living Dead''?
</P>
<P>
   The last thing I want to do here is get serious, but PBS has
tapped into something elemental in the human psyche with ``Antiques
Roadshow.'' No wonder it can be found on one or another of our
local public television outlets six nights a week. It appeals to
the gambler in all of us, the magical dream that someday we're
going to find a piece of junk that turns out to be worth a fortune.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the lure of schadenfreude, the pleasure we take
from someone else's misfortune. Sure, it's nice when a sweet old
lady discovers she has a treasure, but it's much more satisfying
when somebody clearly thinks she has a treasure and it turns out to
be trash. I don't think we get to see enough of those moments on
the show.
</P>
<P>
   I like it when the expert says, ``Well, we have some good news
and some bad news.'' Because the bad news is almost always a
corker.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent show a woman brought in an Arts and Crafts lamp she
said she'd found stuffed in a box in a corner of her attic. First
the good news, the expert said. It would probably fetch $15,000 to
$20,000 at auction. Then the bad news. If she hadn't cleaned and
polished it, it would bring $85,000 to $125,000.
</P>
<P>
   This little segment was great theater. Watching it, I was swept
by a series of conflicting reactions and emotions, as follows:
</P>
<P>
   --Oh, the poor thing.
</P>
<P>
   --Twenty thousand bucks? For something that looks like her kid
made it at summer camp?
</P>
<P>
   --Ha, that's what she get for being a compulsive cleaner.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing that could have improved the little drama would
have been if the woman had wept and cursed and howled on hearing
the bad news. And if she'd been dressed like a chicken, so much the
better. But she sat there composed, betraying only the slightest
disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the supplicants _ is that the word? _ are so subdued you
might think they'd been tranquilized. Perhaps they're just
exhausted, reduced to a zombie-like state by the ordeal of lugging
their possessions to the show and waiting in line for an appraisal.
Or maybe the show's producers tell them how to behave on camera:
look happy but not too happy, disappointed but not suicidal.
Personally, I wish they'd take a hint from ``Let's Make a Deal''
and encourage people to scream and cry and jump up and down and hug
the guest experts.
</P>
<P>
   But it is PBS, after all, which is why, the next time some
hideous knick-knack turns out to be worth a small fortune, it's
owner will say, almost inevitably, ``Oh really? But I'd never think
of selling it. It has great sentimental value.''
</P>
<P>
   I don't believe it for a second.

THE NEW PRIME TIME: IN THE OFFICE, SURFIN' THE WEB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By YVONNE ABRAHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Where were you on the afternoon of Friday, Sept. 11, 1998?
</P>
<P>
   If you're an office worker, chances are you were at your
computer, guffawing at screen after screen of the lascivious Starr
report on the Clinton/Lewinsky liaison, clicking through that wreck
from which we simply could not look away: the Altoids footnote, the
president's phone call while being serviced, Lewinsky's thoughts on
education policy _ all available all over America within minutes of
its public release, all the best bits immediately accessible via
the Find function.
</P>
<P>
   All not strictly work-related, of course, yet tolerated by many
of the nation's employers, who were preoccupied searching for
keywords themselves.
</P>
<P>
   It was the busiest day in the history of the Internet, that
loose connection of computer networks from all over the world that
most people use for two things: to send and receive e-mail, and to
surf sites conveniently collected for us on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   And in the American workplace, Web use is exploding.
</P>
<P>
   Workers spent 40 percent more time surfing the Web in May than
they did in December, according to Media Metrix, a survey company
that measures Web site visits.
</P>
<P>
   For most of us, the office is the only place where surfing the
Web isn't an exercise in frustration. Internet access is faster at
the office, where computers are often more powerful, and company
connections to the 'Net are fast and remain open continuously. And,
more important, they're free.
</P>
<P>
   And this frenzy of activity has had some interesting
consequences:
</P>
<P>
   --It has created new viewing patterns, shared by millions of
workers during the day, just as they share television viewing
habits at night.
</P>
<P>
   --It spurs predictable and dramatic surges in computer use every
time there is a big breaking news story or a dramatic fluctuation
in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   --It provides ample opportunity for enormous efficiency, but
also for unprecedented time-wasting _ which has companies worried
enough to hire other companies to monitor their employees' use.
</P>
<P>
   --It has driven the American worker further from the person at
the next desk, and closer to the stranger in another time zone _
away from the water cooler, and into the chat room.
</P>
<P>
   --It keeps workers at their desks longer, blurring the lines
between work and home, speeding the arrival of the 24-hour workday.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the Internet is transforming office life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Digital applications allow us more seamlessly to integrate the
different elements in our lives,'' says Douglas McFarland, senior
vice president and general manager of Media Metrix. ``You can be
responding to business e-mails at work, and send a note to your
mom. Or you can be using your computer at home, and send a note to
a (work) colleague from there.''
</P>
<P>
   And according to industry analysts, workers are doing all of
this according to a predictable pattern _ a pattern some industry
folks are calling the new Prime Time.
</P>
<P>
   Internet use in the workplace peaks just the way TV viewing
does, but at very different times _ an advertiser's dream.
</P>
<P>
   There is major workplace Web surfing between 7:30 and 8 a.m.,
according to McFarland. It makes sense: You arrive at the office,
you're a little early, so you put down your coat, then check the
news, or what the stock market has done, or the latest Jennicam
installment.
</P>
<P>
   Usage spikes again at noon, when millions of people are on their
lunch hour but bored with Microsoft Golf or Doom.
</P>
<P>
   The final spike comes at about 3 or 4 in the afternoon, due to
one of two reasons.
</P>
<P>
   No. 1: Your day is getting on, you haven't checked off any of
the items on that nice little to-do list you made at 9 a.m., and
you're worried. So you log on and surf work-related Web sites to
make the best possible use of your time. Your boss wants a report
on the political and financial situation in Malaysia by 6 p.m., and
you're going hell for leather at those search engines. You are a
model employee.
</P>
<P>
   No. 2: Your day is getting on, you haven't checked off any of
the items on that nice little to-do list you made at 9 a.m., and
you've given up. So you log on and surf any sites you can find that
have nothing to do with work. You look for good movies and
restaurants for tonight's date, then check the traffic report.
</P>
<P>
   You surf the local weather site for the weekend forecast, check
how your 401(k) mutual funds did today, and find out if John Tesh
and Connie Sellecca are still together.
</P>
<P>
   So where do workers go when they hop on the Web at work?
</P>
<P>
   A list of the most popular sites visited by office workers
during the day, as compiled by Media Metrix, has search engines
like Yahoo and Internet Service Providers like Netscape clustered
at the top. But the interactive home-page site Geocities comes in
at No. 7, attracting 5.86 million office visitors during May. And
Amazon, at No. 11, attracted 3.58 million workers. Nearly 3 million
people visited online auction house Ebay, while CNN and MSNBC's
sites got visits from about 2.5 million workers each.
</P>
<P>
   And 2.4 million workers were curious enough about what Mother
Nature would do next to click on weather.com.
</P>
<P>
   Though this may shock, shock! some, the list shows that not all
Internet use at work is work-related. There's no getting around it:
Sometimes, American office workers take time out for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In March and early April, for example, visits to ustreas.gov
skyrocketed, and you can bet that all those hits weren't from
accountants, but from average workers downloading tax forms in a
tizzy as the filing deadline approached.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to popular belief _ and the strong impression conveyed
by a recent slew of high-profile resignations _ not all workers are
whiling away their work hours downloading pornography.
</P>
<P>
   Not all, but some. According to Media Metrix, of the 61.6
million Internet users who surfed the Web in March, 5 million
visited adult content sites from their offices at least once during
the month (17.6 million visited from home).
</P>
<P>
   Granted, that's just 8 percent of all the users, but the thought
of millions of workers viewing strangers' naughty bits in dingy
cubicles is hardly a comfort, now is it? Especially when you
consider that those who visit adult content sites are spending an
average of 46 minutes per month there.
</P>
<P>
   But it turns out the stock market is far more distracting to the
American office worker than pornography.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are people using financial sites to buy and sell stocks at
work? Absolutely,'' says McFarland. ``Work usage will often follow
stock trends. If the market is having a very good or bad day, then
usage trends increase.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Media Metrix, at-work visits to financial Web sites
have skyrocketed in recent months. Nearly 3 million workers visited
Yahoo Finance in March, up 26 percent from December 1998. Two
million clicked onto Quicken Financial Network, an increase of 63
percent since December. Traffic at Etrade more than doubled in the
same time frame, from 357,000 to 744,000 visits.
</P>
<P>
   And the upward trend is likely to continue as more and more
traditional stock trading companies throw in the towel and offer
low-fee, click-and-buy transactions.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The fact that workers are trading stocks or reading movie
reviews when they should be preparing reports has many employers
worried: How to control all of this?
</P>
<P>
   McFarland urges calm, and recommends that bosses make a
comparison to another modern marvel of office technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know our employers get logs of our phone calls,'' he
says. ``But very few of them sit down and go through them to
determine which is a business call and which is a personal call.''
</P>
<P>
   Employers simply take it for granted that workers will use the
phone to conduct personal business, and seem unbothered by it for
the most part. Same thing with the Internet: Just because workers
don't use it for work 100 percent of the time doesn't mean their
mice should be confiscated.
</P>
<P>
   Tell that to the burgeoning cadre of corporate watchdogs whose
raison d'etre is to catch you selling Britney Spears collectibles
on the company dime.
</P>
<P>
   They stand at the ready at this very moment, waiting for that
call from your employer. One word from the corner office, and
they'll be swooping down, trying to determine exactly where you've
been pointing and clicking lately.
</P>
<P>
   Reassuring, isn't it?

HARVARD WARS WITH FIRM OVER WEB SITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAMES BANDLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not long after Chai Ling launched her Internet start-up venture,
her publicist boasted that she was ready for the rough-and-tumble
business world, having led ``thousands of students against a
communist government more ruthless than Microsoft.'' What the
publicist didn't mention was that Jenzabar.com, the former Beijing
student leader's company, was already under fire, this time from
the legal guns at the Harvard Business School.
</P>
<P>
   For months, the dispute was waged politely and quietly, with
Harvard's lawyers contending that Jenzabar was trying to capitalize
on the business school's blue-chip reputation. The business
school's lawyers demanded that Jenzabar stop posting a claim on its
Web site that the Cambridge, Mass. company's main product had been
designed by the same technowizards who designed the business
school's intranet system.
</P>
<P>
   An intranet system is a Web site accessible to a limited number
of users, often the employees of a single company or the students,
faculty, staff, and alumni of a school. Jenzabar markets intranet
technology to colleges and universities.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the dispute is out in the open.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Harvard Business School name stands for excellence and
integrity,'' said Loretto Crane, a business school spokeswoman.
``It's not surprising that people want to leverage some sort of
relationship with it. It's also not surprising that the school is
concerned when it's used inappropriately.``
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the business school _ like Harvard University as a whole
_ jealously guards the use of its name. Perhaps as many as 50 times
a year, the university counsel's office swings into action, sending
out cease-and-desist letters to companies and individuals that are
trying to improperly capitalize on the Harvard name. Most recently,
university lawyers sent out a cease-and-desist letter over Ralph
Lauren's use of the law school's crest on ties sold in upscale
boutiques.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute has been embarrassing for Jenzabar's team, which
includes many politically connected individuals, including former
Massachusetts Treasurer Joe Malone, the company's director of
development. Legal counsel is provided by former governor William
F. Weld and his law firm, according to a Jenzabar spokesman. The
company's chairman is Chai's fiance, millionaire Robert Maginn, who
lost a race last year to succeed Malone as treasurer.
</P>
<P>
   One thing everyone can agree on is that no one wanted any of
this to become public. ``We're not going to dwell on incidents like
this,'' said Malone, referring to Jenzabar's troubles with the
business school. ``We want to get across the fact that this isn't
an obsession on our part.''
</P>
<P>
   The controversy started in May. The business school received a
call from an information technology manager at SUNY-Buffalo who
said a Jenzabar sales representative had told her flatly that the
company had developed its intranet system at the business school.
</P>
<P>
   When business school officials logged onto Jenzabar's Web site,
they discovered that Jenzabar stated that its ``core application''
was ``developed by the technology leaders who also developed the
award-winning Harvard Business School intranet system.''
</P>
<P>
   That's quite a stretch, business school officials say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a collection of half-truths that ultimately portray
something false and mislead the public,'' a business school source
said. Another business school official described the role of any
Jenzabar team members in the development of the business school
intranet as ``very minor to peripheral.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a written statement, a spokesman for Jenzabar said three
individuals who did substantial work on the $11 million Harvard
Business School intranet also worked on Jenzabar.com's ``core
application.''
</P>
<P>
   One of them, a graphic designer, is currently working full time
at Jenzabar.com, according to Jenzabar. But in an interview, the
graphic designer described his role in the design of the business
school intranet as small.
</P>
<P>
   A Jenzabar spokesman said the company acted promptly to correct
any misimpressions, but business school officials said it was not
until a few weeks ago _ nearly two months after Harvard lawyers
objected _ that the questioned claims were removed from the
company's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site now states that ``Chai's experience as an MBA
student with the Harvard Business School intranet convinced her to
bring this technology to the higher-education community across the
nation and around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Jenzabar has contracts with six schools using Jenzabar
software, according to a Jenzabar spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Suozzi, director of library and information services at St.
Michael's College in Vermont, said Jenzabar representatives gave
her the impression that the key people involved in the Jenzabar
project were on ``the team at the Harvard Business School that
developed that whole (intranet) system.''
</P>
<P>
   Last winter, three Jenzabar representatives, including Malone,
offered a demonstration of their product, according to Suozzi. They
also gave a demonstration of parts of the Harvard Business School
site, Suozzi said.
</P>
<P>
   Told about the dispute between Harvard and Jenzabar, Suozzi
said: ``I'm certainly disappointed they would give the impression
of a connection when there wasn't. That certainly makes us
uncomfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   But other Jenzabar clients said they didn't care whether the
company had any connection with Harvard Business School. All of the
clients interviewed, including Suozzi, said they were pleased with
the product's performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't care whether they dropped from the moon or where they
went to school,'' said Sylvan Lashley, the president of Atlantic
Union College. ``We looked at the materials and what they could do.
We didn't care if it came from Harvard or Yale.''

VOW TO DONATE KIDNEY BROKEN, RETIREE IS OUT $2,500 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TATSHA ROBERTSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EGREMONT, Mass. _ Dr. Anthony Robbins, a retired neurologist and
chairman of the town's Board of Health, propped himself up in his
king-size bed Wednesday and told of a broken promise that nearly
cost him his life.
</P>
<P>
   It began two years ago when Robbins's friend, Police Chief
Michael Balcom, made a life-saving offer: he would donate his own
kidney for Robbins's desperately needed transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Their relationship, though, seemed mutally beneficial. The
chief, who had fallen on hard financial times, got $2,500 from
Robbins, no strings attached.
</P>
<P>
   But Balcom apparently changed his mind about the transplant and
vanished _ after he got the loan. Robbins, who passed up the chance
for an earlier transplant in Utah, then sued to get the money back.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit became an ugly legal battle that has set the usually
sedate town in the southern Berkshires abuzz. Three weeks ago,
Balcom was due in court after a judge ordered him to repay the
money, but he did not show up.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Balcom has filed for bankruptcy, according to court
documents. The move further delayed the case, which Robbins and his
wife, Ellen, desperately want to end.
</P>
<P>
   While Robbins insists he never gave Balcom the money in exchange
for his kidney, as local newspapers have widely reported, Robbins
said he was so angry when his friend reneged that he filed the
lawsuit to get the money back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never asked anything of anybody. He brought up the
subject,'' said Robbins, who recently had his left leg amputated
due to complications from diabetes. Balcom ``made a promise he
could not keep,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Balcom, who abruptly quit his job in 1997, has an unlisted
telephone number and has not talked to reporters. Though he is
believed to live near town, he has apparently not been seen since
he quit.
</P>
<P>
   Balcom reportedly left because he faced gambling debts, but town
officials also wanted him out. According to his severance
arrangement, town officials are barred from discussing his
resignation, according to Mary Brazie, the Selectmen's
administrator.
</P>
<P>
   But one official said that Balcom ``needs to get the hell out of
town, since everybody knows what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Before he came to the Berkshires, Robbins had a medical career
that spanned two decades, mostly in his native New York City. But
in the mid 1970s, he was diagnosed with diabetes and forced to slow
his pace.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins moved to the quiet and solace of Egremont, but still
commuted to New York each day. Finally, Robbins retired in the
mid-1980s and left New York for good.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins and his wife flourished in Egremont, a town of 1,000
whose population doubles during the summer. He gained respect as
the Board of Health chairman and in 1995 met Balcom, the town's
police chief.
</P>
<P>
   ``We became friends. We had a camaraderie,'' Robbins said.
</P>
<P>
   During one conversation, Robbins discovered that he had known
Balcom's mother, a nurse in a New York hospital. The little boy
that Robbins often saw tagging along with her was Balcom, now in
his 40s.
</P>
<P>
   The men had been friends for two years when one day in 1997,
Robbins recalled, the police chief noticed that Robbins looked ill.
The doctor had recently suffered two heart attacks, and his kidneys
were barely functioning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `I need a kidney,' and he said, `I will give you one.'
'' Robbins said. To that point, ``I never asked anyone for (a
kidney) but my children'' and none of them were appropriate donors.
But Balcom was a near perfect match.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Balcom was having financial problems and eventually
asked his friend for help. Robbins gave him $2,500, but wasn't
worried about getting it back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never expected a payment. I didn't pursue it because it was
a friend,'' said Robbins.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Robbins had been in touch with a Utah hospital which
had found a possible match for him. He didn't pursue it, though,
because he believed his friend's word was gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was my friend,'' Robbins said. But as days and
months passed, ``he was nowhere to be found. I got angry as a
hornet'' and decided to sue.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins called the Utah hospital to see if he could still get a
transplant, but doctors there said he had become too sick to risk
the operation. Fortunately, a local hospital was willing to perform
the transplant this spring after a donor kidney was found.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the acrimony and the lawsuit, Robbins insists he holds
no grudge against Balcom.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's really not a bad guy,'' he said. ``I just didn't think
near the end of my life I would have to deal with terrible things
like this.''

THE DEMAGOGUES AGAINST TAX CUTS ARE POISONING THE DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We have gotten so used to the bitter rhetoric of the enemies of
tax relief _ liberals and Democrats, mostly, plus much of the
national media _ that we no longer notice how it poisons the
national discourse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that could explain this love of tax cuts is a
lowered IQ.'' Thus Margaret Carlson of Time magazine, venting on a
television program last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Tax cutters are ``mostly Republican ideologues like Bill Archer
and Dick Armey, whose primary interest is in giving tax breaks to
affluent Americans.'' Thus leftist economist Barry Bluestone in the
current issue of The New Republic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans have created the illusion of paying back their
wealthy supporters and corporate special interests in a bill that
will never become law.'' Thus US Representative Pete Stark in the
House debate last week.
</P>
<P>
   Over and over we hear them _ the insults, the slanders, the
appeals to resentment and envy. It is ugly stuff, political sewer
talk, and we've been listening to it for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be damned if I am going to let a bunch of supply-side
extremists destroy our middle class to pay for tax cuts for the
wealthy,'' declared Richard Gephardt, the House Democratic leader,
in 1996. That was about the time Ted Kennedy was barking, ``Keep
your tax-cutting, greedy hands off our Medicare'' and Nina
Totenberg was telling TV viewers that ``there is another word for
the way they are behaving. They are behaving like whores.''
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible to imagine tax-cut advocates talking this way.
``The only thing that can explain their aversion to tax relief is
mental retardation.'' ``Democrats want taxes to stay high so they
can keep giving money to inner-city welfare leeches.'' Republicans
would be savaged, and deservedly, if they said anything so foul.
Yet the demagoguery of the liberals goes unrebuked.
</P>
<P>
   The argument for tax relief is simple: Taxes should be cut
because taxes are too high. Only once before has the federal
government confiscated so great a proportion of the nation's
economic output. That was in 1944-45, when the United States was
fighting a two-front world war. Today we are not at war. Nor are we
in a recession, or struggling with some natural catastrophe, or
burdened with high unemployment. Yet Washington takes nearly 21
cents of every dollar of new wealth Americans create. When state
and local taxes are added in, the typical family spends close to 40
percent of its income on taxes. That is more than it spends on
food, clothing, shelter, and transportation _ combined.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, what a ``typical'' family spends in taxes can be a
misleading statistic. The overwhelming share of income taxes
collected in this country comes from the well-to-do. The top
federal tax bracket is 39.6 percent, more than 2 1/2 times the rate
for lower-income taxpayers. Millions of working Americans near the
bottom of the income ladder pay no income tax at all thanks to the
earned-income tax credit.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom 60 percent of all taxpayers account for just 6
percent of the income taxes collected. By contrast, the top 8
percent of all taxpayers _ anyone earning more than $100,000 _ pay
62 percent of the total. This is known as soaking the rich. And it
explains why any honest tax cut is going to return more dollars to
the well-off than to the poor.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton ran for office promising a ``middle-class tax
cut.'' Like so much of what he says, that promise was a lie. What
he (and congressional Democrats) delivered in 1993 was not a tax
cut but a punitive tax increase _ necessitated, he said, by the
federal budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Now that deficit is gone and the federal government is awash in
surplus cash. No longer is there an excuse for taxes to be jacked
up so high. It has been 18 years since Congress last enacted
serious tax relief. What possible objection can there be to doing
so now?
</P>
<P>
   Well, says Clinton, a tax cut like the one the Republicans
propose _ a little under $800 billion, phased in over 10 years _
``would require dramatic cuts in vital areas, such as education,
the environment, biomedical research, defense, and crime
fighting.'' But this, too, is a lie. The GOP tax cuts would have no
effect on spending; their impact would simply be to reduce the $1
trillion surplus in income tax revenues that Washington now
anticipates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last week, in the House of Representatives, they passed an
irresponsible tax bill that would spend our surplus,'' Clinton said
on Tuesday. Hear that? ``Our surplus.'' That is how the liberal
mind works: The money belongs to the government, even if the
government doesn't need it.
</P>
<P>
   And the government doesn't need it, as Clinton himself admitted
on one of the rare occasions when he actually told the truth.
Speaking of the 1993 tax hike, he told a Houston audience in 1995:
``You think I raised your taxes too much. Well, it might surprise
you to know I think I raised them too much, too.'' (A few days
later Clinton retracted his statement; his unaccustomed lapse into
the truth was caused, he said, by ignoring his mother's advice to
``never give a talk after 7 o'clock at night.'')
</P>
<P>
   The tax debate boils down to a straightforward question: Should
you be allowed to keep a little more of your own income?
Republicans vote yes; they trust you to spend the extra dollars
sensibly. Democrats, with some honorable exceptions, vote no; they
think you are too stupid to be trusted. But the Democrats can't say
what they really think. So they resort to insults instead.

THANK YOU FOR READING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I started writing columns for The Boston Globe in the summer of
1993. Back then, they were published every other Saturday. I always
imagined that at some point the Globe would reclaim the space and
send me on my way. But they never did, and in the summer of 1995
editorial page editor David Greenway asked me to increase my output
to once a week.
</P>
<P>
   By the fall of 1996, I was actually writing two columns a week,
one for foxnews.com on media and technology and the other for the
Saturday Globe. In June 1997, Greenway asked me to come on
full-time as a staff columnist, and I happily accepted his offer. I
now happily resign.
</P>
<P>
   I say ``happily'' because the Globe has been, as the ``Saturday
Night Live'' baseball player used to say, ``very, very good to
me.'' Greenway and op-ed page editor Marjorie Pritchard never never
changed the substance of my copy, and never told me I couldn't
write about certain subjects. Once, they even let me criticize The
New York Times, which at the time had just purchased The Boston
Globe. Throughout my time writing for the paper, they gave me the
closest thing I've ever known to complete editorial freedom.
</P>
<P>
   That freedom enabled me to write about a range of subjects that
I might not have written about otherwise. And that, in turn, led to
a series of job offers which were simply too good to pass up. In
September, I will begin anew as an Internet consultant (or
principal, depending on the outcome of negotiations), as a
columnist for Fast Company magazine and (for a week) as the Ryder
Cup columnist for Thestreet.com. Greenway has also asked me to
continue to contribute to the Globe's op-ed page, which I intend to
do as often as time allows.
</P>
<P>
   There are other reasons I am leaving the Globe, of course. First
among these is that my standing as a political columnist has been
undercut by the fact of George W. Bush's presidential candidacy.
Bush is my first cousin and a friend. Writing columns about his
candidacy was, for me, like playing three-dimensional chess. I
finally gave up trying, and in so doing, realized that a political
columnist who didn't write about politics should probably, as they
say, get a life.
</P>
<P>
   Our life has changed as well. When I started writing for the
Globe, I lived in the Boston area. Because of my wife's work, we
moved to New York late last year and have now bought a home in
Westchester County near the Hudson River. Part of being a good
columnist is being part of the community the paper serves. We have
no intention of moving back to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   And there comes a time in life when you want to know if you're
right. I have a lot of ideas about the impact of Internet
technologies on commerce, some of which I have written about in
these pages. I'd really like to know if these ideas work; if they
are as applicable in the real world as I think they might be.
There's only one way to find that out. You just have to go do it.
</P>
<P>
   Writing a twice-weekly column for a major metropolitan newspaper
is a great privilege and a lot of fun. It gives you access to
people who would be otherwise hard to reach. But there's a
trade-off, which is that it doesn't pay particularly well,
particularly by New York standards. Money matters when there are
children to be educated and retirement on the horizon. I've got two
children and am older than I think I am. Denying these realities is
no longer an option.
</P>
<P>
   There are many people to thank for making possible my time at
the Globe and I will thank most of them privately. But there are
two I would like to thank publicly. First, I am especially grateful
to Ben Taylor, who published my work even though I suspect that he
probably disagreed with much of it. Had the roles been reversed, I
can't imagine I'd ever have been as tolerant or as supportive.
</P>
<P>
   And I am also especially grateful to you, the reader of this
space. The only demographic that matters in modern life is the fact
that no one has any time. There are always a hundred other things
to do. The fact that you read this column and in some cases took
the time to write or e-mail me was, for me, the highest compliment.
</P>
<P>
   The great satisfaction of writing comes from connecting with
your reader, if only for a while. The connection now breaks, but my
gratitude remains. I thank you for your time and attention.
</P>

SUMMERTIME AND THE GARDENING IS . . . FUNNY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE HATCH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The other seasons are busy, serious, but summer _ especially
high summer _ is a time to lie back. It is light comedy, it is
mysteries, it is a special entity with its own sounds, sights, and
feelings.
</P>
<P>
   Comedy.
</P>
<P>
   I think it's time for some plant division, says I.
</P>
<P>
   Long or short division, says she. Ba-da-bing.
</P>
<P>
   In a small gravelly bed, Oriental lilies and lavender thrive,
appreciating the good drainage and enduring the somewhat hellish
conditions. Something is needed to skirt the lilies (red `Star
Gazer' and white `Casa Blanca'), though, for the picture is barren.
Small, yellow day lilies are just the thing, with cascading,
grasslike foliage, and I already have mature clumps out front.
Despite the heat, I will divide them. First, I dig the holes where
the divisions will go, for I don't want the roots to dry out
waiting while I dig. I lever the clumps up and out, slice them into
sections with leaf fans and roots, and plant them. Then I water
like crazy.
</P>
<P>
   This is such a success that I move on to a line of heuchera
`Raspberry Red.' There's a gap, and I take the farthest one back
and whack it in twain to provide a replacement. This works
reasonably well. The new heuchera seems to respond to the watering,
but the remainder of the original is flagging, its leaves browning;
mulch may help.
</P>
<P>
   The sunflowers come next. They need thinning, and rather than
waste the thinnings, I pop them out using a thin trowel and replant
them. I water mightily, but within 30 minutes they have wilted.
Some plants resent being transplanted, and sunflowers are among
them. Frequent watering helps, though, and I think they may
recover. I've had mixed success in similar moves of cosmos
seedlings. They just collapse in pathetic, wilted heaps. Some
recover and grow, some don't.
</P>
<P>
   Dividing and planting in high summer is not recommended, and for
good reasons. The recommendation can be ignored, but not the
reasons: Plants transpire in heat, the moisture comes from the
roots, and those roots are decimated when moved. So, frequent
watering is needed, and it can help to prune some of the plant tops
to reduce the amount of moisture lost through the leaves. Plants
also are stressed because they are faced with having to generate
new roots at a time when they otherwise have shut down. Day lilies
and heucheras are tough guys, though.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And that brings us to mysteries.
</P>
<P>
   What is eating my roses? Oh, the usual suspects are present,
Japanese beetles and earwigs, but there's another, a tan and
mottled gray beast about the size of a Japanese beetle, though much
easier to hand-squoosh. I've noticed them before, but never in such
numbers as this summer.
</P>
<P>
   I do research on the Web (some good sites are
plants.okstate.edu/plantdoctor and
http://everest.ento.vt.edu/Facilities/OnCampus/IDInfo.html) and
think it might be the Asiatic garden beetle. I call the master
gardeners at the Massachusetts Horticultural Society (781-235-2116,
10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays). The nice woman
who answers isn't sure what my beastie is but thinks I might have
an infestation of thrips, too, based on many rose flower buds
failing to open. Great.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, I sleuth it out. I call Deborah Swanson at the Plymouth
County Extension. It isn't the Asiatic garden beetle, it's the
Oriental beetle, she says, which often associates with Japanese
beetles. She advises hand-picking, which is what she does, though
``I live with a lot of damage.''
</P>
<P>
   I don't want to inadvertently kill snakes, toads and birds with
pesticides, either, so I will continue squooshing. And I'll take a
new look at earwigs. Swanson suspects they do a lot more damage
than is generally supposed.
</P>
<P>
   Further research reveals that the Oriental beetle is closely
related to the Japanese beetle and the Asiatic garden beetle, and
they have similar life cycles, with their grubs being particularly
destructive to lawns. The beetles emerge from the soil in July and
August. Endemic in the Northeast, they are thought to have arrived
from Japan in 1920.

   High summer is a semimystical time, when heat saps the body,
leaving the mind to wander, memories tapped by sweat and dust and
idle musings on cloud formations. The drones of the cicadas are
exactly as they were last summer, and the summer before, and the
summer of 1955 in a berry patch outside Halifax, Nova Scotia.
</P>
<P>
   The gardener is reduced to early morning chores, before the sun
presses flat the will to work. We notice yews that need pruning,
diseased branches in a cherry that should come out, weeds. We
notice a big hairy grin among the cannas _ Lucy the Newfoundland
dog is lazing in the garden! Out, out! She rises and ambles off,
her eyes sparkling with mischief (perhaps we anthropomorphize), and
we see that she somehow managed to lie among the plants without
damaging a single one. Ba-da-bing.
</P>
<P>
   These are the dog days, and it's a laugh a minute.

STAYNER STATEMENT CALLED DUBIOUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL DOUGAN and ELIZABETH FERNANDEZ  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, Calif. _ Somewhere in the drama-infused
life of Cary Stayner, seeds of violence were planted. But while
research into the minds of multiple murderers has identified common
causes, the template doesn't fit neatly over Stayner's story.
</P>
<P>
   Stayner, 37, has reportedly confessed to the killings of three
tourists he held captive in Yosemite National Park and a naturalist
who worked there.
</P>
<P>
   In an off-camera interview with a TV reporter, Stayner said he
had been entertaining visions of slaying women for three decades _
meaning, if true, that his frightening fantasies began when he was
7.
</P>
<P>
   What may have been the defining event in Stayner's life _ the
1972 kidnapping of his younger brother, Steven, by a pedophile and
Steven's surprise return to the family fold seven years later _
came too late to explain his deadly deeds, the reporter said
Stayner told him. Three years before the kidnapping, by his own
time line, images of mayhem began to flicker on his mental screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not typical (in serial killers), and I'm not sure I
believe it, either,'' said P. Terry Macdonald, a San Jose State
sociologist who studies the minds of multiple murderers. ``It's
very rare for a 7- year-old kid to fantasize about killing women.''
</P>
<P>
   In many cases serial killers begin their criminal careers
following the failure of a key relationship, Macdonald said. ``I
suspect he has had some failed relationships that turned out pretty
bad, and I doubt if he started having them at 7,'' Macdonald said.
</P>
<P>
   Macdonald said the infamous Ted Bundy had started his killing
spree in response to a girlfriend's rejection. Most of his victims
resembled that woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would go back and look at (Stayner's) ex-girlfriends
immediately, if he had any ex-girlfriends,'' Macdonald said.
</P>
<P>
   Stayner had no recent romantic entanglements, according to his
neighbors in El Portal, just outside Yosemite. Stayner lived and
sometimes worked at the Cedar Lodge, where three of his alleged
victims were staying when they were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Ludwig, 16, said Stayner had described a ``dry spell'' in
the dating department. ``He hadn't had sex in about six months,''
said Ludwig, who works in the town's only gas station.
</P>
<P>
   Stayner reportedly also enjoyed talking to teenage girls in the
community.
</P>
<P>
   Two of his alleged victims were adolescents: Juli Sund, 15, and
Silvina Pelosso, 16. Stayner has reportedly admitted murdering
both, as well as Juli's mother, Carole Sund, in mid-February.
</P>
<P>
   His last alleged victim _ park naturalist Joie Ruth Armstrong,
who was found dead on July 22 _ was 26.
</P>
<P>
   While some serial killers report abusive childhoods, other
deficits in their home environment can lead to violence later in
life, according to several experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes what you find instead is abandonment,'' said Mike
Rustigan, an San Francisco State University criminologist.
``Sometimes you find a lack of any bonding between child and
parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Stayner's parents _ Delbert and Kay Stayner, who live near
Merced about 50 miles west of the Yosemite National Park _ are
thought to have been attentive and devoted to their children. But
Kay Stayner has been described as aloof.
</P>
<P>
   ``Del was much more emotionally and affectionately involved with
the kids than Kay was,'' said Mike Echols, who wrote a book about
the Steven Stayner kidnapping case called ``I Know My Name Is
Steven.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Kay, in a perfunctory sense, was very concerned about their
being fed and clothed, but she was not touchy-feely. She was not
physically affectionate,'' Echols said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Cary and Steven Stayner were not physically abused by
their parents, Echols said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kay pushed Del into physically punishing the kids, but that
was relatively rare, and Del did everything he could to avoid it,''
Echols said. ``He just absolutely hated that.''
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Miller, who wrote the screenplay for a TV miniseries based
on Echols' book, told Hollywood columnist Army Archerd that after
spending ``quite a bit of time with the whole Stayner family,'' he
``found no affection between the parents and children.''
</P>
<P>
   The known central trauma in Cary Stayner's life was the
abduction and return of his younger brother.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Stayner escaped from his captor, Kenneth Parnell, in
1980. His return home was marked by much media hoopla, and Cary
Stayner was pushed into the background as his parents attempted to
reassimilate his younger brother into the family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steven got all the attention,'' said Anna Jones, Delbert
Stayner's sister, in an interview with the Sacramento Bee.
``Whatever Steven wanted, Steven got.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the TV reporter who interviewed Cary Stayner in
jail Monday, Stayner said his first homicides came in February of
this year.
</P>
<P>
   That Stayner may have begun committing murder at mid-life fits
the pattern of other serial killers, Macdonald said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average age is 35,'' Macdonald said.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Almost all serial murderers have low-paying jobs
that don't seem to be going anywhere. Thirty-five seems to be about
the age that they crack and can't handle the strain of knowing what
their lives are going to be like. Plus, they're afraid that maybe
they're losing their sexual attractiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   Rustigan said the organized manner in which Stayner allegedly
pulled off the Sund-Pelosso murders indicates he might have killed
before. ``There could be more victims,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Though Stayner has denied in news accounts that he sexually
molested his victims, Dr. Reid Meloy, a San Diego forensic
psychologist and author of ``The Psychopathic Mind,'' said the
ferociously violent murders fit the rare homicidal category known
as serial sexual killings.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hunch is there's a high probability these were sexual
homicides: Women were targeted who were unknown to the
perpetrator,'' Meloy said.

CARTOONS ARE WHAT'S UP AT THE BOWL, DOC

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ George Daugherty is not ashamed to admit he still
enjoys watching cartoons. But better still, he enjoys the
soundtracks so much that he created a musical program that combines
the best of both worlds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bugs Bunny on Broadway IV'' comes to the Hollywood Bowl at
7:30 p.m. Aug. 8. For a few hours, the audience will enjoy a
collection of cartoons featuring that wascaly wabbit and his pals
cavorting on a huge screen and accompanied by the Hollywood Bowl
Orchestra conducted by Daugherty. ``The audience sees a 50-foot
screen hanging over the orchestra,'' Daugherty says. ``And the
orchestra plays the music live, completely synchronized with the
cartoons.''
</P>
<P>
   The program is so popular that many audience members are repeat
customers. ``People wear rabbit ears and carrot corsages and shout
out dialogue along with the characters because they've seen them so
many times,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   And last year, approximately 150 fans bought a box at the Bowl
and came dressed in hats similar to what Bugs Bunny wears in the
cartoon ``What's Opera, Doc?'' ``It was still light,'' Daugherty
recalls, ``and I looked into the audience and saw 150 gold helmets
with horns. For the rest of the night they got everyone doing the
wave.''
</P>
<P>
   Daugherty is a classically trained pianist who also has dabbled
in producing, directing and writing, as well as conducting American
and international symphonies.
</P>
<P>
   He grew up with a fondness for the cartoons created by Chuck
Jones and Friz Freleng not only because they entertained him but
because of the snippets of classical music that he heard with them.
``We've all grown up with these wonderful cartoons. I was drawn to
these cartoons through the music when I was a kid,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Daugherty believes he has found the best possible union for
introducing kids _ and even their parents _ to classical music. He
says his goal has always been ``to bring children, families and
adults in to experience classical music.''
</P>
<P>
   However, what he feels is most important is introducing
classical music in small doses. ``Thirty-six hours of Wagner is
condensed to seven minutes, which is about what most people can
tolerate of Wagner,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Simple takes on popular operas _ such as the ``Rabbit of
Seville'' based on the Barber of Seville _ delight audiences
without overwhelming them.
</P>
<P>
   Ticket prices range from $3 to $75, half price for children
under 12. To purchase tickets, call Ticketmaster at (213) 480-3232
or visit the Hollywood Bowl box office.

ZIGGY MARLEY &AMP; THE MELODY MAKERS/``SPIRIT OF MUSIC'' (Elektra)
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the past decade, Marley and his siblings have remained true
to reggae's positive vibe. With their Don Was-produced new album,
the Grammy-winning Melody Makers _ augmented by such top players as
Jim Keltner, Benmont Tench and Mark Isham _ embrace an acoustic
approach while keeping the sound rootsy. Along with warm originals
like the bluesy, harp-tinged opener, ``Keep My Faith,'' Marley
retools a couple of his dad's classic tunes (``High Tide or Low
Tide'' and ``All Day All Night'') for a nice slice of well-arranged
contemporary reggae. 3 stars

   DAVE BRUBECK/``THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY TOUR OF THE U.K.'' (Telarc)
</P>
<P>
   Last November, jazz legend Brubeck traveled to Britain with the
idea of re-creating the first tour he made in 1958. This enjoyable
disc chronicles those dates, which are filled with enthusiastic
music and audience appreciation. The program eschews nostalgia,
mixing older songs (``Someday My Prince Will Come,'' ``I Got
Rhythm'') with newer Brubeck compositions (``The Time of Our
Madness,'' ``The Salmon Strikes''). The constant is the striking,
fiery musicianship from the 78-year-old Brubeck and his longtime
alto sax partner Bobby Militello. It would be no surprise to see
Brubeck crossing the Atlantic for a golden anniversary celebration.

<P>
   A fabulously retro stylist straight out of the Billie/Ella/Sarah
school, even down to the mezzotinted album photos, and we're the
better for its delightful attention to eternal musical verities.
Butler is daughter of Louisiana sax man Scott Butler, and her deep
musical roots show everywhere, from the classic tune selection to a
tastefully grooving backing band. You can quickly tell why St.
Louis-based MaxJazz used this album to kick off a new series of
jazz crooners. I played this album cold with an aficionado friend,
and it knocked us both out. It'll do the same to you. Highly
recommended. 3 1/2 stars

</P>
<P>
   That griping you hear in the background of Krauss' achingly
beautiful new release is the inevitable critical carping that the
darling of bluegrass revivalism has gone glossy and commercial.
True enough, this lustrously arranged and performed disc owes its
slightly gauzy pop professionalism to classy tunesmiths like Todd
Rundgren, Danny O'Keefe and Michael McDonald (who's credited or
co-credited on three tracks).
</P>
<P>
   But Krauss' faithful Union Station band, augmented with harmony
vocals by the indispensable Cox family, plays with as much keenly
felt spirituality as ever. And Krauss' crystalline yet lived-in
voice shows new layers of emotional grit and maturity. Listen, for
instance, to the way she exhales the phrase ``whisper of smoke'' on
her goose bump-inducing cover of Hugh Prestwood's country hit
``Ghost in This House.'' Is Krauss getting soft? Forget about it. 3

   Unlike other ``tiki bands,'' the Hawaiians surf beyond happy
hour, aiming for a dark, spooky mood while avoiding the corny
novelty numbers so beloved by competing outfits. The genre-blending
``Savage Night'' _ the title is borrowed from a gritty crime novel
by Jim Thompson _ is a seductive trip to the noir side of town
where a Hawaiian steel guitar and a Hammond B-3 organ can become
all-night drinking buddies. Vocal and instrumental originals here
include ``Trouble Bay'' and ``Flesh &AMP; Soul'' next to imaginative
covers of Henry Mancini's ``Experiment in Terror'' and Tom Waits'
``Jockey Full of Bourbon.'' 3 stars

   This Texan female r&AMP;b quartet come back swinging with a tight,
modern-sounding sophomore set that seems destined to do better
business than last year's self-titled debut, which spawned just one

Child has taken control of their sound. Memorable uptempo tunes
like ``So Good,'' ``Bugaboo'' and the Missy Elliott-penned
``Confusing'' suggest it's too soon to count these gals out just

immortal three-chord ``Blitzkrieg Bop'' to the irresistably inane
``Pet Sematary,'' demonstrating how the now-defunct Ramones
brilliantly cut rock 'n' roll down to its barest essentials.
</P>
<P>
   Despite being the first, the wittiest and most purely
pop-inspired punk group, the Ramones never scored a Top 40 album or
single. Three years ago, after a farewell show in Hollywood, the
``brothers'' went their separate ways. This anthology does a good
job compiling most of the greatest tracks along with rarities and
alternate mixes. But where's ``We Want the Airwaves''? {

BERKELEY OWNER OFFERS TO REOPEN RADIO STATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JULIE CHAO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERKELEY, Calif. _ In what appeared to be an abrupt turnaround,
the Pacifica Foundation announced it would reopen KPFA and remove
itself from management of the beleaguered Berkeley radio station
for six to 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   The statement came as the crisis at KPFA seemed to be deepening
_ mediation appeared on the verge of collapse, bigger protests were
planned and board members substantiated rumors that Pacifica was
discussing selling off the left-leaning station.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reopening the station is a goodwill gesture on the part of
Pacifica toward resolving the conflict and moving toward
diversification on local terms,'' Pacifica chairwoman Mary Frances
Berry said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
   The 50-year-old listener-sponsored station has been at the
center of a bitter struggle over the direction and control of its
future.
</P>
<P>
   Pacifica closed the station two weeks ago and began airing tapes
of old programs after a reporter was heard on the air arguing with
armed security guards under orders from management to remove him
from the station for reporting about the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   KPFA union representative William Harvey, said Berry called him
Wednesday afternoon to lay out the offer. She said a written
proposal would be presented Thursday morning through federal
mediators, who have been involved with negotiations between staff
and management since last week.
</P>
<P>
   Aileen Alfandary, co-news director, was elated yet hesitant
about the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is an amazing turnaround,'' she said. ``However,
I would caution, I am still extremely skeptical. Pacifica has not
negotiated in good faith from day one of this crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Harvey, Berry offered to reopen the station Friday
at 9 a.m., remove all security guards and welcome back all staff
except Nicole Sawaya, the well-liked station manager let go on
March 31, and Larry Bensky, the veteran broadcaster fired a few
weeks later for criticizing on the air Pacifica's refusal to renew
Sawaya's contract.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bensky and Sawaya are involved in legal discussions with
Pacifica regarding their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Pacifica said Bensky violated a long-standing policy forbidding
on- air discussion of internal personnel matters. KPFA supporters
called it a ``gag rule.'' Harvey said Berry's proposal included
suspending the gag rule.
</P>
<P>
   Berry's statement also said the Pacifica national offices, now
located in Berkeley next to the KPFA station, would move to
Washington, D.C., where Berry, chairman of the U.S. Civil Rights
Commission and a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania,
is based.
</P>
<P>
   While Pacifica, which also oversees stations in Los Angeles,
Houston, New York and Washington, is removed from management of
KPFA for the proposed six to 12 months, it will monitor KPFA's
audience ratings and diversity of its programs and listeners, two
areas which Berry has said she wanted to see improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Mediation through the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service
will continue, Berry's statement said, ``until a more permanent
resolution is met.''
</P>
<P>
   J. Imani, who is a member of the KPFA steering committee
involved in the mediation, said that he was hesitant to continue
negotiating with Pacifica because it had not shown good faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way to mediate with somebody who has no
integrity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey said he was satisfied with Berry's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we have some skepticism borne of the difficulty that's
happened throughout this whole thing, it meets most of the items on
the union short-list,'' he said.

over health care spilling into the open today, Speaker Hastert said
he only had a long shot of bringing the health care bill to the

the opposition denounced the House leadership. One House member
accused the leadership of ``going back to the old days of stacking
the deck against anything that doesn't fit the special interests,
the insurers and the HMOS.'' Some Republicans have even crossed

costs came at a time when the economy slowed abruptly as consumers

2.3 percent in the second quarter, slower than the first quarter's
4.3 percent annual pace and much slower than what economists had
expected. By Sylvia Nasar.

DIRECTOR CHOOSES MAN-EATER OVER MAGNUM POWER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``Oh the shark has razor teeth, dear.''
</P>
<P>
   The opening line from ``Mack the Knife'' must have gone through
director Renny Harlin's mind a few times while he was making ``Deep
Blue Sea.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, with a project like this, there were lot of ways to
end up as many of the characters in ``Deep'' _ shark munchies.
</P>
<P>
   Since ``Jaws'' _ the 1975 film that put Steven Spielberg on the
cinematic map _ shark movies have tanked, including the three
``Jaws'' sequels. And water movies such as ``The Abyss'' and
``Waterworld'' are notorious for production problems _ as was
``Titanic,'' although that was the exception to the rule that
proved worth the soggy effort.
</P>
<P>
   So why risk the perils of the ``Deep''?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd been looking for a scary movie to do for years,'' said
Harlin, 40, whose 1990 signature hit, ``Die Hard 2,'' hauled in
$117.5 million on a $70 million budget. ``Nobody was making the
big-scale horror movies like `Jaws' or `The Exorcist' anymore. When
I got this script, I said, `What? I'm going to kill myself trying
to do `Jaws' again?' But I read it and felt it really worked on its
own as something different from `Jaws.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And rather than do another movie where people were shooting at
each other and having fistfights, I wanted to do something visually
exciting that's kind of a roller-coaster ride that explores
horror.''
</P>
<P>
   To achieve those thrills, Harlin's film depended on animatronic,
computer-generated and real-life sharks.
</P>
<P>
   Shot in Baja Mexico at the state-of-the-art studio that was
built for James Cameron's ``Titanic'' production, ``Deep Blue Sea''
is the story of a scientist (Saffron Burrows), on a floating
laboratory called Aquatica, searching for a way to regenerate human
brain tissue in order to cure Alzheimer's disease. Convinced that
the magic serum is in the brains of sharks, she genetically
re-engineers aggressive mako sharks, growing three of them to 40
feet (that's 10 feet longer than the shark in ``Jaws'') and
increasing their brains to five times normal size.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, ignoring the don't-fool-with-mother-nature
axiom leads to disaster as the MENSA maneaters begin to do some
methodical re-engineering of their own.
</P>
<P>
   All this may sound wild, but at a recent screening in Hollywood,
the crowd was clearly enjoying the ride. The $80 million Warner
Bros. release also stars Samuel L. Jackson, Thomas Jane and LL Cool
J, whose cool comic touch made him an audience favorite.
</P>
<P>
   But the real stars of ``Deep'' are the authentic-looking sharks.
While not as famous as the much bigger great white (star of
``Jaws''), the mako shark, which can grow to 12 feet, is a highly
prized sport fish known for its speed and maneuverability in the
water, clocking in at 60 miles per hour. They're also aggressive
and have a preference for consuming live prey.
</P>
<P>
   To suggest realistic, lightning-fast makos _ and not kill their
human cast in the process _ the producers of ``Deep Blue Sea'' had
to seamlessly mix high-tech engineering with primordial nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all depended on how lifelike we could get,'' Harlin
explained. ``We decided to go with three types of sharks _ real
ones, hydraulic models and computer-designed.''
</P>
<P>
   A decision was also made to use as much footage of animatronic
or hydraulic model sharks as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We figured we'd supplement that with the digital sharks,''
explained shark action supervisor Walt Conti, whose credits include
``Free Willy'' and its two sequels. ``We were brought in early to
design the look of the mako sharks. People are so used to great
whites. These are makos, the fastest shark in the world. The idea
was to keep it as closely based on reality as possible, but tweaked
a bit. We enlarged the teeth and the cranial area, but basically,
reality was as scary as fiction as far as the design of the
shark.''
</P>
<P>
   As Harlin points out, one of secrets of the success of ``Jaws''
was that the gigantic shark _ called Bruce on the set _ was mostly
suggested rather than fully revealed, because the technology of the
time wouldn't support such a creature.
</P>
<P>
   ``They turned a disadvantage into an advantage,'' he said. ``But
it's 25 years later, and audiences accustomed to animatronics and
computer-generated imagery need to see more.''
</P>
<P>
   The most difficult part of capturing the mako on film was
getting its energy, Conti said, adding: ``They're always cruising
kind of slowly, then they snap and just go with this incredible
burst of energy.''
</P>
<P>
   That's where live shark wrangler Stuart Cove came in. Cove
hosted Harlin's crew in the Bahamas, where footage was shot of
actor Jane swimming with sharks. That's where a grip was bitten.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shark bit his hand but released it right away,'' Cove
said. ``Oh, he needed a bunch of stitches.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Jane, who plays shark expert Carter Blake at the research
facility, he swam through a shark ``feeding frenzy'' for the
camera, Cove said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was amazing,'' Cove said. ``My stunt people don't even like
to do that. We were very impressed.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Harlin _ whose other successes include ``Nightmare
on Elm Street 4'' and ``Cliffhanger,'' but who also helmed the
seagoing disaster ``Cutthroat Island'' _ realizes the summer
release schedule is crowded but hopes word gets around that ``Deep
Blue Sea'' is an enjoyable ``popcorn'' movie for the masses.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a movie where people can have fun in the theater,''
the Finnish director said. ``It's not like they have to analyze the
subtext of the scenes. I'm also thinking of the international
market when I make a film. I want a person in Asia or Europe as
well as the U.S. to be able to have a good time.''
</P>
<P>
   Harlin hinted he'd like to tackle stock car racing next.
</P>
<P>
   ``There hasn't been a good racing movie in this age of digital
technology in sound and picture,'' he said. ``We could make a movie
that could blow the audience away again without having people
shooting guns or anything like that. That's something I'd really
like to do.'' &QL;

 (Repeating for all needing)  
 BOSTON: ... crack babies.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many of the studies are centered around laboratory animals.
Researchers inject or feed cocaine to pregnant mice, rats, or
rabbits, then study the size of the offspring's cranium, or test
how the offspring respond to noise and light.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Kosofsky, a researcher, studies cocaine-exposed mice at
the University of Massachusetts' Charlestown lab. The mice are
placed in a two-room maze where they are exposed to smells and
shocks. Normal mice run to the safe room; cocaine-exposed mice get
confused.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're unable to block out extraneous, redundant
information,'' Kosofsky said. Also, the brains of cocaine-exposed
mice are as much as 12 percent smaller in volume.
</P>
<P>
   While Kosofsky knows crack-exposed babies are better off
developmentally than people once thought, he said many children
need to be taught how to handle stress and how to process
information. They need people to be patient with them, to figure
out ways to help them learn.
</P>
<P>
   Maleeka, because of her struggles with math, has a teacher who
taught her to draw circles on paper to visualize math problems.
</P>
<P>
   Her parents, Barbara and Gary Webb, never give her a list of
things to do. ``If I tell her to go upstairs, brush her teeth then
bring me something, she'll say `That's too much!' '' Barbara Webb
said. ``I give direction in small chunks. If you know to do that,
it's not a big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Maleeka has done well partly because her parents make sure she
is getting the help she needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first day they brought her to us, she just sat on my lap
and clung to me,'' Barbara Webb said. At 2 1/2, she was not talking
much, wore braces on her legs, and could not walk. But the Webbs
got Maleeka speech and physical therapy and explained to her
teachers her special needs. She has also had tutors.
</P>
<P>
   And her schedule is filled with activities. She plays softball.
She practices gymnastics. She takes swimming lessons. And, at home,
her mother lavishes her with attention. But Maleeka is not spoiled.
When her parents ask her to do something, she might question why _
in her theatrical way _ but in the end she listens.
</P>
<P>
   Like any proud parent, Barbara Webb does not see anything
getting in her child's way: ``I see her going to college if she
wants.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Advocates say not every crack-exposed child needs to be taken
away from their mother to make it. Whenever possible, they say,
both mother and child should be helped.
</P>
<P>
   Kosofsky said the issue has become politicized, with some people
labeling mothers as criminals instead of understanding that they
need treatment so they can care for their children.
</P>
<P>
   Because crack, a synthesized, cheap form of cocaine, is used
more heavily by poor people, and because blacks and Latinos are
disproportionately represented among the poor, most of the women
who smoke crack during pregnancy are black and Latina.
</P>
<P>
   Hortensia Amaro, a psychologist and professor of social and
behavioral sciences at Boston University School of Public Health,
is determined to save the ``crack mothers.''
</P>
<P>
   She founded the MOMs Project in Roxbury and Entre Familia
(Within the Family) in Mattapan for addicted mothers. Most of the
women, she says, abuse drugs partly to escape the trauma of
childhood abuse. The mothers also tend to be high school dropouts,
and many have been homeless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighty percent come in with a history of childhood abuse, a
history of mental illness like depression and anxiety disorders and
post-traumatic stress, from when they were abused,'' Amaro said.
</P>
<P>
   The stigma created early on by the blaring headlines of crack
babies with countless medical disabilities continues when people
see children like Eddie Jussila, 10.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie's mother smoked crack and drank alcohol so often her
placenta never attached to the walls of her uterus, from where
nutrients and oxygen flow.
</P>
<P>
   Moments before Eddie entered the world, his heart stopped.
Doctors revived him in utero, then plucked him from the womb, his
body dripping with placenta laced with crack cocaine. Born with
severe brain damage, Eddie spent most of the first two years of his
life at Massachusetts General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   He only recently developed muscles to hold up his head. The
cornea of his left eye drifts to the corner of the socket. Tiny
teeth jut from his thick gums, the result of never having chewed
food. A machine pumps 2 ounces of formula _ a pureed blend of beef,
peas, and peaches _ into him every hour.
</P>
<P>
   Though Eddie represents the far end of the spectrum, even he is
doing better than doctors had expected. He communicates basic
thoughts _ yes, no, hello _ with a handheld computer. And he can
walk for brief periods with a special walker resembling a tricycle.
</P>
<P>
   His legal guardians, Marianne and Bruce Jussila, have cared for
more than 20 drug-exposed children in 17 years. People look at
Eddie, said the South Harwich couple, and see him as a poster child
for crack babies. That hurts the children who do not show obvious
signs but still need special attention, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Children like Maleeka.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Outside her home the other day, Maleeka ran through the Crazy
Daisy sprinkler, her shoulder-length braids flopping. ``Mom! Mom!
Watch me!'' she screamed, cartwheeling through the spray.
</P>
<P>
   After a few minutes, she ran inside, to show the A's she had
gotten on spelling tests and the smooth flow of her cursive
writing.
</P>
<P>
   Maleeka understands she was born with cocaine in her body,
Barbara Webb said. Sometimes, Maleeka gets angry thinking of her
mother who used drugs that ``hurt her brain.''
</P>
<P>
   Webb said she believes the cocaine is to blame for Maleeka's
struggle with math and analyzing information.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told her, `Maleeka, you're very lucky you can do all the
things you do.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Maleeka agrees. And if anyone asks her, she announces, with
theatrical flair, ``I think I'm 100 percent smart.''

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- With ambulance sirens wailing, Maleeka arrived at
Children's Hospital, a newborn so tiny doctors could hold her
squirmy, 3-pound body cupped in one hand.
</P>
<P>
   The cocaine that had swirled in her bloodstream caused sections
of her intestine to shrivel. At 2 months old, surgeons
reconstructed it, but feared she would die.
</P>
<P>
   She survived, a miracle girl with a label on her head: ``crack
baby.'' It was 1989 when that phrase sent shudders throughout
Boston and the nation. Doctors cringed at the thought of Maleeka's
miserable fate.
</P>
<P>
   Now 9, Maleeka is an outgoing, talkative girl who thrives on
attention, and writes and reads at grade level. A row of A's marks
her report card, except in math, which is a struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``She can be anything she wants in the world,'' said her
adoptive mother, Barbara Webb of Harwich.
</P>
<P>
   More than 12 years since the birth of the first generation of
crack babies, researchers have reached an unexpected and hopeful
conclusion: Crack-exposed babies did not grow up to become the
irreparably damaged children that everyone once feared. While most
of them need some help, you cannot, just by looking at them, tell
them apart from other children.
</P>
<P>
   ``People said these babies were damaged. That they would be
retarded and become wards of society,'' said Barry Lester, a
leading researcher on cocaine-exposed children, based in
Providence. ``Now we know that they do show differences, but the
differences are subtle and can be corrected with treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers say they believe the brains of some of these
children are smaller and less developed, with neurological glitches
that cause misfires in processing information. Most of the children
struggle to stay focused, take longer to understand complex
thoughts and solve math problems, and tend to get excited easily.
The average crack-exposed child has an IQ about 3 points lower than
the average child, studies show. But with special education
programs, researchers say these children can perform as well as
other children.
</P>
<P>
   It was more than a decade ago when TV news began flashing
pictures of scrawny babies with glassy eyes who shook
uncontrollably and did not like being held. Pediatricians, nurses,
and social workers blamed the horrors on a new drug called crack _
a potent, highly addictive form of cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, doctors realized they overlooked another possible
culprit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are classic symptoms of heroin withdrawal,'' said
Lester. ``At the time, people would find out the mother was using
cocaine, and they didn't look for signs of other drugs. They
thought cocaine was doing all the dirty work.''
</P>
<P>
   Most pregnant mothers who smoke crack also smoke cigarettes,
drink alcohol, and often do other drugs. In Maleeka's case, her
mother was so strung out on drugs, she told doctors she did not
know she was pregnant. She gave birth to Maleeka in her Dorchester
apartment, then dialed 911.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the problem for many of the children: poverty,
malnutrition, lack of mental stimulation, neglect, and growing up
in dysfunctional homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's remarkable that these kids do as well as they do
considering all they are facing,'' Lester said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Maleeka is tall for her age, a bright-eyed girl with tremendous
energy, who admits, ``I love to talk.''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent day, she ran around her home, talking to her Furby
doll. Then she walked in front of a visitor, tapped a pair of chop
sticks on the table, and announced, ``Ladies and gentlemen,'' while
raising the sticks in front of an imaginary choir. As she waved the
sticks, her voice boomed: ``La. Lee. La. La.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, with a giggle, Maleeka revealed the scars hidden under her
T-shirt. ``Here are my railroad tracks,'' she exclaimed, pointing
to the incision and staple marks stretching across her abdomen. It
is a reminder of the surgery she had at 2 months old. Another scar
marks her gallbladder removal. Along her lower spine, a fleshy
mound reminds her of the recent removal of a cyst in between her
vertebrae.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctors don't know what caused it,'' said Webb, 42. ``I
find it hard to believe it's not connected to the cocaine.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite physical ailments and minor learning disabilities,
children like Maleeka do so well most people would never suspect
their mothers smoked crack.
</P>
<P>
   Like Fred, 5, who has a sly grin, is outgoing and friendly, but
easily distracted.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you try to get him to play with blocks or do a puzzle, he
doesn't stay engaged. You have to work hard with him,'' Lester
said.
</P>
<P>
   He has trouble controlling his excitement, and gets emotional
easily. But his IQ on various tests is 98, two points shy of
average. And he speaks and understands concepts as well as his
peers.
</P>
<P>
   Fred's mother smoked crack cocaine about four times a week in
the first trimester, but says she stopped because she worried that
continued use would cause harm. If anything, drug and alcohol use
causes the most damage in the first trimester, doctors say, when
the baby's central nervous system and major organs are forming.
</P>
<P>
   But, Lester said, Fred's mother continued to drink and smoke
cigarettes throughout her pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   Lester has known Fred since birth and thinks he will do fine
despite his minor handicaps. Fred's mother has done an about-face
and now reads with him, plays with him, and gives him the kind of
nurturing and stimulation he needs.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite the good news, the effort continues to fully understand
cocaine's effects on the brain. Researchers theorize that the
brains of crack-exposed children are smaller based on studies that
show the diameter of their heads is about a centimeter smaller at
birth than those of children not exposed to crack. But no one has
published a study showing such children's brains are actually
smaller. Also, it is difficult for researchers to prove that crack
limits children's brain functions, basing the belief on the poorer
performance of crack babies.

THE 323I _ UNMISTAKABLY A BMW DESPITE THE $26,400 PRICE TAG

 By BILL GRIFFITH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It looks like a BMW. It handles like a BMW. And it performs like
a BMW. Ergo, it must be a BMW.
</P>
<P>
   But wait, it isn't priced like a BMW _ this vehicle sells for
$26,400 MSRP.
</P>
<P>
   Say hello to the 323i, BMW's entry-level sports sedan.
</P>
<P>
   BMW made its reputation in this category by building drivers'
cars. Over the years, it added the luxury cachet that has earned it
an enviable position in the upscale market.
</P>
<P>
   For BMW, the strategy of offering a designated entry-level car
is clear: Sell a buyer on the 3-series and hope to have him or her
move up to a 5- or 7-series down the road.
</P>
<P>
   My move was a little different. After a week in the new Saab 9-3
Viggen (colleague Royal Ford promises a full road test of that
soon), I jumped into the 323i and experienced culture shock. The
difference in the driving feel from the front-wheel-drive Saab with
its 200-horsepower 2-liter high-output turbocharged four to the
Beemer with its 2.5-liter straight six and rear-wheel drive is
obvious even to this auto-writing novice.
</P>
<P>
   The rear-wheel drive lends a sedate feel, but once you throw it
into a corner, the Beemer sticks like the road tar that always
seems to coat my own car's rocker panels.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this 323i was helped by the presence of bigger tires
(225/50R-16 Dunlop Sport radials) _ part of a $2,400 Sports package
that adds the tires, stiffer suspension, nifty five-spoke wheels,
fog lights, a multifunction leather sports wheel with fingertip
audio, cruise control and telephone controls, and 10-way manually
adjustable seats. (A word on the seats: comfortable.)
</P>
<P>
   This brings us back to our starting point. Yes, it's
unmistakably BMW from its traditional vertically slatted cowl
grille, recognizable roof line, and side ``character lines.'' New
are the free-form headlight treatment and bigger wheel openings
(for those bigger tires), and revamped-but-still-recognizable
rear-deck treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly it handles like a BMW, especially with the
above-mentioned sports suspension. Now here is where the ``but''
comes in. Money had to be saved someplace, and the most obvious is
on interior accoutrements.
</P>
<P>
   If you want the extra goodies, you have to pay. Add the Sports
package ($2,400), metallic paint ($475), Xenon lights package
($500), and single-disc CD player ($200) and you're hovering a few
bucks below the $30,000 mark, $29,975 by my count. That's the level
where our test vehicle checked in.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, I'd have liked to add a power moon roof ($1,050),
onboard computer ($300), heated seats ($500), real leather instead
of the tacky (by BMW standards) leatherette ($1,450), navigation
system ($1,990), and upgraded sound system ($675). Total: $35,940.
You get the picture. And you can call me Lord Plushbottom, because
one does get spoiled by all these toys.
</P>
<P>
   However, you get a lot for your money in the basic car.
</P>
<P>
   Especially when you consider that the 323i is the vanguard of
BMW's redesign program for these 3-series cars. Coming are similar
redesigns of the coupe and convertible. With BMW, buying early in
the series means you might have a long relationship with your car
because designs often last for eight years, and the marque has
proven reliability.
</P>
<P>
   The 323i's 2.5-liter straight six definitely qualifies it as the
little brother to the 2.8-liter six in the 328i. The 2.8 is
slightly more powerful, slightly faster (0-60 in 6.6 as opposed to
7.1 seconds, according to manufacturer's claims _ it just didn't
seem that quick) and a little more expensive ($33,400 base).
</P>
<P>
   But the 2.5-liter is adequate, with sufficient torque at low and
medium engine speeds _ familiar conditions indeed for us
city-dwellers.
</P>
<P>
   The 323i cleanly passed my off-hours commuting road tests.
</P>
<P>
   It effortlessly hit 60 miles per hour coming off an on-ramp to
merge smoothly onto Rte. 93. It also nicely handled Mass. Highway's
surprise lane shift where Rte. 93 north passes the Mass. Pike exit
(if you can't stay in your lane, your car flunks this test).
</P>
<P>
   The BMW also charged straight through Mass. Highway's
across-the-grain bumps stretch that leads into the South Station
Tunnel heading northbound. (Who says you need a hidden test track?)
</P>
<P>
   This was a vehicle that lures you into taking the long way home
or to drive an extra 50 miles for dinner. That tells me BMW has
fulfilled its mission by continuing to provide driving pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   The five-speed manual transmission's gears are nicely spaced,
and the clutch action is so smooth that you can engage first gear
with no pressure on the accelerator pedal. Wind it up through the
gears with the radio off and you catch a pleasingly understated
whine from the drivetrain and exhaust.
</P>
<P>
   The clutch is self-adjusting, a feature BMW promises will
greatly extend clutch life and maintain continuity of performance.
Finding reverse can be a challenge at first _ until you become used
to pushing through the spring-loaded gate.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years ago, only those in the country-club set knew
the term Beemer (it was once excised from a Globe Sports section
story in the '70s because no one on the copy desk recognized it);
now, BMW continues to appeal to the club set by boasting that the
323i's trunk is ``configured for two golf bags transversely; they
don't have to be positioned diagonally.''
</P>
<P>
   If trunk room is good, front-seat space is sensational. A
fair-minded person would say that some of that should be shared
with the rear-seat occupants. There's ``some'' space, but I
wouldn't want to be back there for an all-day trip with two other
normal-sized folks.
</P>
<P>
   I want to be up front at the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Because BMWs are all about driving. From the entry-level on up.

IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE, IT'S A VERY COOL CITY

 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The shadowy gray light through my bedroom window
tells me before I am fully awake that it will be another cold,
dreary summer day in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Just as I mumble, ``Bummer,'' I remember recent conversations
with family and friends back East. Their words drift through my
brain like the soft, cool breezes they all believe have deserted
them forever.
</P>
<P>
   Miserable.
</P>
<P>
   Stinking.
</P>
<P>
   Debilitating.
</P>
<P>
   Disgusting.
</P>
<P>
   Hell.
</P>
<P>
   I turn on National Public Radio and hear that the latest heat
wave torturing the East and Midwest has killed 49 people.
</P>
<P>
   Crops are withering in fields. Pennsylania has an official
drought emergency. Relief workers in Iowa are passing out electric
fans and opening air-conditioned shelters.
</P>
<P>
   In Cincinnati, it has been above 90 degrees for more than a
week. Four people in St. Louis died in one day when the temperature
peaked at 102. Everywhere the demand for power is off the charts.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, the branches of my neighbors' trees whip in
the wind. The sky above them is the color of wallpaper paste.
</P>
<P>
   Near my deck, a jasmine vine _ recently transplanted from a
warm, sunny clime _ looks as if it's passed through some Star Trek
wormhole and ended up in an alien galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   I pull on jeans, a turtleneck, thick cotton socks, hiking boots
and a heavy cardigan sweater. Because I'll be on public transit all
day, including late afternoon when the Pacific fog shoves its way
into town, I grab a big scarf.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1975, shortly before I moved to California, I was living
in New York City. I'd grown up in Indiana and once spent what a
boyfriend labeled an ``oppressive'' summer in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   All I knew about June, July and August were heat and humidity.
</P>
<P>
   But that final East Coast summer was a lulu and moved me to
write in my journal: ``God. Merciful rainstorm. I can't remember
when I've been so conscious of the heat, day in and day out. I
dread it at night, hours before I go to bed, anticipating the soggy
sheets and dozens of awakenings. When I finally admit defeat in the
morning and get out of bed, I mentally sort through my closet and
try to find the coolest thing to hang on my back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life here at the equator. Fitzgerald's reference to a time so
hot one didn't care `whose flushed lips he kissed, whose head made
damp the pajama pocket over his heart.' Maybe it's quite the right
time to be moving to seasonless San Francisco.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, yes, I remember it well: Pantyhose that felt as if they were
literally growing into my legs, like some moist synthetic skin
graft. Rivulets of sweat trickling down my sternum, forking left
and right under each breast, then running headlong into the
rivulets coming down from under my arms.
</P>
<P>
   Hair, always damp and stringy and in my face. Hands sticky,
nails gritty. Fingers and ankles swollen. Every crease, from the
top of my ears to between my toes, a mini-salt water marsh.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the stench from the subway and streets. Any
garbage more than two hours old had the olfactory force of a
decomposing corpse. Dog doo was so potent it was like smelling in
Day-Glo. The anti-perspirants of stockbrokers and even fashion
models were useless; no old lady's talcum powder had a chance.
</P>
<P>
   Shirt lacquered to my back, I'd walk into my Midtown office, a
bank or a bar, and swoon in relief at the meat-locker climate.
</P>
<P>
   Then (especially if it was a bar), I'd forget about the real
world until I walked out and felt as if I were standing under the
afterburners of a Titan rocket.
</P>
<P>
   And it lasted, day after day, for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, strolling toward the 24th Street BART station,
I can't help but notice all the fleece zip-ups, sweatshirts,
leather jackets and tweed sportcoats. Descending the station steps,
I watch three maintenance workers repairing a broken escalator.
They wear windbreakers.
</P>
<P>
   A street musician, dressed in a dark leather jacket, felt hat
and pants, stands outside the BART turnstiles, singing ``(Sittin'
On) the Dock of the Bay.'' A chill wind creeps through my sweater
and blows my hair into my mouth.
</P>
<P>
   I smile.
</P>
<P>
   Another lousy summer day in paradise.

   BUSH-RICHARDS _ Former Gov. Ann Richards, the first Democrat to
lose to him, says the best way to go after George W. Bush is not
to. ``I wouldn't pay any attention to the opponent,'' Richards said
when he asked for her advice on how to run against Bush. As Bush
looks more and more like the inevitable GOP nominee, the Democrats
are scrambling for the most effective way of running against him.
So far, the Gore camp has adopted a relatively low-key, subtle
approach. But the Democratic National Committee, ignoring Richards
advice and perhaps foreshadowing what's to come, is mounting a
full-frontal assault. A look at the Democratic strategy for beating
Bush, an early front-runner in this earliest of election campaigns.

   ISRAEL-DEATHPENALTY _ JERUSALEM _ After two cases in which
fathers killed their children, a few shocked Israelis made a call
for the country to start using the death penalty against murderers.
But, the suggestion was rejected with barely a debate as Israel,
despite a history of terrorist attacks and a rising crime rate,
seems decisively against the form of punishment that is so
prevalent in the United States. Israel has only used the death
penalty once in its 51-year-history. That was to execute senior
Nazi SS leader Adolf Eichmann under a law concerning crimes against
humanity. (Kaplow, Cox News Service).

   NY-SUMMER-DANCE (New York) _ Dance heads for the parks, plazas
and streets of the city and beyond each summer. In a working
vacation of sorts, dancers have a chance to perform for larger,
newer audiences, often on shared programs with artists in other
fields. For audiences, summer festivals can be full of distractions
not found in a formal theater setting. Still, the experience is
also serendipitous and the price is right most of the time, with
admission often free or by small suggested donation. By Jennifer
Dunning.

<P>
   PICKETT-EARLY-MUSIC (New York) _ One might have thought that all
the European period instrument ensembles that have become stars on
recordings over the last couple of decades had already visited New
York, where appetites for early-music recordings are healthy, and
indigenous competition, while formidable, is not overabundant. But
there are pleasures still to be sampled. Philip Pickett, a recorder
player and one of the most imaginative early-music directors
working in Britain, is just now getting around to performing in New
York with the New London Consort, the ensemble he founded in 1976.
The group is to make its United States debut in a Mostly Mozart
concert on Sunday afternoon at Alice Tully Hall. By Allan Kozinn.

   APPLES-PITTSBURGH (Pittsburgh) _ One fine day this summer,
wreckers toppled six towering smokestacks along the Monongahela
River. Once part of a huge coke works but long idle, they were the
last vestiges of Big Steel left within the Pittsburgh city limits.
The mills that once employed tens of thousands of workers and made
a third of the world's steel have vanished like ghosts at dawn.
Iron City, aka Steeltown U.S.A., is no more. But having survived
the truly grueling loss of most of its heavy industry, Pittsburgh
is alive and well and getting better. It has had not one
renaissance but two, and a third is under way, fueled by an intense
local pride and a gritty determination to bounce back. By R.W.

MRS. CLINTON'S SENATE BID MAY HELP WALL STREET BILL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Aug. 1.)  EDS: Filed in ``w'' and ``f'' categories.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee says
First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton's bid for a U.S. Senate seat may
boost prospects for enactment of legislation allowing banks,
securities and insurance firms to merge.
</P>
<P>
   The reason: Wall Street is drooling for the bill. And the New
York financial community is an important constituency that cannot
be ignored by New York politicians. Mrs. Clinton is revved up to
run for the U.S. Senate from New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point is pretty obvious: If you are running in New York
it's hard to be against this bill,'' said Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas,
chairman of the panel.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm recently told a group of industry lobbyists that Mrs.
Clinton's candidacy ``would make it difficult'' for President
Clinton to veto the legislation, as he has threatened to do to the
Senate version of the bill. The White House has signaled approval
of the House version.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm said while ``there are still some tough issues'' to work
through, he believes lawmakers will successfully reconcile the
differences between the two bills _ a process that is expected to
begin this week.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would end Depression-era laws that have barred
banks from selling insurance and have limited their ability to sell
stocks and bonds.
</P>
<P>
   The main difference between the two bills is that the Senate
version would require banks to set up a separate holding company to
conduct insurance and securities businesses while the House bill
would let banks sell insurance and securities through a bank
subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   The difference may seen insignificant, but under the Senate bill
it would mean that the Federal Reserve would become the nation's
main financial services regulator because it oversees bank holding
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Under the House bill, the Treasury Department would maintain its
current role as the supervisor of bank subsidiaries. In fact, banks
could choose whether they want to set up a subsidiary or a separate
holding company, so both the Federal Reserve and the Treasury
Department would continue to have a hand in bank regulation,
depending on how banks decide to organize.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill also would weaken the Community Reinvestment Act
that requires banks to document loans they make in neighborhoods
with large numbers of minorities and low income people _ groups
that have previously been denied access to credit.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm, who said he would like to do away with the Community
Reinvestment Act entirely, included a provision in the Senate bill
that would exempt about 4,000 banks with less than $100 million in
assets from CRA rules. Gramm argues that the CRA paperwork burden
is too tough on smaller banks.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, including Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., are strong
supporters of the CRA and believe it has contributed to a rise in
home ownership rates among minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I very much want a bill,'' Schumer said. ``But I think you can
have one without'' changing the CRA.
</P>
<P>
   If the proposed CRA changes are left out of the final bill, some
lawmakers and lobbyists believe the White House may cave in on
provisions that favor the Federal Reserve over the Treasury
Department as the main regulator of the new financial services
conglomerates that would be created as a result of the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury Department is part of the executive branch while
the Federal Reserve is independent of the White House and Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Most Democrats support President Clinton's position that would
maintain Treasury's financial services regulatory role along with
that of the Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer said he would back the bill regardless of which federal
regulator is chosen.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York wants this bill,'' Schumer said. He said he has not
spoken with Mrs. Clinton about the bank bill.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Guenther, the top lobbyist for the Independent Bankers
Association of America, said Mrs. Clinton's candidacy ``could make
a difference'' in getting the White House to abandon its quest to
protect the Treasury Department's role as a financial services
regulator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wall Street wants this bill in the worst way,'' Guenther said,
noting that the financial services industry in New York would
provide campaign contributions to Mrs. Clinton and anyone else
running for the seat being vacated by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan,
D-N.Y., regardless of party.
</P>
<P>
   Even without Mrs. Clinton's campaign, the prospects for
enactment of the financial services legislation are better than
they have been in the past 20 years. This year's House and Senate
votes mark the first time that both chambers have approved the
measures in the first session of Congress. This will give lawmakers
up to a year and a half to work out the differences between the
bills and get it signed into law.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the House approved the bill in May while the Senate
never took it up. Even if it had, lawmakers and lobbyists say there
wasn't enough time to work out the differences between the bills
before Congress ended its two-year session. Once a session ends all
uncompleted legislation dies and the process of enacting it must
start over in a new session of Congress.

COMPANY SEARCHES THE GLOBE FOR RIGHT NAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATT BEER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ ``Air Sick Bag Inc.''
</P>
<P>
   Much to the surprise of Palo Alto-based Hewlett-Packard Co.
executives, that was one foreign translation of a proposed name for
the company's new spin-off corporation.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard avoided that gaffe by hiring San Francisco-based
Landor Associates, the nation's largest branding consultants, to
help name its new company, which carried the working name
``NewCo.''
</P>
<P>
   The result of the $1 million effort led by Landor was that H-P
has announced that it was naming its $8 billion measurements and
medical technology spin-off Agilent Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Landor, which has been helping companies pick names for the last
60 years, is responsible for such corporate titles as FedEx, the
overnight shippers, and Lucent, the technology research company
formerly known as Bell Laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   According to Agilent Vice President Bill Hahn, the quest to find
a name for the new company began shortly after H-P's March 2
announcement that it was splitting itself in two.
</P>
<P>
   One company, which manufactures computer hardware and software,
would retain the Hewlett-Packard name. The other company, which
would focus on Hewlett- Packard's less-consumer oriented electronic
measuring and medical equipment, needed a new name.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to start off fresh,'' said Hahn, a former H-P
controller. ``So picking the right name was crucial for us.''
</P>
<P>
   An internal Hewlett-Packard contest, along with input from
Landor, generated a list of 2,000 candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Then the list was put through a complex winnowing process.
</P>
<P>
   Names that incorporated the the Hewlett-Packard brand were
eliminated. Next, many candidates were dropped because they could
be found in the dictionary.
</P>
<P>
   ``There really isn't any regular word out there that doesn't
have a claim on it already,'' said Peter Harleman, a vice chairman
with Landor. ``The English language is pretty much impossible to
use now.''
</P>
<P>
   The 200 or so candidates that were deemed suitable were then
checked to see if they could legally be used. According to
Harleman, H-P had to clear the names through the legal systems of
the 100 countries where the new company would be conducting
business. The survivors of that process were then put through what
Harleman called the cultural screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brand names can have some interesting and very unintended
meanings overseas,'' said Harleman. ``You definitely don't want to
have a Nova situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Nova situation'' is legendary among brand consultants.
When General Motors debuted its Chevrolet Nova in South America, it
failed to notice that nova means ``It doesn't go'' in Spanish. (Not
to be outdone, Ford Motor Co. didn't check the name of its Fiera
sports car in Latin America, where the name translated into ``ugly
old woman.'')
</P>
<P>
   Proposed names that passed these tests were then put before an
eight-member panel of H-P employees and executives.
</P>
<P>
   Agilent was finally chosen because ``agile'' best reflected the
mandate of the new company, Hahn said. The NT ending, Hahn said,
was added to give the word ``strength and forward motion.'' It also
avoided the quandary of the name's being interpreted as feminine or
masculine overseas by adding an ``e'' or ``a'' ending.
</P>
<P>
   ``Agilent is now like an adverb,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The final name ``was exactly what we want people to think about.
It didn't oversell the company, and it spoke to our mission,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   It also didn't translate into anything like ``air sick bag.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not that we know of,'' Hahn said, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Agilent Technologies will become a separate company Nov. 1 with
Edward W. ``Ned'' Barnholt as chief executive officer. It will be
headquartered on the Palo Alto site where H-P was founded 52 years
ago.

A SAFE HAVEN FOR WOODSTOCK SPIRIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDVINS BEITIKS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Talking to a standing-room-only crowd at the
Barnes &AMP; Noble, Richie Havens was asked why he thought people
rioted at the latest Woodstock nostalgia concert. Havens, whose act
opened the original Woodstock in 1969, shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason is, it wasn't Woodstock,'' said Havens, who was in
Oakland to introduce his new book, ``they can't hide us anymore,''
written with Steve Davidowitz (Avon Books).
</P>
<P>
   To his mind, said Havens, the real Woodstock will be held in
mid- August on the original site _ Max Yasgur's 600-acre farm _
with the original artists on hand, including Arlo Guthrie, Melanie,
Country Joe MacDonald, John Sebastian and Havens himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was tragic. It didn't have to be that way,'' Havens
said of last weekend's riots, which ended a three-day festival at a
former air base outside Rome, N.Y. He said co-organizer Michael
Lang, one of the original Woodstock organizers, made a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made the mistake of thinking he put on the first one. The
people put it on,'' said Havens. ``The last two (Woodstock) shows
have been failures because they disrespected that.''
</P>
<P>
   Havens didn't come down hard on youngsters at the concert, in
the wake of a riot that targeted ATM machines and left vendors'
booths and trailers burning. ``They are actually freer than we
are,'' he said. ``They need more space. They need more respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Havens called his autobiography, 25 years in the making, ``they
can't hide us anymore'' because that's the thought that occurred to
him at the first Woodstock, held on Yasgur's farm outside Bethel,
N.Y., as Havens was being flown in a bubble-front helicopter over
hundreds of thousands of people to the stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking below my feet at all those people and I thought,
`They can't hide us anymore,''' he said. ``And you know, they still
can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Havens was supposed to be the fifth act of the concert. But the
refusal of others to go first, and the inability to get It's a
Beautiful Day out to the stage in time, sent Havens out after a
delay of almost four hours. He started a set that was supposed to
go 20 minutes with ``Minstrel from Gault'' and kept singing as the
set grew to 40 minutes and more.
</P>
<P>
   Havens left the stage half a dozen times, only to be pressed
back to fill the gaps in music. By the seventh time, Havens ran out
of songs and improvised ``Freedom'' to a driving backbeat. It set a
tone for Woodstock and left Havens feeling that ``Bethel was such a
special place, a moment when we all felt we were at the exact
center of true freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   The son of a Blackfoot Native American father and mother from
Barbados, Havens grew up in Brooklyn during the 1940s and '50s,
``doing doo-wop on the street corner with my buddies, getting water
thrown on us, all that.''
</P>
<P>
   Havens moved on to the Greenwich Village music scene, meeting
later-to-be-famous names, from Bob Dylan to James Baldwin, as the
'50s wound down. He still makes his home in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Havens opened his presentation at Barnes &AMP; Noble by playing
``All Along the Watchtower'' on a guitar he brought with him, his
foot thrumming time on the floor. The audience, 100-plus stuffed
into a corner of the store, fell silent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to sing this six times a day back in the Village, seven
days a week, seven years in a row,'' he said. Then Dylan got the
words of the song from Havens, and ``I stopped singing it because
my friend recorded the definitive version.''
</P>
<P>
   But lately youngsters are asking him to do the song, said
Havens. Holding an arm out waist-high, he said, ``They're this big,
and I ask them where they heard this song and they say, `Oh, I've
got my grandma's records.' `Grandma?' Couldn't they at least say
`Mom's records?'''
</P>
<P>
   Havens delighted a mixed crowd of gray-hairs, longhairs and no-
hairs with three songs and a walk down memory lane. Looking much
the same as he did in the days of his 1968 album ``Something Else
Again'' _ rings on every finger, hair in a ponytail, shy smile on
his face _ Havens said, ``Some people called me a folk singer ... a
folk- rock singer, a folk-jazz singer, a folk-blues singer. I just
call myself a song singer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been on tour since December of '67,'' said Havens. ``I
say it as a joke, but it's true. I did get to see the changes
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Havens built his autobiography up and tore it down over the past
quarter of a century, settling on a weekly tape session with writer
Davidowitz to get it finished. ``He came over every Tuesday, wound
up with 100 hours of tapes,'' said Havens.
</P>
<P>
   He tells his story, as might be expected, with great sweeps of
emotion and constant kindnesses to the people around him.
</P>
<P>
   Insights into the top music figures of the time are there, from
Elvis to Janis Joplin to Jimi Hendrix, and Havens writes a lament
for both the mistakes of drug use and the mistakes of the
government's war on drugs.
</P>
<P>
   There are times when ``they can't hide us anymore'' gets too
airy for its own good, as when Havens waxes poetic about the
Natural Guard, a group of youngsters heading to Washington to teach
politicians the true way, and when he argues for a fleet of baby
seals to be taught how to release the safety belts of passengers
trapped inside airplanes downed in rivers and seas.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, though, Havens stays surprisingly down to
Earth, as he did Tuesday night at Barnes &AMP; Noble. There will never
be a bigger champion of the Woodstock ethic than Havens, who told
the bookstore crowd the first concert ``was the biggest
non-negative get-together we have seen, to this day.''

COLD SOUP ON A HOT DAY IS VERY COOL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RUTH FANTASIA  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   About the last thing anyone wants to do on an 80-degree day is
simmer a pot on the stove for several hours. But not all soups need
to be simmered and served hot.
</P>
<P>
   The harvest of summer produce brings with it the ability to make
cold, refreshing dishes that just happen to be liquid and served in
a bowl: soup.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike winter soups and stews, summer versions aren't cooked for
long, or even at all. While that means the kitchen _ and the cook _
stay cool, there's no processing to bring out the ingredients'
flavors. This means the soup is only going to taste as good as the
ingredients you use. Therefore, buy the ripest, most flavorful
ingredients you can find.
</P>
<P>
   If the soup is served with chunks of vegetables, cut the
ingredients by hand, writes James Peterson in his book ``Soups.''
Food processors and blenders tend to over-process ingredients,
creating a mushy texture instead of a chunky one with the contrasts
of the vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   To make Peterson's gazpacho, a flavorful soup based on fresh
tomatoes, use the following method:
</P>
<P>
   Peel, seed and chop 8 large, ripe tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Place in a large bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Peel 3 cloves garlic, mince and then mash them with salt until
paste-like.
</P>
<P>
   Add to tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Chop 2 large sweet onions, 2 cucumbers, 2 yellow bell peppers
and 2 jalapeno peppers (optional).
</P>
<P>
   Add chopped ingredients to tomatoes as you go.
</P>
<P>
   Add in the juice of 3 limes, a pinch of cayenne pepper, salt and
pepper to taste.
</P>
<P>
   Refrigerate.
</P>
<P>
   Serve drizzled with olive oil and topped with croutons.
</P>
<P>
   Pass hot pepper sauce and extra chopped vegetables if desired.
</P>
<P>
   Summer fruits are also excellent for making soups such as in
this recipe for Santa Fe Chilled Nectarine Soup from the California
Tree Fruit Agreement (a promotional group for that state's peach,
nectarine and plum producers):
</P>
<P>
   Combine 1 pound cut up nectarines, 1/2 cup apple juice, 1/2 cup
cranberry-raspberry juice, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon red
pepper flakes and 1 1/2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar in a blender.
</P>
<P>
   Process until smooth.
</P>
<P>
   Add 2 tablespoons fresh cilantro leaves and process to chop.
</P>
<P>
   Refrigerate until serving.
</P>
<P>
   Garnish with lime slices.
</P>
<P>
   Makes 2 (1-cup) servings.
</P>
<P>
   And if you don't have some of the ingredients on hand, don't
sweat. You can always substitute peaches for nectarines, green
peppers for yellow peppers and wine vinegar for balsamic. After
all, taking it easy is the way you should make cold soup in the
first place.

`RUNAWAY BRIDE': PRETTY WOMAN IS BACK, BUT NOW SHE'S CAUTIOUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nine years after sparkling her way through ``Pretty Woman,''
Julia Roberts has come a long way from that streetwalker's role.
She's come so far in ``Runaway Bride'' that she plays a woman who
runs a hardware store and looks perpetually ready to fix a sink.
</P>
<P>
   Set in the kind of folksy Maryland town that has quaint
hand-painted signs and not a single chain store, this new
collaboration between the stars and director of ``Pretty Woman''
takes pains, geographically and otherwise, to get as far away from
Rodeo Drive as it can. The small town's streets are even roamed by
a barbershop quartet.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the ``Pretty Woman'' bloom is definitely off the rose as
Ms. Roberts plays a pale, stern woman with an incongruously
screwball-type problem. It seems that her character, Maggie
Carpenter, is altar-phobic. She avoids her own weddings in a way
that makes for nifty one-liners (``May the groom's heart be full of
hope and the bride's feet be full of lead!'') and even newspaper
headlines (``Hardware Honey Goes Nuts and Bolts'').
</P>
<P>
   This is an even worse problem than the one with which Ms.
Roberts grappled in ``Notting Hill'' (being famous). And maybe it's
not as funny as it's supposed to look.
</P>
<P>
   But Garry Marshall smoothly turns Maggie's little kink into
big-screen sitcom fodder, just as he managed to put a nice spin on
the idea of a rich, powerful Pygmalion buying a Hollywood Boulevard
hooker to redo. Richard Gere returns, this time in the smiling nice
guy's role, to rekindle some of the earlier film's warm glow.
</P>
<P>
   His and Marshall's reunion with Ms. Roberts guarantees a comedy
that's easy on the eyes and dependable in the laugh department. But
``Runaway Bride'' also, like Maggie, shows signs of strain.
Chemistry-wise, it can't bode well for a romantic comedy to feature
two stars who apparently posed for the poster art on separate days.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the film there's a glimpse of Gere and Ms. Roberts
having a great time playing cards together. But it flashes by
quickly as part of a standard feel-good montage, and it leaps out
as the rare spontaneous moment in a largely mechanical romp.
</P>
<P>
   More often, the film is like a ride through a car wash: forward
motion, familiar phases in the same old order and a sense of being
carried along steadily on a well-used track. It works without
exactly showing signs of life.
</P>
<P>
   Gere plays a veteran newspaper columnist. We know he's an old
pro because a) he's named Ike, b) he's chummy with workmen in the
street and c) he's right at home at the local bar. If an audience
buys that, is it a big leap to the idea that Ike's entire
professional future hangs on his investigation of Maggie's habit of
jilting her fiances?
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes. But the movie packs Ike off to Hale, Md., anyway so
he can follow Maggie around in a state of Act I animosity. Only the
barbershop quartet's harmonies are as sure as the promise that by
Act II or III the ice will melt.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Ms. Roberts does let her hair down and start turning
the world on with her smile. But it takes a while for that to
happen. Much of the film's first hour is devoted to Ike's Cheshire
Cat-like ability to turn up grinning anywhere in Hale, and Maggie's
annoyance over his presence.
</P>
<P>
   The screenplay by Josann McGibbon and Sara Parriott is much
better on delivering zingers and developing minor characters than
it is on plotting. It also locks no-nonsense Maggie and misogynist
Ike into a stale battle of the sexes that isn't much fun.
</P>
<P>
   But Marshall does know when to let the stars turn on their high
beams and keep the film's secondary characters amusing and bright.
These include Paul Dooley as Maggie's father, who dryly says things
like: ``Wedding cake freezes. This we know.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Meloni has some funny moments as the latest
unfortunate fiance, the jock who plans to coach Maggie through a
wedding ceremony as if it were a sporting event. Joan Cusack makes
a dependably tart best friend for Maggie, Laurie Metcalf runs the
local bakery and Jean Schertler plays Maggie's grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   Aficionados of mainstream nuptial comedy will not be surprised
to hear Grandma ogling young men and saying funny, raunchy things
about the wedding night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Runaway Bride'' does a smooth job of working Ike into this
down-home crowd. So it isn't long before the nicely ubiquitous Gere
is jamming on the guitar with Hale's mayor and sheriff, wearing a
Hale football jacket, etc. Maggie resents this; then the story
gives her and Ike nighttime car trouble on a deserted country road
by moonlight and of course things start to change.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, they have one of those arguments in which each
character sums up the other in a tidy nutshell. (Maggie to Ike:
``All you do is tear others down and laugh at them and criticize
what they do because you're too afraid to do anything yourself!'')
And at last Ms. Roberts pulls out all the stops, ready to dazzle
Ike and the viewer as if a peacock were fanning out its feathers on
cue.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's better moments are the ones that escape this
pattern, like a glimpse of Maggie's first near-wedding, the one
with a Grateful Dead motif. (Ms. Cusack is seen with a tambourine.)
There's also a Federal Express joke so good that it constitutes a
best case scenario for product plugs, in a line delivered by Hector
Elizondo, another ``Pretty Woman'' veteran.
</P>
<P>
   He plays the man who replaced Ike in the affections of Ike's
ex-wife, played bluntly by Rita Wilson. Honk if you guess that the
ex-wife happens to be Ike's newspaper editor too.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCTION NOTES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `RUNAWAY BRIDE' is rated PG (Parents strongly cautioned). It
includes mild profanity and nothing terribly unsuitable for
children.

 &HT;    EVEN AFTER BRUTAL MURDERS, ISRAELIS NOT FAVORING DEATH PENALTY
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service(at) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ A crime shocked Israel this week as it would any
other country: A father stabbed and strangled to death his wife and
two toddlers.
</P>
<P>
   But, the minority calls for the death penalty were quickly
dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the terrorism of the past or horrible domestic crimes of
the present, Israel chooses to do without the capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, only one man has been executed in the 51-year history
of the state. In 1962, Nazi SS officer Adolf Eichmann, who had been
captured in hiding by Israeli agents, was hanged for organizing the
deportation of hundreds of thousands of European Jews to death
camps.
</P>
<P>
   ``They felt the enormity of the offenses was so great that a
sort of cosmic justice required his execution,'' explained Ruth
Gavison, law professor at Jerusalem's Hebrew University and a civil
rights activist.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, Israel's view of capital punishment was apparent in
this week's reaction to the case of Amnon Cohen, accused of killing
his wife and children.
</P>
<P>
   Naomi Leeron, director of the government's Authority on the
Status of Women, created a stir by saying on Israeli radio that the
case required the death penalty. It would show, she said, that the
government is serious about domestic violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have another solution,'' Leeron later told the Cox
News Service. She said domestic violence is increasing, and that
men who murder their wives act in a ``calculated'' manner. ``They
are not violent at work. They are only violent with their wives,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   But, her radio comments brought quick rebuttals from Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak, Justice Minister Yossi Beilin and State
Prosecutor Edna Arbel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those proposing to impose the death penalty on killers of
wives and children are making populist statements that don't bring
a real solution to the problem,'' Beilin was reported as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Another case Thursday seemed to reiterate the country's
sentiment. A military court sentenced a Palestinian terrorist to
three life sentences and 15 years for the murder of a settler rabbi
and a series of other attacks. Some settlers and the victim's
family wanted a death sentence, though not even the prosecutor had
requested it.
</P>
<P>
   Military law allows the death penalty of terrorists and in
several cases military judges have ordered executions. However,
each time, the sentences were either overturned by appeals courts
or military commanders simply refused to carry them out.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli military leaders see the death penalty as problematic.
Executions, they maintain, create martyrs and could provoke revenge
attacks that would endanger Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Though many Israelis support a limited death penalty, they are
much cooler to the idea than Americans. Polls often show 70 percent
of Americans favoring the death penalty and more than 350
executions have been carried out since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, where crime is less frequent, the death penalty has
less support, though polls were not available.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a cultured nation. We don't need this,'' said Israeli
Ruth Sheinfeld, a 79-year-old retired agricultural worker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a religious person and I believe it is God who decides
the fate of people,'' said Yair Sinai, a 29-year-old teacher and
Orthodox Jew. ``We don't talk about this much. We talk all the time
about security and peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli view could be seen as somewhat contradictory. The
death penalty is eschewed, but the government has resorted to
commando assassinations of terrorists, seen as a way to protect
Israelis from their schemes.
</P>
<P>
   But, Israeli experts point out that their country is in line
with growing numbers of countries that are abolishing the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``America is way out in left field,'' said Leon Sheleff, a
sociology professor at Tel Aviv University and a death penalty
opponent. ``There's almost no chance of it being changed here.''

IS DAVID DUCHOVNY LEAVING `X-FILES'? THE TRUTH IS OUT THERE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Asked whether he'll return for an eighth
season of ``The X-Files,'' David Duchovny doesn't immediately
answer. Instead, he slowly pours water in a cup and takes a sip as
though he's the only one in the room. ``I really can't answer
that,'' he finally replies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say `never' about anything. But as of right now, my
contract is up at the end of this coming year. So I'm living life
as if this would be the last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Duchovny isn't being coy. He's politely serving notice that this
interview will be conducted on his terms, and he's off to an
awfully good start. In the years he has played Agent Mulder on the
critically acclaimed Fox drama, he has always had something of a
take-it-or-leave-it attitude, and nothing has changed much.
</P>
<P>
   We're meeting under impromptu circumstances. Fox is trying to
redirect the circulating rumors that the final season of the Fox
drama is near, that the series will live on only on the big screen.
</P>
<P>
   Just hours earlier, the rumor mill had started churning at the
annual summer TV critics' meeting, when ``The X-Files'' creator
Chris Carter, promoting his supernatural drama ``Harsh Realm,'' had
given a similar notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard second- and third-hand that Fox might approach us
about taking the show past the seventh season,'' Carter told
journalists. ``Right now, as I'm plotting the series, I'm looking
at these next 22 episodes as a wrap-up.''
</P>
<P>
   So here's Duchovny being asked to place the remaining puzzle
piece, and this is what we get. And forget reading between the
lines. Duchovny displays no obvious nervous tics or showy emotions,
except amusement, which is usually preceded by a biting sarcasm
that's often mistaken for celeb ego-tripping.
</P>
<P>
   That's the wonder of Duchovny. Loaded questions make him smile,
and lighter questions make him serious. He doesn't adjust his seat
when discussing what you'd consider uncomfortable subjects, because
to Duchovny, there are no such things.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he believes in the supernatural, he answers ``Yes.
No.'' Asked whether his perspective has changed by doing ``The
X-Files,'' he answers, ``Completely and not one bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he smiles and says, ``Next question?''
</P>
<P>
   Some might say that the fame he has gained as Mulder has taught
him well. Others figure he has enough money in the bank and stature
in the business to feel secure. Maybe both, maybe one, maybe none.
</P>
<P>
   But Duchovny knows more than he's telling concerning the future
of the series. On the one hand, he feels possessive of Mulder,
sounding upbeat and giddy when discussing the possibilities of more
big-screen stories. Yet the next minute, he's trying to convince us
that another actor could end up partnering with Scully (Gillian
Anderson) if there's an eighth season.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's contract expires a year after his, so it's possible
that ``The X-Files'' could go on without him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm no longer indispensable,'' Duchovny acknowledges. ``Nobody
is.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The X-Files'' has its own life, its own brand identity. ``It's
like Crest,'' he says. ``It's Menudo. Look at `NYPD Blue.' I'd be
an idiot to sit here and say, `Oh, my God, you know it's not going
to go on without me.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course it could, if the stories were good. If the writers
were good. If the directors were good. I'm sure they'd hire a good
actor.''
</P>
<P>
   But.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's a part of me that would be sitting at home wishing
fervently that it would fail. I want to take care of this character
to make sure he's not misrepresented. I want to do right by the
character that I've lived with and helped create for the last six
years.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Carter, he's obviously ready to move on, venturing out
first with the canceled ``Millennium'' and now with ``Harsh
Realm.''
</P>
<P>
   The pilot for ``Harsh Realm,'' which stars Scott Bairstow as a
military man who finds himself stuck in a virtual-reality world,
may not be the smash-hit follow-up Carter wants. It's dark, moody
and confusing. But many didn't seem to get ``The X-Files,'' either.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fun and it was exciting and it was well-written and it
was well-acted and it was well-directed,'' Duchovny says of ``The
X-Files.''
</P>
<P>
   Duchovny is talking in past tense. Should we read something into
that?
</P>

`TWIN FALLS IDAHO': TALE OF A MENAGE A TROIS, WITH THE EMPHASIS ON
DEUX 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   (italics)``Twin Falls Idaho'' was shown as part of this year's
New Directors/New Films series in New York. Following are excerpts
from Janet Maslin's review, which appeared in The New York Times on
April 9. The film opens Friday in Manhattan.(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   An eerily effective film, ``Twin Falls Idaho'' takes the
real-life closeness of the identical twins Michael and Mark Polish
into the realm of haunting fantasy. These arrestingly gaunt,
watchful-looking brothers star in the film as conjoined twins,
Blake (Mark) and Francis (Michael) Falls, whose delicately balanced
interdependence provides a rare brand of tension.
</P>
<P>
   The film, which the Polish brothers wrote and Michael directed,
begins as the twins encounter a wild, gorgeous young woman named
Penny (Michele Hicks, a former model) in an interestingly desolate
hotel. It's a setting that the cinematographer, M. David Mullen,
photographs with bleak and painterly precision.
</P>
<P>
   And it is here that the brothers' differences begin to emerge,
with Blake as the stronger figure and the one most powerfully drawn
to Penny. Imagine how a Siamese twin might conduct a courtship, and
imagine this rendered with intense acuity and no gimmicks.
</P>
<P>
   Because Francis is the weaker and more dependent of the two, and
because the situation's menage a trois possibilities are
unavoidable, the film explores aspects of symbiotic relationships
that nonconjoined viewers will easily understand.
</P>
<P>
   It also has strong, offbeat atmosphere and a richly perverse
sense of mischief where the twins are concerned. A pivotal part of
the film unfolds on Halloween, when the Falls boys impress
strangers with their marvelous costume (a two-armed, three-legged
suit) and attend a party where they seem like the most normal
people in the room. Though the twins have done time as a circus
attraction, the film itself never treats them like freaks.
</P>
<P>
   With an especially affecting performance by Mark Polish as the
story's dominant figure, and with Ms. Hicks a striking kohl-eyed
presence even when she struggles with the story's more demanding
scenes, ``Twin Falls Idaho'' has style, gravity and originality to
spare.
</P>
<P>
   It's a film that dwells as hauntingly on loneliness as it does
on never actually being able to be alone.

`INTIMATE UNIVERSE: THE HUMAN BODY': COMPELLING BUT OCCASIONALLY
DEPRESSING 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   So much for the spiritual significance of those near-death
experiences. The tunnel and the light that people talk about seeing
has something to do with vision-control neurons firing at random.
And the sense of euphoria and inner peace just comes from various
brain chemicals at work. The same thing happens to test pilots
undergoing ``gravity-induced loss of consciousness'' in the
centrifuge.
</P>
<P>
   As for the dream of middle age _ turning back the clock by
shaping up now with the right diet and exercise _ forget it. The
body is just a big photocopying machine (making new cells that are
supposed to be duplicates of the existing cells), and it tends to
make inferior copies. Taking better care of the machine now might
help slow down the deterioration of future copies, but it couldn't
turn the process back to copying from the original.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intimate Universe: The Human Body'' isn't just award-winning
television; it's depressing. At least the last few episodes, which
are being shown on the Learning Channel on Sunday and Monday
nights, are.
</P>
<P>
   In the first, ``The Brain,'' the series' host, Dr. Robert
Winston, even drinks a lot of wine to establish once and for all
that alcoholic beverages don't make people more charming and
amusing than before. After a bottle or so, in fact, Winston can't
remember his lines and can't quite pronounce the word
``belligerent.''
</P>
<P>
   The photocopier analogy comes from ``As Time Goes By,'' the
episode about aging. Bud and Viola, a farm couple who met almost 50
years ago, are the living examples of the effects of aging, which
is described as ``one of the greatest paradoxes of human biology''
and ``probably a genetic accident.'' When the couple pay their
first visit to New York and seem a little rattled while trying to
navigate its busy streets, a voice-over explains that the brain, as
it gets older, ``has to work harder to make sense of the limited
information it's getting from the outside world'' and ``this means
fewer brain cells for memory and decision-making and might account
for the confusion, especially in strange and noisy places.''
</P>
<P>
   And the scientific explanations of the frequently reported
near-death phenomena come from the penultimate episode, ``Life's
Last Chapter,'' in which Herbie, a charming German man living in
Ireland, invites cameras in to watch as he slowly dies from
inoperable stomach cancer. Although basic medical information is
imparted (``Hearing is the last thing to go''), the fascination _
and the real learning _ is in observing Herbie's psychological
preparations for death.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in ``The Making of `Intimate Universe: The Human
Body,'' the filmmakers take viewers behind the scenes for a look at
the show's use of scanning electron miscroscopes, motion-control
cameras, thermal imaging, endoscopy and other technology. The
series began earlier this year with four other episodes _ on
pregnancy, babies, teen-agers and the average human lifetime _
which will be shown again Saturday night at 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intimate Universe'' has flaws. At times, the use of people
like Bud and Viola to illustrate universal truths seems
self-consciously folksy and predictable. And there are only so many
ways you can make an explanation of the development of the
opposable thumb interesting. But just as often, the series does
something brilliant, like showing microscopic hair cells in the ear
actually dancing to ``Rock Around the Clock'' (then how is it
possible that we don't all have rhythm?) or showing several views
of Monet's famous bridge at Giverny that teach as much about
Impressionism as about eye disease. If everybody had had science
classes this compelling, we'd probably have cured cancer by now.

A SCORECARD MIGHT COME IN HANDY FOR FALL TV CAST CHANGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TIM GOODMAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Everything we know we learned from the TV
critics press tour: You need a program to track the cast changes
for the fall. But we know this much: Heather Locklear is going to
become a cast member on ``Spin City.''
</P>
<P>
   That probably won't help in toning down all the relentless sex
jokes of this once-stellar show.
</P>
<P>
   Nikki Cox, former star of ``Unhappily Ever After'' on The WB _
the only show known better for its Internet sites devoted to Cox's
body than actual episodes _ will join the cast of ABC's ``Norm''
show.
</P>
<P>
   Probably no sex jokes there, either.
</P>
<P>
   So much for Ellen DeGeneres' retirement from Hollywood. She's
developing a pilot for CBS. She better finish it in a hurry _ that
network's fall programming looks painfully bad.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca DeMornay may be joining the cast of ``ER,'' mostly
because the hospital hit needs some life. Already, Maura Tierney
(``NewsRadio'') has joined the cast.
</P>
<P>
   ``NYPD Blue'' executive producer Paris Barclay joked that the
networks are suddenly so desperate to cover for their fall
whitewash that they'll be having open auditions in Compton.
</P>
<P>
   He made those comments Wednesday on ``Good Morning America,''
shot live here at the hotel _ which made for a 4 a.m. appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ABC flew the cast out and worked endlessly to turn part of the
hotel into a studio. But when the critics got a chance to talk to
Diane Sawyer and Charlie Gibson on Tuesday, they virtually had
nothing to say.
</P>
<P>
   Sawyer didn't answer questions as to why she took two personal
days off as the JFK Jr. story broke. This only fueled charges that
high-profile, highly paid national news anchors have become
celebrities themselves and are too chummy with the people they
cover.
</P>
<P>
   The ``GMA'' producers didn't talk about a new set being built in
Times Square (see, you've got to have big windows if you're a
morning show in New York) or what it would look like. And everyone
was too afraid to say whether CBS's ``Early Show'' with Bryant
Gumbel was causing lost sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Which prompted the question: Why the hell are you here wasting
our time?
</P>
<P>
   TCI is changing its name to AT&AMP;T Cable. So when we complain
about not getting The Cartoon Network or The Food Network or ESPN2,
can we also complain about our long-distance bills?
</P>
<P>
   Why it took Latinos this long to get organized and complain
about a lack of roles in Hollywood is confusing. Don't they know
that the TV industry is reflexive, and that all those new roles are
going to African Americans first, because executives down here
don't ``get'' the problem?
</P>
<P>
   Sample question from next year: ``We see you've added a lot of
black actors. What are you going to do about the Latino audience?''
</P>
<P>
   Sample network answer: ``Isn't Cheech Marin on `Nash Bridges'?''
</P>
<P>
   If only that were a joke.
</P>
<P>
   Asians also need to step to the plate. God love Sammo Hung, but
do you really want Middle America to think that's who you are?
</P>
<P>
   Looks like the honeymoon could be over for David Kelley, the
golden boy producer who gave us ``Ally McBeal'' and ``The
Practice.'' His half-hour version of ``Ally'' looks to be nothing
more than a money grab, because he acknowledged that half-hour
shows make more money in syndication (and the ``new'' episodes will
be repackaged starting from the very first show, then run
chronologically).
</P>
<P>
   Plus he got a lot of ``Chicago Hope'' cast members mad by
writing them out of the show on last year's finale. And now he has
developed ``Snoops'' for ABC, which has met with massive critical
disinterest down here.
</P>
<P>
   At least Michelle Pfeiffer still loves him.
</P>
<P>
   If you're wondering which network will be the first to crumble,
consider this: Chris-Craft, a TV station group that owns half of
UPN, had its second-quarter earnings drop nearly 50 percent, and
the blame went straight to UPN. Better hope the network's wrestling
idea pays off _ and quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Bring me the head of ``Shasta McNasty.''
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, sad news: ``Two Guys, A Girl and a Pizza Place'' is
losing the pizza place. Yes, the kids have grown up and won't be
baking pies anymore, so it's just going to be called ``Two Guys and
a Girl.''
</P>
<P>
   We suggested ``Why Is This Show Still On?'' but it was rejected.
</P>
<P>
   The High Fives:
</P>
<P>
   1. ``The Sopranos'' getting all those Emmy nominations. (And
yes, the show will repeat all the original episodes before the next
season, which starts in January).
</P>
<P>
   2. Farrah Fawcett was down here, and she wasn't spacey, like her
infamous Letterman appearance.
</P>
<P>
   3. The same could not be said for ``Ally McBeal'' star Lisa
Nicole Carson, who was lucky she had a limo driver.
</P>
<P>
   4. Quick synopsis of the fall: Too many teens, too many dramas,
but overall not bad.
</P>
<P>
   5. The death march with cocktails is winding down.

`CONDUCT UNBECOMING A WOMAN': MALPRACTICE OR MISOGYNY? 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1889, a well-known gynecological surgeon named Mary Dixon
Jones was tried for manslaughter resulting from what prosecutors
said were botched and unnecessary operations. The charges, which
led to a sensational trial, were prompted by a series of newspaper
articles in The Brooklyn Daily Eagle accusing the doctor of gross
malpractice.
</P>
<P>
   After the trial, in which she was acquitted, Dixon Jones sued
the newspaper for libel, prompting an even more spectacular trial
in 1892. By centering on the reputation and methods of one of the
few female surgeons in the United States, the trials opened a
window on the conflicts in values and the deep sexual anxieties
prevalent in the country at the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conduct Unbecoming a Woman'' by Regina Morantz-Sanchez, a
historian at the University of Michigan, is a close and probing
examination of these nearly forgotten events. It is a study not
just of the drama of the trials or the struggle of Dixon Jones to
succeed as a surgical innovator in the male world of American
medicine. Ms. Morantz-Sanchez's main purpose is to forge a social
history of late-19th-century medicine. She develops several themes:
the role of newspapers in creating social consciousness; the
conservative ethos that prevailed in Brooklyn in the 1870s and
1880s; the rapid development of gynecology as a speciality, and the
use of radical surgery. But the main idea is this: that the
journalistic and legal assault on Dixon Jones represented
punishment aimed at a woman whose chief offense was to step beyond
the accepted bounds of feminine behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dixon Jones,'' Ms. Morantz-Sanchez writes, ``attained a
professional status unique to her sex at the time, but one that was
bound to be challenged, particularly in a conservative city like
Brooklyn, struggling not only with complex social changes but also
with the various challenges to the medical status quo raised by her
chosen specialty.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Morantz-Sanchez is more interested in the scholarly value of
her story than in its inherent drama, and that will make the book
tough going for some readers. Ms. Morantz-Sanchez's writing is not
obscure _ certainly not compared with much of the writing that
appears in academic books these days. But she does lay a level of
theory rather heavily over her narrative, which is bespeckled with
a trendy, abstract, ritualistic boilerplate that will seem strange
to the uninitiated. Phrases like ``mediated symbolic forms,''
``multiple meanings,'' ``medical construction of the female body,''
and the monotonous overuse of words like ``strategies'' and
``negotiate'' are the standard, unoriginal and imprecise components
of academic writing. ``In the next chapter we will see how her
finely tuned antennae helped her negotiate the uncertain waters of
a new speciality in the making,'' Ms. Morantz-Sanchez writes at one
point. Here we have the dubious spectacle of antennae helping to
negotiate waters. There are many such pretentiously clunky
passages.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the story is fascinating, and the analyses thoughtful and
provocative. Ms. Morantz-Sanchez also scrupulously provides all the
relevant, sometimes self-contradictory information, and she invites
the reader to draw different conclusions than her own. The story
begins with a journalistic battle waged over the actions of Dixon
Jones. Even as The Eagle's expose provided lurid details of her
mistreatment of patients, another newspaper, The Citizen, came to
her defense. Ms. Morantz-Sanchez also tells all that is known about
the specific medical complaints against Dixon Jones before
embarking on historical interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   This leads her to a thorough examination of the social and
medical context in which Dixon Jones lived, both as a hard-driving
and ambitious doctor and as a woman. Ms. Morantz-Sanchez describes
Brooklyn in the last third of the 19th century as an especially
conservative society that consciously saw itself as a family- and
church-oriented alternative to sinful and dissolute Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   She then devotes several chapters to medical history, especially
the emergence of surgical gynecology as a specialty. She makes a
persuasive case that surgery was viewed through other prisms than
the purely scientific. Specifically, the use of radical surgery
seemed in those early days not to cure women but to destroy their
ability to bear children, which was seen as a sacred role. ``Cries
of women being `spayed, unsexed, mutilated' were common, and many
conservative practitioners, some of them female, drew parallels
between gynecological surgery and vivisection,'' Ms.
Morantz-Sanchez writes.
</P>
<P>
   And later: ``If the female body stood in for the city in the
minds of Dixon Jones' enemies, then her alleged violation of
patients' bodies represented an even more egregious attack on the
social body _ indeed, on motherhood itself _ and spoke pointedly to
the true nature of her shameful breach of Brooklyn's trust.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, as Ms. Morantz-Sanchez makes clear, matters were not so
simple. Questions remain, including: was Dixon Jones persecuted and
prosecuted because of these underlying cultural anxieties or was
she a bad doctor who botched operations? As always, we will find
all the information on this significant question in ``Conduct
Unbecoming a Woman.'' When Ms. Morantz-Sanchez recounts details of
the libel suit, she acknowledges that the evidence presented by the
newspaper was ``overwhelmingly convincing'' and that it was drawn
from ``a staggering number of dissatisfied patients.'' Indeed,
Dixon Jones lost her libel suit.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible, in other words, that Dixon Jones committed
malpractice rather than that she was persecuted as a woman
challenging a male preserve. And yet this reader, at least, tends
to side with Ms. Morantz-Sanchez. It seems reasonable that if Dixon
Jones had been a man she would not have been the subject of The
Eagle's expose, and that if surgery had not been so new and
frightening, there would have been no trial. Whatever the case, and
despite the awkwardness of this book's execution, we owe it to Ms.
Morantz-Sanchez for having laid out this rich and absorbing case
for our own deliberation.

story about life in a city where ``things were happening all the

   EASY MONEY. By Jenny Siler. (John Macrae/Holt, $24.) The offbeat
but articulate heroine of this lethal debut thriller is a young

intent on retrieving a computer disk with secret evidence of an
ugly Vietnam War conspiracy.

   FLAT LAKE IN WINTER. By Joseph T. Klempner. (Thomas Dunne/St.
Martin's, $24.95.) This grave and thoughtful legal thriller, set in

criminal lawyer to come up with a defense that will hold off an

middle-aged widow who returns to her native Ireland to care for her

that takes the suspense thriller into emotional territory where it
rarely dares to go.

 By IMRE KARACS  
 c.1999 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Germans are at odds over claims that harsh potty training is to
blame both for Nazism and modern thuggery.
</P>
<P>
   A friend of mine is convinced that the German national character
in all its complexities can be traced back to Germans' rigorous
potty training.
</P>
<P>
   Teutonic infants, he claims, are made to sit on their lowly
thrones for hours on end, until pronounced spiffy clean, usually at
a remarkably tender age.
</P>
<P>
   Out of this early purgatory of life emerges a nation of
precision engineers obsessed with waste disposal, with an
unquenchable yearning for order and authority.
</P>
<P>
   My Jewish friend, referring me to the works of Sigmund Freud,
believes this explains everything in German history, including the
Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Ridiculous. Or so I thought until I opened Die Zeit, Germany's
most intellectual weekly. There it was: a 6,000-word essay on this
very subject.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the Holocaust for one moment. What the author wanted to
establish was whether East Germans were really susceptible to
neo-Nazi views because of the harsh potty-training regime of the
communist era. For that is what a noted Wessi (West German)
criminologist claims.
</P>
<P>
   Christian Pfeiffer, director of the Criminological Research
Institute of Lower Saxony, thinks the xenophobia permeating east
German society can be traced back to the nursery schools.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Pfeiffer had been looking into the reasons why youth
in eastern Germany are four times more likely to commit
racially-motivated crimes than their western counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   It all boils down to ``das Topfen,'' a word which exists only in
the east German dialect, a noun forged bureaucratically from the
word Topf _ ``potty.''
</P>
<P>
   It denotes the ritual of potty training, a sacred act codified
by precise instructions passed down from the Politburo. ``As soon
as the child is able to sit without help, the teacher can begin
with regular potty training,'' the official instruction manual for
nursery schools and kindergartens ordained.
</P>
<P>
   At set times, children were herded into a communal toilet and
made to sit on rows of potties. ``Potty times'' were the nurseries'
main activity, potty training the supreme goal of the institution.
</P>
<P>
   It served an ideological purpose. Through their synchronized
bowel movements, the children of the proletariat shared the
vicissitudes of life. Those who did not perform remained seated,

<TEXT>
<P>
   Germans are at odds over claims that harsh potty training is to
blame both for Nazism and modern thuggery.
</P>
<P>
   A friend of mine is convinced that the German national character
in all its complexities can be traced back to Germans' rigorous
potty training.
</P>
<P>
   Teutonic infants, he claims, are made to sit on their lowly
thrones for hours on end, until pronounced spiffy clean, usually at
a remarkably tender age.
</P>
<P>
   Out of this early purgatory of life emerges a nation of
precision engineers obsessed with waste disposal, with an
unquenchable yearning for order and authority.
</P>
<P>
   My Jewish friend, referring me to the works of Sigmund Freud,
believes this explains everything in German history, including the
Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Ridiculous. Or so I thought until I opened Die Zeit, Germany's
most intellectual weekly. There it was: a 6,000-word essay on this
very subject.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the Holocaust for one moment. What the author wanted to
establish was whether East Germans were really susceptible to
neo-Nazi views because of the harsh potty-training regime of the
communist era. For that is what a noted Wessi (West German)
criminologist claims.
</P>
<P>
   Christian Pfeiffer, director of the Criminological Research
Institute of Lower Saxony, thinks the xenophobia permeating east
German society can be traced back to the nursery schools.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Pfeiffer had been looking into the reasons why youth
in eastern Germany are four times more likely to commit
racially-motivated crimes than their western counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   It all boils down to ``das Topfen,'' a word which exists only in
the east German dialect, a noun forged bureaucratically from the
word Topf _ ``potty.''
</P>
<P>
   It denotes the ritual of potty training, a sacred act codified
by precise instructions passed down from the Politburo. ``As soon
as the child is able to sit without help, the teacher can begin
with regular potty training,'' the official instruction manual for
nursery schools and kindergartens ordained.
</P>
<P>
   At set times, children were herded into a communal toilet and
made to sit on rows of potties. ``Potty times'' were the nurseries'
main activity, potty training the supreme goal of the institution.
</P>
<P>
   It served an ideological purpose. Through their synchronized
bowel movements, the children of the proletariat shared the
vicissitudes of life. Those who did not perform remained seated,
while the avant-garde left to play. The dunces soon caught on.
</P>
<P>
   Thus did East Germany become the country of world champion
toddlers, faster out of their cotton diapers than any other nation.

PITTSBURGH: WHERE STEEL WAS KING, A NEW SPIRIT REIGNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ One fine day this summer, wreckers toppled six
towering smokestacks along the Monongahela River.
</P>
<P>
   Once part of a huge coke works but long idle, they were the last
vestiges of Big Steel left within the Pittsburgh city limits. The
mills that once employed tens of thousands of workers and made a
third of the world's steel have vanished like ghosts at dawn. Iron
City, aka Steeltown U.S.A., is no more.
</P>
<P>
   But having survived the truly grueling loss of most of its heavy
industry, Pittsburgh is alive and well and getting better. It has
had not one renaissance but two, and a third is under way, fueled
by an intense local pride and a gritty determination to bounce
back. Two new downtown stadiums (one for baseball, the other for
football), a new theater designed by Michael Graves and a new
convention center are on the way. Designed by Rafael Vinoly, the
$231 million convention center is to have a roof in the shape of a
catenary curve; water running off the building's cooling towers
will make it glitter by day, and interior lights will set it aglow
at night.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Pittsburgh is hard at work, striving to forge
a new economic identity as a high-tech center and a regional
medical capital.
</P>
<P>
   Cultural life has a fresh elan as well, sparked partly by the
hip, innovative Andy Warhol Museum _ ``the posthumous home of the
King of Pop,'' as someone called it. The 53rd Carnegie
International, one of the world's premier surveys of contemporary
art, will open in November at the Carnegie Museum of Art with works
by 40 established and relatively unknown artists from 17 nations,
including installation art and video as well as paintings and
sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   The century-old Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, under the
energetic, Latvian-born Mariss Jansons, one of the most prominent
of the young conductors who have emerged in recent years from the
Baltic countries, will open its season this fall not with a safe
selection of Beethoven or Brahms but with Schoenberg's immense,
romantic, seldom-performed ``Gurrelieder.'' Among the soloists will
be two of the more sought-after singers of the day, the Canadian
tenor Ben Heppner and the American mezzo-soprano Jennifer Larmore.
</P>
<P>
   And of course Pittsburgh glories, as ever, in its magnificent
site, first scouted by George Washington as a British major in
1753. The city lies deep within the Allegheny Mountains, where the
Allegheny River meets the Monongahela to form the broad Ohio. Ernie
Pyle wrote once that this was a place of ``hills, mountains,
cliffs, valleys and rivers, up and down, around and around, in
betwixt,'' much better suited to goats than people.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of antique funiculars, called inclines here, still slide
up and down the steep face of Mount Washington, across the water
from the skyscrapers packed into downtown Pittsburgh at the tip of
the Golden Triangle.
</P>
<P>
   Max King, the former editor of The Philadelphia Inquirer, who
moved to Pittsburgh this year to become the executive director of
the $1.5 billion Heinz Endowments, sees a vibrancy in downtown
Pittsburgh that is lacking in Philadelphia, and with industry
having abandoned the riverfronts, he sees ``a once-in-a-lifetime
chance'' to redevelop them to public benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pittsburgh's economic troubles spared it the sprawl that is
disfiguring Philadelphia,'' he said. ``There, the hole is quickly
emptying into the doughnut; all the action is in the suburbs. But
Pittsburgh _ the city itself _ is still the center of this region,
and it's holding.''
</P>
<P>
   There are, to be sure, plenty of problems. Race relations are
not the best. Pockets of urban rot persist not only in the
burnt-out mill towns up and down the river valleys and in the slums
in the city itself, but also downtown. A tacky T-shirt store and a
wig shop stand incongruously, for example, across the street from a
new Lazarus department store.
</P>
<P>
   The jury is still out on job creation, here as in other Rust
Belt cities like Cleveland and Detroit. Pittsburgh's population is
as old as those in some Sun Belt retirement cities, because too
many of the area's most talented young people leave in search of
economic opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   A City of Amenities
</P>
<P>
   But for those who stay or move here, the amenities are many.
Leafy, close-in suburbs like Shadyside and Squirrel Hill. A low
crime rate. Good schools. Moderate housing and living costs.
Extensive parks. A terrific zoo. Three identical suspension
bridges, all painted primrose yellow, crossing the Allegheny side
by side. Three substantial universities: Carnegie Mellon, strong in
science and technology; Duquesne, known for the liberal arts and
law, and the University of Pittsburgh, a medical powerhouse where
some of the pioneering work in liver transplants was carried out.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh has its own vernacular. ``Redd'' means clean, as in
``redd off the table,'' and ``youns'' is the plural of ``you.'' It
has a certain innocence as well. Maybe, as some here complain,
Pittsburgh is provincial (or, to adopt the kinder phrase, used by
one local businessman, ``not very cosmopolitan''). But it also
lacks the edgy aggressiveness of many larger cities.
</P>
<P>
   This is, after all, the hometown of Fred Rogers, the kids'
sweet-natured friend Mr. Rogers, whose program is made at WQED, the
nation's first public television station.
</P>
<P>
   You arrive in Pittsburgh from the west, where the airport is
situated, by way of the Fort Pitt Tunnel. One minute you are
cruising along amid wooded hills, the next you are in the
half-mile-long tube, and then you emerge onto a bridge. Dead in
front of you is Pittsburgh's skyline, a sudden, dramatic,
exhilarating sight, akin to spying the New York or San Francisco
skyline from a steamship in the days before the dawn of jet travel.
</P>
<P>
   The air is clean, the rivers are bright and clear, and if the
sun is shining, John Burgee and Philip Johnson's PPG Place, the
Houses of Parliament in London transmuted into a glass office
building, catches your eye at once.
</P>
<P>
   But of course the approach didn't always look so splendid.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Determined Mayors
</P>
<P>
   It took a series of determined mayors to change the city's face,
starting in the 1950s with David Lawrence, who adopted the slogan
``Smoke Must Go.'' He and successors like Peter Flaherty and
Richard Caliguiri made common cause with business leaders, notably
Richard King Mellon.
</P>
<P>
   Rachel Carson, who grew up not far from here, would have been
proud of what they accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   In its heyday as the self-described Workshop of the World,
Pittsburgh was an industrial inferno. Only half a century ago, the
rivers teemed with tugs and barges, and the mills poured brown and
green ooze into the water and black and gray soot into the skies,
so much so that street lights often had to be kept on all day. One
week in 1948, 30 people were killed by smog in the grimy little
borough of Donora (where, incidentally, the baseball hall-of-famer
Stan Musial grew up).
</P>
<P>
   ``Blackest place I ever saw,'' said the 19th-century English
traveler Anthony Trollope, and he knew grim industrial landscapes
at home.
</P>
<P>
   But Pittsburgh produced steel in prodigious quantities. At the
end of World War II, United States Steel, the first billion-dollar
corporation in history when it was formed in 1901, made twice as
much steel as the entire Soviet Union. Set against that, what was a
little pollution?
</P>
<P>
   Enormous Fortunes
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh also produced enormous fortunes for men like Andrew
Carnegie, an immigrant from Scotland who built a steel empire;
Henry Clay Frick, the king of coke, the baked coal essential to the
steel-making process, who was first an aide and then a rival to
Carnegie, and Andrew Mellon, the banker who financed the new
magnates and grew rich in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Mellon money built the National Gallery in Washington, and when
Andrew Mellon's son, Paul, died this year at the age of 91, he had
given it more than 1,000 pictures, including two van Goghs and 12
Winslow Homers in a final bequest, as well as $75 million in cash.
Frick money built New York's finest small art museum. Carnegie
money built libraries around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Only small fractions of their wealth stayed in Pittsburgh,
though their names grace monuments, buildings, parks, streets and
museums.
</P>
<P>
   To work in the mills, peasants came from all over Europe. A sign
from one Carnegie plant, preserved in the excellent (if clumsily
named) John Heinz Pittsburgh Regional History Center, warned of
danger in English, Italian, Hungarian, Slovak and Serbo-Croatian.
My great-grandfather was one of those hardy spirits, and his son,
my grandfather, worked in nearby Jeanette, which was for some time
the center of the American glass industry. My father was born
there.
</P>
<P>
   Myths grew up about industrial Bunyans like Joe Magarac, a
Hungarian who could derail a locomotive with his little finger, and
Steve Mestrovic, a Serb who could supposedly twist a 500-pound
steel bar into a pretzel. In real life, the tough river towns where
the immigrants settled produced more than their share of sports
heroes, especially pro football quarterbacks, including Johnny
Unitas, Joe Montana, Jim Kelly, Joe Namath and George Blanda.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh quickly became a battleground between labor and
capital. In the notorious Homestead strike of 1892, Pinkerton
detectives employed by Frick clashed with workers; 20 people were
killed and 300 wounded. The Amalgamated Association of Iron and
Steel Workers was crushed. Industry won the battle, but labor won
the war, decades later, when Philip Murray organized the United
Steel Workers Union. Now plans are afoot to bring the site of the
strike and other steel-industry landmarks under the aegis of the
National Park Service.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks streamed into Pittsburgh as well, and soon built a
thriving subculture. The Pittsburgh Courier was the nation's
leading African-American newspaper, and the city produced a
seemingly endless flow of jazz stars, from Billy Strayhorn to
Erroll Garner to Mary Lou Williams. Before the integration of major
league baseball, the Pittsburgh Crawfords and the Homestead Grays
flourished on the black circuit with players like Josh Gibson and
the inimitable Satchel Paige.
</P>
<P>
   Sports still loom large here, as befits the city's six-pack
image, though the relatively small population (350,000, with
1,335,000 in Allegheny County) makes supporting big-league teams
difficult. The Pittsburgh Penguins, twice National Hockey League
champions in recent years, were faced with bankruptcy until a judge
approved a plan under which Mario Lemieux, the team's greatest star
until he retired in 1997, took control of the team.
</P>
<P>
   Legends live on, like Pirates infielder Bill Mazeroski's
improbable last-of-the-ninth home run to beat the Yankees, 10-9, in
the seventh game of the 1960 World Series, and Steelers running
back Franco Harris' ``immaculate reception'' of Terry Bradshaw's
deflected last-gasp pass to win a crucial playoff game in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Architectural Highlights
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh is rediscovering its significant architectural
heritage and urging visitors to do the same. Southwestern
Pennsylvania has two of the very greatest American buildings, Henry
Hobson Richardson's Allegheny County Courthouse and Jail, in
Pittsburgh, and Frank Lloyd Wright's wonderful cantilevered country
villa, Fallingwater, an hour to the southeast.
</P>
<P>
   Fallingwater was built for Pittsburgh merchant Edgar Kaufmann,
who cooked up a number of other projects, most of them never built,
with the master of Taliesen. Plans and models can be seen in a show
at the Carnegie Museum through Aug. 27.
</P>
<P>
   The courthouse _ a great castlelike structure of rusticated
granite, with a 325-foot tower _ is connected to the jail by a
Bridge of Sighs like the one that links the Doge's Palace and the
jail in Venice. It is a massive, masculine ensemble; the voussoirs,
or blocks, that form the main entrance, one of Richardson's
trademark Romanesque arches, are eight feet long. Yet there is
nothing clumsy or heavy about the structure.

WHEN SPARKS FLY BETWEEN FILM COUPLES, YOU DON'T NEED AN A+ SCRIPT
FOR SUCCESS
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by COUPLES-LIST) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This weekend, Paramount Pictures is taking a gamble that will
probably pay off. The studio is betting that even though it's been
nearly 10 years since ``Pretty Woman,'' audiences will remember how
fondly they responded to the teaming of Julia Roberts and Richard
Gere, and watch the duo's reunion in ``Runaway Bride.''
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that Roberts and Gere have starred in only one
picture together. ``Bride,'' which opens Friday, is likely to
steamroller that fact and any other obstacle in its way. It'll plow
through Gere's spotty track record in '90s movies, and it'll run
over the way Roberts' offscreen life has been more interesting than
many of her films.
</P>
<P>
   It won't matter that ``Bride'' is, to be kind, haphazardly
written _ from its unrealistic portrayal of Gere's USA Today
columnist to its use of eggs as personality-defining objects _ or
that ``Woman'' director Garry Marshall films ``Bride'' in a style
that's as obsessed with cuteness as a rack of Hallmark cards.
</P>
<P>
   Quality's not the point here; chemistry is. And Gere and Roberts
generated enough chemistry in ``Pretty Woman'' that their teaming
is being touted as the reunion of one of the screen's favorite
romantic couples, putting them in a league with William Powell and
Myrna Loy, Rock Hudson and Doris Day, and Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan.
For fans of ``Woman,'' the reunion of Gere and Roberts will
generate a lot of good will, and that tends to makes audiences
forgive _ or not even notice _ many of a film's flaws.
</P>
<P>
   Romantic teams in movies and TV aren't always saddled with
faulty material, of course; Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn's
movies were of consistently high quality, and Michael Douglas and
Kathleen Turner were served well in the three '80s movies they made
together. But when a script is mediocre, star chemistry can save
it.
</P>
<P>
   It worked for Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan in two movies, the
underwritten ``Sleepless in Seattle'' and the overwritten ``You've
Got Mail''; Hanks' all-American boy and Ryan's perky girl next door
go so well together, it's easy to ignore the morose qualities of
``Sleepless'' and the forced cleverness of ``Mail.''
</P>
<P>
   But there wasn't much Hanks or Ryan could do for the dreary
``Joe vs. the Volcano,'' despite Ryan giving one of her most
interesting performances in a triple role.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their flaws, ``Sleepless'' and ``Mail'' were better
movies than ``Runaway Bride,'' but they still relied more on charm
than depth, and hung their hopes on their star pairing. It was a
wise move, as both were hits and had enough resonance that Hanks
and Ryan are serious contenders for big-screen couple of the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   That title could have gone to David Duchovny and Gillian
Anderson, if only they had made more movies. As the stars of ``The
X-Files,'' the duo has been blessed with a wealth of well-written
material. And when ``Files''' writing sags, the combination of
Duchovny's laconic deadpan and Anderson's steel-eyed earnestness
carries the show.
</P>
<P>
   Chemistry like theirs is important in the world of TV, where
even quality shows suffer from the occasional clunky script simply
because of the volume of material being churned out. When you
invite couples into your living room every week, it helps to like
them, and TV has an advantage over movies in that series have more
time to fix their problems and watch their characters grow.
</P>
<P>
   A good example is ``Friends,'' a 5-year-old sitcom that found
new life this past season by pairing Courteney Cox's Monica and
Matthew Perry's Chandler, who actually seemed to be enjoying their
onscreen romance. It was a switch from the mopey bickering that
marked the romance of Ross (David Schwimmer) and Rachel (Jennifer
Aniston). After a promising start, their relationship bogged down
the show, largely because his whininess didn't play well off of her
flaky energy. But the pairing of the relatively grounded Monica
with the wisecracking but insecure Chandler helped the show's
writers bring its scripts to new levels.
</P>
<P>
   TV has all but taken over the idea of serial romantic teams,
from Lucy and Desi in the '50s to ``NYPD Blue's'' Bobby and Diane
in the '90s, and perhaps it's because of TV's ability to spend time
developing its characters. Screen teams, once a staple of the
movies in the days of Bogart &AMP; Bacall and Astaire &AMP; Rogers, have
become increasingly rare. More often than not these days, the
screen teams are male-male couples such as Danny Glover and Mel
Gibson or the eternal Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau. Pairings like
Gere and Roberts or Hanks and Ryan fill a void, which is why
audiences will ignore anything critics have to say about ``Bride''
and turn it into a huge hit.

 PITTSBURGH: the structure.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Richardson whets your appetite for more, walk down Grant
Street. On the way you will see Frick's Union Trust Building
(1915), with a breathtaking stack of nine balconies, crowned by a
round stained-glass skylight, and a froth of terra-cotta turrets,
balustrades, pinnacles and balustrades on the roof; the Koppers
Building (1929), in an urbane Art Deco style, and the USX Building
(1970), a bold tower in Cor-Ten steel, which oxidizes to a deep
red-brown, protecting against deterioration.
</P>
<P>
   The USX Building, by Harrison &AMP; Abramovitz, looks much less
dated than the slightly earlier buildings from the same hands, New
York's Metropolitan Opera House and Avery Fisher Hall at Lincoln
Center. Its exoskeleton of vertical beams is filled with water and
antifreeze as a fire retardant.
</P>
<P>
   In a real sense the USX Building is a continuing advertisement
for the company that built it, once named U.S. Steel. So is the
former Alcoa Building (1953), nearby on Sixth Avenue, whose skin is
formed of preformed aluminum panels, and the glass-faced PPG Place
(1984), on Third Avenue, which was built by a company formerly
called Pittsburgh Plate Glass.
</P>
<P>
   A Cultural Catalyst
</P>
<P>
   No family has done more for Pittsburgh, especially for the arts
in Pittsburgh, than the Heinzes, purveyors to the world of 57
Varieties _ actually, today, more like 5,700. It was H.J. Heinz II,
known as Jack, who had the idea that cultural resources could aid
in jump-starting an economic revival here. He bought four abandoned
movie theaters dowltown and helped turn them into the Cultural
District, anchored by Heinz Hall, home to the Symphony.
</P>
<P>
   Fritz Reiner, William Steinberg, Andre Previn and Lorin Maazel
all helped to mold the orchestra's global reputation, but Heinz
dollars balanced the organization's budget. Without them, as Gideon
Toeplitz, the managing director, said several years ago, Pittsburgh
would have ``a small regional orchestra rather like the Wheeling
Symphony just down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   In December, the new home of the Pittsburgh Public Theater will
open across the street from Heinz Hall with a world premiere of a
play by August Wilson, a Pittsburgh native. Designed by Michael
Graves, with a great copper cowl giving its facade a distinctive
appearance, it has a Heinz connection, too. It was partly financed
by the friends of, and named for, Anthony J.F. O'Reilly, H.J. Heinz
Co.'s 's Irish-born chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Next door will stand a fountain designed by Louise Bourgeois.
</P>
<P>
   Drama is a many-layered thing in Pittsburgh. Apart from the
Public Theater and the musicals that also play in the Cultural
District, there are the venturesome City Theater on the South Side
and Karla Boos' lively Quantum Theater, which performs in spaces
either discovered or improvised.
</P>
<P>
   Neither opera nor dance is big-league yet, but the city has an
amazing number of dance organizations, large and small. The most
prominent is the Pittsburgh Ballet Theater, whose artistic
director, Terrence Orr, has steered it away from the Balanchine
tradition toward that of his alma mater, American Ballet Theater.
</P>
<P>
   The Phipps Botanical Gardens, an 1893 gift from Henry Phipps,
one of Carnegie's sidekicks, has a 13-room Victorian conservatory,
one of the finest in the country. And the Frick Art Museum, a
country cousin of the New York showplace, exhibits the collection
of Henry Clay Frick's daughter, Helen; its highlights are a
magisterial Rubens portrait and works by the Sienese masters Duccio
and Sassetta.
</P>
<P>
   Bones and Art
</P>
<P>
   But the heaviest hitters here, in addition to the Symphony, are
the Carnegie and Warhol museums.
</P>
<P>
   The Carnegie complex, in Oakland, east of downtown, includes a
museum of natural history, renowned for its dinosaur collection, as
well as the art museum, headquarters for the International, whose
curator this year is Madeleine Grynsztejn. Since its beginning, the
art museum has concentrated on the art of the 19th and 20th
centuries _ ``the Old Masters of tomorrow,'' as Carnegie himself
put it.
</P>
<P>
   Paintings, sculpture and the decorative arts are intermingled to
good effect in galleries occupied by the permanent collection.
Take, for instance, the room devoted to the Arts and Crafts
Movement; there, furniture by C.F.A. Voysey and Harvey Ellis and
copperware by W.A.S. Benson keep company with two huge, newly
acquired Pre-Raphaelite canvases by Burne-Jones.
</P>
<P>
   First-rate pictures by the likes of Cezanne, Kirchner and Degas
(a smashing portrait of the engineer Henri Rouart) lie ahead. But
most intriguing to me was a selection of pioneer American
abstractionists like Burgoyne Diller, George L.K. Morris and
Stanton Macdonald-Wright.
</P>
<P>
   Over at the Warhol, installed in an old seven-story building
renovated by the New York architect Richard Gluckman, you are
greeted by a big cobalt-blue self-portrait of the artist,
wide-eyed, spiky-haired. The building is filled with Warhol's
collections (milk glass, shoes famous people); Warhol's wallpaper
(I liked the pink-and-yellow cow pattern); Warhol's films; Warhol's
portraits of Mao, Liz and Mick; Warhol's books and Warhol's
archives _ 605 identical boxes filled with everything from the
master pack rat's mail to the original images on which he based his
famous silk screens.
</P>
<P>
   A Pittsburgh native whose parents came from the Carpathian
Mountains in central Europe, Warhol once wrote: ``You live in your
dream America that you've custom-made from art and schmaltz and
emotions just as much as you live in your real one.'' The museum is
Andy's world, custom-recreated.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh has taken to it slowly; Thomas Sokolowski, the
director, says, ``It's a sober city, very Presbyterian.'' Of the
65,000 visitors to the museum last year, half came from out of
state, many from Japan and Germany. But Sokolowski keeps plugging.
He has started a Friday happy hour and has big plans for musical
events, including a staging of the Satie-Poulenc-Ravel triple bill
``Parade,'' as big a scandal in its day as Warhol in his.

<P>
   Here is a short list of popular romantic couples through the
decades, and what made them work:
</P>
<P>
   1930s: William Powell and Myrna Loy. Usually, on-screen
chemistry is a matter of clashing styles, but not in the case of
Powell and Loy, who matched each other in sophistication and
repartee in the Thin Man series. Essential movie: ``The Thin Man.''
</P>
<P>
   1940s: Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall. It shouldn't have
worked; Bogart was short and ugly, Bacall sounded like a man, and
their age difference was more than 20 years. But it did, because
Bacall never seemed threatened by Bogart's tough-guy cynicism.
Essential movie: ``To Have and Have Not.''
</P>
<P>
   1950s: Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy. Although they
started in the '40s and worked together in the '60s, Hepburn and
Tracy did the bulk of their best work together in this decade, when
her feisty crackle taught his befuddled curmudgeon a thing or two
about male-female relationships. Essential movie: ``Adam's Rib.''
</P>
<P>
   1960s: Rock Hudson and Doris Day. They really didn't make that
many films together, but the combination of his sensitive hunkiness
and her freckle-faced wholesomeness created a spark that made them
minor romantic-comedy icons. Essential movie: ``Pillow Talk.''
</P>
<P>
   1970s: Woody Allen and Diane Keaton. Until he hooked up with
Soon-Yi Previn, Allen had a way of casting his off-screen loves in
his movies. Keaton was the only one who could hold her own with
him. Her beguiling kookiness was the perfect foil for his uptight
neuroses. Essential movie: ``Annie Hall.''
</P>
<P>
   1980s: Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner. They only made three
movies together, pairing his long-suffering alpha male with her
strong-willed adventurer. Their strongest work, however, came in
``The War of the Roses,'' which detailed the disintegration of a
marriage in one of the screen's darkest comedies, all the more dark
because they seemed made for each other. Essential film: ``War of
the Roses'' (duh).
</P>
<P>
   1990s: Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan. They've also made three movies
together, and one _ ``Joe vs. the Volcano'' _ was barely watchable.
But although they've done their most interesting work apart,
something special happens when his boy-next-door earnestness gets
together with her girl-next-door perkiness. Essential film:
``Sleepless in Seattle.''

   Enjoying Pittsburgh
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh is 365 miles southwest of New York City. Here is a
sampling of attractions and places to stay and eat in the area,
along with travel information:
</P>
<P>
   Where to Stay
</P>
<P>
   DOUBLETREE HOTEL, 1000 Penn Ave., (412) 281-3700. Renovated only
this year, the Doubletree is Pittsburgh's freshest hotel, with a
light-filled, four-story atrium lobby. Theaters are just a couple
of blocks away, and an enclosed walkway leads to the convention
center. Though pretty prosaic, the rooms are a good deal roomier
than the chain hotel standard. Double rooms: $189 weekdays; $119 to
$189 weekends.
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH HILTON, Gateway Center, (412) 391-4600. In a city
that woefully lacks a top-drawer hotel, the Hilton is blessed with
those three cardinal virtues: location, location and location.
Overlooking the junction of the Allegheny and Monongahela, with 711
rooms and 38 suites, it is a convention hotel par excellence, with
all the pluses and minuses that go with that. The crisp, smallish,
up-to-date rooms on the top floors are the best. Double rooms: $199
to $250.
</P>
<P>
   SUNNYLEDGE, 5124 Fifth Ave., Shadyside, (412) 683-5014. Oakland
once had a pair of fine big hotels, the Schenley and Webster Hall.
Both are long gone, alas, but this eight-room red-brick inn
provides a classy refuge for visitors to the universities and the
museums. All mod cons: minibars, cable television, Jacuzzi tubs,
hair dryers and Frette linens. Double rooms: $199 to $189; suites,
$275.
</P>
<P>
   WESTIN WILLIAM PENN, 530 William Penn Place, (412) 281-7100.
Henry Clay Frick built this Beaux-Arts pile to house his business
friends when they came to town. After countless face lifts, the old
girl is handsome enough, with enormous crystal chandeliers in the
Palm Court. But the service is disheartening, with breakfast cards
sometimes left dangling on doorknobs, unfilled, and desultory
delivery of baggage and messages. Today's nabobs send their
visitors down the street to the veddy private Duquesne Club. Double
rooms: $169 to $229, weekdays; $99 to $169, weekends.
</P>
<P>
   Where to Eat
</P>
<P>
   CAFE ALLEGRO, 51 S. 12th St., (412) 481-7788. The cooking is a
tad uneven at this relaxed spot next to the 1915 South Side Market
House, just off post-industrial Carson Street; one night recently,
the veal chop was tasty and sweet seared scallops were nicely mated
with a tangy tangerine-juice reduction, but smoked trout was too
dry and soft-shell were crabs overcooked. Still, the spirit is
willing; baffled at first by a request for cheese at meal's end,
the kitchen quickly improvised an appealing assortment.
</P>
<P>
   CASBAH, 229 S. Highland Ave., Shadyside, (412) 661-5656. This is
the lead restaurant of an entrepreneurial duo who call themselves
Big Burrito Inc. The menu is Mediterranean: tagines from Morocco,
fearlessly fiery merguez sausage from Tunisia, pasta, a dense
ragout of lamb with couscous. Flavors are as emphatic as a smack in
the chops. Terrific wines, especially the Rhones, and a sultry,
sand-colored decor with hanging lamps reminiscent of Venice and
Fortuny.
</P>
<P>
   STEELHEAD GRILL, 112 Washington Place, (412) 394-3474. An
outpost of Drew Nieporent's empire (and hence a sibling of New
York's Tribeca Grill and Nobu), this is the city's top table, for
my money. Greg Alauzen, a hometown boy, concocts a shellfish
chowder that would delight any Down Easter, and serves skillfully
grilled shrimp on a bed of linguine with a rich basil-lemon sauce.
The wines are chosen by the savvy Daniel Johnnes of Montrachet.
</P>
<P>
   TESSARO'S, 4601 Liberty Ave., Bloomfield, (412) 682-6809. You're
tired of beurre blanc and balsamic vinegar and waiters named Clyde.
You need a joint with no attitude. In Pittsburgh, Tessaro's fills
the bill perfectly: a bar in a working-class neighborhood with Sam
Adams on draft, decadently juicy half-pound burgers cooked on a
hardwood grill, and plenty of good cheer. No french fries, no
dessert, no reservations, just sensational meat.
</P>
<P>
   LA CUCINA FLEGREA, 2114 Murray Ave., Squirrel Hill, (412)
521-2082. The room is plain and tiny, but the minute you walk in,
you know you're in the right place. It smells Italian, not
Italian-American. Anna Fevola comes from a village north of Naples,
and her cooking has that superbly unadorned clarity of flavor we
all long for. Order the grilled sausage, with charred edges, served
underneath a blanket of bitter rapini. BYOB.
</P>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE HAUNTING &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Liam Neeson, Lili Taylor, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Owen Wilson,
Bruce Dern, Marian Seldes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Jan De Bont &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PG-13 117 minutes
</P>
<P>
   The ad in the paper calls for insomniacs to participate in a
study of sleep disorders, but as the project director, Dr. David
Marrow (Neeson), puts it, what he's really after are several
narcissistic types with low self-esteem to be guinea pigs in his
research on fear and hysteria.
</P>
<P>
   Three applicants are selected and told to report to Hill House,
a menacingly convoluted old pile in the Berkshires. The most
flamboyant of the trio, Theo (Ms. Zeta-Jones), is a woman of many
affairs (bisexual) and a natural foil for the noble Nell (Ms.
Taylor), who makes a career of getting kicked around by abusive
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The third specimen, Luke ( Wilson), is a young man of no
apparent distinction other than his quickness with a quip.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the house. Old man Crain, a textile baron, started
construction 130 years ago and now glowers down from a huge,
unflattering portrait dominating the cavernous central hall. When
life didn't pan out as he envisioned, Crain became a recluse, madly
adding rooms and, it is learned later, doing twisted things to
children who slaved in his factories and were brought to the house
for a ghastly end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get a real strong sleep high from this place,'' Luke
observes early on. That's because a large and virulent
netherworldly presence rumbles and snuffles about, battering doors,
dislodging beams, cracking plaster and waking the dead, who emerge
from cherubic carvings to waft about in the form of Crain's young
victims.
</P>
<P>
   Within a night or so, Marrow, who picked the house for these
very properties, realizes that he has a little more than he can
handle in the fear and hysteria department. Only Nell, who connects
with the spirits, can save them now.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE The worst behavior is exhibited by the house itself,
which sprouts spectral faces and fists from walls and ceilings and
creaks and rocks about like a ship at sea. As for bodily violence,
one head is lost and a small amount of blood spilled in a film that
is filled with latent violence throughout. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX Theo sashays and flirts a bit with Nell, but there's nothing
too sexy about the Hill House situation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY Some but not much. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 3-8 Way too frightening for many young children (though
some would be highly entertained). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 9-11 Parents know their children, but by now many can
handle the scary stuff and they'll find the movie spooky and fun. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 12 AND UP They should be fine. But by now viewers might
sense an unintended comedic flavor to some of the goings-on, which
could make the film seem a trifle foolish, especially to older
teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   DROP DEAD GORGEOUS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kirsten Dunst, Kirstie Alley, Denise Richards, Allison Janney,
Ellen Barkin &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Michael Patrick Jann &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PG-13 97 minutes
</P>
<P>
   In a very tired scenario, Jann's film sends a documentary crew
to Mount Rose, Minn., to record a teen-age beauty pageant. The
odds-on favorite is Becky Leeman (Ms. Richards), daughter of the
local furniture merchant, a contestant brimming with patriotism,
religious fervor and phony self-effacement. Besides, as someone
points out, she's the richest girl in a small town.
</P>
<P>
   Becky's major competition is Amber Atkins (Ms. Dunst), who lives
in a trailer and practices tap dancing while working at the funeral
parlor. Other than the local nymphomaniac, the rest of the field
seems virtually retarded. One of the judges actually is retarded,
with the others ranging from dim to perverted.
</P>
<P>
   Becky can't abide the thought of losing, nor can her mother,
Gladys (Ms. Alley), a strident former pageant winner and chairwoman
of the event. To say that either of them would kill for the crown
is no exaggeration. Various mishaps befall Amber and those
associated with her, including a football player who is shot dead
by a sniper (not to point fingers, but Becky is president of the
Lutheran Sisterhood Gun Club).
</P>
<P>
   With her candidacy consistently sabotaged, Amber taps on, even
after the trailer burns down and the costume for her routine is
ruled obscene. The pageant proceeds, with all the girls preening
and strutting and doing plenty of vomiting (a Hollywood obsession
and a must in a movie of this ilk) after partaking of tainted
seafood. Is winning merely everything, or is it the only thing?
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE This is a spoof and clearly so, but arson and murder
are arson and murder.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX One contestant is continually making out with her boyfriend
and Gladys casts a longing eye at a hunky schoolboy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY No torrent of profanity, just a stream. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 3-9 In no way should this be construed as a movie suitable
for small children. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 10-13 Parents could well veto the film on grounds of taste,
but children will press to attend.
</P>
<P>
   INSPECTOR GADGET &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Broderick, Rupert Everett, Joely Fisher, Michelle
Trachtenberg &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Directed by David Kellogg &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PG 85 minutes
</P>
<P>
   When John Brown (Broderick), a nice security guard, gets more or
less killed in an altercation with a smirking son of Satan named
Sanford Scolex (Everett), what's left of him is outfitted with
implements one would come across at Home Depot. Utter the correct
verbal command and the new Brown, rechristened Inspector Gadget,
can turn himself into a power drill perhaps, or a walking
stepladder.
</P>
<P>
   Such a contraption is naturally of value to local law officials,
though the police chief (Dabney Coleman) resists robotization on
his force. Put together by Dr. Brenda Bradford (Ms. Fisher), with
whom Brown-Gadget remains smitten throughout his makeover, the
inspector becomes a one-man hardware store in the struggle against
Scolex, who has stolen a mechanized foot and plans world
domination.
</P>
<P>
   On it goes. Gadget is provided with a supercar powered by a
talking computer with attitude (the voice of D.L. Hughley) and
loaded with popular food and drink. Faster than a speeding product
endorsement, Scolex manufactures a replica of Gadget, called
Robogadget (also Broderick), a pyromaniac who walks the streets
like Godzilla and has clacking teeth. Fortunately, Gadget squirts
toothpaste.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE Solid mayhem but strictly silly. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX Some glancing references, but mild. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY None. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 3-6 This may not be ideal fare for the littlest ones, but
Broderick has gentle, winning ways and the villainy isn't too
scary. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 7-10 Just right. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 11 AND UP Starting to attend movies with friends, many
pre-teen-agers bid farewell to PG movies. Gadget will still appeal
to some, but turn off others.

SPOTLIGHT ON A NEW ALBUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ANN POWERS

<TEXT>
<P>
   LEN: ``You Can't Stop the Bum Rush'' (The Work Group). Rock is
bouncing back from the doldrums, with artists like Limp Bizkit and
Kid Rock scoring mass adulation. But those bad boys are giving a
nasty reputation to the blend of hip-hop and punk galvanizing the
renewal.
</P>
<P>
   Woodstock's fires illuminate only one aspect of this important
juncture. Others are more promising than menacing.
</P>
<P>
   Len, whose frisky song ``Steal My Sunshine'' is this summer's
emblematic hit, advocates looting _ but this Toronto-based bunch
prefers the friendly, cultural kind. Len is eclectic to a fault,
blending rap with all kinds of pop and rock. A lightsome touch
saves the band from getting buried in its own musical diversity.
</P>
<P>
   Led by the siblings Marc and Sharon Costanzo, Len began in 1990
as a pop-punk band. Traces of that past remain on ``You Can't Stop
the Bum Rush.'' The band's probable next single, ``Feelin'
Alright,'' boasts a crunchy riff by the hair-metal guitar god C.C.
DeVille and a cathartic lyric reminiscent of the Offspring.
</P>
<P>
   Hyperactive emotions are only one ingredient in an album that
surveys trends from old-school rap revivalism to German techno
tributes, turntable artistry, 1960s candy pop, and even a
gospel-inspired blockbuster ballad.
</P>
<P>
   Len merrily acknowledges its kleptomania by sharing the
spotlight with its heroes Kurtis Blow and Biz Markie, whose human
beatbox propels ``Man of the Year.''
</P>
<P>
   And by turning out charming spirit-lifters like ``Steal My
Sunshine,'' Len shows that musical thieves can work like Robin
Hood, stealing from music's history to enrich the here and now.

ALICE RIVLIN REFLECTS ON FED, OTHER GOVERNMENT POSTS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Aug. 1.)  (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In 1953 Harvard University's public affairs school
told Alice Rivlin that women need not apply.
</P>
<P>
   Today Rivlin laughs as she recalls the incident _ perhaps
because in the decades since then she has held high-profile
government posts that most Harvard graduates can only dream of
having.
</P>
<P>
   She has been:
</P>
<P>
   _Vice chairman of the Federal Reserve from 1996 until last
month.
</P>
<P>
   _Deputy director and then director of the White House's Office
of Management and Budget (OMB) from 1993 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
   _Head of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), which she
created, from 1975 to 1983.
</P>
<P>
   _Assistant secretary for planning and evaluation at the then
Department of Health, Education and Welfare in 1968 and 1969.
</P>
<P>
   _Chairman of the Washington, D.C., Financial Control Board since
last September.
</P>
<P>
   Rivlin, reflecting on her years of public service, said in an
interview last week that her favorite job was running the CBO,
which determines how much all those bills that lawmakers propose
will actually cost. ``We got to design a new government agency,''
she said. ``It was very, very challenging and difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Her next-favorite post was at the Fed's Board of Governors,
which she described as a calm oasis compared with the White House's
OMB. That, she said, is the ``crossroads of government.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is probably the most pressuring job in government,'' she
added. ``Just about everything in the government goes through
OMB.'' Not only does the agency put together the president's annual
federal budget, but it also handles regulatory changes proposed by
government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the kind of job that no human being can ever feel that he
or she is doing well,'' Rivlin said. ``You are always trying to
catch up.''
</P>
<P>
   A big part of the OMB job is negotiating with Congress on behalf
of the White House. Rivlin held the post during the height of
budget battles between President Clinton and the
Republican-controlled Congress when parts of the federal government
shut down in 1995 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   When she moved to the No. 2 spot at the Fed, Rivlin recalled,
she was surprised at ``how civilized it was after the chaos of the
White House. Decision-making was quite deliberate, meetings started
on time and people were called on in turn.''
</P>
<P>
   As Fed vice chairman, she, Chairman Alan Greenspan and the rest
of the seven-member board _ along with the 12 presidents of the
Fed's regional banks _ periodically considered raising or lowering
interest rates in order to keep the U.S. economy stable. That
19-member group, called the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC),
meets eight times a year. Last year it cut rates three times.
</P>
<P>
   But monetary policy, which gets the most publicity, takes up
only a quarter of the Fed's time, she said. Mostly, the job
involves setting U.S. bank regulations and attending academic and
banking conferences.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the publicity that Greenspan gets, Rivlin insisted
that economic decisions are made by the entire FOMC and not solely
the chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a go-around-the-table in which everybody says what
they think is happening out there,'' Rivlin said. ``Greenspan is
the last to speak. He listens to all that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivlin said the 12 regional Fed presidents are key to the Fed's
decision-making, especially in deciding whether to raise, lower or
leave interest rates steady. ``They interact with the business,
banking, agriculture communities where they are from,'' she
explained.
</P>
<P>
   While Rivlin was at the Fed, she picked up another demanding job
as chairman of Washington, D.C.'s control board.
</P>
<P>
   It had been created by Congress in 1995 to run the city's
finances, schools and other government functions during the reign
of then Mayor Marion Barry, who presided over a near financial
collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Under Rivlin's chairmanship, however, the control board returned
most of the day-to-day activities to the new mayor, Anthony
Williams, and city council. The board still oversees the city's
budget.
</P>
<P>
   After almost a year of two jobs, Rivlin wanted to spend more
time with her husband, Sidney G. Winter, who teaches part of each
week in Philadelphia at the Wharton School of Business.
</P>
<P>
   So she is now settling in at the Brookings Institution, a
Washington-based think-tank where she will study and write about
urban policy and economics. One study will cover why U.S.
businesses have become more productive.
</P>
<P>
   Rivlin calls Brookings her ``home room'' because she has
returned to the research organization between government
assignments. In fact, she started her career there in 1957 while
she was finishing her doctorate at Radcliffe College, which was
then Harvard's school for women.
</P>
<P>
   Now she thinks she will stay at Brookings for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 68,'' Rivlin said. ``I'm not looking for any more big
positions.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ One might have thought that all the European period
instrument ensembles that have become stars on recordings over the
last couple of decades had already visited New York, where
appetites for early-music recordings are healthy, and indigenous
competition, while formidable, is not overabundant.
</P>
<P>
   But there are pleasures still to be sampled. Philip Pickett, a
recorder player and one of the most imaginative early-music
directors working in Britain, is just now getting around to
performing in New York with the New London Consort, the ensemble he
founded in 1976. The group is to make its U.S. debut in a Mostly
Mozart concert Sunday afternoon at Alice Tully Hall.
</P>
<P>
   What took so long?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to answer that,'' Pickett said. ``We didn't have a
U.S. agent, and when one got interested, we were offered a terrible
deal. We could come the first time for nothing and spend a few
weeks on buses and planes going nowhere in particular. And we had
so much work to do in Europe and other parts of the world that it
just didn't seem worth behaving like students again.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most ensembles of its kind, the New London Consort is a
flexible group with a roster that expands and contracts as the
musical needs demand, and those needs vary widely. The group's
repertory begins with 12th-century works for small ensembles and
runs through the chamber orchestra repertory of the 18th century.
</P>
<P>
   For about half of BBC television's Shakespeare productions since
the 1980s, Pickett and company have provided the music, sometimes
on camera. They also have performed on a few film soundtracks,
including ``Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves.'' Over the last decade,
Pickett has led his ensemble in a growing collection of superb
recordings for Decca and its early-music imprint, L'Oiseau-Lyre,
and for the independent Linn label.
</P>
<P>
   For the consort's Mostly Mozart appearance, Pickett has put
together a program devoted mostly to 17th- and 18th-century English
theater music. The works of lesser-known composers like Matthew
Locke, Giovanni Battista Draghi and John Blow will be heard beside
those of their more famous contemporaries, Purcell and Handel, with
a paean to Shakespeare, composed in 1776 by Thomas Linley Jr., as
the finale.
</P>
<P>
   Pickett has always been one for making provocative assertions,
and this constellation of composers will allow him to test one of
them. In Pickett's view, the 20th-century notion that Purcell was
the greatest 17th-century English composer _ ``modern Purcell
worship,'' as he puts it _ is all wrong, and prevents us from
understanding the era and the way its composers worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``To think in terms of individual achievement is misleading,''
he writes in his program notes. ``A corporate style with individual
mannerisms would be nearer the mark.''
</P>
<P>
   Elaborating on this theme in a telephone interview from his home
in London, Pickett speculated on why Purcell has become a symbol of
the era while composers like Blow, wh was Purcell's teacher, are
known mainly to specialists and collectors of early-music
recordings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think mainly it's because we never get to hear performances
of the other chaps. Or if we do, they're always low-budget
productions. The real money gets spent on Purcell, and that's
important. If some music college presents a work by Matthew Locke,
because it's more interesting for the students _ there's more for
them to do _ nobody takes any interest at all. So I'm definitely up
for championing some of these other guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, I think Purcell is quite straightforward. We have a
tradition of performing Purcell, so people tend to understand
what's going on. But music by people like Draghi, Locke and even
John Blow can be very tough. A performer has to be aware of
symbolism, characterization and allegory, and then be able to
project those things. When they do get those things right, and put
them forward in a performance, I think John Blow's music can be as
moving, touching and convincing as any piece of Purcell's.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why in some ways I prefer Blow's `Venus and Adonis' to
Purcell's `Dido.' I feel it's a much more personal, heartfelt
statement. `Dido' is great art. But when you understand the Blow,
it hits you in the chest in a way that `Dido' never has.''
</P>
<P>
   Excerpts from both works are included on the consort's program.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But Pickett added that modern audiences have never heard ``Dido
and Aeneas'' the way Purcell meant it to sound, despite a
burgeoning catalog of period-instrument recordings of the work. In
particular, he said, few performers have devoted much study to
Purcell's time signatures _ the numerical indications of how many
beats are in a bar of music, and which kind of note is used as the
basis for counting those beats _ which he considers crucial to the
work's dramatic and emotional structure.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't use the same kind of time signatures that we do,''
he said of Purcell and his contemporaries, explaining that they
were more precise about relationships between tempos than today's
musicians. ``I have performed `Dido' with very careful attention to
these details, and the performance sounded rather unusual because
all the tempi were completely different to everybody else's. But I
felt it had much more impact dramatically and was much more
sensible. Implied or projected states of emotion were suddenly very
different when played at different tempi. These composers knew what
they were doing. It's just that we are so far from them that we've
lost a lot of the plot.''
</P>
<P>
   Pickett said he had no immediate plans to record his
reconsideration of ``Dido and Aeneas.'' At Mostly Mozart, he is
offering Dido's famous Lament. Because only a single selection will
be performed, listeners won't be able to hear how Pickett's tempos
work. But the performance will differ from most period-instrument
readings in that it will be accompanied by strings only, without
the harpsichord or lute continuo that has become standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of a long tradition of laments, which goes right
back into the Renaissance,'' he said. ``They were always
accompanied by violas da gamba, with very low string parts to imply
the depression of the soul. So you shouldn't have harpsichords or
lutes clattering around.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There is more Purcell on the program _ selections from ``The
Indian Queen'' and ``Timon of Athens'' _ as well as music from a
17th-century production of ``The Tempest'' that was long attributed
to Purcell, but is now believed to be by an unknown contemporary.
</P>
<P>
   Locke, who Pickett believes was a strong influence on Purcell,
and Draghi, Locke's sometime collaborator, are to be represented by
selections from ``Psyche,'' a work that Pickett describes as ``the
beginning of the English musical theater.'' And there is a scene
from Blow's ``Venus and Adonis.''
</P>
<P>
   The program also includes selections from two nontheatrical
works, Handel's ``Acis and Galatea'' and Linley's ``Ode on the
Spirits of Shakespeare.'' Pickett included them, he said, for their
quasi-theatrical associations. The Handel, after all, tells its
story in a theatrical way, and the Linley, more a cantata than a
theater piece, was once performed in a theater that was owned by
the composer's father. Including it was also a way to call
attention to Linley, an English contemporary of Mozart who was
considered promising and forward-looking at the time of his death
in a boating accident in 1778, when he was 22.
</P>
<P>
   Pickett regards this sampler of British music as a look at the
origin of a quasi-operatic theater style that can be traced through
Gilbert and Sullivan to the modern English and American musical
theater. Does he, one wondered, really see a link between Purcell
and Andrew Lloyd Webber?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' Pickett said with a mischievous laugh, ``we do seem to
have a very strong tradition here in England of not writing opera.
And in effect, with a couple of exceptions the piece we are going
to perform could be regarded as the Lloyd Webber shows of their
day. They were extremely popular.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems that people in England have always liked to go to a
play with a lot of music, with colorful costumes and as many sets
as possible _ a spectacle, a multimedia entertainment. But we never
seemed to have much sympathy for pieces which were all sung. And
that possibly stems from the time when Italian opera was popular
here. Those early experiments by people like Handel didn't really
work. Or they worked in terms of the wonderful arias that were
written for the great singing stars to show off. But all those
endless, boring recitatives that nobody could understand drove
people away in the end.'' Pickett, 48, became interested in early
music in the mid-1960s, when he was a trumpet student at the
Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London, and had been
captivated by performances of Renaissance and medieval music that
were proliferating in England under the direction of David Munrow
and other young musicians. He received encouragement from Anthony
Baines, a musicologist best known for his histories of instruments,
who persuaded Pickett to take up the valveless Baroque trumpet.
Around the same time, ickett became fascinated with recorders and
other early wind instruments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I blew all my grant money, which was meant to pay for my
education, on some nice recorders and nice krummhorns,'' he said.
He began attending Munrow's classes at the Royal Academy of Music,
even though he wasn't enrolled there, and eventually persuaded
Munrow to give him a few recorder lessons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took weeks to get him to hear me play,'' Pickett said,
``but in the end he did, and I got a job straight away. Having been
a trumpet player, I played the recorder without vibrato. All the
other recorder players in England warbled like mad.''
</P>
<P>
   After his first year at the Guildhall School, Pickett gave up
the trumpet and devoted himself entirely to wind instruments. He
also became interested in musicology and sat in, again
unofficially, on classes given by Ian Bent, who was then at the
University of London's King's College. He quickly realized that
instead of looking for repertory in published anthologies, as most
other London medieval and Renaissance ensembles were doing, he
could make a stronger mark by searching libraries for unpublished
gems. With the fledgling New London Consort, he gave the first
performances in England of works by Hildegarde of Bingen and Peter
Abelard, and of manuscript collections like the ``Carmina Burana''
and the ``Cantigas de Santa Maria.''
</P>
<P>
   Pickett's musicological explorations have also led him to
idiosyncratic interpretations of familiar works. In his liner notes
for the New London Consort's 1994 recording of Bach's
``Brandenburg'' Concertos, for example, he proposed that the set of
works, compiled for the Margrave of Brandenburg, were meant as a
procession of mythical scenes, figures and virtues.
</P>
<P>
   He presents a compelling argument that the First Concerto was
meant to evoke a Roman triumph, or military procession; that the
prominent trumpet of the Second Concerto portrays Fame, and that
the Third Concerto, with its symmetrical string writing, depicts
the harmony of the Spheres. The Fourth, in Pickett's reading,
describes a contest between Apollo and the satyr Marsyas; the
Fifth, with its combination of French and Italian styles and its
extended harpsichord cadenza, is a musical version of Hercules'
choice between Virtue and Vice, and the low-lying string writing in
the Sixth is a reminder of death and redemption.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no concrete evidence at all,'' Pickett said when asked
for the basis of this reading, ``but there is a mountain of
circumstantial evidence. And I'm more convinced than I was then
that you can find a locus topicus _ or, you can try and imagine
one, because you'll never really find it _ for almost any piece of
Baroque music. I have yet to come across a piece which was not
obviously based on something allegorical, symbolic or emotional. I
promise you, it's not pie in the sky. This is how these composers
worked, and I believe that these are the things that were in Bach's
mind when he wrote those pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   For their first dozen years, Pickett and his group pursued their
repertory adventures in the concert hall, on European tours, in
radio concerts for the BBC and in recordings for small British
labels. Not until 1989 did the band make its major label recording
debut, a collection of dances from Praetorius' ``Terpsichore,'' for
L'Oiseau-Lyre. As it turned out, the long wait for a label deal
proved beneficial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we played so many concerts,'' Pickett said, ``all of
our early recordings we made after a great deal of experience with
the music. We were able to go into the studio and make the
recordings without having to use session time to rehearse. And the
company loved that, because in a lot of cases they would commission
an ensemble to record repertory that they had not performed, and
the players would turn up, rehearse and record, and make the record
by cutting together eight bars at a time. We were a breath of fresh
air because we'd come in and perform 15 minutes of medieval music
without rehearsing and without stopping. Those early recordings
have hardly any editing.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, as the group's repertory expanded toward Baroque and
Classical works, and as the label began requesting works that were
not in the repertory, the consort began making recordings that were
exclusively studio productions. Even so, the performances on those
disks _ the group's fine accounts of Monteverdi's Vespers and
``Orfeo'' are examples _ have the same lively edge that have
characterized the ensemble's work from the start.
</P>
<P>
   When Pickett isn't conducting or playing recorder with the New
London Consort, he is working with his other band, the Musicians of
the Globe. Formed in 1995, this ensemble of mostly younger players
is resident at the reconstructed Globe Theater in London.
</P>
<P>
   ``Originally, they wanted the New London Consort,'' Pickett
said, ``but the old-guard players are too established in their own
right, and they don't want to sit in a theater three to five nights
a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I was very eager to do it, because I did a lot of theater
work in my younger years, and when I watched the Globe going up I
was thinking, `Wow, if only it were me.' So we hit upon a plan
where I would use a lot of younger players, but also make sure that
the group had a life of its own outside the theater. And that has
worked out, because the Musicians of the Globe now play concerts,
make broadcasts and recordings, and go on tour. But because they
are part of this group, they can be strong-armed into the theater _
you know, `If you want to be part of this, you have to suffer!'''

PENETRATING THE SECRETS OF PORCELAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By WENDY MOONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Nearly everyone is familiar with blue and white Delft
tiles from the Netherlands, but few know much about Delft's
original rival in France, the Saint-Cloud porcelain factory, which
thrived between 1690 and 1766 in the commune of St.-Cloud, across
the river from Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is an opportunity to see about 300 pieces of
Saint-Cloud soft-paste porcelain at a beautifully mounted
exhibition at the Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the
Decorative Arts, in Manhattan, through Oct. 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``Porcelain was considered a mysterious and magical material in
1700,'' the London porcelain dealer Errol Manners said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were boatloads of blue and white coming in from China in
the 17th century,'' he explained, ``but the Europeans hadn't yet
discovered the secret of making it. When Louis XIV saw people
pouring out money for it, he sponsored experiments at French
factories. For royalty, having a porcelain factory was a great
prestigious thing, like having a stable of fine race horses. It was
very cutting-edge.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in the mid-1660s, several countries in Europe tried to
figure out how to make porcelain; the race involved international
spying as well as the poaching of talent.
</P>
<P>
   Bertrand Rondot, the curator from Paris' Musee des Arts
Decoratifs who organized the Bard show, said France had played a
leading role in this contest. He explained that Louis XIV's finance
minister, Jean-Baptiste Colbert (1619-83), took it upon himself to
stimulate the production of porcelain by having the King grant a
royal privilege to Saint-Cloud.
</P>
<P>
   By 1660, France had been producing faience, or earthenware, for
nearly a century. But the story of French porcelain really starts
with two brothers, Claude and Francois Reverend, who had a passion
for ceramics. Claude was a successful Paris salt merchant who
imported faience from the Netherlands. Francois had worked in
faience factories in Rouen from 1648 to 1653.
</P>
<P>
   In 1664, Claude obtained a royal license to make faience and
decided to build a factory in Saint-Cloud, probably because the
family had connections there with Louis XIV's brother, the Duc
d'Orleans, who lived in the town.
</P>
<P>
   In 1664, another Reverend brother, Jean, became the duke's
chaplain, Rondot said, pointing out that royal patronage was
important in developing a ceramics business.
</P>
<P>
   Claude spent so much money building the factory, an essay in the
Bard show's catalog said, that in November 1666 he was heavily in
debt and had to hand over ownership of the factory to Francois.
</P>
<P>
   Francois was the director of the business until 1674. He
recruited pottery workers from the Netherlands and hired Pierre
Chicaneau, a faience painter from Saint-Cloud. The two must have
been good friends; Francois Reverend was godfather to Chicaneau's
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   At the outset, the objective was to make faience that imitated
Oriental porcelain. The factory manufactured vases for Versailles
and wall tiles and tiles for lining ornamental ponds at the royal
Chateau de Marly, Louis XIV's country retreat.
</P>
<P>
   In 1674, Reverend handed over the directorship of the factory to
Chicaneau, who began a series of experiments. He may have
discovered the process for making soft-paste porcelain _ that is,
porcelain made without kaolin _ before he died in 1677.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the end of the 17th century, Saint-Cloud was not the only
manufactory engaged in discovering the secret of porcelain
production, but it was, in fact, the only one able to actually make
`real' porcelain and to exploit it commercially,'' Rondot wrote in
the catalog essay.
</P>
<P>
   In 1678, after Chicaneau died, his widow, Barbe Coudray, married
Henri Trou, a potter from Nevers, France. From that point on, the
success of Saint-Cloud could be attributed to Ms. Coudray.
</P>
<P>
   In 1683, Ms. Coudray and her husband bought the factory. By
1697, she, her husband and three of the Chicaneau children had set
up a separate company solely to produce porcelain _ the first such
company in France.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barbe Coudray and Henri Trou became masters of the faience and
porcelain factory established at Saint-Cloud and would remain so
for 17 years,'' Genevieve Le Duc, who recently died, wrote in the
catalog.
</P>
<P>
   When Trou died in 1700, the estate inventory of the factory
included 3,146 pieces of porcelain. Again, Ms. Coudray came to the
rescue.
</P>
<P>
   Although porcelain production had to be halted until another
royal privilege was granted, she organized her family to continue
making faience in the interim. In 1702, she and her son got the
warrant, and she spent the next several years as the primary
decision-maker in the family. Sons and daughters-in-law were all
involved, but she retained her position almost until her death in
1717.
</P>
<P>
   By then, the factory was established. Her son Henri Trou II and
his sister-in-law Marie Moreau took over for the next 24 years.
Eventually, a relative leaked the secret of porcelain-making, and
the factory went bankrupt in 1766.
</P>
<P>
   Saint-Cloud porcelain can be divided into three categories: blue
and white, all-white and colored. It is difficult for amateurs to
identify because it is often unmarked. At first, a sun, the emblem
of the Sun King, was painted on the bottom; later on, some pieces
were marked STCT, for Saint-Cloud Trou.
</P>
<P>
   In the first decades, many of the porcelain shapes show a strong
Chinese influence; there are Minglike vases, gourd-shaped pots,
pots-pourris, Chinese teacups and big bowls.
</P>
<P>
   Later on, other shapes were added. They mimic silver sugar
sifters, inkwells and snuff boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining the appeal of Saint-Cloud porcelain, James Sansum, a
partner at the New York gallery L'Antiquaire and the Connoisseur,
said: ``It has a completely different feel from hard-paste
porcelain. It's softer.''
</P>
<P>
   David Dalva of the Dalva Brothers gallery in Manhattan, which
sells some Saint-Cloud, said its appeal was in its ``charming
utilitarianism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice, organic and unpretentious,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pamela Klaber of Klaber &AMP; Klaber, private dealers in London
(www.klaber.com), likes Saint-Cloud, she said, for ``its very soft,
creamy look.''
</P>
<P>
   She continued: ``Porcelain is very tactile; you have to want to
feel it. Saint-Cloud makes you want to pick it up. It has an
unctuous look, like clotted cream. Meissen porcelain is brittle and
has a hard, professional look.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Klaber is organizing a virtual exhibition of Saint-Cloud on
her Web site in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saint-Cloud has been out of fashion for a long time,'' she
said. ``But it's coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   Michele Beiny, a by-appointment-only Manhattan dealer who
specializes in 18th-century porcelain, agreed. ``There isn't a lot
around, but when I get a good piece, it's gone in five minutes,''
she said.

 &HT;    DOLLARS AND SENSE FOR Y2K
 &HT;    Eds: Marilyn Geewax, formerly with the Atlanta Journal and
Constitution, is now a national correspondent with Cox Newspapers'
Washington Bureau.
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Aug. 1
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For millions of Americans, nothing fosters a sense
of security quite like a fat roll of crisp $20 bills.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show that as more people begin preparing for New Year's
Day and the computer problems that may come with it, the desire to
hoard cash is growing. The Federal Reserve Bank is bracing for
large cash withdrawals late in the year, even while assuring
customers that such stockpiling is unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   The cash craving is being fed by fears about the ``Y2K bug,'' a
software flaw that will cause some older computers to interpret
dates ending in ``00'' as 1900 instead of 2000. That
misunderstanding has the potential to shut down the computerized
systems that control everything from power generators to financial
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Though programmers are racing to correct the problem, some
people doubt they will finish the job in time to avert disruptions
in many basic services. A poll conducted by the Associated Press in
mid-July found that one-quarter of Americans plan to take extra
money out of the bank in case problems arise, such as automated
teller machines that stop working or power outages that keep banks
closed.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare for a possible grab for greenbacks in December, the
nation's central bank is increasing the value of its cash inventory
by the end of September to more than $200 billion, up from its
usual $150 billion. That increase would provide enough cash for
each U.S. household to withdraw an extra $500 for New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Fed governors last(cq) month voted to make
special loans to banks, thrifts and credit unions that might need
emergency funds because of consumer fears about Y2K. The loans will
be offered from Oct. 1 to April 7 to help financial institutions
``more confidently commit'' to making loans to other banks during
the Y2K transition.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan said last(cq)
month that the efforts to fix Y2K-related problems in the banking
and financial system have been so ``exhaustive'' that ``we expect
the full array of payment options to work'' as usual after Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most risky activity people can take is to take all their
currency out of their banks because there will be a new industry
that will emerge as a consequence ... millenium thievery,'' he told
the Senate Banking Committee this week.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, bankers point out that dollars can be destroyed by
fire, and
</P>
<P>
   money in the mattress is not insured for free up to $100,000, as
it is in a federally insured institution.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan said ``the most sensible thing'' to do on Dec. 31 is
to keep your money insured and earning interest in the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers in many major industrialized nations share the Fed's
belief that cash hoarding is unnecessary and even foolhardy. Still,
the central banks in Japan, Britain, Canada, Sweden, Italy,
Switzerland and Singapore are printing more money to prepare for
the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   And while hoarding cash can be unsafe for individuals, it isn't
risk-free for bankers either. According to a report by the Bank of
England on Y2K preparations, the huge stacks of bills will create
so many security problems that many banks around the world are
planning to stash money in secret locations.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, Y2K may create opportunities for those who
prey on armored vehicles. With an extra $50 billion moving in
trucks from the Treasury Department's Bureau of Printing and
Engraving to the Fed's vaults around the nation, guards will have
more money to watch over.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not everyone will be interested in obtaining paper
bills. For those who believe Y2K will trigger social and economic
catastrophes, gold is the answer. For months, companies that sell
gold coins have been urging people to buy the glittering metal to
use in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   One Web site, which opens with the phrase ``Year 2000 News
Flash: Economic Crisis Grips World,'' is offering consumers a
``Gold Jubilee Pack'' of 50 gold medallions bearing likenesses of
religious leaders. For $1,770, consumers get a pack of coins
weighing 4.58 ounces.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site does not mention that this year, gold prices have
tumbled, recently falling to a 20-year low. At current prices, 4.58
ounces of gold is worth less than $1,200.

ON TOBACCO AND `60 MINUTES'; `EYES' MYSTERY; GETTING OLDER?
GREAT! 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Michael Mann, director of ``Last of the Mohicans''
and ``Heat,'' is nervous. So is Joe Roth, chairman of Walt Disney
studios. And who can blame them?
</P>
<P>
   The two men are awaiting reaction to Mann's newest and most
anticipated film, ``The Insider,'' which deals with, among other
issues, the decision by CBS News in 1995 not to broadcast an
interview on ``60 Minutes'' with a tobacco company whistleblower.
</P>
<P>
   ``The volume has been turned up in the media,'' said Mann, who
created the television series ``Miami Vice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not so much concerned about CBS or Mike Wallace or Don
Hewitt or those folks,'' Mann said of the ``60 Minutes'' reporter
and the executive producer, who are portrayed in the movie in a
less-than-flattering way. ``The big concern was _ and is _ tobacco.
They're highly litigious. They compelled CBS, a paragon of
journalistic integrity, to yank a show.''
</P>
<P>
   The two-and-a-half-hour film, to be released by Disney on Nov.
9, stars Al Pacino as Lowell Bergman, a former ``60 Minutes''
producer, and Russell Crowe (``L.A. Confidential'') as Jeffrey
Wigand, a scientist who decided to reveal information that his
former employer, the Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp., had lied to
Congress about tobacco's addictive effects. The film deals with the
complex and volatile relationship between Wigand, a complicated,
almost withdrawn figure, and the aggressive television producer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're totally different,'' Mann said. ``In a social context,
they wouldn't be attracted to one another as friends or even get
along. And Jeffrey Wigand is not `Mr. Deeds Goes to Washington.'
He's precisely as imperfect as all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS initially decided against broadcasting its interview with
Wigand with the acquiescence of Hewitt and Wallace. Bergman, who
was Wallace's longtime producer, strenuously argued with his
bosses. CBS later broadcast the interview. But Bergman quit.
</P>
<P>
   Bergman now teaches at the University of California at Berkeley
and does free-lance reporting, including some assignments on
contract with The New York Times. Wigand lives in Charleston, S.C.,
and runs a project intended to keep youngsters from smoking
cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Mann said he had known Bergman for years and had considered
making a film based on another ``60 Minutes'' episode produced by
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every week or so I'd get a call from him,'' Mann said. ``I was
inside those events when CBS closed down the story and Wigand was
under intense personal pressure. At one point I said, `What you're
living through, that's a drama.'''
</P>
<P>
   An article about Wigand in Vanity Fair, by Marie Brenner, which
was the basis for the movie, accelerated the project.
</P>
<P>
   Roth, Disney's chairman, said the script by Eric Roth, who won
an Academy Award for his screenplay, ``Forrest Gump,'' immediately
sold him on the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good drama, a good thriller, a good story of how
corporations face responsibilities or not,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Roth added that he was convinced that the various portrayals of
real people in the film were accurate and that the drama was not
merely a criticism of the CBS journalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was concerned that the people at `60 Minutes' would see the
movie as something other than what it intends to be, a drama told
on different levels in which they went along with corporate
decisions that they probably regret in retrospect, and Mike Wallace
has gone on record as saying that,'' Roth said.
</P>
<P>
   Roth said he was a bit reluctant to talk about Brown &AMP;
Williamson's response to Disney's decision to make the film.
``We've certainly heard from them along the way,'' he said. ``Our
lawyers have been in this the whole time. I have a great deal of
confidence in Michael Mann's meticulous research.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Mann, who is credited as a co-screenwriter on the film, and
Roth made clear that they hoped any potential uproar about the way
CBS News or Brown &AMP; Williamson is presented in the movie would not
overshadow the movie itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to sell the controversy or the potential problems
with `60 Minutes' or Brown &AMP; Williamson,'' Roth said. ``It's a
great American story about how difficult it is, even if you're
right, to go against hugely rich and powerful companies in
communications and manufacturing. And the irony is not lost on me
that I work for one of those, too.''
</P>
<P>
   `Eyes' Mystery
</P>
<P>
   Though executives at Warner Brothers, as well as those at rival
studios, say they expect Stanley Kubrick's ``Eyes Wide Shut'' to
emerge as a big success overseas, its box office in the United
States dropped 54 percent in its second weekend, raising the
question of why a sexual drama with Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman
has fallen so sharply.
</P>
<P>
   Reviews for the film were wildly mixed, and several rival
marketing and distribution executives said that audiences who saw
the movie in its first days were disappointed and conveyed their
views to friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a drop like this, it's because it doesn't
deliver in a way that people anticipated,'' one distribution
executive said. ``The early publicity was very strong. People
anticipated a masterpiece. They were disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Another distribution executive said that two groups of
moviegoers _ fans of Kubrick, Cruise and Ms. Kidman _ showed up the
first week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Kubrick fans were probably more pleased than the Cruise
fans,'' the executive said.
</P>
<P>
   Getting Older? Great!
</P>
<P>
   By the time actors turn 50, their careers often take a downhill
slide. Not 59-year-old James Cromwell.
</P>
<P>
   After decades of struggle and a period in the 1970s when he
almost dropped out of acting, Cromwell has turned into perhaps the
busiest film actor in town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm actually getting scripts now, offers,'' said Cromwell,
sounding a bit incredulous at his sudden good fortune.
</P>
<P>
   The austere-looking, 6-foot-6 character actor _ who often plays
Army generals, government officials and police officers _ has made
about 30 films in recent years. And they keep rolling out.
</P>
<P>
   In his most recent film, ``The General's Daughter,'' a drama
about a daughter who is murdered, Cromwell plays the general, who
has some deep secrets. Next Cromwell will play a prison warden
(``The Green Mile''), a priest (``The Bachelor'') and William
Randolph Hearst in ``RKO 281,'' an HBO drama about the making of
``Citizen Kane.''
</P>
<P>
   After working mostly on television and in the New York theater,
Cromwell's film career took off in the mid-1990s. His earlier
experience in the movie business in the 1960s and '70s had been
dismal, partly because he was so tall that casting directors
avoided him.
</P>
<P>
   ``My agent sent me a script and said it was about a pig,''
Cromwell said. ``I leafed through it. I had about 12 lines. I
thought it was this Disney thing. So I thought I'd go for the
audition. It's not as if I had a lot of offers.''
</P>
<P>
   Five months later he got word to fly to Australia to make this
movie, ``Babe,'' which became one of the biggest hits of 1995.
Cromwell received an Academy Award nomination, and has not stopped
working since.
</P>
<P>
   Although Cromwell often plays villains now _ ``Maybe it's my
height,'' he said _ the actor's personal life is unusually
altruistic. In the 1960s and '70s, he worked in the civil rights
movement in the rural South, touring with the Free Southern Theater
and directing and starring in ``Waiting for Godot'' for black
audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most rewarding experience I ever had in the theater,''
said Cromwell, who is married to Julie Cobb, the daughter of the
actor Lee J. Cobb.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Cromwell has immersed himself in the plight of
the Lakota tribe in South Dakota, and has founded a project with
the help of wealthy Hollywood figures like Norman Lear to build a
fine arts college at the Pine Ridge Reservation there. ``I've
always had a political bent,'' Cromwell said.
</P>
<P>
   The actor grew up in Hollywood. His father was John Cromwell,
the actor and director who was blacklisted in 1954, and moved to
the East Coast after that. His mother, Kay Johnson, was a stage and
film actress, and so was his stepmother, Ruth Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   Cromwell, who studied acting and directing at Carnegie Mellon,
spent years in Los Angeles struggling to earn a living as an actor.
His low point, he said, came in the 1970s, when he grew despondent
about his acting career. He sailed around the world for 18 months,
and returned to Los Angeles intending to work as a probation
officer.
</P>
<P>
   But a friend, Gordon Davidson, artistic director of the Mark
Taper Forum, asked him to appear in ``Hamlet,'' which starred Stacy
Keach. Shortly afterward, Lear offered him the role of Stretch
Cunningham in ``All in the Family.'' Cromwell has since worked
regularly _ if not full time _ on television and in the New York
theater.
</P>
<P>
   Cromwell said he could hardly believe his recent good fortune.
Finally. ``It's the luck of the Irish,'' he said. ``Better late
than never.''

   A Mini-Trove Of Velazquez? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Frick Collection hopes to unite six portraits by Velazquez
(1599-1660) that have never hung together before. If all goes as
planned, this small, highly focused exhibition, organized to mark
the Spanish master's 400th birthday, will bring together works from
the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Hispanic Society and the Frick.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed appropriate to have some kind of celebration,'' said
Samuel Sachs II, the Frick's director. ``These six works will cover
the artist's entire career.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hispanic Society is lending three paintings: ``Gaspar de
Guzman, Count-Duke of Olivares,'' ``Camillo Astalli, known as
Cardinal Pamfili'' and ``Portrait of a Little Girl.'' It is the
first time in 90 years the society has allowed any of its
collection of Old Master paintings to leave the museum.
</P>
<P>
   Pending approval from the Metropolitan's board, those works will
be joined by ``Juan de Pareja'' and the ``Infanta Maria Teresa of
Spain,'' neither of which has left the Metropolitan since they
visited the Prado in Madrid nine years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The sixth work in the show, a portrait of King Philip IV of
Spain, is from the Frick's collection. It was acquired by Henry
Clay Frick, and therefore cannot travel. (Under Frick's will, the
art he acquired _ about two-thirds of the collection _ is not
allowed to be lent.)
</P>
<P>
   Sachs said the show, which runs from Nov. 16 through Jan. 16,
was the brainchild of Jonathan Brown, a Velazquez scholar who is on
the Frick Art Reference Library Council Association. It will be
installed in the oval gallery, which is where the Frick's Velazquez
originally hung when the house-museum opened in 1935. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Smithsonian Tours &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It seems to be something of a trend for museums to send their
collections on tour to other institutions when they close for
renovation. The Barnes Foundation in Merion, Pa., and the Van Gogh
Museum in Amsterdam, for example, have organized highly popular
traveling exhibitions of their prized paintings.
</P>
<P>
   So it comes as no surprise that while the Smithsonian Museum of
American Art and its Renwick Gallery are shut for a three-year
renovation beginning in 2000, ``Treasures to Go,'' eight thematic
exhibitions of paintings and sculptures organized by the museum,
will travel to museums across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to have a lot more people understand how important
American art is and to learn more about us,'' said Elizabeth Broun,
director of the Museum of American Art.
</P>
<P>
   The shows are: ``Young America,'' tracing the transformation of
the colonies, with portraits by John Singleton Copley, Charles
Willson Peale and Gilbert Stuart, as well as landscapes scenes of
early America; ``Lure of the West,'' which includes portraits by
George Catlin, Western subjects by Frederic Remington and Albert
Bierstadt and works from the Taos school; ``American
Impressionism,'' concentrating on 19th-century artists from the
late 1880s like Childe Hassam, James McNeil Whistler, Mary Cassatt,
John Twachtman and William Merritt Chase; ``The Gilded Age,'' which
highlights artists after the Civil War and through the mid-1920s,
including John Singer Sargent and Abbott Thayer; ``Scenes of
American Life,'' exploring the century from 1909 to 1980 through
works by Edward Hopper, Jacob Lawrence and Paul Cadmus; ``Modernism
and Abstraction,'' surveying the 20th century from emerging
technological innovations to new political theories, from Jo%ph
Stella and Georgia O'Keeffe to Marsden Hartley and Arthur Dove;
``Contemporary Folk Art,'' showcasing self-taught artists from the
last 40 years, and ``Arte Latino,'' about Latino art traditions and
innovations.
</P>
<P>
   These shows will go to a varied group of about 70 museums, from
Portland, Ore., to Portland, Maine., and to urban sites like Miami,
Dallas and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Fees for the exhibitions range from $30,000 to $40,000, Ms.
Broun said. As a government institution, the Smithsonian does not
try to make a profit but is concerned with covering its costs.
</P>
<P>
   The Principal Financial Group, a Des Moines-based insurance and
financial services company, is providing funds for various
initiatives connected with the shows. It will help pay for
advertising and publications as well as produce several national
cable television specials and a syndicated program for network
affiliates in each city on the tour. It will also help pay for a
new section of the museum's Web site about the exhibitions, which
can be reached at www.nmaa.si.edu. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Seattle Sculpture Park &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Following in the footsteps of cities like Washington and Dallas,
Seattle is about to have its own museum-affiliated sculpture
garden.
</P>
<P>
   This week the Seattle Art Museum and the Trust for Public Land,
a nonprofit organization that works with public authorities to
preserve open spaces, received a $4 million gift from the Allen
Foundation for the Arts, a Seattle-based organization.
</P>
<P>
   The gift will go 4oward the purchase of a $17 million, six-acre
site adjoining Myrtle Edwards Park, downtown Seattle's last
remaining parcel of undeveloped land. The site, which is currently
owned by the Unocal oil company, will be developed into a
waterfront sculpture park.
</P>
<P>
   The museum has also received a $4 million pledge from the Bill
and Melinda Gates Foundation and a $5 million endowment pledged by
Jon and Mary Shirley, Seattle collectors, to insure the park's
long-term operation and maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   So far, $24 million has been raised toward what is estimated to
be a $37 million project. The Seattle City Council has also passed
a resolution to help finance the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sculpture has become a vital collecting field in Seattle,''
said Mimi Gardner Gates, director of the Seattle Art Museum, who
added that the project is expected to take about three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``First we wanted to insure that we had the land because there
were many developers right behind us,'' she said. ``The artistic
program, along with the design of the park, has still to be
developed.''

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: How Warsaw's young warriors view
NATO
 &HT;    (Eds: Second in a series. Cox News Service columnist Joe Murray
reported from Eastern Europe during a visit 10 years ago, just
before the fall of the Berlin Wall. This summer he returned to
write about the changes that have led three former Eastern Bloc
countries _ Hungary, the Czech Republic and Poland _ to become the
newest members of NATO. At the end of the series, CoxNet will
compile these columns into our weekly Focus page, good for running
as a Perspective-type page or op-ed feature. These pages are

<P>
   WARSAW _ Other than its history, there's nothing old about Old
Town.
</P>
<P>
   Like most of Warsaw, this segment of the city -- dating back to
the 13th century -- was bombed to basement level, and then some,
before World War II was over and done with.
</P>
<P>
   Old Town has since been reconstructed according to 18th century
architecture. Never mind that New Town is only slightly younger.
The tourists like what they see.
</P>
<P>
   Old Town, too, is where you find the young people, a fine place
for music and beer on warm summer evenings. So it was that I was
here in search of our newest NATO allies, Warsaw's young warriors,
Poland's finest, prepared as they were to lay down their lives for
the NATO way of life.
</P>
<P>
   I had some trouble getting them to set down their beer long
enough to talk. But here are comments I recorded through the help
of an interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   This was not a scientific poll. If nothing else, it may reflect
a sense of history:
</P>
<P>
   Tomasz Stawinski, high school student, age 17:
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a good step for Poland to become a NATO member. Many
politicians, deciding to make that step, perhaps thought first
about their own career, not about the whole nation. But from the
point of view of the ordinary people, it is good to receive support
from the rest of Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Micha Wilczek, student, age 24:
</P>
<P>
   ``It is good that Poland is in NATO. We never knew before whose
side we were on. It was as if we were between a hammer and an
anvil. In our feelings, we were always on the side of Western
democracy, but we were bound to the East. We couldn't help that.''
</P>
<P>
   Mirek Mordak, student, age 21:
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sure it will be better for Poland than it used to be. But
Poland has no business in Kosovo. It is an American problem, not
ours. I would like to join the army, but I would not go to Kosovo.
If I had a choice to kill or not to kill someone, I would choose
not to.''
</P>
<P>
   Mariola and Katarzyna Dbrowska, sisters who work and attend
school part time, ages 19 and 22:
</P>
<P>
   ``It is better now. Poland will be safer now. We'll have a
chance to develop. We will be safer from aggression of our Eastern
neighbors. Intervention in Kosovo was necessary. We had to put an
end to people killing other people.''
</P>
<P>
   Katarzyna Majka, student, age 22:
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a NATO member is a protection of our safety. It gives us
a feeling that we belong to this world and that we mean something
for it. The bombing of Kosovo was not necessary and it is said that
it never took place.''
</P>
<P>
   Lidka (no last name given), nurse, age 29:
</P>
<P>
   ``It is going to take much more for us to become a real NATO
member. We should solve our inner problems first before becoming a
NATO member. We cannot solve our ordinary problems of education,
health care and agriculture. We are too weak to handle all the
responsibilities of NATO membership. The invasion of Kosovo was a
very big mistake made by an irresponsible person.''
</P>
<P>
   Edyta Wacierak, student, age 21:
</P>
<P>
   ``The invasion of Kosovo was a game played at the top by
politicians, between the U.S. and Russia. Those countries gained
profits from it. It's not about people's problems, but about
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Pawe Lang, student, age 21:
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO is a good thing to stabilize our country, but on the
other hand it can spoil our relations with our Eastern neighbors.
As for the bombing of Kosovo, I think it was a good thing, but it
lasted too long.''
</P>
<P>
   There you have it, the news from Old Town _ in some ways, not so
different from what you'd hear in a cafe back home, except for that
polka music.

BACKSLIDING INTO THE POLITICALLY INCORRECT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Thursday, Aug. 5)  
(mk) 
 By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The story goes something like this. Two women were out on the
soccer field when the new coach, a man, walked by and one woman
player turned to another woman player and said ``cute butt,'' not
realizing at the time that the amused woman to whom she'd tossed
the remark was the coach's mother.
</P>
<P>
   The anecdote with ``cute butt'' ended up in a newspaper story
about more women playing soccer, along with a happy-ending part
that the admiring player and the coach fell in love, got married
and her teammate became her mother-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   The ``cute butt'' comment probably gave many women a knowing
chuckle for this is something that women are known to say about
men. The male posterior is often a focus of admiration and
attention, particularly in sport settings.
</P>
<P>
   Men pay attention to this aspect of the female body too. But men
have been sensitized against making public comments which can get
them into trouble. Say something like that about a female soccer
player and the person sitting next to you might fire back, ``Is
that all you ever notice?''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, in this particular case the comment didn't get anyone
in trouble but became part of family lore.
</P>
<P>
   But some who read ``cute butt'' did not see it in its ironic
context. Some cried foul, asking how come a woman can say this
about a man but not vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   I have to admit that my first reaction was not as a member of
the politically correct squad but as a person who sometimes finds
delight both in large social gaffes and the occasional football
huddle.
</P>
<P>
   What's the harm in ``cute butt''? I asked. Is there a man alive
who would protest the compliment? If a man's mother doesn't mind,
why should anyone else?
</P>
<P>
   But the arguments were there, waiting offshore like some giant
wave getting ready to come in and knock me to my senses.
</P>
<P>
   If a man made the same comment about a young woman to her father
would it be as funny? Probably not.
</P>
<P>
   And, considering the scrutiny we now give to coaches, what if a
male coach said that about a female player?
</P>
<P>
   Given the wide range of anatomical commentary used on the female
body, ``cute butt'' isn't much to fret, but if a coach said it he'd
likely lose his job.
</P>
<P>
   The day after ``cute butt'' ran in our newspaper, another
newspaper quoted a joke about men by musician Chrissie Hynde which
made ``cute butt'' sound as harmless as ``nice shoes.'' But I know
... I know, that doesn't make it OK.
</P>
<P>
   It would be so easy to take a break from PC and to say ``Oh for
heaven's sake. We're just kidding.'' Or to allow for certain
exemptions. But that's assuming that everybody doesn't need any
more awareness.
</P>
<P>
   The PC concept was once considered an essential learning tool,
but now the practice is resented by enough people that ridiculing
PC speech is its own kind of humor. But look who's making the
jokes? Aren't they mostly white males?
</P>
<P>
   Look how many laughs Jack Nicholson's piggish character got for
insulting ethnic minorities in ``As Good as It Gets.''
</P>
<P>
   This fall there's a trend in gross-out humor coming on TV that
will get yuks on everything offensive from nose picking to jokes
about big breasts (they will not be called breasts). These shows
are supposed to appeal to young males who are tired of being
sensitive.
</P>
<P>
   My daughter isn't a boy-talk fan but she does like the rude
``South Park'' series. She said, ``It's funny because it's so
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   But does everybody get that it's wrong?
</P>
<P>
   It's too bad that people are bored with good taste and fair
play, but it seems that somebody's got to keep paying attention,
because, take it from me, people lapse.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty soon one person's CB becomes another's T and A and then
we're back to slurs about pink people and we'll have to sign up for
PC training all over again.

DANCE MOVES BACK TO NATURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dance heads for the parks, plazas and streets of the
city and beyond each summer. In a working vacation of sorts,
dancers have a chance to perform for larger, newer audiences, often
on shared programs with artists in other fields. For audiences,
summer festivals can be full of distractions not found in a formal
theater setting. Still, the experience is also serendipitous and
the price is right most of the time, with admission often free or
by small suggested donation.
</P>
<P>
   What makes a festival work? Money, of course, and rainless days
and nights. Even more, the success of the longest-running New York
festivals is attributable to directors who are knowledgeable,
imaginative and tireless.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard de Paur, the first director of the Lincoln Center Out of
Doors festival, retired in 1988 and died last year. But the memory
of his sonorous voice, which lent extra importance and a touch of
humor to even the most mundane festival announcements, is likely to
linger long, as is the memory of de Paur making the rounds of his
festival day after day.
</P>
<P>
   ``He spent hours on that plaza,'' Norma de Paur recalled of her
husband, who is being honored by the festival this year. ``He loved
it. He'd walk and walk and walk. You never knew where he would
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln Center Out of Doors, led today by Jenneth Webster, is
one of the four largest summer performing arts festivals in and
around New York. Each has its own personality. Celebrate Brooklyn,
now in its 21st year, combines funk and gleaming grandeur with
surprising ease in the performers it offers, the 7,200 people it
can accommodate on seats and across the lawn, and a $3.4 million
upgrading of the audience and backstage areas at the Prospect Park
Band Shell.
</P>
<P>
   The august Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival in the Berkshire hills
and meadows of Becket, Mass., offers the unusually contemplative
dance equivalent of green thoughts in a green land, to paraphrase
Marvell. Performances, talks, exhibitions, open classes and films
and videos seem to sprout up everywhere as one walks across lawns,
past gardens and into the rustic theaters, studios and exhibition
centers.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln Center Out of Doors, founded in 1971, sprawls across the
plaza, spilling over into the Damrosch Park Bandshell, in a vivid,
festive mix of professional and community dance and music groups.
And the cutting edge and funky hip reign at Central Park
Summerstage, which celebrates its 14th anniversary this year.
</P>
<P>
   But there is more going on. Spot an awning or banks of sound
equipment and there is likely a smaller neighborhood performing
arts festival in full swing. One popular site this year has been
Battery Park, where the Downtown Dance Festival will offer a
glimpse /f mostly unfamiliar dance from other countries on the lawn
at the close of summer.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the fare at New York City performing arts festivals
tends to be more diverse than it was at the city's earlier
festivals, at the vast Lewiqohn Stadium in Harlem from the late
1920s through the '60s, and at the popular Delacorte Dance Festival
in Central Park from the early 1960s into the '70s. Both audiences
and performers are conscientiously nurtured more, too, with
improvements in seating and stages and slowly increasing pay for
dancers. Festivals are also commissioning work and offering
residencies that include precious free rehearsal time.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrate Brooklyn! will present the Goldhuber &AMP; Latsky duo and
Maia Claire Garrison and her troupe M'zawa Danz, both festival
dance residents this year, in a shared program on Aug. 7 preceded
by an open rehearsal and workshop on Aug. 4. New pieces are being
developed in a monthlong rehearsal period that includes three weeks
at the Picnic House in Prospect Park and a final week of stage
rehearsal in the band shell with full crew and production elements.
</P>
<P>
   The program will combine relatively laid-back downtown
experimentalist dance with dance that passionately addresses social
issues. Lawrence Goldhuber and Heidi Latsky, choreographers and
performers who are probably best known for the way they juxtapose
their large and small bodies, will present a new piece in a suite
called ``I Hate Modern Dance,'' featuring puppets and social
dancing. Ms. Garrison's new work will be the first segment of a
suite called ``The Panther Peace,'' which honors the Black Panthers
and was inspired in part by Paul Taylor's allusion to the Ku Klux
Klan in his recent ``Oh, You Kid!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally we look for two very different choreographers to
share an evening,'' Jack Walsh, co-producer of the festival with
Rachel Chanoff, said of the residency programs. ``This is a large
venue and we must develop wider audiences. We've found that when we
produce like-minded artists it is not so exciting and risky.''
</P>
<P>
   Other festival dance attractions include Momix, an offshoot of
Pilobolus, on Aug. 13, and the younger Stephen Petronio Company on
Aug. 20. The festival also presents music of all kinds, including
jazz by David Gonzalez and the D.D. Jackson Trio on Friday night
and a shared program Saturday of bluegrass music by Orrin Star and
the Sultans of String and Irish traditional music by Solas. Feature
and short films are also shown on the festival's 50-foot screen on
Thursday nights in the Sundance Channel Film Series.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It would probably have been inconceivable in 1970, when Lincoln
Center Out of Doors began as a relatively small festival that
relied on community performing groups, that an all-male ballet
company would one day be performing a work by Merce Cunningham at
the Damrosch Park Bandshell. But this year the irrepressible lads
of Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo will be dancing
Cunningham's 1964 ``Cross Currents'' on Aug. 7.
</P>
<P>
   It would probably have been equally hard to imagine the festival
having money to commission works from well-known modern dance
choreographers like Molissa Fenley and Ronald K. Brown. Ms. Fenley
will collaborate with the New York City Ballet principal Peter Boal
on a new piece, set to music by Joan Jeanrenaud, that will be
performed Aug. 12 as part of Ms. Fenley's ``Expanding Universe''
program. Brown's new ``Ode to Ellington'' will be performed Aug. 19
and 20 by the exuberant Philadanco troupe from Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Most of the other commissioning grants have also gone to dance.
The festival has provided the choreographer Risa Jaroslow with 11
wading pools for her ``Pool Party Paradise II'' on Aug. 24. In a
dizzying change of pace, Lincoln Center Out of Doors will also
present the New York Baroque Dance Company in ``Vivaldi
Carnivale,'' to be performed among the leafy trees of the South
Plaza on Aug. 25 and 26.
</P>
<P>
   The range of remaining dance is wide, from Trisha Brown's
charmingly breezy new ``Five Part Weather Invention,'' set to music
by Dave Douglas and his Charms of the Night Sky ensemble, to
traditional folk dance from Peru, Haiti and Taiwan and some nutty
prop-dance choreography from Rhode Island's Everett Dance Theater.
The festival also inclu$es many music programs and events like
``Homemade Instrument Day'' on Aug. 14 that are designed for
children's participation.
</P>
<P>
   Central Park Summerstage has laid down a carpet of green plastic
turf _ by now as reassuringly bedraggled as city grass _ that has
reduced the dust in the air. But the festival remains a potent
slice of New York adventurousness, with music and dance events that
bring disparate audiences together and even have them dancing in
the aisles and chatting. That atmosphere is not accidental. ``Part
of the fun of it is that we can be both artistically adventurous
and populist at the same time,'' Bill Bragin, director of the
festival, said. ``We have the benefit of free admission and a great
location. People from different backgrounds feel welcome in the
park. Particularly for dance, people sometimes feel intimidated by
the venues. Summerstage allows people to take a chance and see
sophisticated work but also drink a beer and eat a burger. People
end up engaging with the art and with other audiences.''
</P>
<P>
   Still to go on the festival dance roster are the avant-gardists
Muna Tseng and Ping Chong, who perform Aug. 17 in a program shared
with the poet Cornelius Eady and the jazz composer Diedre Murray.
The next night is devoted to dance, opening with Rennie Harris
Puremovement, which builds on street and club dance forms, and
including a commissioned work by Leon Parker, whom festival
officials describe as a ``scientific hambone artist.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most complete summer dance experiences is to be had
at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival, founded in 1941 at the
bucolic home that the modern-dance pioneer Ted Shawn created for
his Men Dancers company a decade earlier. This weekend, Michael
Moschen will juggle fire, hoops and crystal balls at the Ted Shawn
Theater in the meditative blending of motion and light that have
made him a popular and iconic performance artist.
</P>
<P>
   Down the hill in the less formal Doris Duke Studio Theater, Jane
Comfort will present her Bessie Award-winning ``Underground
River,'' which features puppets by Basil Twist and an a cappella
score composed by Toshi Reagon. The score for Ms. Comfort's prickly
``Three Bagatelles for the Righteous'' includes music for tabla
drums, balafon and gamelan instruments as well as sound bites from
speeches by President Clinton, Pat Robertson, and other political
and religious figures.
</P>
<P>
   The Pillow, together with the just-ended American Dance Festival
in Durham, N.C., is one of the most active commissioners of new
work. Under the direction of Ella Baff, the Berkshires festival is
also focusing on dance with live musical accompaniment for a little
mini-Tanglewood flavor. Live music will be a feature of a program
by Los Munequitos de Matanzas, a three-generation family rumba
troupe from Cuba that performs Aug. 11 to 15.
</P>
<P>
   During the week of Aug. 18 to 22, music will be performed on
African traditional instruments by the Harlem-based Batoto Yetu
children's dance troupe founded by Julio Leitao of Angola, at the
Shawn, and gamelan music performed by the New Jakarta Ensemble will
accompany Yin Mei's ``Empty Tradition/City of Peonies'' at the
Duke. And in the festival closing week, there will be live music
for the dancers of the Bolshoi Ballet appearing at the Shawn in
American premieres by Aleksei Ratmansky, with Seamus Egan and his
Solas group providing the accompaniment for Sean Curran at the
Duke.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dancing Honeymoon,'' to be performed on the Mark Morris Dance
Group program next week at the Shawn, is set to taped songs by
George and Ira Gershwin, Jerome Kern and Cole Porter. But as George
Gershwin put it, who cares? The Pillow roster will be completed by
the Teatro Hugo and Ines, puppeteers who perform at the Duke
starting Aug. 5.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the greatest pleasures of the Pillow experience is
simply to wander. Down a steep incline lies the Simon Performance
Space, a simple wooden platform that seems to float over the wooded
hills beyond. A free hourlong program of choreography by dancers _
Abby Yager and Ming-Lung Yang of the Trisha Brown troupe and Fritha
Pengelly of the Doug Elkins Dance Company _ is on tap Friday night,
followed Saturday by young performers in Chet Walker's Jazz on
Broadway Workshop at the Pillow school. Other free outdoor
activities include the Wednesday afternoon talks on the Great Lawn
by members of companies appearing this season at the festival.
</P>
<P>
   Back up the hill is Blake's Barn, a rough-hewn, airy hub of
activity. Marge Champion, the film dancer, actor and choreographer

   The doors are always open, too, for the leisurely viewing of
exhibitions of dance photographs by Lois Greenfield and artifacts
from the Pillow archives as well as two continuously running
videos. One is a documentary by Nuria Olive-Belles on the making of
Joanna Haigood's 1998 ``Invisible Wings,'' a site-specific outdoor
piece about the Underground Railroad station that was once on
Pillow grounds. The other video demonstrates the ``motion capture''
computer technique of Paul Kaiser and Shelley Eshkar that has been
used by Merce Cunningham for his recent ``Biped'' and for work by
the Estate Project for Artists with AIDS.

   There is food here for the mind as well as the eyes and ears.
And for the body, there are the picnics that are another
distinguishing feature of summer festival dancegoing in and beyond
the city. As for the performers?

PROPOSAL BRINGS FLURRY OF YELLOW RIBBONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JOSE FRANCO   
 The (Spartanburg, S.C.) Herald-Journal  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAYO, S.C. _ Donna Blake saw the sign, and she knew there was
only one Choice.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, retired truck driver Choice McKinney proposed to his
girlfriend of two months by writing it on a huge aluminum sign off
Highway 221.
</P>
<P>
   And this upstate South Carolina town hasn't been the same since.
</P>
<P>
   It's what people talk about at the local diner, the Mayo
Drive-In and at the Fast Fare convenience store.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the biggest prankster in South Carolina,'' McKinney, 64,
said. ``I did it for a joke, and to show her how much I loved her
and to get people to talking.''
</P>
<P>
   Drivers passing by honk their horns in approval or slow down to
get a closer look at the note that reads: ``Donna, I love you! Will
you marry me? If yes, put a yellow ribbon on the fence. Choice.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, 131 yellow ribbons popped up along the barbed wire
fence.
</P>
<P>
   McKinney had proposed two weeks earlier, but Blake couldn't give
him an answer at the time.
</P>
<P>
   McKinney said he decided to ask for a yellow ribbon because the
song ``Tie A Yellow Ribbon Round the Old Oak Tree'' kept running
through his mind.
</P>
<P>
   McKinney, who spent 42 years on the road and has been a widower
since 1989, said he's had a crush on Blake for three years but
didn't have the nerve to ask her out until two months ago. Their
first date was over coffee at the Waffle House.
</P>
<P>
   Both Blake, who is 58 and has been a widow since 1973, and
McKinney said their former spouses would approve. ``I think both of
them would want us to be happy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Blake was embarrassed by all the attention but wanted to match
McKinney's proposal. So, she gathered all the yellow ribbon she
could find and tore up a yellow bed sheet to make the 131 ribbons.
</P>
<P>
   McKinney drove by that afternoon in his pickup and saw the sign
and said, ``Holy smoke!''
</P>
<P>
   He picked her up, and while driving out to look at the sign he
proposed once again, this time placing a ring on her finger.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just what I have been waiting for. I know what's ahead. A
life of love,'' she smiled, squeezing his hand.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal has certainly sparked talk around town.
</P>
<P>
   The wedding is set for Aug. 24 _ Blake's birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Friends have suggested they get married where McKinney professed
his love. The couple is considering that idea, but haven't decided.
McKinney is trying to figure out something to top his proposal.

`RESTLESS SPIRITS': SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Broadcast notes are at end of review. Time and station are
for New York area; see local listings.) 
(mk) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The time is 1927, two weeks before Charles Lindbergh's historic
nonstop New York to Paris flight. The pilot of the downed plane is
the French World War I ace Lt. Charles Nungesser; the other victim
of his crash is his navigator, Francois Coli, their lives lost en
route from Paris to New York in quest of the $25,000 prize won by
Lindbergh.
</P>
<P>
   On this footnote to aviation history pivots the action of
``Restless Spirits,'' the television movie to be seen Sunday at 8
p.m. ET on Showtime. Part ghost story, part girl's adventure, part
history lesson, part tale of generational conflict, part portrait
of psychological trauma, part message movie as it heads for its
lump-in-the-throat finale, this something-for-everyone story is
rightly presented as one of the cable channel's ``Original Pictures
for All Ages.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the imperfect but engaging and
well-intentioned ``Restless Spirits'' focuses on a bright but
difficult 12-year-old, Katie Penhallow (Juliana Wimbles), who is
dropped off with her all-but-mute kid brother, Simon (Nickolas
Swan), to summer in Newfoundland with their paternal grandmother,
Lydia (Marsha Mason).
</P>
<P>
   Their mother (Leslie Hope), the widow of Lydia's son, a test
pilot killed in a crash four years earlier, is about to fly to
Paris for a rendezvous with her boyfriend, a decision that only
deepens Katie's persistent anger.
</P>
<P>
   But when Katie sneaks out one night to meet some of the local
children at Porter's Pond, she encounters the ghosts of Nungesser
and Coli, fresh from their crash 70 years earlier. Because Porter's
Pond has always been a source of local ghost stories, no one
believes her.
</P>
<P>
   But her dreams and those of little Simon, who begins wearing a
black eye patch like Coli, are filled with images of the two
aviators' jubilant takeoff from Paris in their little biplane,
called L'Oiseau Blanc (the White Bird), and of their descent
through the trees into the pond.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, with the submerged plane, which exists in the past
and the present, as a physical connection between flesh and
phantom, Katie is helping the vainglorious Nungesser (Lothaire
Bluteau) and the kindly family man Coli (Michel Monty) to retrieve
and repair their aircraft so they can complete their flight and
rest their souls.
</P>
<P>
   In so doing, as she races against time to thwart two aviation
archeologists determined to retrieve the wreckage for their own
purposes, Katie learns to come to terms with the past and move on
to the future.
</P>
<P>
   As her grandmother tells her: ``Loss is a part of life. Get used
to it. Hold on to the memory. Put it in your heart, where nobody
can take it away.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the direction of David Wellington, working from a script
by Semi Chellas, Ms. Wimbles gives an appealing performance as
Katie, who begins as a brat and finishes as a young woman of
courage. Monty transmits the warmth and decency of Coli, and Ms.
Mason is fine as an understanding no-nonsense grandmother. But
Bluteau, whose credits include Denis Arcand's ``Jesus of
Montreal,'' is saddled with a poorly drawn role that requires him
to flaunt his medals and exhibit unbelievable hauteur and ill
temper before he is allowed to act like a human being.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the mumbo-jumbo of the impact of fog on transactions
between ghosts and children, ``Restless Spirit'' packs a reasonable
amount of everyday entertainment.
</P>

PONTIAC GAINING MOMENTUM IN AUTO RACING WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PATRICK ZIER   
 The Lakeland, (Fla.) Ledger  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The last time Pontiac had a dominant car on the track in Winston
Cup racing was 1993, when Rusty Wallace won 10 races and Pontiac
11.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, believing that General Motors was primarily
focused on Chevrolet, Wallace left Pontiac and went over to Ford.
Pontiac had pretty much been in the tank since then _ until this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Joe Gibbs' two-car team featuring Pocono winner Bobby
Labonte and rookie sensation Tony Stewart, Pontiac is staging a
comeback.
</P>
<P>
   With Labonte's three wins and another by John Andretti, Pontiac
has already scored more victories in 1999 than any year since 1993.
It's not impossible that, excluding 1993, the car could win more
races this season than in any year since it returned to the sport
in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   There are three primary reasons for this:
</P>
<P>
   _ First was Gibbs' decision to switch from Chevy to Pontiac
prior to the 1997 season. Gibbs felt Chevy's major effort was
concentrated on two teams, Rick Hendrick and Richard Childress, and
Pontiac, which had dropped off dramatically with the loss of
Wallace, knew it needed to develop another lead team.
</P>
<P>
   _ The improvement in other teams such as those owned by Richard
Petty and Bill Davis. Andretti has a win in Petty's car and Ward
Burton has been in position to win with Davis.
</P>
<P>
   _ The chance to work with a car that is now becoming more of a
known quantity. As Kyle Petty explained, Pontiacs ended the 1997
season strong, but the picture changed in 1998. ``They took more
spoiler and more front air dam away from us than the other makes,''
he said. ``Now they've brought the Pontiacs back. We're basically
back to the rules we ended the 1997 season with.''
</P>
<P>
   With almost a brand new team, Petty hasn't shown the improvement
of some of the others. But Labonte says you can't blame losing on
the car.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think people can argue we don't win races because
we're running a Pontiac,'' Labonte said. ``I think this team has a
shot to win almost every track we go to.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the race tracks where we don't have a shot are not because
it's the car's fault,'' Labonte said. ``It's my fault.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton said the addition of crew chief Tommy Baldwin late last
year has increased his team's capability of winning on a consistent
basis.
</P>
<P>
   Pontiac teams have a new level of confidence in 1999, and it's
showing in their performance on the track.

ROUSH TEAM LOOKING FOR ANSWERS

<TEXT>
<P>
   It is about 100 miles from Liberty, N.C., where Johnny Benson
and Kevin Lepage have their race shop, to the garage of Mark Martin
and Jeff Burton, which is in Mooresville, N.C. But when it comes to
racing, the distance between them is much more than that.
</P>
<P>
   Benson, Lepage, Martin and Burton, along with Chad Little, also
housed in Mooresville, are all part of Roush Racing.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact that they all race under the same name is about all
they have in common.
</P>
<P>
   In 19 races so far, Martin and Burton have combined to win five,
finish in the top five 23 times and in the top 10, 28 times.
</P>
<P>
   The other three cars have not won a race between them nor have
they finished in the top five. Together, they have just three top
10s, two by Little and one by Benson.
</P>
<P>
   From a practical standpoint, what has developed are three
separate teams, Martin and Burton, Benson and Lepage and Little.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, after winning at Charlotte, N.C., Burton remarked that
the way he and Martin help each other ``is an example of how a
two-car team should work together.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, though, what works for Martin and Burton is not working
for the rest of Roush Racing.
</P>
<P>
   And it is having an impact.
</P>
<P>
   Lepage's primary sponsor was purchased by a competitor earlier
this year and pulled out. Roush got TV Guide as a replacement, but
now it looks as if TV Guide will leave at the end of the year, and
there is the possibility Lepage's team may fold, leaving him
looking for a ride.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Lepage's crew chief, James Ince, was let go and
blamed for Lepage's poor performance. Ince, who is now crew chief
for Rich Bickle, said he was the scapegoat for a team that had
major problems.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to centralize his operation, Roush is building new
facilities in Concord, N.C., which is near Mooresville just north
of Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   Little and current Busch Series points leader Matt Kenseth, who
will join Roush in 2000 in a car partially owned by Martin, will
move in first, with Benson and Lepage following, if Lepage has a
sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   With Benson, Little and Lepage all having worse years than they
did in 1998, Roush hopes moving them closer to stock car racing's
center will help pick them up.
</P>
<P>
   Benson thinks it might. He said the Liberty shop has done well
but it is difficult to get enough good people to work on the cars
in the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will make a huge difference,'' Benson said. He said
many of the people who have been working in Liberty commute about 1
1/2 hours each way from the Concord and Charlotte area.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a lot to ask of somebody that's working the hours they
work _ to work seven days a week and then ask them to drive 21
hours a week back and forth to work,'' Benson remarked.
</P>
<P>
   The addition of Kenseth could work for the others, because
Kenseth is considered by some to be the best driver in the Busch
ranks, Dale Earnhardt Jr. notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   Kenseth is not likely to tolerate second-class status among the
Roush teams, and with Martin involved, has a direct connection to
Roush.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever happens, it can't be any worse for Benson, Lepage
and Little, who are scraping bottom now.

RAIDER TRADITION LURED FORMER BUC KICKER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRANK BLACKMAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAPA, Calif. _ It isn't easy for any player who joins a new
team. If he's lucky, there'll be a few guys he's played with
before. Still, he's an outsider trying to fit in as quickly as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   It's an even tougher adjustment for a kicker.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Husted, the Raiders' new field-goal kicker, understands
there is a natural prejudice against the men who do his job. Most
of the time in training camp, they're trying to stay out of the way
while the rest of the team is hard at work preparing for the
season. And, anyway, everyone knows kickers are different _ you
know, a little weird.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I make my kicks they talk to me,'' Husted joked. ``Yeah,
I've always tried to break that stereotype of kickers being the
weird guys, the kooky guys, whatever you want to call us. I have a
lot of people in Tampa Bay say, `Wow, you're the most normal kicker
I've ever come across.'''
</P>
<P>
   Husted was with the Bucs last year, where he made 21 of 28
field- goal attempts, including a long of 52 yards. But that still
wasn't good enough to guarantee him a job for 1999. He got caught
in a salary cap squeeze and was told by management there was a good
chance he wouldn't be back.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than hanging around to find out for sure, Husted
instructed his agent to call the Raiders to see if they were
interested in him. He definitely was interested in them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been a Raiders fan,'' he said. ``I think they have
a great tradition. Mr. Davis (owner Al Davis) wants to win. He
gives every player an opportunity to come out here and win a game.
Like I said, the Raider tradition speaks for itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Players have been saying that for decades now. The problem is
that the Raiders' commitment to excellence hasn't resulted in a
Super Bowl victory since 1983. So how could that once-glorious
tradition affect a player like Husted? He was 13 years old the last
time the Raiders played in the sport's biggest game.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what makes a tradition,'' he said. ``There's just that
thing about the Raiders that you always hear growing up. A lot of
things when you grow up were very impressionable on you and they
stick with you. That's the way it was with me.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't enough that Husted wanted to play for the Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   His dream team had to want him, too. It did.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Davis was the field-goal kicker last year and finished the
season with the lowest (63) percentage in the NFL. See ya, Greg.
When Husted's agent called, coach Jon Gruden grabbed the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Husted because a couple of years ago he led the NFC in
touchbacks'' the coach explained. ``I think he's going to be a real
good kicker, and a real asset to our special teams.''
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders like Husted so much, they haven't even brought in
another kicker to compete with him in training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're only allowed to bring so many guys to camp nowadays,''
Gruden explained. ``When you have three or four kickers, you have
one less lineman or one less defensive back. You have to take that
into consideration. Ideally, you'd like to have competition
everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Husted has looked around and noticed that there aren't any other
guys lining up to practice field goals, too. But, he insists, that
doesn't make a bit of difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``First and foremost, I always compete with myself,'' he said.
``I've always had the approach that they can bring in one guy, they
can bring in 10 guys, I've still got to make my kicks. It's between
me and those uprights. If I don't make my kicks, it doesn't matter
what the other guys do. And if I make my kicks, it still doesn't
matter what the other guys do.''

THE 72 FACES OF KAREN BLACK  
 NEW RELEASES OF VIDEO CASSETTES: REVIEWS BY NEW YORK TIMES
CRITICS  
 PAST RELEASES: LITTLE FILMS THAT ROAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By PETER M. NICHOLS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE 72 FACES OF KAREN BLACK: Look up Karen Black's videography,
and the list of credits, while falling well short of, say, John
Wayne's, stretches about as long as any actor's. From 1960 and
``The Prime Time'' (a satire about a day of American television
without the censors) to 1997 and ``Cries of Silence'' (about a
traumatized girl found in the aftermath of Hurricane Camille), the
Black entries in ``Videohound's Golden Movie Retriever'' number 72.
(Wayne stands at 140.)
</P>
<P>
   Among these films are ``Easy Rider'' (1969), with Ms. Black
playing a prostitute, and Bob Rafelson's ``Five Easy Pieces''
(1970), in which she portrayed a waitress and received an Oscar
nomination and Golden Globe Award as best supporting actress. There
is also her acclaimed performance in ``Nashville,'' Robert Altman's
1975 classic, for which she also wrote two songs.
</P>
<P>
   Of all this work, what do many people remember most? ``Almost
everyone who comes up to me says `Trilogy of Terror,''' Ms. Black
said the other day. That would be Dan Curtis' three-part horror
film, made for television in 1975 and released on videocassette
last week by Anchor Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Black stars in all three episodes. In the first she is a
teacher toying with a student who makes the mistake of trying to
seduce her; in the second she is a woman with a monumental
split-personality disorder. In the third segment she is Amelia, the
victim of a foot-high jagged-toothed Zuni hunting doll she has
bought for her boyfriend. The doll's name is He Who Kills, and the
little man isn't kidding as he chases the frantic Amelia around her
apartment biting her on the ankles and elsewhere, cutting his way
out of suitcases, breaking through barricaded doors and finally
escaping cremation in a hot oven.
</P>
<P>
   People remember. ``I wish they said `that wonderful movie you
did for Robert Altman,' but they don't,'' Ms. Black said. ``They
say, `that little doll.'''
</P>
<P>
   For her, ``Easy Rider'' represents a turning point in films. In
the 1970s, she said, the studios realized that audiences wanted
reality. ``They wanted to see people throwing up, smoking grass,''
she said. For ``Nashville'' Altman used two cameras and did not
stage scenes. ``He would let you do what you did,'' she said. ``He
would find you there. The camera probed into the room and found the
reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Even current action films, she added, have more interesting
material within. ``Inside the framework of that adolescent plot
line, you still have people with idiosyncrasies, real problems,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   These days she concentrates on writing films as well as acting.
Now and then she advises young filmmakers who seek her opinion. One
of her own projects, she said, was developed at the screenwriter's
lab at the Sundance Film Festival. As an actor, she prefers art
films that play the festival circuit, though she says that their
directors, concerned primarily with character, should pay more
attention to story. ``They aren't disciplined enough,'' she said.
``They might have to admit they don't know everything.''

   Out there in the romantic suds are the high-powered Chicago
newspaperwoman Theresa Osborne (Robin Wright Penn) and the laconic
sailboat builder Garret Blake (Kevin Costner). Taken with a longing
note from a man to a woman that she has found corked in a bottle,
Theresa analyzes the cork, plots ocean currents and tracks down
Garret, the note's author, an aw-shucks kind of guy who lives on
the Outer Banks of North Carolina. Cozy snuggling ensues on beach
and boat, followed by Garret's winningly awkward trek to Chicago.
Nevertheless, Costner, who should stay out of overalls and goggles,
seems stodgy in, Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times, a
``prettily torpid film with the warm glow of a hazelnut coffee

   In a radical overhaul of Choderlos de Laclos' 18th-century novel
``Les Liaisons Dangereuses,'' the sexual predators are turned into
very late '90s teen-agers and placed in Manhattan. A nasty pair of
brats, Sebastian Valmont (Ryan Phillippe) and Kathryn Merteuil
(Sarah Michelle Gellar) plot the ruin of young friends and make a
bet. Either Valmont beds the very virtuous Annette (Reese
Witherspoon) or Kathryn gets his prized 1956 Jaguar. Half-baked
subplots involving bisexuality and interracial sex only further
undo a movie whose tone ``veers uncertainly between comedy and soap
opera'' (Stephen Holden).

   Not much plot is required in Carlos Saura's thrilling film,
which wafts dreamily through countless forms of tango music. At the
center is Mario (Miguel Angel Sola), properly brooding and
smoldering, a director who, having been abandoned (cruelly) by his
wife, turns his attentions to a sylph (Mia Maestro) and gangster's
girlfriend. Heat to a boil in performances that alternately move
from decorous to furiously angry in a film that ``finds artful ways
to turn each tango encounter into something new'' (Janet Maslin). &QL;

   Say what you will about Myles Berkowitz, but he did come up with
a salable gimmick for a documentary. Date 20 different women in Los
Angeles and fall in love with one of them, all on camera. Berkowitz
doesn't mind embarrassing people, but he's often as dismissive of
himself as he is of others. That can be amusing, as are gambits
like not having enough money or getting kicked out of Spago for
bringing a camera crew. ``But whenever `20 Dates' begins to
establish a playful mood, it's liable to do something to make you
squirm'' (Janet Maslin).

A QUESTION OF HONOR: TEXAS COMPANY WINS $14.5 MILLION IN FOOD
FIGHT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Okla.) 
 
By SHANNON BUGGS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Gene Chung has experienced every high and low a
small-business owner can have.
</P>
<P>
   His Chung's Gourmet Foods, which makes egg rolls and frozen
Oriental meals, has been recognized as one of the city's best
start-ups but has been on the verge of bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   This week, however, a state district court jury in Houston
awarded his company $14.5 million in damages in a civil lawsuit
Chung brought against a competitor he says stole his biggest
client.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my first experience with the judicial system,'' Chung
said. ``I am, of course, very pleased.''
</P>
<P>
   Chung started his company in 1986 in a 3,000-square-foot plant
in the suburbs. In about three years, his factory was producing
80,000 egg rolls each day and his workers were stepping all over
each other to make them.
</P>
<P>
   He got a low-interest loan from a city-run economic development
program and in 1990 opened a plant closer to downtown. That
expansion allowed Chung's Gourmet Foods to compete with Minh Foods
Co. of nearby Pasadena, the nation's No. 1 egg roll producer in the
early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   By 1993, Chung had added frozen specialties, such as moo goo gai
pan, to its product line, employed 300 people and developed
vacuum-packed cartons shaped like traditional takeout containers.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the first setback occurred. In 1994, Chung's biggest
customer, Pace, a food wholesaler operating mainly in the
Northeast, closed its doors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overnight Pace went out of business and overnight we lost $6
million,'' Chung said.
</P>
<P>
   But within a few months, VIP Sales Co. of Tulsa, Okla.,
approached Chung's about becoming the exclusive entree manufacturer
for VIP's Taipan line of frozen Oriental dinners. Chung already had
supplied VIP with frozen egg rolls.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were doing some entrees on their own and we thought they
had the capability of making ours,'' said Guy W. Lewis, owner of
VIP, which freezes vegetables and fruits for its own brand as well
as private-label brands sold by grocery chains.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Chung's and VIP signed an exclusive three-year contract
for Chung's to make entrees only for Taipan and for VIP to buy
entrees for Taipan only from Chung's.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis says soon after they signed the agreement, the quality of
Chung's entrees went down. He says the company did not automate its
plant as quickly as it had promised, and it failed to include the
amounts of chicken, beef and vegetables in the meals specified by
VIP.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ended up with a lot of rice,'' Lewis said. ``We had a lot
of customer complaints, and we lost customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Chung, however, said his company followed VIP's orders to the
letter, including reducing the meat portion of the meals from 2
ounces to 1.2 ounces, so more of VIP's vegetables could be used in
the meals, reducing VIP's cost.
</P>
<P>
   The companies' differences would have been worked out, Chung
said, if a rival entree manufacturer had not become involved.
</P>
<P>
   At some point in 1995, VIP began talking with McKinney-based
Delta DailyFood of Texas, a subsidiary of a privately held Dutch
company. Lewis eventually decided to end the contract with Chung's
and begin using Delta DailyFood as his supplier.
</P>
<P>
   Chung responded with a breach of contract arbitration lawsuit in
1996. But the damage had been done. VIP represented $3.5 million in
revenue to Chung's every year, said Chung's attorney Adam Schiffer,
a partner with Vinson &AMP; Elkins in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``VIP was larger than all of Chung's 19 other customers,'' he
said. ``As a result of the termination of the contract, Chung's was
forced to the brink of bankruptcy.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Chung asked Yellowstone Capital, an equity investment
firm that also operates food supply companies, for help. The firm
gave Chung's an undisclosed amount of money in exchange for 70
percent ownership.
</P>
<P>
   ``We called it a merger,'' said Chung, ``but they are now the
majority owner.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the arbitration proceedings ended in October after
eight months. Chung did not have the money to continue. But in
December of that year, Schiffer agreed to work on contingency while
Chung sued Delta DailyFood for tortious interference with a
contract.
</P>
<P>
   Under contract law, a business can be found to have interfered
in a contract if it knows or should know that the contract exists
and disregards that to pursue a relationship with one of the
parties.
</P>
<P>
   Chung's lawsuit contended Delta DailyFood knew about his
company's exclusive three-year contract with VIP and bullied VIP
into firing Chung's. The jury agreed and granted the company a
multimillion-dollar award based on an evaluation of how much the
firm lost because its contract with VIP ended prematurely. Chung's
attorneys were awarded $430,000 in fees.
</P>
<P>
   But Katrina Packard, an attorney for Delta DailyFood, said her
client was approached by VIP because that company wanted to be rid
of Chung's.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my understanding that this happens all the time in
business,'' she said. ``I think consideration of an appeal is
imminent.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said no one twisted his arm about leaving Chung's and that
he testified to that at the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot see how that jury awarded him that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When the case is finally settled, if he gets any money from it,
Chung says he plans to try to buy back a majority stake in his
company. But he will discuss that with his partner to find out what
will work best for both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this country, you have to honor a contract,'' he said.
``You cannot break it; you have to honor it.''

 &HT;    AIRPORTS LOOKING FOR MAJOR BOOST FROM CONGRESS
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    ATTN GEORGIA, TEXAS, FLORIDA: Story contains funding estimates
for airports in your states 
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A massive influx of federal funds to expand and
renovate the nation's crammed airports has flown into a holding
pattern in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   With parts of current aviation law due to expire August 6, the
Senate has yet to schedule action on a bill to overhaul the
aviation system, amid concerns that a House-passed version will be
a budget-buster.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, aviation backers continue to hold high hopes for
legislation to modernize air traffic control systems and improve
airports that are stretched to the breaking point by a huge
increase in passengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really do believe that this year we'll see some movement,''
said Darryl Jenkins, professor of aviation at George Washington
University. ``Congress is now tackling this issue _ they've put it
off for years.''
</P>
<P>
   Such optimism is based partly on legislation that glided easily
through the House last spring. That bill, sponsored by
Transportation Committee Chairman Bud Shuster, R-Pa., would triple
annual payments to major airports from funds raised through ticket
and fuel taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would also raise the cap on airport fees from $3
to $6 per passenger, an increase that would be a potential boon,
especially to high-volume airports in the Sun Belt.
</P>
<P>
   Under the House bill, Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport
would receive $27 million beginning in the year 2001, triple its
current $9 million entitlement for construction and improvements.
And an increase in passenger fees could be a major source of added
revenue for Hartsfield, which in 1997 served 33 million passengers,
the most in the nation. Georgia's total entitlement for its major
airports would rise to $44.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Florida, with its overall high volume of tourism, would receive
$100 million for its major airports, triple the current statewide
payment. Miami International Airport would get $14.7 million
compared with $4.9 million now. Fort Lauderdale's entitlement would
go up from $2.3 million to $6.8 million. And Palm Beach
International's payment would go from $1.5 million to $4.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Texas airports would receive $136 million compared with the
current rate of $45 million. Under the proposal, Houston and Dallas
combined would receive $48 million. Austin would be entitled to
$4.5 million in the House bill, compared with $1.5 million now.
</P>
<P>
   Airport managers would do well not to count on all of these
hikes in the House bill, which would cost $57 billion over four
years. The Senate version of the legislation would hold spending
close to current rates. And a bipartisan group of senators,
including Budget Chairman Pete V. Domenici, R-N.M., are protesting
a House plan to exempt the airport spending from budget limits. In
a letter to Senate leaders last week, they opposed ``any
legislation establishing special budgetary treatment for aviation
programs.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, an expected House-Senate compromise later this year would
almost certainly increase spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm optimistic the way things are going,'' said Dan Molloy,
aviation design and construction manager at Hartsfield
International Airport. Molloy said that more federal funds would
ease the way for building two new taxiways and adding a fifth
runway in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Such expansions are needed nationwide, said Jenkins, as
congestion clogs airports, delays flights, and causes frustration
for the flying public, who are crammed into waiting areas and often
bumped from over-booked flights.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an air traffic control system at airports that on a
good day is totally maxed out,'' Jenkins said. ``There is no
flexibility at all.''
</P>
<P>
   With air traffic controllers still using antiquated equipment
and procedures, flights are frequently delayed and hundreds are
cancelled solely because of inadequate facilities, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins assigned the blame broadly: ``The airlines should have
brought this up as a problem years ago. The White House has not
shown proper respect to aviation infrastructure. The FAA (Federal
Aviation Administration) is bogged down in bureaucratic processes,
and the Congress holds hearings but does not act.''
</P>
<P>
   He said of the current legislation, ``Anything we do will make a
difference. We haven't done squat, so the problem keeps getting
larger.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It can now be firmly said that First Lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton also wears the pants in her family, both literally
and figuratively.
</P>
<P>
   Natty, tailored pants suits in a range of cheerful colors have
become her favorite uniform for official events, from a simple silk
number for the daytime semi-announcement of her Senate candidacy to
a white satin affair for an evening theater gala. They are her new
trademark.
</P>
<P>
   We have grown so accustomed to the fresh look that reporters
were startled when she appeared in a rare skirt at the recent New
York memorial service for John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife and
sister-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   Is it news that a first lady has a penchant for pants as the
20th century nears an end? Well, yes. It represents another break
with the stuffy traditions that historically have entombed first
ladies.
</P>
<P>
   As the first president's wife to have a professional career
before entering the White House, Hillary Clinton has steadily
sought ways to affirm her own identity. Her aggressive move into
public policy with a sweeping health care overhaul was not a
success. Nor were her many hairdos, until this latest simple cut.
</P>
<P>
   With her new attire, she is inescapably making a political
statement of independence and modernity. And it works.
</P>
<P>
   She also reflects the national inclination of both genders
toward increasingly casual dress in the workplace as well as at
home. She's a trendsetter. She is nudging fashion along, but not
doing anything really scary or radical.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing color-coordinated pants suits is smart of her. She looks
good in them _ and feminine to boot. They are more attractive on a
middle-aged woman than the clumsy mid-thigh-length skirts, the
dowdy long skirts or the too-provocative short-short skirts.
</P>
<P>
   Any female who sees herself on television in a short skirt
showing more leg than is tasteful as she goes down the steep stairs
from Air Force One to the tarmac is bound to desire a more flexible
and less constricting costume.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, often photographed
showing a great expanse of stockinged thigh while sitting beside
important world leaders and negotiating tough global issues, would
do well to copy the first lady's example.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, this sartorial change is unusual for a president's
wife. Hillary Clinton's predecessors were never photographed in
anything but skirts at public events. In the bad old days not so
long ago, slacks were considered unacceptably mannish.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Nixon forbade his wife Patricia to be seen in slacks
even on their vacations, but Nancy Reagan wore jeans when she and
Ronald Reagan relaxed at their California ranch. Normally the
height of elegance, Mrs. Reagan did make a fashion blooper once by
appearing at a formal reception abroad in velvet knickers. The
knickers created a sensation of the wrong kind and were never seen
again.
</P>
<P>
   Photographs of Barbara Bush anywhere, even on vacation at the
family summer home in Kennebunkport, Maine, invariably show her in
skirts.
</P>
<P>
   But Tipper Gore, the vice president's wife, often emulates the
first lady by appearing at public events or posing for photographs
in pants suits. Female members of Congress are also spotted from
time to time in pants, although none wears them as regularly as
Hillary Clinton now does.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush's wife Laura sometimes shows up at
campaign events in pants. However, GOP presidential hopeful
Elizabeth Dole, a genuinely old-fashioned Southern belle, wears
only skirts.
</P>
<P>
   Female pants suits are part of every working woman's wardrobe.
This columnist is wearing one as she writes.
</P>
<P>
   On their new covers both bibles of the fashion world, Vogue and
Harper's Bazaar, feature models wearing pants rather than skirts.
Vogue's model wears a tasteful tan and red sporty number suitable
for most activities short of a formal ball. Bazaar opted for a
sleazy, sexy look appropriate for bar-hopping but not for political
campaigns or the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   The fashion industry itself is partly to blame for this confused
and transitional state of affairs. For two decades, designers have
been trying to put women in frivolous clothes that bag and sag,
fluff and puff, and make us look stupid. Enough already.
</P>
<P>
   We've been expected to look like impoverished waifs in skimpy
rags that cling to imperfect figures like limpets, or like tarts in
daytime sequins and fishnet stockings, or juveniles in shapeless
baby-doll dresses, or hags in weird costumes of clashing prints and
colors. The latest idiocy is the notion that women should wrap
themselves in bulky bedding-type material, waddling out into the
world as tubs of lard in outfits that would overflow ordinary
closets.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times reports that the big Paris fashion show last
week was a strange collection of black leather outfits with
chain-link tunics, English hunting garb with feathered hats
featuring embalmed birds and jackets with collars of knitted balls.
The Times found much of it ``ludicrous.'' So would any woman in her
right mind, which Hillary Clinton definitely is.
</P>
<P>
   For much of this decade, working women hid out by wearing
so-called power suits, plain jackets with straight skirts cut off
primly at the knee and accompanied by plain blouses, often with
bows. Barbara Bush popularized three-strand pearls to go with this
ensemble.
</P>
<P>
   This was a safe approach to the tricky business of being taken
seriously in the office while still being attractive enough to
avoid the dreaded wallflower limbo after hours. But it was boring.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton has now shaken free of that dullness in favor of
functional, flattering outfits in which she seems comfortable. It's
her brains, not her legs, that count anyway.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Concept cars have long been a staple of automobile
shows because these vehicles allow automakers to achieve two
self-serving goals simultaneously: Manufacturers can appear to be
engineering leaders by showing off state-of-the-art technology
(even if some of it is so conceptual it may never find its way into
mass production) while keeping consumers hooked on one of the
industry's most potent narcotics _ the dream machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Different Roads: Automobiles for the Next Century,'' an
exhibit that opened July 22 at the Museum of Modern Art, takes the
concept car and turns the concept on its head. Although all the
vehicles displayed in the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Sculpture Garden
include cutting-edge engineering and design features, some are
already available to consumers in various countries, and most of
the others will soon be as well.
</P>
<P>
   And far from being fantasy inducing, these vehicles _ designed
for a world running short of clean air, crude oil and parking
spaces _ offer a conscience-awakening look at the types of cars
that we may not want to drive in the future, but probably will have
to.
</P>
<P>
   The poster child for the show is its smallest exhibit: the Smart
Car, a joint venture of DaimlerChrysler and Swatch. Sport utility
owners may shudder at its length: a shade under 100 inches long.
With little more than a dashboard and two seats inside, the Smart
Car looks as if it could have accidentally rolled off a conveyor
belt on a Disney World ride. But in Europe, where it has been on
sale since 1998, it is smart indeed, taking up half a typical
parking spot.
</P>
<P>
   As small as the Ford Ka is _ 143 inches long _ it is about 45
percent longer than the Smart Car. About a half million Kas have
been sold in Australia, Europe, Latin America and Japan since 1996.
The Ka looks at home in the Modern: Its exterior and interior are
marked by soothing, organic curves and long, unbroken lines.
Nonetheless, its name _ an Egyptian word for soul _ may seem like a
self-deprecating joke. It's so small, a three-letter word is far
too lavish to describe it.
</P>
<P>
   For drivers whose cars represent an inviolable and essential
chunk of their personal space, two vehicles in ``Different Roads''
provide the comforting promise that the spacious interior is safe
for Year 2000 and beyond. The Audi Al2, a 1,700-pound minivan
expected to go on sale in Europe later this year, uses extensive
aluminum construction and takes styling cues from the Audi TT. The
museum notes play up features that are not unusual _ navigation
system, clutchless manual transmission _ but ignore the intriguing
multilens head lamps.
</P>
<P>
   Another minivan, the Fiat Multipla Bipower, comes by its
tongue-twisting name deservedly. Its hybrid engine can combine
gasoline use with diesel, electric or methane. The dashboard makes
ergonomic sense: The screen for the navigation system is directly
in front of the driver (the instruments _ requiring less-frequent
glances by comparison _ are in the middle). Or the screen can be
plugged in to face the passengers, to show movies to entertain
children. The middle front seat can even be replaced by a small
refrigerator. Not to worry, though. Americans won't be adding
refrigerator raids to their long list of driving distractions
because there are no plans to sell the Multipla in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Hybrid and alternative-power cars are also represented at the
Modern's exhibit: the General Motors EV1 electric, available for
lease in Western states, and the Honda VV and Toyota Prius,
gasoline-electric hybrids to go on sale here within a year. The
Prius features homely styling typical of the Japan-only market, but
the VV (to be called Insight here), like the EV1, has a tapered
tail reminiscent of Citroen sedans.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Citroens, the one vehicle that does more to produce
dread for the future of car styling than any other is the
DaimlerChrysler Composite Concept Vehicle _ CCV for short (like
everything in this exhibit). It is meant to evoke the Citroen 2CV
and to be as easy to build as a toy, but its injection-molded
plastic body makes the CCV seem more like motorized lawn furniture.
The CCV will be marketed in developing countries, which may or may
not ease their resentment of the major economic powers.
</P>
<P>
   `Different Roads: Automobiles for the Next Century' is at the
Museum of Modern Art (212) 708-9400, through Sept. 21.

 &HT;    Booknotes: Old JFK Jr. bios selling, new ones upcoming
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the publishing world discovered when Princess Diana died in a
car accident, nothing sells books like the tragic death of a
much-loved celebrity. Expect the same with John F. Kennedy Jr.
Three previously published biographies of Kennedy already have hit
Amazon.com's Hot 100 list and the publishing dates of new bios have
been moved up.
</P>
<P>
   Currently available are ``The JFK Jr. Scrapbook'' (Citadel,
$15.95) by Stephen J. Spignesi; ``John F. Kennedy Jr.: A Life in
the Spotlight'' (Andrews McMee , $14.95) by Michael and Montague
Druitt; and ``Prince Charming: The John F. Kennedy Jr. Story''
(Signet, $6.99) by Wendy Leigh.
</P>
<P>
   According to Publishers Weekly, the books are going back to
press for updated editions that are expected to hit stores by this
weekend. Also arriving this week is ``The Kennedys: The Third
Generation'' (Pinnacle, $5.99) by Barbara Gibson and Ted Schwartz.
The paperback originally was scheduled to hit stores in October.
</P>
<P>
   Other books in the works are ``The Kennedy Weddings'' by St.
Martin's Press and ``The Kennedy Men'' by Laurence Leamer. And C.
David Heymann, the author of ``A Woman Named Jackie,'' has pitched
a proposal for a new JFK Jr. bio.
</P>
<P>
   So far, sales of books about the Kennedys are not that great,
says Chapter 11 bookstore owner Barbara Babbitt Kaufman, but she
expects that to change once the books about JFK Jr. arrive.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are waiting for these,'' she says. ``And on the `Prince
Charming' book, they're going back to press in hardback. That's how
strongly they believe the books will sell.''
</P>
<P>
   But what about making a profit from tragedy?
</P>
<P>
   Neither the authors nor the booksellers see it that way.
``People want to know more,'' author Spignesi said in one
interview. ``That's just the nature of American society.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman agrees. ``You're giving the consumer something to
perpetuate the memory. ''
</P>
<P>
   -- Teen tomes: Contrary to popular belief, teenagers do read
books. In a survey, Book magazine reports that 61 percent of kids
between 12 and 19 say they read books for pleasure. Of course,
that's not as many as watch television (98 percent), but it's
encouraging. And they aren't just reading trash. Matthew Smith, 16,
a student at Paideia School in Atlanta, told the magazine two of
his favorite authors are Victor Hugo and Ray Bradbury. Others list
John Grisham, Mary Higgins Clark and Stephen King as their
favorites, but they also read Jane Austen, William Faulkner and
Shakespeare. What should teens be reading? Anything is better than
nothing, but Book magazine's recommendations include ``The Perks of
Being a Wallflower'' by Stephen Chbosky, ``East of Eden'' by John
Steinbeck, ``The True Confessions of Charlotte Doyle'' by Avi,
``Slaughterhouse Five'' by Kurt Vonnegut and ``Rule of the Bone''
by Russell Banks.
</P>
<P>
   -- Politics and publishing: Hillary Rodham Clinton will be in
the publishing spotlight as well as the political when she
officially starts her Senate campaign in New York. ReganBooks has
signed Peggy Noonan, a former Reagan speechwriter, to write a book
about the first lady's campaign. ``The Case Against Hillary
Clinton'' will be published next spring. Meanwhile, Gail Sheehy's
biography, ``Hillary's Choice,'' is scheduled for release in
September from Random House, and Christopher Andersen's ``Bill and
Hillary: The Marriage'' is due from Morrow in late August. Still to
come next year from HarperCollins is ``The First Couple, State of a
Union'' by Jerry Oppenheimer.
</P>
<P>
   -- Making a point: The spring/summer issue of Five Points,
Georgia State University's literary magazine edited by Pam Durban
and David Bottoms, has an impressive lineup of talent. In addition
to a short story by Alice Hoffman and essays by Andre Dubus and
Rick Bass, the magazine features an in-depth interview with
Frederick Busch, author of the critically acclaimed novel ``The
Night Inspector.''

 &HT;    Winslow's cool insurance-fraud thriller is one fiery-fun read
 &HT;    EMBARGOED UNTIL SUNDAY, AUG. 1
 &HT;    By J. Edwin Smith
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Incendiary is the word that best describes Don Winslow's latest
novel. To use the vernacular of its lead character, Jack Wade:
``Surf's up, dude. So let the sparks fly. Let the eagles feast.
Let's go dance with the (expletive).''
</P>
<P>
   The expletive in question is fire _ what Prometheus gave to man
to warm his caves, cook his food, incinerate his fellow man in all
manner of nasty combustion. Which is where Jack Wade comes into
play. He adjusts fire claims for California Fire &AMP; Life Mutual. Too
often, it's grisly work: dudes crawling inside a booze bottle,
tanking out and lighting a cigarette, then dozing off with the
cigarette smoldering on the sheets, which eventually ignite. And
when that happens, says Wade, ``What's left is ... ah, well, you
end up scraping the dudes off the bed springs.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what the coroner had to do with Pamela Vale. Police
contend she was a drunk and druggie, that when she zonked out with
a lit cigarette and subsequently became a crispy critter, it was
her own fault, which is why they rule the fire to be accidental.
</P>
<P>
   Whoaaaaaa, says Jack. Pamela had supposedly dried out. And she
didn't smoke. At least not until she was lying in bed with the
flames licking at her thighs. It just doesn't make sense. And what
about the fact that her financially strapped husband filed the
insurance claim on the very morning his wife and heavily mortgaged
house went up in flames?
</P>
<P>
   There you have it: the making of a good novel. Why, any rube
could take it from there and hold your attention. But only a Don
Winslow could make this bad boy snap, crackle and pop. Only a Don
Winslow could make you cringe and laugh within seconds of each
other. The man's gift for creating biting prose is that good.
</P>
<P>
   Incorporating Left Coast ``cool dude'' dialogue, a cast of truly
memorable characters and a masterful plot device that sizzles from
the book's opening page to its flashpoint finish, Winslow gives new
meaning to the term ``hot read.''
</P>
<P>
   There's something here for everybody. Winslow gives us a
penetrating insider's glimpse of the compost heap that is the
insurance industry. He puts us into the shoes of an arsonist, takes
us into a warehouse and allows us to strike the match; then he lays
out the telltale evidence that, long after the flames have been
quenched, would send us to jail.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything else, though, Winslow gives us a true
villain: Mother Russia, a character as despicable as anything in
recent memory, including Hannibal Lecter.

 &HT;    MYSTERY ROUNDUP: Taking notice of series sleuths' latest
goings-on
 &HT;    EMBARGOED UNTIL SUNDAY, AUG. 1
 &HT;    By Carolyn Nizzi Warmbold
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The sleuth, more than plot, is central to long-running mystery
series featuring characters fans have come to know. One reads the
newest novels about Kay Scarpetta, Kathleen Mallory and Lou Boldt
to keep tabs on the events of their lives as much as to find out
whodunit.
</P>
<P>
   -- Black Notice by Patricia Cornwell
</P>
<P>
   (Putnam, $25.95).
</P>
<P>
   Kay Scarpetta, chief medical examiner of Virginia, is not
holding up well after the gruesome death of her lover, Benton
Wesley. In addition to dealing with her grief, she faces a
multitude of problems: A disgruntled employee sets up a bogus and
embarrassing Internet chat room in her name, a new woman police
chief seems bent on destroying her and police officer Pete Marino's
credibility, niece Lucy gets involved in a dangerous drug sting
that goes wrong, an unidentified body shows up in a ship from
Europe and a serial killer with werewolf (yes, werewolf)
characteristics is savaging women. The search for the killer takes
Kay to Europe and Interpol, to events in her past and into the arms
of a new lover.
</P>
<P>
   The mystery is not without flaws: At times, Marino's bluster
grows tiresome, and Kay's lapse of judgment at the end of the book
seems a demand of plot rather than a function of character. But
this is one of Cornwell's better reads and holds up because of its
Gothic overtones. Evil increasingly becomes incarnate in
Scarpetta's universe, inveigling its way through the seem-
</P>
<P>
   ingly secure doors of one's house and heart.
</P>
<P>
   -- Shell Game by Carol O'Connell (Putnam, $24.95).
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell, whose last work was the outstanding ``Judas Child,''
excels in complex psychological explorations. ``Shell Game'' is
perhaps her riskiest and most ambitious book. The novel opens in
the mind of Malakhai, a magician in a private hospital in upstate
New York. As he awakes from a dream or from a minor stroke, he
watches a magician friend die performing a trick on television.
Kathleen Mallory of the New York Police Department, convinced that
the death is not an accident, investigates it, and ensuing deaths,
with risk to her reputation, life and career. The magical murder
tour takes her into the past, to Nazi Germany, to the death of
Malakhai's wife (from a magic trick during the war), into the
psychotic, to Malakhai, with whom she becomes enchanted.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell admirably treads the tightrope between appearance and
reality, memory and history, the magic and mundane. But events are
obscured by the book's permeating hallucinogenic haze that depletes
reader interest in the identity of the murderers (past and present)
or the mechanics of their dastardly tricks. Still O'Connell
achieves a nuanced portrait of the increasingly anti-social
Mallory, who perhaps because of her own brush with psychosis in
childhood, understands the darker chambers of the human mind.
</P>
<P>
   -- The First Victim by Ridley Pearson
</P>
<P>
   (Hyperion, $23.95).
</P>
<P>
   On the heels of his ``Pied Piper,'' a chilling page turner about
a ring of kidnappers, Pearson gives us another installment in the
life and career of Seattle police detective Lou Boldt. Someone is
illegally shipping Chinese women into the United States, where they
are enslaved in sweatshops. When some of the women die, Boldt and
Sgt. John LaMoia are assigned to the case. Their investigation is
made more difficult by an arrogant Immigration and Naturalization
Service official and a woman TV anchor whose Asian-born adopted
sister has disappeared while reporting on the case.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to care for anybody besides Boldt in this book, and
the plot is only intermittently engaging. LaMoia is remarkably
sexist, the TV anchor surpasses all ethical bounds, Boldt's wife,
though courageously fighting cancer, may grate on readers' nerves.
And the characterization of a Chinese woman connected to the
underworld borders on the stereotypical. All in all, a rare
disappointment from Pearson.

 &HT;    Fresh Fatboy Slim puts new spin on old beat
 &HT;    EMBARGOED UNTIL SUNDAY, AUG. 1
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service

   Records skipping. CDs jamming. Syllables frozen, isolated and
repeated, faster and faster or slower and slower until they lose
all conscious meaning and dissolve into hypnotic dada poetry, so
much verbal vertigo.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Cook, the British DJ sensation who is conquering the
United States as the clever oxymoron named Fatboy Slim, understands
the genius of repetition. His music thrives on stuttered catch
phrases, crazy walloping rhythms and twitchy eccentric grooves,
monstrous guitar and keyboard riffs that lurch and swoop out of the
flux, only to keep lurching and swooping. With two turntables, a
modest mixing board and a bunch of vinyl LPs, he creates
psychedelic fugues and roaring funk frenzies. In the United
Kingdom, it's called Big Beat. Here, it's the trendiest background
noise ever, the skittish pulse of hip TV commercials, movie
soundtracks, video games.
</P>
<P>
   It's what drew about 2,000 teen and college-age kids to the
Tabernacle recently, tweaked to the gills on ... mere nervous
energy?
</P>
<P>
   Whatever its guise _ techno, house, big beat, electronica,
garage _ this is music that seems to achieve much of its punch from
extra-musical stimulants. As pop events go, Fatboy Slim's show was
at once anachronistic and slightly ahead of its time. The vibe,
enhanced by two large screens flashing with images of vaguely
ominous smiley faces and animated geometric patterns, was very
1960s, a psychedelic light show upgraded for the MTV-saturated.
Yet, there was no band, just the devilishly grinning Cook pirating
everything from Who licks (at least it sounded like the opening
chords of ``I Can't Explain'') to percolating bongo beats to the
surf guitars and infectious mantra _ ``Right about now, the funk
soul brother'' _ of his stateside breakthrough hit, ``Rockafeller
Skank.'' At most concerts, the moment when the headlining act
arrives on stage is dramatic. You kind of lose that when it's just
some guy who looks like he wandered in off the beach, toting a bin
of old records.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, well: that's the 1999 part. We live in the post-rock era, if
an era can be telescopically redefined as five or six years. Like a
scavenger in a dystopian Mad Max adventure, Fatboy Slim sorts
through the wreckage and builds a wacky go kart. What surprised was
how entertaining he was behind those wheels of steel. He had moves
to match the hyper-kinetic music: cocking his head back and forth
like a parrot; wagging his fingers at the crowd like a gunslinger;
half-circling his hand in the air, as if ``spinning'' the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Historically speaking, Norman Cook isn't up to anything new.
Steve Reich, one of the important composers to emerge from the
minimalist movement of the '60s, was messing around with tape
recorders and repeated phrases that looped in and out of sync on
his 1965 piece ``It's Gonna Rain,'' which features the voice of a
San Francisco Pentecostal street preacher named Brother Walter. At
17 minutes and 47 seconds, ``It's Gonna Rain'' is best appreciated
by the dedicated private listener late at night on headphones. I've
used it to drive people out of my house. What's new is that, 34
years after Reich toted his microphone out to a public square,
people will pay $25 to experience a funkier version of the same
thing. Contemporary DJs even pay homage on the recently issued CD,
``Reich Remixed'' (Nonesuch). Though conceptually nifty, the
project mostly suggests the DJs would be better off digging up
their own discrete sources.
</P>
<P>
   That's the beauty of Fatboy Slim. He sounds fresh, even though
he's not. When they start selling those '90s hit compilations on
cable TV in a couple of years, the DJ's latest CD ``You've Come a
Long Way, Baby'' (Skint/Astralwerks) will likely provide a few
tracks. It's the sound of these times and proof, too, that what
comes around goes around. Like an old record.

 &HT;    White rappers: Hip-hop hybrids shaking up rock
 &HT;    EMBARGOED UNTIL SUNDAY, AUG. 1
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Greetings from Screamville. A few thousand preteen girls are
yelling, bouncing up and down, waving their hands in the air on a
recent late afternoon at Lakewood Amphitheatre. Atlanta-based
entertainer DJ Nabs mans a turntable at the side of the stage,
where the hot new boy band 98 Degrees will perform later.
</P>
<P>
   That's why all the girls are here. But that's not what prompts
their energetic outburst. It's the disc Nabs is spinning: hard-core
rapper DMX's ``Ruff Ryders Anthem,'' a tune whose undeniable
rhythmic insurgency has even the kindergarten crew getting down.
</P>
<P>
   Roll back a few months to Atlanta's Music Midtown festival. Kid
Rock, a 27-year-old Detroit performer who describes his fusion of
hip-hop rhymes and AC/DC riffs as ``hick-hop,'' is onstage. He
surveys a tightly packed crowd of maybe 10,000, mostly white fans
in their teens and early 20s, hoisting beers and pumping their
fists to his testosterone-fueled anthems of lowlife misadventures.
When Kid Rock glances up, he can't miss a downtown billboard
plastered with his likeness. Braided hair, cigar jutting from the
side of his mouth, flashy clothes, bowler. If his music is equal
parts Ted Nugent and Sugarhill Gang, he must have taken his fashion
tips from Iceberg Slim's ``Pimp: The Story of My Life.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not hard to connect the dots between these two scenes. If
rap music once was the preserve of Bronx housing projects, it's now
something that any budding young music consumer grows up listening
to. Four decades after Norman Mailer's classic essay ``The White
Negro'' called attention to the birth of the hipster, urban black
culture _ blues and jazz in the 1950s, rap in the 1990s _ continues
to transform the popular culture around it. At this point, in fact,
hip-hop is the popular culture, and everything else adapts to it.
</P>
<P>
   Especially rock music, which in recent months has tapped into
rap's raw voltage to challenge the chart supremacy of manufactured
pop acts such as Britney Spears, the Backstreet Boys and their
sugar-coated like. Performers, such as Kid Rock, whose ``Devil
Without a Cause'' has spawned three hit singles, Florida's seething
Limp Bizkit and California's proud-to-be-dysfunctional Korn, have
discovered the merits of grafting hip-hop trappings onto rock's
power chords. Meanwhile, a former white rapper, Everlast of the
group House of Pain (``Jump Around''), has crossed over to the
modern rock charts with his socially conscious ``Whitey Ford Sings
the Blues,'' a cycle of cautionary tales that translate as hip-hop
for the coffeehouse crowd. More comically, there are the Detroit
acts Eminem (``My Name Is ...'') _ now on the road with the
mosh-happy Warped Tour _ and Insane Clown Posse, who play
disturbing scenarios for outlandish, often self-deprecating effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen anything like this since the early grunge days
when Nirvana came out of nowhere,'' says Leslie Fram, program
director of Atlanta's influential rock station 99X (WNNX-FM), which
has aggressively pushed Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit. ``It's the
biggest phenomenon. Limp Bizkit sold 22,000 records in Atlanta in
less than three weeks. Its album (`Significant Other') debuted at
No. 1 and stayed for three weeks against mass appeal acts like
Ricky Martin.''
</P>
<P>
   What's significant, Fram notes, is that bands such as Limp
Bizkit and Korn _ which had formerly cultivated an underground
audience _ ``are making videos for MTV and recording songs that can
be played on the radio.'' Fram laughs, acknowledging that the music
is still the edgiest in its format. ``A 30-year-old female who
listens to 99X may not want to hear (Limp Bizkit's) `The Nookie' at
lunchtime.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, that poses no obstacle to other listeners.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing artificial about this. Anyone younger than 24
has pretty much lived their entire conscious life with hip-hop,''
says Jim Kerr, alternative radio editor for the industry
publication Radio &AMP; Records. ``Rock as a genre has transformed
itself and embraced a new point of view by including hip-hop
elements. Rock has gone through grunge and the corporate rock of
the '80s and punk, but it's all various shades of angry vocals over
guitar, bass and drums. You haven't seen a whole lot of stylistic
change since the Beatles. Nothing in terms of genre-bending has
happened to rock like we're seeing now.''
</P>
<P>
   Chuck D, whose seminal rap group Public Enemy has exerted a
strong influence over rock acts since the late 1980s, isn't as
impressed. ``This topic is old, man,'' says the Atlanta-based
performer, who raps on the ``metal'' version of ``P.E. 2000,'' the
new single from Puff Daddy. The track features Concentration Camp,
Chuck D's latest project, which approaches the hybrid from the
hip-hop side. ``I don't know why people keep talking about it. When
MTV did `Yo! MTV Raps' back in the '80s, that right there told us
white kids love rap. They didn't put that show on for black kids.
So, the white kids tuned in, they've bought into the culture and
now people are trying to emulate, do it, incorporate it into their
music. What?''
</P>
<P>
   The difference is one of scale. Fifteen years ago, an all-white
rap act such as the Beastie Boys was a novelty, just as the notion
of a commercial radio station broadcasting songs as dissonant as
Limp Bizkit's or Korn's was merely punkish wishful thinking. But
when bands as self-consciously square as Canada's jokey Barenaked
Ladies can kick their record sales into overdrive by rapping, as
the group does on its 1998 hit ``One Week,'' it's clear pop culture
has turned another corner.
</P>
<P>
   The trend is the subject of satire. Performance artist Danny
Hoch, a Jewish New Yorker, deals with the subject in the upcoming
comedy movie ``Whiteboys.'' It's an extension of Hoch's bold stage
work. In one sketch, he portrays a white Midwestern rapper named
Flip who points to a dark mole on his arm, declaring that it's his
``real'' skin color. Flip's bedroom fantasy _ of ``representing''
to Jay Leno on late-night national TV _ is demolished only when his
mother calls from downstairs, demanding he take out the trash.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up in the most multi-ethnic county in the world _
Queens, New York,'' Hoch says. ``So, there was and is a hip-hop
community that is composed of Jews, blacks, Arabs, Latinos _ you
name it. That was the case in 1979, and that's the case now. Now,
if I would have gone to Harlem, that would have been another story.
Assimilation takes time, doesn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   Hoch's routine, part of the 1998 show ``Jails, Hospitals &AMP;
Hip-Hop,'' emphasizes the contradictions inherent in such a trend.
If hip-hop is an African-American concept, what is the cultural
identity of a white entertainer who appropriates it? And if someone
such as Kid Rock or Limp Bizkit vocalist Fred Durst is commanding
platinum record sales and sold-out concerts, is he adding something
to hip-hop's legacy or cashing in on it?
</P>
<P>
   Such rhetoric makes for a lively debate. There's plenty to be
found on the Internet newsgroup rec.music.hiphop, which recently
included 83 responses to the subject, ``Does Kid Rock have any
hip-hop credentials?'' Kid Rock and Eminem are dismissed as ``fake
wannabes from the suburbs'' and Limp Bizkit is written off as
MTV-driven ``rapcore.'' Yet, as a fan points out, hip-hop is the
most promiscuous of genres. To argue otherwise risks, well,
hypocrisy. ``I guess Cypress Hill is ruining hip-hop too because
they did a song with Pearl Jam,'' argues a newsgroup poster called
DarkNinja, cataloging a batch of rap-rock collaborations. ``I guess
(rapper) Kool Keith is wack because he did a song with Prodigy.
Public Enemy must be wack, because they worked with Anthrax.
Run-DMC must be wack, because they worked with Aerosmith.''
</P>
<P>
   The controversy highlights the prime directive of hip-hop, which
is to ``keep it real.'' These rockers who rap attempt to establish
their credibility by disavowing ``skin privilege,'' and stressing
how socially and economically disenfranchised they were before they
became famous. Kid Rock, who grew up in rural Michigan as the son
of a wealthy car dealer, nonetheless touts the virtues of such
``white trash'' intoxicants as Pabst Blue Ribbon and Jim Beam
bourbon and is backed by a musician named DJ Kracker. He says his
music comes ``straight out of the trailer park.'' Eminem, whose
rueful adolescence and adult domestic squabbles provide much of the
backdrop for his debut, ``The Slim Shady LP,'' was actually living
in a trailer when his record hit the charts. He came home from a
tour to find an eviction notice. Durst, who grew up poor in
Gastonia, N.C., tells stories of how his white friends ostracized
him in high school because of his affection for rap music.
</P>
<P>
   As Chuck D contends, this isn't new. It's part of an endlessly
repeating cycle that generates from the core of American culture.
Go back to the early 1950s, and it was Elvis Presley or Jerry Lee
Lewis sneaking into black roadhouses or frequenting Sunday gospel
marathons in East Memphis or Ferriday, La., swept away by what they
would soon learn to synthesize into rock 'n' roll. It wasn't new
then.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as whites could observe blacks dancing and singing
along the coasts of the new world, they started grabbing those
moves, talking and dressing black, and promoting that culture as
the ne plus ultra of authenticity,'' says W.T. Lhamon Jr., a
professor at Florida State University in Tallahassee and the author
of ``Raising Cain: Blackface Performance From Jim Crow to Hip Hop''
(Harvard; 1997). ``The whole concept of white trash and disdained
black forms has been the generative swap meet for Atlantic popular
culture since the 1830s _ since the onset of the Industrial
Revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   The new wave of dirty white boys may be reinvigorating rock
music or could be toppled from the charts by the next unpredictable
trend. But what's more notable is how these performers also are
playing out a story. Those little girls learning how to groove from
a DMX record, or the masses who hailed Kid Rock at Woodstock '99
last weekend, are a part of it, even if they don't know it yet.

   -- Album: ``Devil Without a Cause'' (Top Dog/Atlantic)
</P>
<P>
   -- Real name: Bob Ritchie, 27. Got his name as a teenager, while
DJ-ing in Detroit's black housing projects: ``Yo, watch that white
kid rock!''
</P>
<P>
   -- Home turf: Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   -- M.O.: Early career derailed in early '90s due to white rapper
credibility crisis caused by fluke success of Vanilla Ice. Got back
on track as a self-proclaimed ``white trash'' rapper who drinks
Pabst Blue Ribbon beer and listens to Lynyrd Skynyrd.
</P>
<P>
   -- What's unusual: Tours with a 3-foot, 9-inch midget.
</P>
<P>
   Eminem
</P>
<P>
   -- Album: ``The Slim Shady LP'' (Interscope)
</P>
<P>
   -- Real name: Marshall Mathers, 24. Thought up his alter ego
Slim Shady while sitting on the toilet.
</P>
<P>
   -- Home turf: Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   -- M.O.: Grew up poor and transient, was beat up a lot as a kid,
has issues with his mother. His album takes revenge fantasies to
violent extremes, but undercuts the sociopathology with comic
effects (nasal delivery, quirky samples). Hip-hop producer Dr.
Dre's big discovery.
</P>
<P>
   -- What's unusual: He's a pretty good rapper.
</P>
<P>
   Everlast
</P>
<P>
   -- Album: ``Whitey Ford Sings the Blues'' (Tommy Boy).
</P>
<P>
   -- Real name: Eric Schrody, 29. Everlast is the name of an
athletic gear manufacturer best known for its boxing trunks. He
plays Atlanta Aug. 18 at The Tabernacle.
</P>
<P>
   -- Home turf: Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   -- M.O.: Made a name with House of Pain, an Irish-American
hip-hop act influenced by Cypress Hill. The group's DJ Lethal is
now a member of Limp Bizkit. Reinvented himself as a kind of
latter-day Richie Havens, singing about the wages of inner-city sin
for alternative rock fans.
</P>
<P>
   -- What's unusual: Survived major heart attack while recording
his album.
</P>
<P>
   Limp Bizkit
</P>
<P>
   -- Album: ``Significant Other'' (Interscope).
</P>
<P>
   -- Lead vocalist: Fred Durst, 28. Supposedly, a ``limp bizkit''
is slang for the kind of thing that's probably the subject of a
Marilyn Manson rumor on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   -- Home turf: Jacksonville
</P>
<P>
   -- M.O.: One-time tattoo artist and hip-hop fan Durst was
befriended by California metal act Korn, which helped the group get
signed and put it on its ``Family Values'' tour. The new release,
the group's second, is sharply produced with radio-friendly fare to
help the band expand from its hard-core audience built up through
constant touring. Acts like Rage Against the Machine, Cypress Hill
and Wu-Tang Clan are key reference points.
</P>
<P>
   -- What's unusual: Durst is a devout Lutheran. He also has made
a cameo appearance in a porn film.
</P>
<P>
   Insane Clown Posse
</P>
<P>
   -- Album: ``The Amazing Jeckel Brothers'' (Island).
</P>
<P>
   -- Band members: Shaggy 2 Dope and Violent J, who are in their
20s. And if those aren't their real names, they should be.
</P>
<P>
   -- Home turf: Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   -- M.O.: They're clowns. And they're insane.
</P>
<P>
   -- What's unusual: The vividly theatrical duo actually sells a
lot of records. First gained national notoriety when Disney
subsidiary Hollywood Records dropped them from its roster
immediately upon the release of its major-label debut. Best known
for spraying untold gallons of Michigan-made Faygo soft drinks on
fanatically enthused audiences.

<P>
   Say ``Bugatti,'' and most people think ``automobile.''
</P>
<P>
   That perception may soon change, thanks to the first American
exhibition devoted to the work of three generations of the Bugatti
family that took its artistry from Milan to Paris to Alsace.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition, exclusive to the Cleveland Museum of Art,
showcases furniture and silver designed by Carlo Bugatti
(1856-1940) and the animal sculpture of his son Rembrandt
(1884-1916). But the drawing card probably will be the automobiles
designed by another son, Ettore Bugatti (1881-1947) and Ettore's
son, Jean (1909-39). &QL;
</P>

   Other families have produced multiple generations of artists,
like the Bachs and Strausses in music and the Barrymores in
theater. But the Bugattis stand out because each found a different
medium for expression, said Henry Hawley, the Cleveland museum's
curator who organized the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Typically, secrets of production are passed through family
lines, so they tend to focus on the same sort of things instead of
each one doing something different,'' Hawley said. ``The Bugattis
were not that way. If they shared anything, it was the desire for
originality and working with their hands.''
</P>
<P>
   And they liked eggs _ or at least the ovoid shape.
</P>

   The Bugatti automobile gained its reputation through racing.
Ettore's Type 35 won more than 1,000 races from 1924 to 1940. The
Type 57 was the most commercially successful Bugatti car, with 680
built in 1930-40. The Atlantic Type 57SC, included in this
exhibition, was designed by Jean and is considered by many to be
the most beautiful automobile ever made. Jean's career was cut
short in 1939 when he was killed in a crash while testing one of
his Le Mans race cars.
</P>
<P>
   While racing established the reputation of Bugatti automobiles,
Hawley says their allure has lived on because of the beauty of the
design.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is said that probably a higher percentage of Bugattis
survive than any other automobile ever made,'' he said. ``They do
survive because they are admired.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the six automobiles in the exhibition, two of the best-known
are the Type 41 Royale, owned by the Henry Ford Museum and
Greenfield Village in Dearborn, Mich., and Ralph Lauren's Type 57SC
Atlantic. And all but two _ the Type 51 race car and the Baby
Bugatti, a small-scale version of a '30s racing car _ are Jean
Bugatti's design.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition, which includes nearly 80 objects, runs through
Sept. 19. Tickets can be ordered by calling (888) 262-0033 (outside
Cleveland) or (216) 421-7350 (in Cleveland) or through the museum's
Web site: www.clemusart.com. Admission is $5 on weekdays and $7 on
Saturdays and Sundays; discounts are offered for students and
groups.

   Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of
new or noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in
New York City. Ratings and running times are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   `AMERICAN PIE,' starring Jason Biggs, Chris Klein, Natasha
Lyonne, Thomas Ian Nicholas, Tara Reid, Mena Suvari and Eugene
Levy. Directed by Paul Weitz (R, 100 minutes). The snickering
teen-age comedy about four boys, all seniors in the same Michigan
high school, who make a pact to lose their virginity by the end of
the school year serves up a new gross-out joke every five minutes.
The movie obviously wants to outdo ``There's Something About Mary''
in raunchy guffaws, but it lacks the antic spirit of its
forerunner. More like an upper-middle-class ``Porky's,'' it parades
its dirty jokes as crassly as an old-time burlesque show (Stephen
Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `ARLINGTON ROAD,' starring Jeff Bridges, Tim Robbins, Hope
Davis, Robert Gossett and Joan Cusack. Directed by Mark Pellington
(R, 117 minutes). In a smart, stylish thriller that recalls the
paranoid classics of the '70s, Bridges plays a history professor
who begins to suspect that his smiling suburban neighbors are not
what they seem. Tracking down clues to an anti-government terrorist
network, he also engages in a battle of wits with Robbins' cryptic
character, and these fine actors square off to gripping effect.
Swift and pulse-quickening, this thriller has more than its share
of surprising twists, including a whopper at the finale. All in
all, a welcome change of pace from the season's dopey blockbusters
(Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `AUSTIN POWERS: THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME,' starring Mike Myers,
Heather Graham and Elizabeth Hurley. Directed by Jay Roach (PG-13,
95 minutes). There may come a time when even Austin Powers tires of
the words ``Oh, behave!'' But it isn't here yet. Although the
sequel with the fab title is several love beads short of its
predecessor and more than a few scenes play like outtakes, this is
still a crafty, intermittently hilarious comedy. Myers' neo-Sellers
multiple-personality act is fine even when the material is less so,
and this sequel makes the most of Dr. Evil, his most inspired
creation. A scatological Scotsman, the film's walking id and
bathroom joke, is more of an acquired taste. Costumes and pop
references are still a hoot, as is the adorably benighted Austin.
Ms. Graham makes terrific eye candy but doesn't share Ms. Hurley's
quick-witted air of being in on the joke (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `AUTUMN TALE,' starring Beatrice Romand, Marie Riviere, Didier
Sandre, Alain Libolt and Alexia Portal. Directed by Eric Rohmer
(PG, 110 minutes; in French with English subtitles). The final
chapter of the director's ``Tales of the Four Seasons'' is as
sublimely warming an experience as the autumn sun that shines
benevolently on the Rhone Valley vineyard owned by the central
character, Magali (Ms. Romand). The movie follows the adventures of
this wiry and vital but lonely widowed mother of two after she
allows two friends to play matchmaker. The film's plot, like that
of other Rohmer movies, is mathematically schematic as the
characters indulge in exquisitely verbalized soul-searching. As
sensuously gratifying as it is civilized, with a wonderful central
performance by Ms. Romand, it reaches a happy ending that feels
entirely earned (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `BIG DADDY,' starring Adam Sandler, Cole and Dylan Sprouse and
Joey Lauren Adams, Jon Stewart and Leslie Mann. Directed by Dennis
Dugan (PG-13, 95 minutes). It's awfully early in the career of Adam
Sandler to find him sharing the screen with a scene-stealing
6-year-old (actually the Sprouse twins). Besides, the cute kid in
Sandler's movies is usually the star himself. But he's in a
position to do whatever he likes, even if it's a flimsy sentimental
comedy with more product plugs and fewer laughs than might have
been hoped for. Having greatly expanded his following with the
romantic comedy and '80s kitsch of ``The Wedding Singer,'' not to
mention the inspired rustic lunacy of ``The Waterboy,'' he falls
back on much less inventive material this time. And the barrage of
brand-name junk food is enough to make skin break out in the
audience (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT,' starring Heather Donahue, Michael
Williams and Joshua Leonard. Directed by Daniel Myrick and Eduardo
Sanchez (R, 87 minutes). A horror film shot outdoors by its actors,
who play three scared filmmakers at work on a spooky documentary,
this is a fine example of how to make something out of nothing _
nothing but terrific imagination and a game plan so enterprising it
should elevate its creators to pin-up status at film schools
everywhere. With tentacles including a hit Web site, an elaborate
fake witch mythology, a book tie-in, a special on the Sci-Fi
Channel and much more, this clever little indie is at the center of
a new form of synergy and an inspired multimedia blitz (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE BUENA VISTA SOCIAL CLUB,' with Ibrahim Ferrer, Compay
Segundo and Ry Cooder. Directed by Wim Wenders (not rated, 106
minutes). When the American guitarist and producer Ry Cooder
assembled a group of all-but-forgotten Cuban musicians to record an
album, no one expected that the record would become a phenomenon,
selling more than a million copies worldwide and revitalizing the
Cuban music scene. Wenders' ebullient documentary follows the group
on tour from Amsterdam to New York and includes interviews with the
group's main members. The music pulsates, and the pictures of
Havana compare the city's grand but faded architecture with the
musicians' weather-beaten faces (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `CABARET BALKAN,' starring Nikola Ristanovski, Nebojsa Glogovac
and Lazar Ristovski. Directed by Goran Paskaljevic (not rated, 100
minutes). When one character in ``Cabaret Balkan'' bitterly
describes Belgrade, Yugoslavia, as a hemorrhoid, he isn't joking.
The movie, directed by the Serbian director Goran Paskaljevic, is a
``La Ronde''-like series of brutal confrontations, all taking place
on the same frigid winter night in 1995 on which frustrated
residents of the city humiliate and murder one another. The scenes,
introduced ``Cabaret''-style by a smirking, androgynous master of
ceremonies, portray a society so at odds with itself it is on the
verge of committing mass suicide. Powerfully acted, but brutal,
depressing and deeply misanthropic, ``Cabaret Balkan'' is not for
the squeamish (Holden). &QL;

<P>
   `DEEP BLUE SEA,' starring Saffron Burrows, Thomas Jane, LL Cool
J, Jacqueline McKenzie, Michael Rapaport, Stellan Skarsgard and
Samuel L. Jackson, Directed by Renny Harlin (R, 100 minutes).
Better not mess with Mother Nature. That's the familiar message of
this man-against-shark horror film in which the research team of a
floating ocean laboratory is stalked by three 8,000-pound
genetically ``improved'' mako sharks. Ms. Burrows is the chilly,
anything-for-science marine biologist behind the research, and Jane
the hunky shark-wrangler who tends these razor-toothed killing
machines. ``Titanic'' meets ''Jaws,'' without romance, history,
myth or credible characters, only nonstop action and half an ocean
full of crimson, blood-thickened water (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `DROP DEAD GORGEOUS,' starring Kirsten Dunst, Denise Richards
and Kirstie Alley. Directed by Michael Patrick Jann (PG-13, 97
minutes). In the guise of sending up beauty pageants, this
mean-spirited, clunky satire manages to load up on stereotypes,
sneer at Minnesota, stage a scene in which beauty contestants vomit
en masse and make its audience wince through what must be a record
number of miserably unfunny jokes. Ms. Dunst and Ms. Richards show
some stellar appeal despite the dreary circumstances. And Allison
Janney makes the most of a supporting role (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `EYES WIDE SHUT,' starring Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.
Directed by Stanley Kubrick (R, 145 minutes). This last cryptic,
spellbinding addition to the Kubrick canon provides a stunning
epiphany for the summer of the dirty joke. It's a dead-serious film
about eros and mortality, one that flirts with the ridiculous but
sustains its fundamental eeriness and gravity throughout. Cruise,
as a doctor caught up in a nighttime sexual odyssey of strange,
dreamlike clarity, and Ms. Kidman, as the wife who sparks his
jealousy by speaking frankly of her own libido, give themselves
over body and soul to the filmmaker's meticulous and delicately
balanced scheme. Given the dark themes and explicit nudity found
here, the R rating (achieved by digital alterations to 65 seconds'
worth of film) is a joke (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE GENERAL'S DAUGHTER,' starring John Travolta, Madeleine
Stowe, James Cromwell, Timothy Hutton and James Woods. Directed by
Simon West (R, 118 minutes). Murder on a military base was once
enough of a pretext for a detective thriller, but nowadays it takes
more. The prevailing sleaze quotient calls for kinks, and this
galling adaptation of a Nelson DeMille best seller is happy to
oblige. So the title character, a pretty young officer who the film
thinks has no place in the military, is the victim of a lurid
crime. Travolta and Ms. Stowe affably investigate whodunit, though
the unraveling of the crime is laughably arbitrary. The real point
of their ponderous investigation is that the victim asked for what
she got (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE HAUNTING,' starring Liam Neeson, Lili Taylor, Catherine
Zeta-Jones and Owen Wilson. Directed by Jan De Bont (PG-13, 117
minutes). In a wildly overdone haunted house with a Gothic Nouveau
Riche look, walls warp, statues morph and things go bump in the
night. The special effects are piled on so relentlessly that after
a while, the sight of the flying cow from De Bont's ``Twister ``
would not be amiss. Firmly committed to the idea that more is more,
this is a remake of a 1963 black-and-white film that left much more
to the imagination. But the cast is good; Neeson plays the doctor
who leads the other three principals to Hill House for a psychology
experiment that goes really, really wrong (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `AN IDEAL HUSBAND,' starring Cate Blanchett, Minnie Driver,
Rupert Everett, Julianne Moore and Jeremy Northam. Written and
directed by Oliver Parker (PG-13, 97 minutes). The best thing about
Parker's likable but diluted screen adaptation of Oscar Wilde's
1895 comedy of politics and Victorian morality is Everett's
portrayal of Wilde's elegantly epigrammatic alter ego Lord Arthur
Goring. In underplaying this seemingly incorrigible (but actually
wise, witty and caring) rake, verett makes him all the more
charming. Northam and Ms. Blanchett are well cast as a politician
and his priggish wife, but Ms. Moore and Ms. Driver miss hitting
the right notes in a screenplay that streamlines Wilde into a
quasi-contemporary style, keeping some but not all of the
playwright's scintillating bons mots. The settings are so lavish
they're almost edible (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `INSPECTOR GADGET,' starring Matthew Broderick and Rupert
Everett. Directed by David Kellogg (PG, 85 minutes). The midmorning
midden of children's cartoons that yielded a vein of cinematic gold
with ``George of the Jungle'' has now been mined for this clinker.
Too bad, because this Disney comedy wastes good talent. Broderick
brings an endearing combination of intelligence, wit and naivete to
his portrayal of a security guard who is transformed into the human
gizmo Inspector Gadget after being blown up in an effort to capture
a megalomaniacal magnate (Everett). But even Broderick can go only
so far with the film's noisy, childish material. Watching this
movie is like watching a human Swiss army knife for nearly an hour
and a half. It's a remarkable device, but do you really want to
spend a lot of time with a not-too-bright hardware store
Frankenstein creation that can light cigars with his thumb, shoot a
grappling hook to the top of a skyscraper and produce a helicopter
from his head? (Lawrence Van Gelder). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `LAKE PLACID,' starring Bill Pullman, Bridget Fonda, Oliver
Platt and Brendan Gleeson. Written by David E. Kelley and directed
by Steve Miner (R, 88 minutes). Despite the DOA nature of the genre
it tacitly sends up, this ``Jaws''-minded demon crocodile movie
finds a fair amount to work with in newly reptile-plagued Maine. A
good cast is given the challenge of keeping straight faces. (``Any
recent bear attacks?'' ``This was no bear. Bears don't attack
people underwater.'') And the horror effects can be divinely
cheesy, like the apparent underwater sprinkler hose whose churning
effect is described as ``scared perch.'' Trouble is, this story
also has to go through the motions of a totally familiar monster
plot. There's no way to make that seem anything but tired (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `MY LIFE SO FAR,' starring Colin Firth, Rosemary Harris, Irene
Jacob, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, Malcolm McDowell and Robert
Norman. Directed by Hugh Hudson (PG-13, 93 minutes). A steady
``Masterpiece Theater''-like glow warms ``My Life So Far,'' a boy's
reverie of growing up in the misty Scottish highlands of Argyll in
the late 1920s. Frisky little Fraser (Norman), who narrates the
story, recalls a year in the life of the mildly troubled Macintosh
clan. What strife there is mostly involves his father, Edward
(Firth), an eccentric fiery-eyed inventor, and his Uncle Morris
(McDowell), who brings home a beautiful French wife (Ms. Jacob)
with whom Edward falls in love. If the story is slight, it is
smoothly told and well acted (especially by Firth) and the
nostalgic atmosphere is beguiling (Holden).

<P>
   `THE RED VIOLIN,' starring Samuel L. Jackson, Jason Flemying,
Greta Scacchi and Don McKellar. Directed by Francois Girard (not
rated, 130 minutes). ``The Red Violin'' follows the colorful
300-plus-year journey of a priceless violin from its construction
in an Italian workshop in 1681 to a contemporary auction in
Montreal. As it makes its way from Vienna to England to China, the
instrument becomes the inspiration for some richly photographed
historical tableaux. If the movie's narrative energy is undermined
by a plodding screenplay and wooden acting, the music, composed by
John Corigliano and played by Joshua Bell and the London
Philharmonia Orchestra, is sublime (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `SOUTH PARK: BIGGER, LONGER AND UNCUT,' with the voices of Trey
Parker, Matt Stone and Mary Kay Bergman. Directed by Parker (R, 88
minutes). The movie spinoff from the outrageous Comedy Central
cartoon series following the adventures of some potty-mouthed
third-grade boys in South Park, Colo., is extremely funny and
jubilantly obscene, with several sewers' worth of bathroom humor.
It is also a smart, pointed satire that demolishes the hypocrisy of
a conservative culture that allows almost unlimited violence and
gore in movies and on television but goes ballistic at the prospect
of children's being exposed to dirty language and sexual
explicitness. When a group of tykes sneak into a Canadian movie
filled with obscenities and come home spewing smut, their parents
raise such a ruckus that the United States declares war on Canada.
Armageddon looms when the Devil, who has been having a troubled
affair with the recently deceased Saddam Hussein, decides to put in
an appearance. Contributing to the madness are 15 clever songs
spoofing everything from Rodgers and Hammerstein to ``Les
Miserables'' (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `STAR WARS: EPISODE I _ THE PHANTOM MENACE,' starring Liam
Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman and Jake Lloyd. Directed by
George Lucas (PG-13, 132 minutes). Stripped of hype and breathless
expectations, Lucas' first installment offers a happy surprise:
It's up to snuff. It sustains the gee-whiz spirit of the series and
offers a swashbuckling extra-galactic getaway, creating illusions
that are even more plausible than the kitchen-raiding raptors of
``Jurassic Park.'' While the human stars here are indeed reduced to
playing action figures, they are upstaged by amazing backdrops and
hordes of crazily lifelike space beings as the Lewis Carroll in
Lucas is given free rein. The ``Star Wars'' franchise was funnier
and scrappier when it was new. But it simply wasn't capable of this
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `SUMMER OF SAM,' starring John Leguizamo, Adrien Brody and Mira
Sorvino. Directed by Spike Lee (R, 145 minutes). This raw,
enthralling evocation of a Bronx neighborhood gone mad in 1977
plunges its audience headlong into a pre-AIDS libidinous frenzy. It
also summons an atmosphere of macho posturing and mounting
prejudice reminiscent of ``Do the Right Thing'' a decade ago,
though the locals this time are white Italian-Americans. The
killing spree of David Berkowitz is used as a catalyst, joining
disco, punk, drugs, a heat wave and the Yankees to summon the
crazed spirit of that time. The characters are thin, but a fine
cast brings them to life. Leguizamo (in high ``Saturday Night
Fever'' style) and Brody (with hair in spikes) are outstanding as
the film's two most visible signs of the times (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `TARZAN,' with the voices of Tony Goldwyn, Minnie Driver and
Nigel Hawthorne. Directed by Kevin Lima and Chris Buck (G, 88
minutes). No need to wonder how this animated Tarzan movie could
improve on the 47 others that preceded it. Disney animation turns
the hero into a supple, long-haired hunk, lets the apes talk to him
and whooshes through lush jungle settings with exultant agility.
This ``Tarzan'' is sprightly and likable in ways that are hard to
resist, with lively vocal performances, excitingly kinetic
animation and Phil Collins singing tunefully in the background.
Parents will stay awake, and children will be charmed (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `TRICK,' starring Christian Campbell and John Paul Pitoc.
Directed by Jim Fall (R, 90 minutes). This engaging, tenderhearted
boy-meets-boy story features two handsome, doe-eyed actors in the
story of a romantic one-night stand. As in the Doris Day-era sex
comedies that are recalled here, the story is filled with obstacles
to the affair, the most noxious of them Tori Spelling in the role
of an incorrigible nuisance. Fall gives a small-town coziness to
his film's Greenwich Village settings, and makes this a quaintly
likable date movie for audiences of any persuasion (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `WILD WILD WEST,' starring Will Smith, Kevin Kline and Salma
Hayek. Directed by Barry Sonnenfeld (PG-13, 107 minutes). Another
big, lavish movie with no there there. This post-Civil War James
Bondish contraption-happy sci-fi film is hard to categorize, a
quality not to be confused with originality. Directed by Sonnenfeld
without the deadpan-alien sensibility that worked for ``Men in
Black,'' this stylistic grab bag is similarly kinky but a lot more
chaotic, however heroically Smith, as a newly hunky and debonair
action hero, tries to save the day. Good-looking but dopey, with an
emphasis on toylike but vaguely ghoulish special effects. A movie
with that much potential kiddie appeal didn't have to start in a
bordello, either (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   FILM SERIES:
</P>
<P>
   `TO HAVE AND HAVE NOT.' Preparing to begin an 18-month survey of
its 17,000-title collection in October as part of the museumwide
exhibition ``MOMA 2000,'' the Museum of Modern Art is running a
77-film series that amounts to a wish list of films the museum
hopes to add to its collection. The series consists of films
regarded as significant in the development of cinema as a modern
art, including documentaries, experimental work and narrative
fiction films ranging from musicals to melodramas. This weekend's
attractions include Quentin Tarantino's influential ``Pulp
Fiction'' (1994) Friday at 2:30 p.m. and Sunday at 2 p.m.; Douglas
Sirk's melodrama ``Written on the Wind'' (1956) Friday at 6 p.m.
and Saturday at 5 p.m.; Jim Jarmusch's offbeat western ``Dead Man''
(1995) Friday at 8 p.m. and Sunday at 5 p.m., and Chris Noonan's
fairy tale ``Babe'' (1995) Saturday at 2 p.m. Continuing through
Sept. 14 at the museum, 11 West 53rd St., New York, N.Y., the
series is free with museum admission: $9.50 for adults, $6.50 for
students and the elderly; free for visitors under 16 with an adult.
Pay what you wish on Fridays from 4:30 to 8:30 p.m. Information:
(212) 708-9400 (Van Gelder).

 &HT;    Grade: A

<TEXT>
<P>
   They are alive and kicking.
</P>
<P>
   Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard and Michael Williams, the stars
of the independent horror thriller ``The Blair Witch Project,''
might have mysteriously disappeared in the Maryland woods in their
movie's creepy tale of witchcraft, murders and ghost sightings. But
in real life the three actors, who each lent their real names to
their movie characters, are ready to talk about the experience.
</P>
<P>
   After all, ``Blair Witch'' is just a movie, even if it doesn't
look or feel that way as you watch the characters slowly but surely
come apart psychologically amid the escalating terror inflicted on
them by the film's creative team. Many moviegoers have been taken
in by the ingenious publicity that presents this fictional tale as
fact. It's a gimmick, not even a necessary one to appreciate the
movie's power, but one that apparently is helping stoke public
interest.
</P>
<P>
   In case you haven't heard, ``Blair Witch'' is a film industry
phenomenon. The low-budget movie, shot in eight days for a mere
$30,000 to $35,000 with a post-filming cost of about $350,000, a
pittance by Hollywood standards, has repeatedly sold out its
showings at United Artists' Tara Cinema in Atlanta and 26 other
theaters across the country since it debuted July 16. So far, it
has grossed more than $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Today it expands to more than 1,000 theaters nationwide,
including several megaplexes in Cobb, Gwinnett and DeKalb counties.
</P>
<P>
   We recently caught up with all three actors.
</P>
<P>
   Donahue lives in Los Angeles and has been auditioning for new
roles. Leonard, who also lives in L.A. and is on location in San
Francisco shooting a low-budget film, recently landed a part in the
upcoming Hollywood mainsream movie ``Navy Divers'' with Robert De
Niro and Cuba Gooding Jr. And Williams, who's currently living in
Thornwood, N.Y., is getting married in September, will honeymoon in
Aruba and then move to Los Angeles to continue pursuing his acting
career.
</P>
<P>
   The trio beat out 2,000 other unknown actors who auditioned for
``Blair Witch'' two years ago. Because the movie is basically
improvisational, auditions also required seat-of-the-pants acting.
(The actors were given a 16mm camera, a video camera, sound
equipment, camping gear and a mere outline of the movie and sent
into the Maryland woods to document their harrowing search for the
witch tale.) As each actor entered the audition room, he was told
to improvise a scene in which he was a prisoner up for parole.
</P>
<P>
   ``Josh blew us away,'' says ``Witch'' co-director Eduardo
Sanchez. ``He excited us like nobody else.''
</P>
<P>
   With Leonard a shoo-in, Donahue and Williams got their roles
based on how they would work with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Heather, there was something in her eyes,'' Sanchez
explains. ``We had Josh be real obnoxious and Heather was the only
one to realistically stand up to him. She was cool. And there were
those eyes of hers _ something kind of crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams and another actor were finalists for the third role.
``Mike was a little more the next-door type,'' Sanchez says. But
hair color really tipped the scales in Williams' favor.
</P>
<P>
   The other actor was blond. ``He looked too much like Josh,''
Sanchez says.
</P>
<P>
   HEATHER DONAHUE
</P>
<P>
   -- In ``Blair Witch'': She plays Heather, the leader of the
students documenting the witch tale.
</P>
<P>
   -- Age: 24.
</P>
<P>
   -- Residence: Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   -- Family: Father is a printer, mother is an office manager for
a gynecologist. She has a 22-year-old brother and a 14-year-old
sister; all live in or near Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   -- Experience: Stage work at the Soho Theatre Company and
Battersea Arts Centre; former member of the Red Shag Improv Comedy
group and the experimental Collision Theory Theater Company in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   -- Scariest movie she's seen: ``The Shining.'' ``I've never been
a big fan of horror movies,'' she says. ``I know that seems
strange.''
</P>
<P>
   Q:In ``Blair Witch,'' Heather has a strong personality. Does the
off-screen Heather like the on-screen Heather?
</P>
<P>
   A:I watch the movie now and I am like, ``Oh, shut up.'' You
know? Maybe she should have been better organized. Still, I do
think people are hard on her. If it were a male character I just
know it would be different. People would react differently to a guy
being just like that. I grew up in a liberal household and thought
those attitudes don't happen anymore. But they do.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Any post-``Blair'' dreams?
</P>
<P>
   A:Nothing beyond the normal. I do think I feel loss because it's
over and relieved at the same time. Kind of a postpartum thing. ...
It also felt kind of crazy to come out of the woods. You don't
realize the effect of the sounds of hearing rustling leaves all the
time. The world away from all that is really sort of silent.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Do you go camping?
</P>
<P>
   A:I'm quite an avid camper now. Hard to believe, huh? I go about
once a month. All over California. It's usually for a long weekend.
Doesn't bother me at all.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Your video confession scene is a high point in the film. How
did you get into that?
</P>
<P>
   A:Basically, the directors left me a note, telling me to
confess. I was to do my best to make amends for the complete
disaster. Over a period of days when you are working on your
character _ she was always repressing, repressing _ then you're
finally getting the opportunity to let that go. You finally get to
release it. And it pours out. It's all good.
</P>
<P>
   Q:What has surprised you most about this movie?
</P>
<P>
   A:The audience reaction. It's stunning. A lot of people love it.
And some are completely repulsed by it. The balance could have gone
either way. You have to accept that this film doesn't look like
other films. ... You can't go in expecting anything like a normal
movie. ... It's the aesthetic. It's grainy. It's raw. It's indie,
man.
</P>
<P>
   JOSHUA LEONARD
</P>
<P>
   -- In `Blair Witch'': He plays Joshua, the main cameraman.
</P>
<P>
   -- Age: 24.
</P>
<P>
   -- Residence: Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   -- Family: Father teaches theater at Pennsylvania State
University; mother is having her first book published; has one
younger brother, who is studying Eastern philosophy in Boulder,
Colo.
</P>
<P>
   -- Experience: Stage work at The Living Theatre and the Seattle
Fringe Festival. Several low-budget independent films. Is shooting
low-budget vigilante film ``City of Bars'' in San Francisco: ``I
play a womanizing rock-and-roll guitar player.'' Will also star
with Robert De Niro and Cuba Gooding Jr. in the upcoming ``Navy
Divers.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Scariest movie he's seen: ``16 Candles.'' ``Yeah, the one
with Molly Ringwald. I've never been a big horror movie fan. I know
`Children of the Corn' scared me when I was a kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Q:Why would you put yourself through this experience _ you know,
being stuck out in the woods, having the directors terrorize you
late at night, having food rations depleted just to watch you break
down psychologically?
</P>
<P>
   A:Actors a couple of times in their lifetime, if they are lucky,
are able to help mold a project to this extent. You just don't get
directors out there who have big enough (guts) to cast their actors
and then let them improvise the script. So I knew going in it was
the type of project that was an experiment. ... The only reason to
go out and do this was to see if it could be pulled off.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Hollywood throws a lot of money at its movies like ``Wild Wild
West'' to pull it off. You appear to have made something special,
an inherently scary movie without any special effects.
</P>
<P>
   A:With technique and technology you can make anything cool. But
to make anything that lasts, you have to strip away all that
technology and see if you've got anything at all left. If you don't
have a story that connects, if you don't have that base element,
you don't have much.
</P>
<P>
   Q:One scene that contributed to that base element was when you
use the camera to confront Heather. You push it right in her face
and taunt her with the line, ``What's your motivation?''
</P>
<P>
   A:That was my instinctual reaction to being frustrated, being
way beyond comfort and having this girl always sticking the camera
in my face. That was the breaking point for me and Heather. I
wasn't able to keep my cool anymore. Ultimately, it helped you
understand why she can't put the camera down. It was her link to
sanity. The second she puts it down, the whole situation becomes
too real. After that scene was one of the first times we had to
break character as actors, because it crossed the boundary. We had
to say, ``This is not you, this is not me. We are doing a film here
and are you all right?''
</P>
<P>
   Q:When did you know that ``Blair Witch'' might be something more
than just a bunch of guys tripping out in the woods? That the
public was going to really take to it?
</P>
<P>
   A:We were at a premiere in New York, and we were standing there
and it just felt like something out of the movies. MTV was there.
And CNN. And there was all this flash, flash, flash from
photographers. Mike (Williams) just looked at me and said, ``We
made a film on video in Maryland.'' At that moment it was just the
absurdity of the whole thing. Yes, man, we did. It's a beautiful
thing.
</P>
<P>
   MICHAEL WILLIAMS
</P>
<P>
   -- In ``Blair Witch'': He plays Mike, the sound man.
</P>
<P>
   -- Age: 26.
</P>
<P>
   -- Residence: Thornwood, N.Y, near White Plains. Plans to move
to Los Angeles after he gets married in September.
</P>
<P>
   -- Family: Mother is a homemaker in Thornwood; father, who
worked for Exxon Corp. before the Alaska oil spill, died when
Michael was 16. He is the eighth of nine children: five girls and
four boys.
</P>
<P>
   -- Experience: Studied acting at the State University of New
York. Appeared in low-budget independent films ``Sally'' and
``Nasty.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Scariest movie he's seen: ``The Exorcist.'' ``I can't even
describe how scary that is to me. I also like `Halloween.' The
first one. It's a classic.''
</P>
<P>
   Q:The first time you really got to meet Heather and Joshua was
on a train heading to Maryland for the shoot. What did you talk
about?
</P>
<P>
   A:We talked about what our actor training had been. And all our
side jobs. At that time I was scooping ice cream in a restaurant on
weekends and doing production assistant work. And pumping gas,
cutting stone in a quarry, and I'm still moving furniture. I took
today off for this interview.
</P>
<P>
   Q:After making the movie, what had you learned from Heather and
Joshua about acting? What did you take from the experience?
</P>
<P>
   A:I really learned to trust. You always have to trust your scene
partner. With Josh and Heather, we had to trust each other right
away if the film was going to work. It's improvisation. And we were
portraying people who were going crazy. You have to trust that
somebody's not going to break your face open, not going to hurt
you. I felt perfectly safe with them.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Your bio says you played for three years on the New York
Yankees farm club.
</P>
<P>
   A:Uh. I wrote that as a goof and now it's all over the place.
... Who knew all this amazing stuff would happen with this movie?
They thrust paper at me and told me to write out my biography.

 &HT;    Unbridled `Runaway': Paired with Gere again, Roberts rides high
in a lightweight charmer
 &HT;    
 &HT;    ``Runaway Bride''
 &HT;    Grade: B
 &HT;    Starring Julia Roberts and Richard Gere. Directed by Garry
Marshall. Rated PG for mild language and sexual innuendo. 1 hour,
 &HT;    56 minutes. At metro theaters.
 &HT;    The verdict: Not a runaway success, but a good bet for its
intended audience.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Director Garry Marshall didn't create Julia Roberts, but he did
a pretty good Pygmalion job on her when he cast her opposite
Richard Gere in 1990's ``Pretty Woman'' and made that Roberts smile
world famous.
</P>
<P>
   Nine years later, Marshall, Roberts, Gere and second banana
Hector Elizondo have reunited for ``Runaway Bride,'' a not so
subtle attempt to cajole lightning into striking twice.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, it doesn't. But that doesn't mean ``Runaway Bride'' is a
fiasco. It seems to me that there'll always be an audience for a
movie in which Roberts, wearing full wedding regalia, gallops on
horseback across gorgeous countryside. And that, in a nutshell, is
what ``Runaway Bride'' is all about.
</P>
<P>
   Well, there is a plot. A pretty simple one. Ike Graham (Gere) is
a hotshot, streetwise columnist on speaking terms with everyone
from senators to construction workers. One day he's doing his usual
``research'' _ i.e., downing a cold one at a local bar _ when a
fellow barfly suggests that he do a story about one Maggie
Carpenter (Roberts) from Hale, Md. It seems that Maggie has gone
down the aisle three times and choked at the altar every time. Now
she's scheduled for a fourth trip, and Ike decides there's a story
in her almost certain flight. (There are intermediary
complications, but that would be telling.)
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, Ike shows up in Hale, where, to Maggie's chagrin,
everybody in town _ including her groom (Christopher Meloni), her
best friend (Joan Cusack) and her father (Paul Dooley) _ is happy
to help him out. ``You're going to run again,'' Ike tells her.
``And I'm not leaving until you do.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie never completely capitalizes on its screwball premise;
imagine what Preston Sturges would've done with it. Marshall is too
much of a softie; he meanders around the story, milking it for both
sentiment and comedy and often tripping over himself in the
process. Still, his idea of small-town America is amusing _ a
crossroads of Mayberry and MTV. And he certainly knows how to
present his leading lady in every possible permutation of adorable,
whether she's radiant in bridal tulle or roguish in overalls. After
a while, you find yourself looking forward to the next scene mostly
to see how she'll wear her hair. But at least you're still looking.
</P>
<P>
   As for the ``Pretty Woman'' comparisons, they're almost beside
the point. This movie doesn't have the sheer sparkle of its
predecessor. How could it? ``Pretty Woman'' seemed as delighted to
discover Roberts as we were. Plus, there was the fairy tale quality
offered by Gere's super-rich character who could whisk poor little
hooker Julia off to polo games and the opera. Finally, almost a
decade has passed. Gere isn't a big '80s star looking for a
comeback, and Roberts isn't a semi-known waiting to unleash her
magic. As for Elizondo, his role is minuscule and he spends most of
his time with Rita Wilson, well-cast as Gere's boss and ex-wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``Runaway Bride'' is in no way a critics' movie. But you hope
that it's critic-proof, like such less deserving films as ``Wild
Wild West'' and ``The Haunting.'' Because, sometimes, you just need
to see Julia Roberts in full wedding regalia galloping on horseback
across the screen, and across our collective romantic fantasies.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By 1 p.m. local time Thursday, the mercury had already soared to
101 degrees at Pierre, S.D., a reading symptomatic of the extreme
heat gripping the upper Middle West. The overall pattern of the jet
stream will shift a bit, Friday and Saturday, signaling an easing
of hot weather across the northern Plains and western Great Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   For much of July, a phalanx of three very warm and expansive
high pressure systems over the eastern Pacific, the Middle West and
the western Atlantic created a very stable and generally hot
weather pattern across much of the contiguous states. A consequence
of this stable pattern was the restraining of the jet stream, which
was locked over southern Canada and parts of the northern-tier
states. But the eastern Pacific high will shift northward toward
the Gulf of Alaska on Friday and Saturday, a deviation that will
cause the jet stream to buckle southward over the upper Middle
West, allowing cooler air to ooze south from Canada. As a result,
high temperatures on Saturday across the region will range from the
upper 70s to the upper 80s.
</P>
<P>
   Farther south and east, however, heat and humidity will hold
steady through Saturday across the southern Plains, the Gulf Coast
states, the Southeast, the middle Mississippi and Ohio valleys, the
eastern Great Lakes and the Middle Atlantic states. Isolated to
widely separated thunderstorms will offer spotty, temporary relief.
Hot and humid air will surge back into New York state and parts of
New England by Saturday.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Hot Topic &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Bismarck, N.D., the mercury soared above 100 degrees during
the last couple of days for the first time in nearly eight years.
The searing heat ended the longest period without 100-degree
temperatures in Bismarck since records began in 1884. The
protracted lack of very hot days in Bismarck is a reflection of the
natural regional variations that are a part of the Earth's climate.
Periods of unusual heat, chill, wetness and dryness that last for
many years or decades are probably related to the complex
interactions between the oceans and the atmosphere. &QL;

 &HT;    SOCIAL SECURITY ``Y2K OK'' TO DELIVER BENEFIT CHECKS
 &HT;    By JONATHAN HALL
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Social Security is ``Y2K OK,'' a congressional
panel was told Thursday. But just to make sure, benefit checks will
be delivered on Dec. 29 in case the U.S. Postal Service has
problems associated with the change to the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been certified as 100 percent compliant through the
entire network,'' Social Security Commissioner Kenneth S. Apfel
told members of the House Subcommittee on Social Security. ``From
Social Security to the Treasury Department, the entire federal
system is Y2K compliant.''
</P>
<P>
   If localized problems do occur, there are local contingency
plans available to assure people appropriate service, Apfel said.
</P>
<P>
   If banks have electronic problems and transactions cannot be
processed on Jan. 3, the first Monday of 2000, the Social Security
Administration will immediately contact the Treasury Department and
issue replacement checks sent through the mail to be available
within five days. If someone faces an emergency and urgently needs
his or her check, Apfel said the local field office will
immediately issue it.
</P>
<P>
   The Social Security Administration has been working on a
strategic plan since 1992 at a cost of $4.3 million. Apfel said the
agency's goal is to ensure that January 2000 payments will be made
correctly and on time to the nearly 50 million beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Computer systems are vital to ensuring that Americans receive
the Social Security benefits they have come to expect in a timely
and affordable manner,'' said Rep. Clay Shaw, R-Fla., who is
chairman of the subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   Over the first weekend of 2000, Jan. 1 and 2, the agency will
set up a Y2K command center and test all of its technological
systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Implementation of the strategy will ensure, to the extent
possible, that SSA's facilities will be fully operational on Jan. 3
_ the first business day of the new century,'' Apfel said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. General Accounting Office released a report Thursday
that praised Social Security's commitment to addressing the Y2K
challenges but criticized its discontinuation of a program designed
to speed Social Security payments to the disabled.

U.S. WILL NOT EXTRADITE CHINESE SECT LEADER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. State Department on Thursday flatly
rejected any chance that Li Hongzhi, the U.S.-based founder of the
outlawed Falun Gong sect in China, would be extradited to China
where officials have issued an arrest warrant for him.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Reeker, a State Department spokesman, said the United
States and China don't have an extradition treaty, thus making
extradition impossible. The United States has extradition treaties
with 115 nations, with Russia and China being the major exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials issued an arrest warrant Thursday for Li, who
is the leader of Falun Gong, and said they would seek international
help to place him in Chinese custody.
</P>
<P>
   Because the popular spiritual group has an estimated 10 million
followers, including many members of the Chinese Communist party,
Beijing leaders are concerned that the group poses a challenge to
their autocratic rule.
</P>
<P>
   Li, a Chinese citizen residing in New York City, was charged
with ``disturbing public order'' by organizing demonstrations
without permits, and with spreading ``superstition and malicious
fallacies to deceive people, resulting in the deaths of many
practitioners,'' according to China's official state-run Xinhua
news agency.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese government claimed the group was to blame for 743
deaths.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual move against a Chinese exile, Beijing said it
would ask for cooperation from member nations of Interpol, the
international police force, to arrest Li, according to Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
   Erping Zhang, a Falun Gong spokesman here, dismissed the charges
as ``groundless.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not against the Chinese government, nor do we have any
political aspirations,'' he said, calling on the Beijing leadership
to ``respect the rights of freedom of belief, freedom of assembly,
freedom of expression as clearly stated in the constitution of the
People's Republic of China.''
</P>
<P>
   Gail Rachlin, a Falun Gong spokeswoman, added that the group was
not a cult, as the Chinese government asserts.
</P>
<P>
   Falun Gong participants practice a type of meditation regimen
similar to Tai Chi, a series of relaxation exercises popular in
China and growing in the West. It is based on the martial arts,
Buddhism and Taoism. The group claims 100 million practitioners in
over 30 countries. Li founded the group in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the group says it operates ``practice
centers'' in 39 states.
</P>
<P>
   China began a crackdown a week ago when it banned Falun Gong and
arrested members of the group. Government media said Thursday that
authorities were destroying more than 1.5 million books, posters
and other materials seized from the group.
</P>
<P>
   ``We deplore such heavy-handed attempts to censure free
expression and freedom of thought, conscience and religion,''
Reeker said. ``We call upon China to uphold its obligations under
international human rights instruments and to protect freedom of
expression.''
</P>
<P>
   The State Department's chief spokesman, James Rubin, said the
administration was ``disturbed'' by the government's actions
against the sect.
</P>
<P>
   About 500 members staged a protest Thursday on the grounds of
the U.S. Capitol seeking to draw attention to the plight of Li and
other members who have been arrested or harassed over the last
week.
</P>
<P>
   The group's members were arranged in a rectangle formation of 25
rows of 20 people and were seated on the grass, with each row about
15 feet apart. They sat silently, their eyes closed, and slowly
moved their arms as soft Asian music played over loud speakers.
</P>
<P>
   Several other members held up a yellow banner that read, ``We
request a peaceful dialogue with the Chinese government.''

IRISH DRUG DEALER GETS LIFE SENTENCE IN JOURNALIST'S SLAYING 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By JAMES F. CLARITY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN _ A major Dublin drug dealer was sentenced to life
imprisonment Thursday after being convicted for the 1996 murder of
Veronica Guerin, a prominent Dublin journalist who reported
aggressively on organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   The dealer, Brian Meehan, 34, who had pleaded not guilty, was
convicted in the Special Criminal Court in Dublin by a panel of
judges. The court was established to prosecute political terrorists
and other criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Meehan was also sentenced to 47 years on 14 counts of drug
dealing and weapons possession. Police said he was the king of
Dublin cannabis dealers, earning about $1 million in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Normally there is no parole before 14 years have been served.
</P>
<P>
   Meehan was accused of being the driver of the motorcycle that
took the gunman to intercept Ms. Guerin's car on the outskirts of
Dublin on June 26, 1996. She was shot in the face and chest six
times by a man with a Magnum .357 pistol. The gunman, who has been
publicly identified only as Mr. A, has been arrested but not tried.
His trial is expected later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Last November another Dubliner, Paul Ward, a suspected member of
Meehan's operation, was also sentenced to life for the murder of
Ms. Guerin. The court accepted testimony that he helped plan the
killing and disposed of the gun and motorcycle after the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Meehan had sought to silence Ms. Guerin, 37, because of her
stories in The Sunday Independent newspaper, witnesses said. Before
the killing, she had been shot in the leg in her home, but she
refused an offer of police protection. There was criticism by other
journalists of the Independent's editors for having allowed her to
pursue criminals, including drug dealers, and confront them
directly.

HASEK SAYS UPCOMING SEASON WILL BE HIS LAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dominik Hasek will be the Dominator for one more year and then
no more.
</P>
<P>
   The Buffalo Sabres goaltender, who was the NHL's most valuable
player in 1997 and '98 and won the Vezina Trophy as the league's
best netminder five of the last six years, made it official
Thursday that he will hang up his skates after the upcoming season.
</P>
<P>
   Hasek, who helped carry the Sabres to the Stanley Cup finals
last season, said family considerations primarily were what
prompted his decision. Hasek and his wife, Alena, have a 9-year-old
son, Michael, and 4-year-old daughter, Dominika.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want our kids to go back to the Czech Republic and share in
our families' backgrounds and cultures,'' said Hasek, a native of
that country and the main reason the Czech Republic captured the
hockey gold medal in the 1998 Olympic Games in Nagano. ``I can see
every year it's more and more difficult, especially for my son, to
adapt to the Czech life. Every year he has more problems to speak
Czech. This is one of the reasons. The longer we stay in the United
States, the harder it will be for our kids.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been speculated that Hasek, who turns 35 in January, also
wants to retire at the peak of his career. It was also theorized
that Hasek was hobbled by injury and didn't want to continue to go
through the rigors of the game and its long schedule. However, in a
conference call Thursday, Hasek said the groin injury that bothered
him for much of the postseason had nothing to do with his decision.
He said his health is fine and that his passion for the game is as
strong as ever.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement comes at a tough time for the NHL, which is
already starved for marquee players. Wayne Gretzky, the sport's
greatest ambassador, retired at the end of last season, and with
two new teams coming into the NHL for the 2000-2001 season, Hasek's
departure will be felt even more acutely. He said Thursday that
there is no way he would change his mind halfway through the year,
even though he is signed through 2000-01.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the decision was met with great disappointment
from the league office.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a global stage, Dominik Hasek has been an outstanding
contributor to his team, his league, his sport, and the position he
has played with such distinction,'' said commissioner Gary Bettman.
``He has been exciting and unique, has challenged himself to set
standards of excellence with the same determination that he has
shown in challenging every shooter. We are looking forward to
watching Dom play this season. We wish him well and we wish he
would change his mind.''
</P>
<P>
   It had been speculated that Hasek was trying to use his leverage
to get the Sabres to improve the club, thinking that if the team
knew he would only play for this year, it would make a series of
moves to maximize its chances for capturing the Cup. However, Hasek
said there is no ulterior motive for his decision. He also cited
his desire to move out of the spotlight and to be more active in
his Dominator clothing business, which was started about 18 months
ago, as reasons for his decision.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres' front office said it can at least plan now for when
he leaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously it will be difficult to replace somebody the caliber
of Dominik Hasek,'' said assistant general manager Larry Carriere.
``But he gave us the opportunity to plan our future a year in
advance.''
</P>
<P>
   Hasek said the timing of the announcement came as a result of
his wanting to concentrate on the game and not any outside issues
during his last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to have a lot of fun with my teammates,'' he said.
``I'm announcing it now so that when the season starts I can
minimize the distraction for my teammates, for me, and the Buffalo
Sabres organization, so we can concentrate only on hockey.''

COMMENTARY: THE MARCH OF FOLLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By A.M. ROSENTHAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``A phenomenon noticeable throughout history regardless of place
or period is the pursuit by governments of policies contrary to
their own interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do holders of high office so often act contrary to the way
reason points and enlightened self-interest suggests?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Why, to begin at the beginning, did Trojan rulers drag that
suspicious-looking wooden horse inside their walls despite every
reason to suspect a Greek trick?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These questions open a book by the late American historian
Barbara Tuchman. Its title shames Western democracy even more than
when it was published 15 years ago _ ``The March of Folly.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For most of this century we have been staring at the horses of
totalitarian governments and not only opening the gate but stuffing
them with feed. We garlanded them with money and weaponry _ until
the soldiers leapt out, German soldiers, Japanese, Iraqis, soldiers
who have been not only a danger to us but the instrument of
oppression for their own people, the engine of destruction of the
freedoms we hold so dear for ourselves. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But never have democracies accepted with such sweaty eagerness
the influence of totalitarian society, so allowed themselves to be
influenced by foreign tyranny against their own interests, turned a
more cold and cowardly shoulder to the victims of foreign
dictatorship than in the case of Communist China. About China,
America is no worse than its allies.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the issue is the right of a small nation to mention
in the mildest terms a most obvious truth. Taiwan, self-made and
free, does not demand independence but believes it should deal with
China as state to state. That sent the ever-terrified Beijing
Politburo into froth-mouthed fury and the U.S. government into an
orgy of appeasement.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This slavering endorsement of China's vendetta against Taiwan is
simply one example of the peonage of U.S. policy to China, and of
the knowing hypocrisy of ``engagement'' and ``partnership'' with
China. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Recognition of Communist China as reality was overdue when
Nixon-Kissinger ``reopened'' China. But Americans believed that
reopening would include the Chinese people, and engagement would
include open debate about the relative merits of Communism and
freedom. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Instead the engagement has become between the Washington and
Beijing bureaucracies. China's people? Beijing gave them orders to
continue keeping mouths closed. As the price of doing business with
China, Beijing ordered American businessmen to do the same. Our two
most recent presidents passed on the orders to their subordinates.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So America's government apparatus zippered mouths about the real
extent and duration of Chinese espionage, about forced labor as an
official part of the Chinese economy, about the enslavement of
Tibet, the arrests of Christians who refuse to worship only in the
place and manner ordered by the Communist Party, and about the
continuing hysterical roundup of Chinese whose tradition-based
spiritual movement attracts millions.
</P>
<P>
   For China to become far more influential in America requires
more than presidents. Other parts of American society had to go
along and have _ the majority of Congress, press commentators,
academics, American clergy who tell us not to rock the boat, and
particularly business.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   American business executives convinced themselves and their
beneficiaries in politics that somehow the Chinese economy, still
tottering under a government frenzied with fear of its own people,
is a future U.S. gold mine. Meanwhile, Americans passively absorb
the $50 billion trade deficit the wait costs.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   American believers in human rights, secular and religious, do
not talk war. Only Beijing, not the Chinese or American people,
encourages hostility with threats and aggressive insults. Human
rights advocacy asks only that we not strengthen despotism so that
we become part of its oppression machinery.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Why do powerful free nations like America keep acting against
their interests by building up despotisms until they feel strong
enough to threaten us? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One reason is self-deception stemming from stupidity _ the
refusal to learn from experience. In a person that is a danger; in
a free nation it is closer to a deliberate sin.

JAPANESE IMPOSE SEVERE PENALTIES ON CREDIT SUISSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Japanese financial authorities imposed severe sanctions
Thursday on Credit Suisse Group, closing a six-month investigation
into the firm's sale of derivative securities intended to help
Japanese banks and companies hide huge losses.
</P>
<P>
   The penalties were the most punitive ever brought against a
foreign company in Japan and were clearly meant to send a message
that the Financial Supervisory Agency, Japan's fledgling financial
watchdog, intends to end the cowboy-like activities that have long
characterized the brokerage business in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The agency and its parent, the Financial Reconstruction
Commission, revoked the license of Credit Suisse Financial
Products, thus banishing the firm's most lucrative business here,
and suspended some of the firm's other activities for periods
ranging from one month to more than one year.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign financial concerns have been watching the Credit Suisse
Group case closely as a barometer of the Japanese government's
attitude toward their business dealings in Japan. It had been
widely expected that Credit Suisse would be punished, but the
severity of the penalties was a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   There had been much internal debate among regulators about how
harsh the penalty should be, and clearly, the hard-liners won out.
It was the first time since World War II that regulators have
revoked a banking license. Prior to the war, under a different set
of laws, five banks lost their licenses, but only because they
failed capital requirements, not because of any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Hakuo Yanagisawa, the head of the commission, said investigators
had found that the financial-products division evaded and
obstructed inspections, participated in ``extremely inappropriate''
activities and violated the Banking Law and the Securities and
Exchange Law.
</P>
<P>
   An official of the Financial Supervisory Agency said regulators
had not yet decided whether to refer the case to the prosecutor's
office for criminal wrongdoing, but he noted that government
employees are required to report illegal activities for potential
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released Thursday evening, Credit Suisse noted
that the revocation of the banking license held by its derivatives
unit was unprecedented in Japan and said it considered the
punishment ``disproportionate to the criticized conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   The firm said it would still comply with the sanction and
reiterated its commitment to doing business in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the penalties were viewed as potentially damaging
to the image of Credit Suisse, Europe's sixth-largest bank. Its
shares fell 2.7 percent, to 272.5 Swiss francs ($183), on the Swiss
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   A Credit Suisse spokesman said that the penalties were
financially insignificant. He said the group's operations here
account for roughly 3 percent of its overall revenue and that loss
of the sophisticated derivatives business would probably have an
impact on overall revenue of less than 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The firm also said it understood that the practices of the past
were no longer appropriate under the stricter regulatory procedures
required as part of the ``Big Bang'' that began deregulating the
financial markets here last year. ``Serious lessons have been
learned, corrective actions initiated and disciplinary steps
completed,'' the firm said.
</P>
<P>
   Credit Suisse _ and for that matter, many other foreign and
Japanese financial institutions _ sold sophisticated derivatives
that allowed Japanese companies to defer losses, a practice
commonly referred to as ``window dressing.'' The Financial
Supervisory Agency is conducting similar investigations into Lehman
Brothers and Cresvale International Ltd., a unit of Princeton
International Economics Ltd. here, and an agency official said it
would continue to look for such transactions in future inspections
of both Japanese and foreign firms.
</P>
<P>
   Window dressing is not illegal under Japanese law, however, and
regulators were careful to label such transactions as inappropriate
rather than illegal. They may have grounds to pursue charges
against banks that tried to dress up their balance sheets because
efforts to bolster capital adequacy using such means probably
violates banking guidelines. But no regulations or laws prohibit
the use of complex derivatives by the legions of corporate clients
that bought them in hopes of papering over losses.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign investment bankers in Tokyo said they did not expect the
regulators to come down as harshly on other foreign firms.
``They're sending a message that this sort of behavior won't be
tolerated anymore, but I don't think they're going to make a
practice of punishing foreign firms,'' one banker said. Credit
Suisse was particularly aggressive about the business, and that is
what attracted the attention of authorities. The nationalization of
the Long-Term Credit Bank and Nippon Credit Bank also offered
regulators insights into the window-dressing practice. The two
banks were among Credit Suisse's best clients.
</P>
<P>
   But what seems to have especially angered the authorities was
the firm's attempt to cover up its activities and interfere with
the Financial Supervisory Agency's investigation, which started
with a surprise sweep on the morning of Jan. 20.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after investigators arrived, Michael Winning, who
oversaw Credit Suisse's legal affairs in Japan, sent e-mail and
verbal messages directing that documents be sent immediately to the
firm's offices in London, beyond the reach of the regulators, or
shredded.
</P>
<P>
   Winning and seven other employees were suspended after Credit
Suisse hired the law firm Wilmer, Cutler &AMP; Pickering to conduct an
independent investigation into the incident, and all have either
been dismissed or have resigned, the spokesman said.

`RUNAWAY BRIDE' TAKES FOREVER TO GET GOING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a risky business indeed for a studio to reteam a romantic
star duo a decade after their chemistry originally sparked on the
screen. Lightning rarely strikes twice in the same place, and movie
history is filled with evidence of that.
</P>
<P>
   To a degree, ``Runaway Bride,'' Garry Marshall's repairing of
his ``Pretty Woman'' stars, Richard Gere and Julia Roberts, squeaks
by: Their chemistry does finally shine through. But it takes
forever, and the romantic comedy that results pales in comparison
to the 1990 original.
</P>
<P>
   The premise this time has Gere as a misogynistic USA Today
columnist who, under heavy deadline pressure, uses _ and vastly
exaggerates _ an unsubstantiated item about an indecisive Maryland
woman (Roberts) who has left bridegrooms at the altar. A runaway
bride.
</P>
<P>
   When the woman points out the potentially libelous inaccuracies
in the story to his editor, the columnist is fired. So he goes to
her small hometown and hangs out, smugly sure she'll bolt from her
latest marriage attempt, so he can write about it and exonerate
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Over her protests, he also ingratiates himself with her
alcoholic father (Paul Dooley), her best friend (Joan Cusack), even
her fiance (Christopher Meloni) _ and somehow their feelings of
animosity for each other turn into ... guess what?
</P>
<P>
   The first half of the movie is fairly disastrous. The stars seem
awkward and uncomfortable, the premise is surprisingly charmless,
gags misfire and Marshall reverts to his bag of sitcom tricks.
</P>
<P>
   But the movie's vital signs improve remarkably in the second
half, and especially in the last act. The proceedings suddenly pick
up some screwball charm, the writing improves (with several truly
inspired one-liners tossed in here and there) and the secondary
characters begin to click.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, the chemistry of the stars kicks in and they
suddenly seem comfortable with their roles and each other. It may
not be as potent as what they had in ``Pretty Woman'' (or as
Roberts' chemistry with Hugh Grant in ``Notting Hill'') but it's
enough to allow us to leave the theater smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Runaway Bride. Directed by Garry Marshall. Written by Josann
McGibbon &AMP; Sara Parriott. Cast: Julia Roberts, Richard Gere, Joan
Cusack, Hector Elizondo. Paramount. 111 minutes. Rated PG.

COMMENTARY: THE NEW HUMAN RIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In this post-totalitarian world, the human rights debate needs
an update. While Americans are focusing on issues of free speech,
elections and the right to write an op-ed piece, people in the
developing world are increasingly focused on workers' rights, jobs,
the right to organize and the right to have decent working
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Quite simply, for many workers around the world, the oppression
of the unchecked commissars has been replaced by the oppression of
the unregulated capitalists, who move their manufacturing from
country to country, constantly in search of those who will work for
the lowest wages and lowest standards. To some, the Nike swoosh is
now as scary as the hammer and sickle.
</P>
<P>
   These workers need practical help from the West, not the usual
moral grandstanding. To address their needs, the human rights
community needs to retool in this post-Cold War world, every bit as
much as the old arms makers have had to learn how to make subway
cars and toasters instead of tanks.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Cold War,'' says Michael Posner, head of the Lawyers
Committee for Human Rights, ``the main issue was how do you hold
governments accountable when they violate laws and norms. Today the
emerging issue is how do you hold private companies accountable for
the treatment of their workers at a time when government control is
ebbing all over the world, or governments themselves are going into
business and can't be expected to play the watchdog or protection
role.''
</P>
<P>
   The impulse is to call for some global governing body to fix the
problem. But there is none and there will be none. The only answer
is for activists to learn how to use globalization to their
advantage _ to super-empower themselves _ so there can be global
governance, even without global government. They have to learn how
to compel companies to behave better by mobilizing consumers and
the Internet. I'm talking about a network solution for human
rights, and it's the future of social advocacy.
</P>
<P>
   Precisely such a solution is now being tested with the apparel
industry. For years, U.S. manufacturers have used their clout in
Congress to block any attempt to impose U.S. worker standards on
their factories abroad. Meanwhile, when these shirtmakers shift
production to Guatemala, there are no local standards that are
enforced there, and the International Labor Organization has no
clout. So you end up with no local or global enforcement, which was
highlighted in 1996 with the exposure of appalling working
conditions in a Honduran factory producing Kathy Lee Gifford
clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Out of that revelation a new coalition was born that will begin
operating shortly. Called the Fair Labor Association (FLA), it
brings together the Clinton administration, groups like the Lawyers
Committee, apparel makers and U.S. colleges. It will work like
this: The apparel companies and human rights groups have agreed on
a minimum standard for worker conditions in their factories,
including child labor and working hours. They also agreed on a
uniform system of monitoring that will involve independent external
monitors who are allowed to make surprise visits to factories. The
monitors will be accredited by the FLA and could range from church
groups to PriceWaterhouse. The FLA will issue an annual report on
each company's compliance, which will be broadcast on the Internet
and, it is hoped, published by Consumer Reports.
</P>
<P>
   If a company meets the standards, it will be allowed to attach a
special FLA label on its clothes, so, for the first time, consumers
will have credible information to differentiate between brands, to
buy those that support worker rights and shun those that don't.
(Nike, Reebok, Adidas, Kathy Lee, L.L. Bean, Levi Strauss, Liz
Claiborne, Phillips Van Heusen, Patagonia and Nicole Miller are
participating. The Gap, Tommy Hilfiger, Ralph Lauren, The Limited,
Champion and Russell are not.)
</P>
<P>
   The hope is that every college bookstore and major retailer that
sells sneakers, T-shirts and sweatshirts will insist on selling
only FLA-labeled products. No one says this program is going to
revolutionize worker conditions overnight. It will set a minimum
baseline, though. And if it works, it can be a model for how to
deploy the power of networks and the Internet to make every
consumer a potential human rights enforcer and to deprive global
corporations of anywhere to hide. If it works, it can also make a
real difference in the real lives of real workers.

CANADIAN UNION WANTS HELP FROM AUTOMAKERS IN ORGANIZING PARTS
SUPPLIERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By TIMOTHY PRITCHARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ The Canadian autoworkers union is applying extra
muscle at contract bargaining time to pressure the Big Three
automakers into helping the union organize employees at Magna
International Inc., one of the world's largest automotive parts
suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   Buzz Hargrove, the Canadian auto union president, put Magna on
the agenda last week in the opening contract talks with
DaimlerChrysler Canada Inc., General Motors of Canada Ltd. and the
Ford Motor Co. of Canada. The automakers and the union are seeking
a new contract before the current one expires on Sept. 21.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian union wants the automakers to intercede with Magna
so that the union can conduct organizing drives at Magna's 55
plants in Canada, which employ 17,000 workers. None are unionized.
</P>
<P>
   The effort reflects a fear by the Canadian union about its
receding influence because of the growing role of nonunion auto
parts companies, which have become an important way for auto
manufacturers to reduce costs. The union, which represented 80
percent of Canadian parts workers in the 1970s, now represents only
about half.
</P>
<P>
   Magna, a fast-growing $6 billion company based in Aurora,
Ontario, makes body panels, frames, seats and other parts for
vehicles that range from the Chrysler minivan to the Jaguar XK8.
How the automakers will ultimately deal with the union's Magna
issue is unclear. But Hargrove said that DaimlerChrysler, Magna's
biggest customer, has been ``front and center'' in encouraging
Magna not to oppose certification of union locals in its plants.
</P>
<P>
   After repeated failures, the union is again trying to organize
450 workers at a Magna seating plant that supplies DaimlerChrysler
assembly lines in Windsor, Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian union has accused Magna of subtle forms of
intimidation. Union organizers say the company hires a large number
of immigrants who may feel more vulnerable than Canadian-born
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Magna says there is no need for a union because of the fair
employment policies developed by its founder and controlling
shareholder, Frank Stronach. These include a hot line so employees
can raise concerns with senior management, and profit-sharing and
stock ownership plans.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis DesRosiers, a Toronto-based auto industry consultant,
said the main reason workers in the industry joined a union today
was because of incompetent management. Magna has some problems at
its Windsor seat plant, he said, but overall ``this is an
incredibly well-managed company that puts its workers at the top of
the pyramid, not the bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   The union has at least two important reasons for wanting to add
Magna workers as members. First, Magna has more Canadian workers
than Ford Canada's 12,900 or DaimlerChrysler Canada's 13,800. Only
General Motors Canada has more _ 22,200. But that number has shrunk
from 30,000 six years ago as its parts operations were cut back.
</P>
<P>
   The second reason is the increasingly important role that parts
suppliers play in automotive assembly. Suppliers like Magna now
combine parts to form larger pieces such as complete interiors,
chassis and undercarriage units. That creates more jobs in supplier
plants and, ultimately, will mean fewer jobs on Big Three assembly
lines.

   BUSH-RICHARDS _ Former Gov. Ann Richards, the first Democrat to
lose to him, says the best way to go after George W. Bush is not
to. ``I wouldn't pay any attention to the opponent,'' Richards said
when he asked for her advice on how to run against Bush. As Bush
looks more and more like the inevitable GOP nominee, the Democrats
are scrambling for the most effective way of running against him.
So far, the Gore camp has adopted a relatively low-key, subtle
approach. But the Democratic National Committee, ignoring Richards
advice and perhaps foreshadowing what's to come, is mounting a
full-frontal assault. A look at the Democratic strategy for beating

despite a history of terrorist attacks and a rising crime rate,
seems decisively against the form of punishment that is so
prevalent in the United States. Israel has only used the death
penalty once in its 51-year-history. That was to execute senior

humanity. (Kaplow, Cox News Service).

<P>
   An unexpected spike in an important inflation warning signal
that tracks labor costs spooked financial markets Thursday,
overshadowing a separate government report that showed the robust
American economy took a breather in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the reassuring signs that the economy is not
overheating, both the stock and bond markets fell sharply on fears
that Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who closely monitors
the so-called employment cost index, may now be more likely to
favor raising interest rates in the near future as a preventive
measure against rising prices.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 180.78 points, or 1.65
percent, to close at 10791.29. The broader market fell even more,
with the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index down 1.78 percent and the
Nasdaq composite index dropping 2.43 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury market, ever sensitive to inflation fears, took a
direct hit. The price of the benchmark 30-year bond was down about
three-quarters of a point as the yield, which moves in the opposite
direction, rose to 6.07 percent from 6.01 percent on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed already nudged short-term rates up by a quarter of a
point at the end of June and in the past several days Greenspan has
warned that he would act ``promptly and forcefully'' at the first
hint that inflation was accelerating.
</P>
<P>
   But several analysts cautioned that the financial markets may
have over-reacted to the threat of inflation and that any upswing
in prices is likely to be muted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best days of inflation news may be behind us,'' said
Nicholas Perna, chief economist at the Fleet Bank in Hartford.
Still, he added, ``nothing untoward is necessarily down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   And Bill Cheney, chief economist at John Hancock, the insurance
and investment company in Boston, said that the rise in
compensation costs last quarter, the biggest in eight years, needs
to be balanced against the previous two quarters, when the gain was
unusually small. ``The wage inflation picture is still benign,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, even though economic growth moderated significantly
in the April-June quarter, there were plenty of signs of continued
strength in the latest figures.
</P>
<P>
   The gross domestic product _ the nation's total output of goods
and services _ expanded at a modest 2.3 percent annual pace, not
much more than half the rate of last winter, the Commerce
Department reported Thursday. The slowdown in growth was much more
abrupt than forecasters had been expecting.
</P>
<P>
   American consumers, who had lately been doing so much of the
world's buying, pulled back from their torrid 6.7 percent spending
pace earlier in the year. But spending still advanced at a robust
annual rate of 4 percent, with Americans digging deeper into debt
by shopping more avidly than their gains in take-home pay would
support.
</P>
<P>
   The trade deficit continued to serve as a drag on the economy,
but it was a less severe brake than in recent periods. Spending on
housing slowed considerably and so did the accumulation of
inventories by American businesses.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, business investment in equipment and buildings grew
at a strong annual rate of 9.1 percent and computer purchases by
businesses advanced at a blazing 41.5 percent annual rate.
</P>
<P>
   After two years of growth well in excess of the 2.5 percent to 3
percent rate the Fed deems sustainable over the long haul, the
signs of moderation would normally have been cause for celebration
on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   But instead it was the surprisingly large 1.1 percent jump in
the Labor Department's closely-watched employment cost index that
created all kinds of commotion. The measure tracks changes in total
compensation _ wages and salaries, of course, but also fringe
benefits like health insurance and pension contributions. Both
benefits and pay leapt, with the biggest increases coming in the
highest and lowest paying industries.
</P>
<P>
   Financial firms sharply boosted bonuses while retailers, who
have been coping with labor shortages in many parts of the country,
raised both pay and benefits. The second quarter increase was the
biggest spurt since the spring of 1991 and nearly three times the
tiny 0.4 percent increase in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Wages and salaries grew faster than fringe benefits, but benefit
costs rose by nearly a percentage point in the spring. Costs for
employer-provided health insurance had been remarkably tame in
recent years, thanks to the pressure on most workers to shift to
health maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   But economists have been warning for some time that once the
one-time savings have been achieved, health care costs would start
rising faster. They now appear to be doing so.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Investors have been worried that the Fed was preparing to launch
a series of rate hikes to rein in the exuberant economy. The
outsize spurt in labor costs seemed to confirm their anxieties.
</P>
<P>
   The economic picture, however, does not look as alarmingly
different as the headline numbers on Thursday's reports made it
seem.
</P>
<P>
   Take the labor cost data first. For one thing, the spurt in
labor costs followed a puzzling slowdown last winter when the index
barely rose even as unemployment dropped to its lowest level in
three decades. For another, compensation costs for private industry
are up just 3.3 percent from a year ago, less than the 3.5 percent
rise the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   As of now, it is still possible that labor costs are simply
catching up, and that the second quarter does not signal a new
trend. ``Nobody will know for another few quarters whether the
second quarter increase was an aberration,'' Perna said.
</P>
<P>
   Further, there was no evidence in Thursday's GDP report that
actual inflation was accelerating or that American corporations
were finding it any easier to pass cost increases on to consumers.
While import prices moved up sharply, the so-called GDP deflator,
which measures the prices of all domestically produced goods and
services, rose at a tame 1.6 percent annual rate in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   By the same token, the economy still appears to have plenty of
momentum. After the big blowout on cars and other big ticket items,
which was accompanied by a surge in borrowing, a slowdown was not
only inevitable, but reassuring.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the evidence seemed to point to a slight cooling off of
the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Slower growth in consumption, housing and inventories,'' said
Dean Baker, an economist at the Preamble Center, a liberal advocacy
group in Washington, ``should eliminate any immediate concerns that
the economy is growing at an unsustainable rate.''
</P>
<P>
   But given the mixed picture, investors and analysts will be
focusing most intently on next Friday's release of July employment
data, which will provide the first important clue to the economy's
performance as it entered the hot _ at least in terms of
temperature _ summer season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy is moderating but the Fed is still on hair-trigger
alert,'' said Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch in
New York. ``Stay tuned.''

EXPERTS SAY ENVIRONMENT WAS RIPE FOR WOODSTOCK RIOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ALAN WECHSLER  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union   ALBANY, N.Y. _ As cleanup continues on
the decimated property that was once Woodstock '99, a national
expert in rock concert crowd safety says organizers are to blame
for creating an environment that was ripe for Sunday's riot. Paul
Wertheimer, owner of Crowd Management Strategies in Chicago, said
organizers should have taken stronger steps to enforce the rules
before things got out of hand _ and that the riots might not have
happened in the first place if enough people had been hired to keep
the sites and toilets clean. ``It was the design of their whole
crowd management plan that failed,'' said Wertheimer, a
crowd-control consultant who began his career investigating the
1979 deaths in Cincinnati of 11 people killed in a crush of fans
trying to get into a rock show by The Who. ``They didn't act quick
enough, and they weren't prepared enough,'' added Wertheimer, who
keeps statistics on concert injuries and is an advocate for safer
conditions. On Tuesday, it was announced that Woodstock had had a
second death. David DeRosia, 24, of Connecticut, was airlifted from
the concert Saturday afternoon after being taken to a medical tent
with a high heart rate, low blood pressure and confusion, according
to Woodstock spokeswoman Ilene Marder. He died at 2 a.m. Sunday in
Syracuse, but Woodstock officials say they did not learn of the
death until Tuesday. The cause of death was still unknown.
Woodstock '99, held at an airstrip in Rome, lured 250,000 people
for three days of mostly peaceful music. But the fun was shattered
Sunday night when hundreds of youths ran amok for hours, burning,
looting and destroying everything they could get their hands on
before State Police took control of the site at dawn.
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Tuesday, workers continued to clean the site. Every square
foot is covered in refuse, from pizza boxes to water bottles.
Marder said the cleaning staff will use street-sweepers and large
vacuums to clean whenever possible. On Monday, however, a dozen men
with garbage bags were picking up refuse by hand. ``It's a lot more
than they expected, and half the workers quit,'' said a man who
identified himself as ``Bullfrog.'' ``They've only got one sweeper.
It's someplace else.'' Wertheimer said the Woodstock problems began
with garbage. Woodstock Ventures Inc. should have made sure they
hired enough staff to clean the site every night, he said. Instead,
the refuse built up until, by Sunday, you could not stand or sit
anywhere without being next to trash. He also said Woodstock's
biggest problem was not enforcing the rules. Once concertgoers
realized what they could get away with, such as breaking down the
12-foot fence and stealing from trucks, they became more brash. It
also didn't help that a number of bands, notably Limp Bizkit, were
successfully inciting the crowd to become more wild and
destructive, he said. Wertheimer added that allowing a number of
security guards to leave before the end of the show was a major
error. ``I cannot excuse the vandals who caused the trouble,'' he
said. ``But we know about that element. ... That's why everybody
plans for the hooligan element.'' Woodstock organizers could not be
reached for comment yesterday. Over the weekend, however,
organizers Michael Lang and John Scher have said they were trying
to clean the garbage as well as they could. They said security
guards were told not to try to put the fires out because of concern
for their safety, and firefighters were pulled back from trying to
put out the blazes because people were throwing bottles at them. At
least one state official is already proposing legislation to change
the way a show like Woodstock would be approved. On Monday, state
Senator Nancy Lorraine Hoffmann, a Republican from Syracuse, said
she would propose several bills that would affect large concerts
like Woodstock. She says State Police approval should be required
for security at such large shows, and the state Health Department
should be responsible for keeping the site clean and healthy. She
is also proposing a bill to require that concert venues recycle.
Much of the refuse at Woodstock was from plastic water bottles that
ordinarily would be recycled. The bottles were instead used by
concertgoers to throw at police and feed the bonfires that started
the riot.

RESTORED `THIRD MAN' HAS BEEN RESTORED TO ALL ITS GLORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If ever a film needed no introduction it's Carol Reed's 1949
masterpiece, ``The Third Man,'' which has been restored to all its
pristine glory for its 50th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   It's been considered a classic since the day it was released,
and last year the celebrated American Film Institute poll of the
100 greatest American films placed it at number 57 (even though
it's officially a British film). This year, American
Cinematographer Magazine named it one of the 10 ``best-shot''
films.
</P>
<P>
   Based on an original screenplay by Graham Greene, it's the story
of a naive American pulp writer, Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten), who
comes to postwar Vienna on the invitation of his old pal, Harry
Lime (Orson Welles) _ only to find Harry has just been killed, run
down in the street by his own driver.
</P>
<P>
   When he looks into the freak accident, he finds a certain
discrepancy in the facts. While the official witnesses all report
that two men carried the dying Harry to the side of the street, a
porter who came along minutes later says that a ``third man'' was
also present at the death scene.
</P>
<P>
   So Martins is in pursuit of the mysterious third man, propelled
by his own curiosity, by his horror of an accusation by the top
British military policeman (Trevor Howard) that Harry was an
immoral racketeer, and by his growing attraction to Harry's former
girlfriend, a Czech actress (Alida Valli).
</P>
<P>
   That's the basic premise, but it gives little clue to the
cinematic pleasures that ensue as Martins _ the most incompetent of
movie detectives _ bumbles his way through the rubble of a
war-torn, divided, morally ambiguous, curiously depopulated Vienna:
a ruin of Western Civilization.
</P>
<P>
   In his groundbreaking book ``The Great Films,'' critic William
Bayer argues that ``The Third Man'' is ``a flawless film of
intrigue and suspense, a summit of perfection within the genre ...
one of the most intelligent thrillers ever made.''
</P>
<P>
   The film is also remembered for its purely visual aspects: its
Oscar-winning black-and-white cinematography; its innovative tilted
camera angles; its chases down rain-slicked, cobblestone streets;
its heart-pounding climax in the sewers of Vienna.
</P>
<P>
   And it's legendary for its haunting, minimalist and enduringly
popular zither score and ``Third Man Theme'' by Anton Karas _ who
Reed found playing for tips in a Vienna cafe after the shooting had
commenced and hired on an inspired hunch.
</P>
<P>
   Co-star Welles has only one major dialogue scene in the film,
but Harry Lime would be one of his signature roles, so popular and
so seminal to his persona that he considered it his most movie-star
charismatic piece of acting. He revived it for years in his ``The
Lives of Harry Lime'' radio series in the '50s.
</P>
<P>
   But the star of the film is Cotten, and he's a revelation.
Always an underrated actor who had an amazing knack for being in
classic films (``Citizen Kane,'' ``Shadow of a Doubt''), his Holly
Martins is one of the cinema's great characters _ as innocent,
tragic and prototypically American as Jay Gatsby or Huck Finn.
</P>
<P>
   Note: This restored version of ``The Third Man,'' which debuted
locally at the last Seattle International Film Festival, is the
original British version _ 11 minutes longer than the 93-minute
U.S. release, with opening narration spoken by director Reed
instead of Cotten. I personally think the U.S. version plays a tiny
bit better.
</P>
<P>
   The Third Man (1949). Directed by Carol Reed. Screenplay by
Graham Greene. Cast: Joseph Cotten, Alida Valli, Orson Welles,
Trevor Howard, Bernard Lee. Rialto Pictures. Varsity. 104 minutes.

GUARDIAN OF THE UNIVERSE: CATCHING UP WITH `STAR TREK'S' RICK
BERMAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.) 
 (She also has information on how to subscribe to Inside Trek, a
weekly science-fiction column with color and black-and-white art.)
 (Includes a color slide and a black-and-white photo of ``Star
Trek'' executive producer Rick Berman.) 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Rick Berman is boldly going on. And on, and on. But it's well
worth hearing, because the executive producer of the entire ``Star
Trek'' franchise is talking about the future of ``Star Trek'' _
about ``Voyager's'' sixth year, the next ``Trek'' feature and even
the next ``Trek'' series.
 &HT;    ``We had a wonderful mix of episodes on `Voyager' last season,
in terms of action and aliens,'' Berman says. ``We had some very
poignant episodes, some time-travel shows and a decent balance of
Janeway (Kate Mulgrew) and Seven of Nine (Jeri Ryan) episodes. I'd
like to think the mix is going to be extremely similar this season.
 &HT;    ``In terms of what will be different, we have no major
changes,'' he says. ``We're not losing or gaining any major
characters, and as to the question of whether or not the ship will
return home, certainly it won't happen soon, if it were to happen
at all.''
 &HT;    The return of the Voyager has long been rumored, but Berman
confesses that, speaking strictly as a fan _ which he is _ he isn't
sure it would be such a good idea.
 &HT;    ``When you watched `The Fugitive,' you wanted Kimble to find the
one-armed man, but you also knew that would end the premise,'' he
says by telephone from his office on Paramount's Hollywood lot.
``That's not to say `Voyager' would cease to exist if the crew got
back to the Alpha Quadrant, but I think their journey back and,
hopefully, their final arrival in the Alpha Quadrant, is a
continual goal and one of the show's key elements.
 &HT;    ``There are issues that have us discussing the possibility of
getting the ship home and issues that have us realizing it would be
a good idea to hold it until much closer to the end of the show's
run,'' he concludes. ``It's an ongoing discussion.''
 &HT;    In the meantime, season six of ``Voyager'' kicks off on Sept. 22
with ``Equinox Part II,'' picking up where the fifth-season
cliffhanger left off. Subsequent episodes include ``Survival
Instinct,'' in which Borg drones inform Seven about dark secrets
from her past, and ``Barge of the Dead,'' with a sojourn to the
Klingon equivalent of Hell. Fans can also look for a Walter
Mitty-esque Doctor (Robert Picardo) episode and ``Dragon's Teeth,''
an hour that introduces a new ``Trek'' alien.
 &HT;    Behind the scenes, Brannon Braga remains co-executive producer.
Ronald Moore, Braga's old writing and producing partner, had also
joined the staff, but departed ``amicably'' after only a few weeks.
Ken Biller has since filled Moore's position.
 &HT;    With ``Deep Space Nine'' off the air and no ``Trek'' feature in
production, Berman has more time to devote to ``Voyager,'' but he
insists that _ while he ultimately has the final say _ the effort
is very much a collaborative one.
 &HT;    ``On `Voyager' I work with Brannon daily,'' he says. ``I don't
want to say I have the final word, but I guess I have the final
word.
 &HT;    ``It's a hammer I like to keep in my drawer and not take out
very much.''
 &HT;    Recently, Paramount Pictures studio boss Sherry Lansing wielded
her own hammer, commenting publicly that the 10th ``Trek'' film
might not spotlight Patrick Stewart and the rest of the ``Next
Gen'' cast.
 &HT;    After the box-office success of ``Star Trek: Insurrection,''
even in the face of lukewarm reviews, Berman thought ``Trek 10''
would focus on the same cast, he admits.
 &HT;    ``I still do,'' he insists. ``Have we seen the last of Picard
and Data and company? I can't imagine it.''
 &HT;    Even so, he admits that, one way or another, the show will go
on.
 &HT;    ``If Patrick Stewart were hit a truck tomorrow, would we stop
making movies?'' he asks. ``Probably not. But it's just too soon to
talk about a next movie.
 &HT;    ``Everything is just in such an early stage of conversation.''
 &HT;    Even more nebulous is the long-rumored next incarnation of
``Star Trek,'' the long-awaited fifth series.
 &HT;    ``Will another `Trek' series come to pass?'' Berman asks
rhetorically. ``I would say that's a pretty definite yes. I am
involved now in developing another series.
 &HT;    ``I'm doing it with Mr. Braga, and it's in a very, very early
stage,'' he adds. ``It's something that will be a pretty dramatic
departure from the last couple of series, and it will reach the
airwaves anywhere from fall 2000 to spring 2001.''
 &HT;    Given the phenomenal success of ``The Matrix'' and ``Star Wars:
The Phantom Menace,'' there appears to be a sci-fi boom in the
making. No less an authority than Leonard Nimoy has suggested that,
just as 1977's ``Star Wars'' paved the way for 1979's ``Star Trek:
The Motion Picture,'' so ``The Phantom Menace'' might spearhead
another resurgence in ``Trek's'' popularity.
 &HT;    ``I think Leonard is right,'' Berman says. ``Ironically, `Trek'
influenced George Lucas when it was a television series, and it
also inspired the space program and all that. It influenced the
first `Star Wars' movie, and `Star Wars' definitely gave birth to
the `Trek' movies. There has been a switch-off back and forth.
 &HT;    ``Now that we're dealing with the sixth season of the fourth
`Trek' series,'' he says, ``and now that we've done more than 500
hours of `Trek' television and nine movies, however, I think `Star
Trek' influences `Star Trek' more than anything else does.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ One fine day this summer, wreckers toppled six
towering smokestacks along the Monongahela River.
</P>
<P>
   Once part of a huge coke works but long idle, they were the last
vestiges of Big Steel left within the Pittsburgh city limits. The
mills that once employed tens of thousands of workers and made a
third of the world's steel have vanished like ghosts at dawn. Iron
City, aka Steeltown U.S.A., is no more.
</P>
<P>
   But having survived the truly grueling loss of most of its heavy
industry, Pittsburgh is alive and well and getting better. It has
had not one renaissance but two, and a third is under way, fueled
by an intense local pride and a gritty determination to bounce
back. Two new downtown stadiums (one for baseball, the other for
football), a new theater designed by Michael Graves and a new
convention center are on the way. Designed by Rafael Vinoly, the
$231 million convention center is to have a roof in the shape of a
catenary curve; water running off the building's cooling towers
will make it glitter by day, and interior lights will set it aglow
at night.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Pittsburgh is hard at work, striving to forge
a new economic identity as a high-tech center and a regional
medical capital.
</P>
<P>
   Cultural life has a fresh elan as well, sparked partly by the
hip, innovative Andy Warhol Museum _ ``the posthumous home of the
King of Pop,'' as someone called it. The 53rd Carnegie
International, one of the world's premier surveys of contemporary
art, will open in November at the Carnegie Museum of Art with works
by 40 established and relatively unknown artists from 17 nations,
including installation art and video as well as paintings and
sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   The century-old Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, under the
energetic, Latvian-born Mariss Jansons, one of the most prominent
of the young conductors who have emerged in recent years from the
Baltic countries, will open its season this fall not with a safe
selection of Beethoven or Brahms but with Schoenberg's immense,
romantic, seldom-performed ``Gurrelieder.'' Among the soloists will
be two of the more sought-after singers of the day, the Canadian
tenor Ben Heppner and the American mezzo-soprano Jennifer Larmore.
</P>
<P>
   And of course Pittsburgh glories, as ever, in its magnificent
site, first scouted by George Washington as a British major in
1753. The city lies deep within the Allegheny Mountains, where the
Allegheny River meets the Monongahela to form the broad Ohio. Ernie
Pyle wrote once that this was a place of ``hills, mountains,
cliffs, valleys and rivers, up and down, around and around, in
betwixt,'' much better suited to goats than people.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of antique funiculars, called inclines here, still slide
up and down the steep face of Mount Washington, across the water
from the skyscrapers packed into downtown Pittsburgh at the tip of
the Golden Triangle.
</P>
<P>
   Max King, the former editor of The Philadelphia Inquirer, who
moved to Pittsburgh this year to become the executive director of
the $1.5 billion Heinz Endowments, sees a vibrancy in downtown
Pittsburgh that is lacking in Philadelphia, and with industry
having abandoned the riverfronts, he sees ``a once-in-a-lifetime
chance'' to redevelop them to public benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pittsburgh's economic troubles spared it the sprawl that is
disfiguring Philadelphia,'' he said. ``There, the hole is quickly
emptying into the doughnut; all the action is in the suburbs. But
Pittsburgh _ the city itself _ is still the center of this region,
and it's holding.''
</P>
<P>
   There are, to be sure, plenty of problems. Race relations are
not the best. Pockets of urban rot persist not only in the
burnt-out mill towns up and down the river valleys and in the slums
in the city itself, but also downtown. A tacky T-shirt store and a
wig shop stand incongruously, for example, across the street from a
new Lazarus department store.
</P>
<P>
   The jury is still out on job creation, here as in other Rust
Belt cities like Cleveland and Detroit. Pittsburgh's population is
as old as those in some Sun Belt retirement cities, because too
many of the area's most talented young people leave in search of
economic opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   A City of Amenities
</P>
<P>
   But for those who stay or move here, the amenities are many.
Leafy, close-in suburbs like Shadyside and Squirrel Hill. A low
crime rate. Good schools. Moderate housing and living costs.
Extensive parks. A terrific zoo. Three identical suspension
bridges, all painted primrose yellow, crossing the Allegheny side
by side. Three substantial universities: Carnegie Mellon, strong in
science and technology; Duquesne, known for the liberal arts and
law, and the University of Pittsburgh, a medical powerhouse where
some of the pioneering work in liver transplants was carried out.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh has its own vernacular. ``Redd'' means clean, as in
``redd off the table,'' and ``youns'' is the plural of ``you.'' It
has a certain innocence as well. Maybe, as some here complain,
Pittsburgh is provincial (or, to adopt the kinder phrase, used by
one local businessman, ``not very cosmopolitan''). But it also
lacks the edgy aggressiveness of many larger cities.
</P>
<P>
   This is, after all, the hometown of Fred Rogers, the kids'
sweet-natured friend Mr. Rogers, whose program is made at WQED, the
nation's first public television station.
</P>
<P>
   You arrive in Pittsburgh from the west, where the airport is
situated, by way of the Fort Pitt Tunnel. One minute you are
cruising along amid wooded hills, the next you are in the
half-mile-long tube, and then you emerge onto a bridge. Dead in
front of you is Pittsburgh's skyline, a sudden, dramatic,
exhilarating sight, akin to spying the New York or San Francisco
skyline from a steamship in the days before the dawn of jet travel.
</P>
<P>
   The air is clean, the rivers are bright and clear, and if the
sun is shining, John Burgee and Philip Johnson's PPG Place, the
Houses of Parliament in London transmuted into a glass office
building, catches your eye at once.
</P>
<P>
   But of course the approach didn't always look so splendid.

 PITTSBURGH: so splendid. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Determined Mayors
</P>
<P>
   It took a series of determined mayors to change the city's face,
starting in the 1950s with David Lawrence, who adopted the slogan
``Smoke Must Go.'' He and successors like Peter Flaherty and
Richard Caliguiri made common cause with business leaders, notably
Richard King Mellon.
</P>
<P>
   Rachel Carson, who grew up not far from here, would have been
proud of what they accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   In its heyday as the self-described Workshop of the World,
Pittsburgh was an industrial inferno. Only half a century ago, the
rivers teemed with tugs and barges, and the mills poured brown and
green ooze into the water and black and gray soot into the skies,
so much so that street lights often had to be kept on all day. One
week in 1948, 30 people were killed by smog in the grimy little
borough of Donora (where, incidentally, the baseball hall-of-famer
Stan Musial grew up).
</P>
<P>
   ``Blackest place I ever saw,'' said the 19th-century English
traveler Anthony Trollope, and he knew grim industrial landscapes
at home.
</P>
<P>
   But Pittsburgh produced steel in prodigious quantities. At the
end of World War II, United States Steel, the first billion-dollar
corporation in history when it was formed in 1901, made twice as
much steel as the entire Soviet Union. Set against that, what was a
little pollution?
</P>
<P>
   Enormous Fortunes
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh also produced enormous fortunes for men like Andrew
Carnegie, an immigrant from Scotland who built a steel empire;
Henry Clay Frick, the king of coke, the baked coal essential to the
steel-making process, who was first an aide and then a rival to
Carnegie, and Andrew Mellon, the banker who financed the new
magnates and grew rich in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Mellon money built the National Gallery in Washington, and when
Andrew Mellon's son, Paul, died this year at the age of 91, he had
given it more than 1,000 pictures, including two van Goghs and 12
Winslow Homers in a final bequest, as well as $75 million in cash.
Frick money built New York's finest small art museum. Carnegie
money built libraries around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Only small fractions of their wealth stayed in Pittsburgh,
though their names grace monuments, buildings, parks, streets and
museums.
</P>
<P>
   To work in the mills, peasants came from all over Europe. A sign
from one Carnegie plant, preserved in the excellent (if clumsily
named) John Heinz Pittsburgh Regional History Center, warned of
danger in English, Italian, Hungarian, Slovak and Serbo-Croatian.
My great-grandfather was one of those hardy spirits, and his son,
my grandfather, worked in nearby Jeanette, which was for some time
the center of the American glass industry. My father was born
there.
</P>
<P>
   Myths grew up about industrial Bunyans like Joe Magarac, a
Hungarian who could derail a locomotive with his little finger, and
Steve Mestrovic, a Serb who could supposedly twist a 500-pound
steel bar into a pretzel. In real life, the tough river towns where
the immigrants settled produced more than their share of sports
heroes, especially pro football quarterbacks, including Johnny
Unitas, Joe Montana, Jim Kelly, Joe Namath and George Blanda.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh quickly became a battleground between labor and
capital. In the notorious Homestead strike of 1892, Pinkerton
detectives employed by Frick clashed with workers; 20 people were
killed and 300 wounded. The Amalgamated Association of Iron and
Steel Workers was crushed. Industry won the battle, but labor won
the war, decades later, when Philip Murray organized the United
Steel Workers Union. Now plans are afoot to bring the site of the
strike and other steel-industry landmarks under the aegis of the
National Park Service.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks streamed into Pittsburgh as well, and soon built a
thriving subculture. The Pittsburgh Courier was the nation's
leading African-American newspaper, and the city produced a
seemingly endless flow of jazz stars, from Billy Strayhorn to
Erroll Garner to Mary Lou Williams. Before the integration of major
league baseball, the Pittsburgh Crawfords and the Homestead Grays
flourished on the black circuit with players like Josh Gibson and
the inimitable Satchel Paige.
</P>
<P>
   Sports still loom large here, as befits the city's six-pack
image, though the relatively small population (350,000, with
1,335,000 in Allegheny County) makes supporting big-league teams
difficult. The Pittsburgh Penguins, twice National Hockey League
champions in recent years, were faced with bankruptcy until a judge
approved a plan under which Mario Lemieux, the team's greatest star
until he retired in 1997, took control of the team.
</P>
<P>
   Legends live on, like Pirates infielder Bill Mazeroski's
improbable last-of-the-ninth home run to beat the Yankees, 10-9, in
the seventh game of the 1960 World Series, and Steelers running
back Franco Harris' ``immaculate reception'' of Terry Bradshaw's
deflected last-gasp pass to win a crucial playoff game in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Architectural Highlights
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh is rediscovering its significant architectural
heritage and urging visitors to do the same. Southwestern
Pennsylvania has two of the very greatest American buildings, Henry
Hobson Richardson's Allegheny County Courthouse and Jail, in
Pittsburgh, and Frank Lloyd Wright's wonderful cantilevered country
villa, Fallingwater, an hour to the southeast.
</P>
<P>
   Fallingwater was built for Pittsburgh merchant Edgar Kaufmann,
who cooked up a number of other projects, most of them never built,
with the master of Taliesen. Plans and models can be seen in a show
at the Carnegie Museum through Aug. 27.
</P>
<P>
   The courthouse _ a great castlelike structure of rusticated
granite, with a 325-foot tower _ is connected to the jail by a
Bridge of Sighs like the one that links the Doge's Palace and the
jail in Venice. It is a massive, masculine ensemble; the voussoirs,
or blocks, that form the main entrance, one of Richardson's
trademark Romanesque arches, are eight feet long. Yet there is
nothing clumsy or heavy about the structure.

 PITTSBURGH: the structure.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Richardson whets your appetite for more, walk down Grant
Street. On the way you will see Frick's Union Trust Building
(1915), with a breathtaking stack of nine balconies, crowned by a
round stained-glass skylight, and a froth of terra-cotta turrets,
balustrades, pinnacles and balustrades on the roof; the Koppers
Building (1929), in an urbane Art Deco style, and the USX Building
(1970), a bold tower in Cor-Ten steel, which oxidizes to a deep
red-brown, protecting against deterioration.
</P>
<P>
   The USX Building, by Harrison &AMP; Abramovitz, looks much less
dated than the slightly earlier buildings from the same hands, New
York's Metropolitan Opera House and Avery Fisher Hall at Lincoln
Center. Its exoskeleton of vertical beams is filled with water and
antifreeze as a fire retardant.
</P>
<P>
   In a real sense the USX Building is a continuing advertisement
for the company that built it, once named U.S. Steel. So is the
former Alcoa Building (1953), nearby on Sixth Avenue, whose skin is
formed of preformed aluminum panels, and the glass-faced PPG Place
(1984), on Third Avenue, which was built by a company formerly
called Pittsburgh Plate Glass.
</P>
<P>
   A Cultural Catalyst
</P>
<P>
   No family has done more for Pittsburgh, especially for the arts
in Pittsburgh, than the Heinzes, purveyors to the world of 57
Varieties _ actually, today, more like 5,700. It was H.J. Heinz II,
known as Jack, who had the idea that cultural resources could aid
in jump-starting an economic revival here. He bought four abandoned
movie theaters downtown and helped turn them into the Cultural
District, anchored by Heinz Hall, home to the Symphony.
</P>
<P>
   Fritz Reiner, William Steinberg, Andre Previn and Lorin Maazel
all helped to mold the orchestra's global reputation, but Heinz
dollars balanced the organization's budget. Without them, as Gideon
Toeplitz, the managing director, said several years ago, Pittsburgh
would have ``a small regional orchestra rather like the Wheeling
Symphony just down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   In December, the new home of the Pittsburgh Public Theater will
open across the street from Heinz Hall with a world premiere of a
play by August Wilson, a Pittsburgh native. Designed by Michael
Graves, with a great copper cowl giving its facade a distinctive
appearance, it has a Heinz connection, too. It was partly financed
by the friends of, and named for, Anthony J.F. O'Reilly, H.J. Heinz
Co.'s 's Irish-born chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Next door will stand a fountain designed by Louise Bourgeois.
</P>
<P>
   Drama is a many-layered thing in Pittsburgh. Apart from the
Public Theater and the musicals that also play in the Cultural
District, there are the venturesome City Theater on the South Side
and Karla Boos' lively Quantum Theater, which performs in spaces
either discovered or improvised.
</P>
<P>
   Neither opera nor dance is big-league yet, but the city has an
amazing number of dance organizations, large and small. The most
prominent is the Pittsburgh Ballet Theater, whose artistic
director, Terrence Orr, has steered it away from the Balanchine
tradition toward that of his alma mater, American Ballet Theater.
</P>
<P>
   The Phipps Botanical Gardens, an 1893 gift from Henry Phipps,
one of Carnegie's sidekicks, has a 13-room Victorian conservatory,
one of the finest in the country. And the Frick Art Museum, a
country cousin of the New York showplace, exhibits the collection
of Henry Clay Frick's daughter, Helen; its highlights are a
magisterial Rubens portrait and works by the Sienese masters Duccio
and Sassetta.
</P>
<P>
   Bones and Art
</P>
<P>
   But the heaviest hitters here, in addition to the Symphony, are
the Carnegie and Warhol museums.
</P>
<P>
   The Carnegie complex, in Oakland, east of downtown, includes a
museum of natural history, renowned for its dinosaur collection, as
well as the art museum, headquarters for the International, whose
curator this year is Madeleine Grynsztejn. Since its beginning, the
art museum has concentrated on the art of the 19th and 20th
centuries _ ``the Old Masters of tomorrow,'' as Carnegie himself
put it.
</P>
<P>
   Paintings, sculpture and the decorative arts are intermingled to
good effect in galleries occupied by the permanent collection.
Take, for instance, the room devoted to the Arts and Crafts
Movement; there, furniture by C.F.A. Voysey and Harvey Ellis and
copperware by W.A.S. Benson keep company with two huge, newly
acquired Pre-Raphaelite canvases by Burne-Jones.
</P>
<P>
   First-rate pictures by the likes of Cezanne, Kirchner and Degas
(a smashing portrait of the engineer Henri Rouart) lie ahead. But
most intriguing to me was a selection of pioneer American
abstractionists like Burgoyne Diller, George L.K. Morris and
Stanton Macdonald-Wright.
</P>
<P>
   Over at the Warhol, installed in an old seven-story building
renovated by the New York architect Richard Gluckman, you are
greeted by a big cobalt-blue self-portrait of the artist,
wide-eyed, spiky-haired. The building is filled with Warhol's
collections (milk glass, shoes of famous people); Warhol's
wallpaper (I liked the pink-and-yellow cow pattern); Warhol's
films; Warhol's portraits of Mao, Liz and Mick; Warhol's books and
Warhol's archives _ 605 identical boxes filled with everything from
the master pack rat's mail to the original images on which he based
his famous silk screens.
</P>
<P>
   A Pittsburgh native whose parents came from the Carpathian
Mountains in central Europe, Warhol once wrote: ``You live in your
dream America that you've custom-made from art and schmaltz and
emotions just as much as you live in your real one.'' The museum is
Andy's world, custom-recreated.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh has taken to it slowly; Thomas Sokolowski, the
director, says, ``It's a sober city, very Presbyterian.'' Of the
65,000 visitors to the museum last year, half came from out of
state, many from Japan and Germany. But Sokolowski keeps plugging.
He has started a Friday happy hour and has big plans for musical
events, including a staging of the Satie-Poulenc-Ravel triple bill
``Parade,'' as big a scandal in its day as Warhol in his.

   Enjoying Pittsburgh
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh is 365 miles southwest of New York City. Here is a
sampling of attractions and places to stay and eat in the area,
along with travel information:
</P>
<P>
   Where to Stay
</P>
<P>
   DOUBLETREE HOTEL, 1000 Penn Ave., (412) 281-3700. Renovated only
this year, the Doubletree is Pittsburgh's freshest hotel, with a
light-filled, four-story atrium lobby. Theaters are just a couple
of blocks away, and an enclosed walkway leads to the convention
center. Though pretty prosaic, the rooms are a good deal roomier
than the chain hotel standard. Double rooms: $189 weekdays; $119 to
$189 weekends.
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH HILTON, Gateway Center, (412) 391-4600. In a city
that woefully lacks a top-drawer hotel, the Hilton is blessed with
those three cardinal virtues: location, location and location.
Overlooking the junction of the Allegheny and Monongahela, with 711
rooms and 38 suites, it is a convention hotel par excellence, with
all the pluses and minuses that go with that. The crisp, smallish,
up-to-date rooms on the top floors are the best. Double rooms: $199
to $250.
</P>
<P>
   SUNNYLEDGE, 5124 Fifth Ave., Shadyside, (412) 683-5014. Oakland
once had a pair of fine big hotels, the Schenley and Webster Hall.
Both are long gone, alas, but this eight-room red-brick inn
provides a classy refuge for visitors to the universities and the
museums. All mod cons: minibars, cable television, Jacuzzi tubs,
hair dryers and Frette linens. Double rooms: $199 to $189; suites,
$275.
</P>
<P>
   WESTIN WILLIAM PENN, 530 William Penn Place, (412) 281-7100.
Henry Clay Frick built this Beaux-Arts pile to house his business
friends when they came to town. After countless face lifts, the old
girl is handsome enough, with enormous crystal chandeliers in the
Palm Court. But the service is disheartening, with breakfast cards
sometimes left dangling on doorknobs, unfilled, and desultory
delivery of baggage and messages. Today's nabobs send their
visitors down the street to the veddy private Duquesne Club. Double
rooms: $169 to $229, weekdays; $99 to $169, weekends.
</P>
<P>
   Where to Eat
</P>
<P>
   CAFE ALLEGRO, 51 S. 12th St., (412) 481-7788. The cooking is a
tad uneven at this relaxed spot next to the 1915 South Side Market
House, just off post-industrial Carson Street; one night recently,
the veal chop was tasty and sweet seared scallops were nicely mated
with a tangy tangerine-juice reduction, but smoked trout was too
dry and soft-shell were crabs overcooked. Still, the spirit is
willing; baffled at first by a request for cheese at meal's end,
the kitchen quickly improvised an appealing assortment.
</P>
<P>
   CASBAH, 229 S. Highland Ave., Shadyside, (412) 661-5656. This is
the lead restaurant of an entrepreneurial duo who call themselves
Big Burrito Inc. The menu is Mediterranean: tagines from Morocco,
fearlessly fiery merguez sausage from Tunisia, pasta, a dense
ragout of lamb with couscous. Flavors are as emphatic as a smack in
the chops. Terrific wines, especially the Rhones, and a sultry,
sand-colored decor with hanging lamps reminiscent of Venice and
Fortuny.
</P>
<P>
   STEELHEAD GRILL, 112 Washington Place, (412) 394-3474. An
outpost of Drew Nieporent's empire (and hence a sibling of New
York's Tribeca Grill and Nobu), this is the city's top table, for
my money. Greg Alauzen, a hometown boy, concocts a shellfish
chowder that would delight any Down Easter, and serves skillfully
grilled shrimp on a bed of linguine with a rich basil-lemon sauce.
The wines are chosen by the savvy Daniel Johnnes of Montrachet.
</P>
<P>
   TESSARO'S, 4601 Liberty Ave., Bloomfield, (412) 682-6809. You're
tired of beurre blanc and balsamic vinegar and waiters named Clyde.
You need a joint with no attitude. In Pittsburgh, Tessaro's fills
the bill perfectly: a bar in a working-class neighborhood with Sam
Adams on draft, decadently juicy half-pound burgers cooked on a
hardwood grill, and plenty of good cheer. No french fries, no
dessert, no reservations, just sensational meat.
</P>
<P>
   LA CUCINA FLEGREA, 2114 Murray Ave., Squirrel Hill, (412)
521-2082. The room is plain and tiny, but the minute you walk in,
you know you're in the right place. It smells Italian, not
Italian-American. Anna Fevola comes from a village north of Naples,
and her cooking has that superbly unadorned clarity of flavor we
all long for. Order the grilled sausage, with charred edges, served
underneath a blanket of bitter rapini. BYOB.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Sitting around a table in the back room of a
restaurant on this city's south side, four followers of Falun Gong
discussed their shock and sense of betrayal at the government's
crackdown on their spiritual movement.
</P>
<P>
   There must be some misunderstanding, the four men agreed. To
them, Falun Gong is a life-saving road to spiritual awakening and
physical well-being through exercise and meditation, though the
government has branded it as a political evil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Banning a whole movement is impossible,'' said Liang Zhenxing,
a 34-year-old carpenter who has been practicing Falung Gong for
four years. ``Our activity is healthy. We are not going to quit. We
are going to continue to demand to be recognized legally.''
</P>
<P>
   The crackdown on Falun Gong appears to be a classic clash of
ancient Chinese culture with the grim modern reality of Communist
Party politics.
</P>
<P>
   On one side is an army of ordinary people _ many of them retired
women and laid-off workers _ yearning for spiritual fulfillment. On
the other is an increasingly paranoid crew of Communist Party
leaders who feel threatened to their core by a movement aimed at
countering the soulessness that has infected a country whose
official ideology has grown stale and pointless.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the Chinese police issued an arrest warrant for Li
Hongzhi, Falun Gong's founder, an essentially meaningless gesture,
since Li lives in New York and the United States does not have an
extradition treaty with China.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the arrest warrant reflects the primacy of politics
over legal procedure in China. A week into China's political
campaign against Falun Gong, every ministry is expected to
demonstrate its resolve to combat the group, and the Public
Security Ministry's logical response is to say it would like to
arrest him.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's media blitz included television footage of some of
the destruction of 1.5 million of the movement's publications by
crushing or shredding, an act that is redolent of the ancient
practice of burning books in a public ceremony when a Chinese
emperor wanted both to control information and to send a message
about what was permitted. In the modern version, such repression
also includes blocking many Internet sites.
</P>
<P>
   Falun Gong followers rely heavily on Internet Web sites, e-mail
and mobile phones to pass on information and mobilize.
</P>
<P>
   How well the authorities will succeed is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to shut us down and stop us from practicing
anywhere,'' said Zhai Shulin, a 32-year-old cook from northeastern
China. ``They cannot. We are too big.''
</P>
<P>
   How big, exactly, is an open question. Zhai and other Falun Gong
followers insist that they number at least 100 million, though
scholars say a truer figure is probably between 20 million and 60
million. The authorities, not known for their accurate portrayal of
the movement, say there are only 2 million followers.
</P>
<P>
   One of the many mysteries surrounding Falun Gong is why its
leaders took the politically reckless step on April 25 of sending
more than 10,000 followers to surround the Communist leadership's
compound in Beijing to protest what they felt was unfair treatment
by official media.
</P>
<P>
   Yet what was apparently most shocking to China's leaders was the
discovery that some senior military officers and ministry-level
officials not only believed that Falun Gong could indeed help
practitioners achieve mystical healing and paranormal powers, but
were openly urging their colleagues to take it up.
</P>
<P>
   Falun Gong, a variant of traditional qigong exercises that many
Chinese believe can enhance and channel vital forces, takes its
name from the falun, or ``law wheel'' that practitioners envision
revolving in their bodies, both emitting and absorbing energy.
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of the explosive role that mystical movements have
played in toppling weakened rulers at transitional periods
throughout Chinese history, the government has responded with an
iron fist. In addition to arresting more than 5,000 adherents, the
authorities detained more than 1,200 government officials who
follow Falun Gong for political re-education sessions, where they
are required to write self-criticisms and to study Marxist
documents.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   When the crackdown began last week, the authorities called Falun
Gong the greatest threat to their security since the Tiananmen
student movement of 1989, and orchestrated its largest political
campaign since that time, revving up the nation's sprawling
Communist Party apparatus to try to stamp out any practice of Falun
Gong.
</P>
<P>
   Labeling the movement a political operation aimed at
overthrowing the government lays the groundwork for heavy prison
sentences for the movement's organizers. A commentary in Thursday's
People's Daily, the Communist Party newspaper, stressed the need
for proper application of legal procedures in prosecuting Falun
Gong followers, an indication that China's leaders are sensitive to
criticism from human rights groups that they are violating China's
constitution, which guarantees freedom of speech and assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the authorities have spared no criticism of Li, who founded
Falun Gong in 1992 and moved to the United States in 1997. The
police accused Li of repeatedly disturbing public order and of
being indirectly responsible for the deaths of 743 Falun Gong
followers, some of whom performed reckless acts in trying to effect
supernatural feats like flying or surviving in a pit of fire.
</P>
<P>
   In the Beijing restaurant, the Falun Gong followers said they
had come to the capital from China's far northeast to protest the
crackdown, yet found themselves unable to do so because of the
overpowering police presence at Tiananmen Square and outside the
leadership compound, Zhongnanhai. Whether more protests will
follow, they said, was unknown.
</P>
<P>
   The men, seemingly earnest if politically naive, offered simple
examples of why they thought studying Falun Gong was the path to
spiritual and physical salvation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to smoke, drink and seek out, uh, members of the
opposite sex,'' said Zhai, the cook who also said he was fired from
his job last week when his restaurant, like thousands of other work
places around the country, carried out a sweeping purge of Falun
Gong members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I know that was no way to live,'' he said. ``I don't do
anything that hurts society. I have learned that before you act,
you must think about how it is going to affect other people. Others
first, self second.''
</P>
<P>
   Zhai said he was detained for three days last week, and was
beaten by the police while he was in custody.
</P>
<P>
   His friend Liang is a Communist Party member, but he said he saw
no conflict between practicing Falun Gong and believing in the
party.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are both about serving the people,'' Liang said. ``If I
have to choose, I will remain a member of Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leaders should like people like me,'' Liang continued. ``In
any environment, I am going to act well, because my behavior comes
from the heart. I am not just following what someone told me to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   A third follower, a cow herdsman from a village in northeastern
China, said that at least 70 of the 2,000 residents in his village
practiced Falun Gong. The crackdown may not extend into villages
where the government does not directly control the work force, but
the herdsman, Ji Peng, said his fellow villagers would all
willingly come to Beijing to protest the government crackdown if
they thought it would help.
</P>
<P>
   The followers protested that their movement has no formal
organization, no offices, no financial income and no political
aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can we be an organization if we don't even have a
headquarters?'' asked a fourth member, an astrophysics professor at
a university in Beijing. ``We have no income, no legal status. We
don't want any; we don't need it. All we want is to be able to
practice Falun Gong in peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressed about Falun Gong's organization, which seemed evident if
hidden in the remarkably well-coordinated protest on April 25, the
professor conceded that if there was one, it was minimal.
</P>
<P>
   ``If everyone wanted to contact Teacher Li directly, it would be
overwhelming,'' said the professor, referring to Falun Gong's
founder. ``So there have to be people who help coordinate
contact.''
</P>
<P>
   Li originally said he was in Australia giving lectures when the
protest on April 25 occurred. But after the authorities produced
immigration documents that showed his arrival in Beijing on April
22 and his departure on April 24, he acknowledged having been there
but denied having met or spoken to anyone about the protests.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's People's Daily carried a report quoting former
colleagues of Li who called him a mediocre trumpet player, an
undistinguished writer and a friendless loner.
</P>
<P>
   ``At work he didn't even write good reports, so I cannot believe
he ever wrote a book,'' said his former boss, Yan Guowu, the
newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
   The Falun Gong followers gathered around the table at the
restaurant were not bothered by inconsistencies in Li's account.
</P>
<P>
   ``Li Hongzhi's most important lesson to me is that it is
important to live as a good person,'' Liang said. ``That's all I
care about.''

REP. FRANK TO UNDERGO BYPASS SURGERY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ALOYSIUS FARRELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- US Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) will have coronary
bypass surgery Friday, but he said Thurday expects to be back on
the floor of the House as soon as Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Frank, 59, who suffered a mild heart attack in 1990, is
scheduled to have the multiple bypass operation at the National
Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Md. Four or more arteries from
his legs will be transplanted to his heart, allowing blood to
bypass clogged coronary arteries.
</P>
<P>
   Frank suffered chest pains after exercising or exerting himself
on several recent occasions, and consulted a doctor last week. A
stress test last Friday, and a heart catheterization procedure on
Wednesday convinced his physicians that he needed the surgery
before the August 7 congressional recess.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would obviously like to disrupt my work as little as
possible,'' said Frank. ``I hope to be able to do some voting next
week. They tell me if things go well I should be out by Tuesday.
Voting, as many of my colleagues know, is not heavy lifting. One
can vote without a great deal of stress and strain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a job,'' Frank said. ``I'm not going to put my life at
risk. . . . But one vote can make a big difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank said that his overall cholesterol level was low, at 164,
but that he has a chronic shortage of the beneficial type of
artery-scouring cholesterol that helps prevent clogging. Both his
father and grandfather died at early ages of heart attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have enough good cholesterol, and that is causing
blockage,'' Frank said. ``The one defect in my inheritance.''
</P>
<P>
   After his 1990 heart attack, Frank had angioplasty treatment --
in which a thin tube with a balloon-type device at its tip is
threaded through clogged coronary arteries, and then inflated to
clear them. He has been taking drugs in the last decade to thin his
blood and boost his good cholesterol. He has also followed a
fitness regime, exercising on a stair machine and lifting weights.
</P>
<P>
   Frank helped lead the Democratic defense of President Clinton
during last year's impeachment debate, and said that the workload
might have been a factor in a recent loss of stamina.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had my first heart attack after I was involved in my own set
of accusations so maybe there is a correlation between sex-related
scandals and heart attacks -- in which case I hope everybody will
behave,'' Frank said. ``It gives the phrase `affairs of the heart'
a new meaning.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank's health insurance will cover the cost of the operation,
after he pays a $250 deductible. His experience with heart disease
has given him a first-hand look at the problems Americans face with
health costs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He hopes the bypass operation leaves him in better condition
than before.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds, to some extent, more ominous than it is,'' said
Frank. ``The likelihood is I will resume my life after a
recuperation period in better physical health than before because
my arteries will be fully functioning.''

 &HT;    
 &HT;    ``Run Lola Run''
 &HT;    Grade: B+
 &HT;    Starring Franka Potente and Moritz Bleibtreu. Rated R for
violence and language. 1 hour, 21 minutes. In
 &HT;    German with English subtitles.
 &HT;    At Garden Hills.
 &HT;    The verdict: A breathless kinetic delight from Germany.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Steve Murray

<TEXT>
<P>
   A pyrotechnic celebration of style over substance, ``Run Lola
Run'' is the big-screen love child of every video game and MTV
quick-cut editing trick of the past 10 years. The Berlin-based
story is less important than how it's told. The movie is a nonstop
adrenalin kick, even though the script sometimes can't keep pace
with its leggy heroine.
</P>
<P>
   That's the flame-haired Lola (Franka Potente). The reason she
has to run is to save the life of her boyfriend, Manni (Moritz
Bleibtreu), a bagman for the mob who has misplaced 100,000 marks.
She has exactly 20 minutes to get the cash or lose Manni for good _
either to his trigger-happy bosses or to his dangerous plan of
robbing a grocery store for the loot.
</P>
<P>
   Spinning busy elaborations on this simple tale, writer-director
Tom Tykwer finds endless ways to stimulate the minuscule attention
spans of today's twentysomethings. He has so many visual surprises
and narrative digressions in his arsenal that you can never guess
where Lola, and the movie, are racing next. Especially since he
shoots the same 20-minute dash three separate times, with obstacles
in Lola's path _ a vicious dog, a baby carriage, nuns _ causing
completely different outcomes.
</P>
<P>
   In each, Lola confronts her aloof father (Herbert Knaup), a bank
executive whose daughter's financial needs are the least of his
concerns. It's in these scenes, revised three times, that ``Lola''
slows down for a taste of genuine emotion. Potente and Knaup make
the most of their moments as father and daughter, recognizing the
unbridgeable distance between them.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his swift, fat-free movie, Tykwer employs animation,
different film stock, split-screen images and sharp doses of irony,
such as Dinah Washington singing ``What a Difference a Day Makes''
on the soundtrack. His three what-if variations of Lola's run let
him shuffle the tone: romantic, tragic, funny, mystical. In case
her circumstances aren't suitably outrageous, Lola comes equipped
with a scream that shatters glass.
</P>
<P>
   Even while it's sprinting, the movie plays with big ideas,
especially the notion of fate: We watch as lives are repeatedly
altered by tiny delays or collisions, not only Lola's but those of
people she bumps into on the street. The movie spells out the
destinies of passers-by with lightning-quick flashes of Polaroid
shots.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the film's speed and brevity don't quite obscure
the script's thinness. You may find yourself asking questions you
shouldn't. For example, why doesn't Lola just grab the phone and
call her dad? The answer is that, if she did, there wouldn't be a
movie. And because ``Lola'' is so much fun, you're willing to shrug
and accept the artifice. It's a celebration of the power of love
expressed in bursts of ingenuity and speed.

 &HT;    ``Relax ... It's Just Sex''
 &HT;    Grade: B-
 &HT;    Starring Mitchell Anderson, Jennifer Tilly and Lori Petty.
Unrated, but contains nudity, simulated sex, profanity and
violence. 1 hour, 53 minutes. At Lefont Plaza.
 &HT;    The verdict: A funny if meandering look at the lives and loves
of an extended group of gay and straight Angelenos.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The SoCal ensemble comedy ``Relax ... It's Just Sex'' gets off
to such a crackling, irreverent start, it's a shame when it hits a
melodramatic slick and spins out of control. The movie, which was
shown on opening night at Atlanta's Out on Film festival last
October, is writer-director P.J. Castellaneta's witty look at the
sexual mores of a group of gay and straight friends, centering on
Vincey (Mitchell Anderson).
</P>
<P>
   Eternally boyish, eternally boyless, gay Vincey is like the kid
brother of Tara Ricotto (Jennifer Tilly), the opinionated den
mother of a Los Angeles circle of friends. When she's not trying to
get pregnant by her reluctant boyfriend Gus (Timothy Paul Perez),
she's presiding over the romantic dramas of her friends.
</P>
<P>
   They include self-proclaimed ``lipstick lesbian'' Megan (Serena
Scott Thomas), whose affair with a man ends things with her
girlfriend Sarina (Cynda Williams), who winds up with sporty,
spunky Robin (the comically sharp Lori Petty). Among the
Y-chromosome cast, HIV-positive Javi (Eddie Garcia) hooks up with
activist painter Buzz (T.C. Carson), despite the latter's
conspiracy theories about the origin of AIDS. Then there are Dwight
and Diego (Gibbs Toldsdorf and Chris Cleveland), the gym-cut,
preppy couple whose lives are such a model of upper-middle-class
complacency that they get turned on talking about fresh herbs and
dinner parties.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through, ``Relax'' gets tense with an episode pitting
Vincey and pals against some gay-bashing thugs. This entails a very
awkward shift in tone, causing the movie to lose not only its
casual-sophisticated warmth but its central character, too. Vincey
disappears for much of the film. While it's not uninteresting to
find out whether Tara will get pregnant, or Megan and Sarina will
get back together, the movie's energy dissipates into a lot of
Californian relationship-speak, while all the characters (and we)
wonder where Vincey is.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout, the film throws in sly bits of comedy, including the
angry reaction of Megan's mother when she learns that her daughter
has gone straight (``What are we going to say to our friends in
PFLAG?''). But by its end, ``Relax'' seems a bit too relaxed for
its own good, a sprawling group portrait that might have benefited
from a smaller, tighter canvas.

SARATOGA RACE COURSE DRAWS RECORD CROWD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS _ The 131st opening of Saratoga Race Course
drew a dapper, chapeau-wearing crowd of 26,720 Wednesday, a record
for a July start and 1,150 more people than last year.
</P>
<P>
   Horseplayers packed the grounds and grandstand, full of
expectations and carrying fat wallets. A July opening day record of
$3,193,902 was wagered at the track, $95,700 more than 1998's
kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're delighted in every way,'' said William Nader, director
of broadcast communications and promotions for the New York Racing
Association. ``It's a great start and we hope to have continued
success for the balance of the meet.''
</P>
<P>
   The opening-day attendance record of 30,658 on Aug. 2, 1989,
remains to be broken.
</P>
<P>
   The booming beginning of the century's final Spa City season was
witnessed by arts patron Alfred Z. Solomon, 99, who began his 85th
summer at the track yesterday and in whose honor the eighth race
was named.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been waiting 100 years for this,'' Solomon joked as he
posed for photos with jockey Jerry Bailey and trainer D. Wayne
Lukas after the race was won by Positive Gal.
</P>
<P>
   The soon-to-be centenarian epitomized the style and elegance of
Saratoga's mystique, with his soft white hair curling beneath the
brim of a Baku straw hat. Solomon, a resident of New York City,
also owns Madcaps Farms in Gansevoort, named for the hat company he
founded and ran until 1994.
</P>
<P>
   From his box seats, Solomon greeted well-wishers like state
senators Joseph Bruno, R-Brunswick, and Ronald Stafford,
R-Plattsburgh, as well as clubhouse neighbors like Sheila Rathbun.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a very busy day,'' Solomon said. ``My birthday
is September 25th, but it won't be as exciting as this.'' In Jesus
``Chico'' Dumois' shoeshine chair, trainer Nick Zito was chatted up
before the first race by retired jockey Angel Cordero Jr., now a
jockey agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, so good,'' Dumois said, pocketing Zito's $20 for a $5
shine. ``This is the only place you can make some money. Here they
want to be dressed nice. In Belmont they wear sneakers.'' Dumois
said 20 customers came through between 7:30 a.m. and 1 p.m., and he
called that a good indication for opening day and the season
overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``More shoeshines means the economy goes up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Baby-faced peace officers escorted jockeys through the crowds
after the races; families and friends staked out party spaces with
coolers and chairs in the picnic grounds and lines formed at all of
the betting windows.
</P>
<P>
   Mona Philips of Saratoga Springs, and her friends David Blackard
of Pompano Beach, Fla., and Marge DiNovo of Latham were as busy
watching people as they were the thundering thoroughbreds from
Philips' box in the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call this `Kissing Day' because we're greeting old
friends,'' Philips said. DiNovo called the opener ``beautiful. I
had the early double and won $50 on a $2 bet, so the season is off
to an excellent start.'' ``Every year it gets more exciting,''
Blackard said.
</P>
<P>
   Smack in the middle of the outdoor crowd, sitting beneath a
shady tree in front of the paddock pari-mutuel betting windows,
were Karen and Leo Falconio from Latham. Leo Falconio, 59, began
his 43rd racing season yesterday. He looked forward to placing his
money on filly Circle of Life, which placed second in a photo
finish in the Schuylerville Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just great being here for opening day. I love the
atmosphere,'' he said. ``Plus, you meet everybody you haven't seen
all year. This is in my back yard. It's home.''

<P>
   CHICAGO _ On a Sunday morning at a Roman Catholic church here,
Mary Hallan Fiorito glanced at a nearby pew to see a woman drinking
a can of Coke during Mass.
</P>
<P>
   At a musical in a Broadway theater, Alex Wang turned to the row
behind him to discover people eating corn on the cob.
</P>
<P>
   In schools that once forbade chewing gum, students now bring
doughnuts and candy to class _ along with chewing gum.
</P>
<P>
   Americans seem to be eating all the time, and wherever they
please.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers now see eating as something to be done while you do
something else,'' said Bobby Calder, a marketing professor at
Northwestern University. ``Everybody wants to save time by
multitasking. So you don't just sit down and eat. You eat while you
work, while you're watching TV, while you drive.''
</P>
<P>
   The automobile, among the favorite places for people to snack,
is well on its way to becoming a rolling dining room. A car is
scarcely considered worth driving now without cup holders in the
front and back. Some cars now have refrigerated glove boxes. And
within the next six months, the Samsung Corp. plans to market the
first microwave for cars and minivans. The microwave will plug into
the cigarette lighter.
</P>
<P>
   Less than one in four Americans now stick to the
three-square-meal routine. Only 24 percent of people eat breakfast,
lunch and dinner and nothing else, according to a 1996 survey by
Roper Starch Worldwide, a marketing research concern based in
Manhattan, down from 33 percent in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Polls indicate that a majority of families still eat dinner
together, or at least say they do. But a walk through any
convenience store or grocery store shows that ``portable foods''
have been taking up a lot more room on the shelves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get nervous if I don't have something to munch on,'' said
Paul Johnson, a 34-year-old computer programmer in Chicago, as he
left a convenience store with a bag of fat-free chips and a very
large cup of a frosty drink. ``I guess some people are like that
with smoking.''
</P>
<P>
   Health experts say the increased snacking is partly to blame for
the rising rates of obese and overweight people. Some 52 percent of
Americans are now overweight, the highest rate ever, according to
the National Institutes of Health.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eating has become a recreational activity,'' said Linda Van
Horn, a nutritionist in Chicago. ``And it's one of the biggest
reasons for the epidemic of obesity in this country. It's the
biggest health problem we face.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Van Horn said that people were clearly snacking for reasons
that went beyond hunger. ``It's a comfort thing,'' she said, ``like
having your baby blanket with you.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Americans did not just recently pick up the habit of
eating outside the home. As far back as a generation ago, the New
Yorker cartoonist, Saul Steinberg, was skewering the growing
tendency of people to dine on the dash.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, people in the food business say, snacks
have become a main course. And stores like 7-Eleven are increasing
the number of products that can be eaten with one hand, like sealed
tacos, stuffed breadsticks and hamburgers in the shape of a hot
dog.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Hultquist, a spokesman for the Food Marketing Institute, a
trade group in Washington, said the two-income family and busy
lives of children had changed eating habits for good.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're simply not going back to the days of spending two hours
in the kitchen every night preparing a meal,'' Hultquist said.
</P>
<P>
   Fast-food restaurants, which report that 50 percent of their
sales are now at the drive-by window, are selling things like
french-toast sticks, which can be eaten while driving.
</P>
<P>
   In some markets, McDonalds is testing the McSalad Shaker, which
comes in a plastic container that fits in a car cup-holder. It is
designed so that the customer can pour in the dressing, fasten the
top and shake it up, then eat it with a long fork.
</P>
<P>
   In the view of Michael Batterberry, the editor of Food Arts
magazine, the flowering of the eat-where-we-may style, was
nourished by mineral water.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole thing reached a kind of virus with the carrying of
water bottles by the yuppies in the '80s,'' Batterberry said. When
people started walking around offices with their water bottles, he
said, a line had been crossed. And there seems to be no turning
back.
</P>
<P>
   In some offices, desks and cubicles look almost like food
pantries _ chips, nuts, rice cakes, fruit _ all placed within easy
reach of the telephone and the computer keyboard. Food has become
requisite at almost any staff meeting. This practice of all-day
grazing, meanwhile, has largely replaced the old-fashioned business
lunch, for which workers actually leave the office.
</P>
<P>
   Libraries, which once stood at the vanguard of etiquette,
shooshing talkers and scowling at nibblers, have given up the fight
in many places. They have taken a page from the big booksellers and
started selling coffee near the stacks.
</P>
<P>
   Some movie theaters have apparently taken the tack that if
people want to eat, they will feed them. Some now sell turkey
breast sandwiches and even smoked salmon along with popcorn.
</P>
<P>
   The success of the big chain bookstores, Borders and Barnes &AMP;
Noble, where designer coffee and snacks was a big boost to
business, has not gone unnoticed by other businesses. The Ikea
furniture store has a cafeteria, and Crate and Barrel sells coffee.
</P>
<P>
   It has become rare for a group of people to gather, even for a
short time, without some snacking. At almost every youth soccer or
baseball game, one of the player's parents are assigned to bring
treats for the team, generally candy, chips and soda. Some of the
teams wait until after the game for the treats, but some have
half-time treats, too. As if that is not enough, some parents send
their children to the games equipped with soda and chips.

REP. FRANK TO UNDERGO BYPASS SURGERY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ALOYSIUS FARRELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- US Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) will have coronary
bypass surgery Friday, but he said Thurday expects to be back on
the floor of the House as soon as Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Frank, 59, who suffered a mild heart attack in 1990, is
scheduled to have the multiple bypass operation at the National
Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Md. Four or more arteries from
his legs will be transplanted to his heart, allowing blood to
bypass clogged coronary arteries.
</P>
<P>
   Frank suffered chest pains after exercising or exerting himself
on several recent occasions, and consulted a doctor last week. A
stress test last Friday, and a heart catheterization procedure on
Wednesday convinced his physicians that he needed the surgery
before the August 7 congressional recess.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would obviously like to disrupt my work as little as
possible,'' said Frank. ``I hope to be able to do some voting next
week. They tell me if things go well I should be out by Tuesday.
Voting, as many of my colleagues know, is not heavy lifting. One
can vote without a great deal of stress and strain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a job,'' Frank said. ``I'm not going to put my life at
risk. . . . But one vote can make a big difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank said that his overall cholesterol level was low, at 164,
but that he has a chronic shortage of the beneficial type of
artery-scouring cholesterol that helps prevent clogging. Both his
father and grandfather died at early ages of heart attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have enough good cholesterol, and that is causing
blockage,'' Frank said. ``The one defect in my inheritance.''
</P>
<P>
   After his 1990 heart attack, Frank had angioplasty treatment --
in which a thin tube with a balloon-type device at its tip is
threaded through clogged coronary arteries, and then inflated to
clear them. He has been taking drugs in the last decade to thin his
blood and boost his good cholesterol. He has also followed a
fitness regime, exercising on a stair machine and lifting weights.
</P>
<P>
   Frank helped lead the Democratic defense of President Clinton
during last year's impeachment debate, and said that the workload
might have been a factor in a recent loss of stamina.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had my first heart attack after I was involved in my own set
of accusations so maybe there is a correlation between sex-related
scandals and heart attacks -- in which case I hope everybody will
behave,'' Frank said. ``It gives the phrase `affairs of the heart'
a new meaning.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank's health insurance will cover the cost of the operation,
after he pays a $250 deductible. His experience with heart disease
has given him a first-hand look at the problems Americans face with
health costs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He hopes the bypass operation leaves him in better condition
than before.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds, to some extent, more ominous than it is,'' said
Frank. ``The likelihood is I will resume my life after a
recuperation period in better physical health than before because
my arteries will be fully functioning.''

 CHICAGO: and chips.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   To Mary Hallen Fiorito, who spotted the Coke-drinking woman at
church, the constant eating is a sign that people cannot deny
themselves, even for a short time. ``You'd think you could get
through 45 minutes, wouldn't you?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hallen Fiorito, the vice chancellor for the Archdiocese of
Chicago, said it had also become common for people to bring little
bags of cereal to church for their little ones. And then they leave
the bags in the pews.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're trying to reach a state of spiritual
contemplation,'' she said, ``there is nothing like sitting on a bag
of Cheerios to throw you off.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Van Horn, the mother of a soccer player as well as a
nutritionist, was alarmed by what she considered to be an excess of
treats. She said that children who are obese in the second and
third grade have a very difficult time ever slimming down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing playing children need is fluid replacement,''
Ms. Van Horn said. ``That's water.''
</P>
<P>
   At her suggestion, the treats for the soccer games were changed
from candy and chip to fruits.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the soccer players were happy about the change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure at first they're thinking, `Oh, no here comes the
nutritionist,''' said Ms. Van Horn. ``They thought I was raining on
their parade.''

SWISS POLICE IDENTIFY 2 OF THE 19 VICTIMS ON `CANYONING' ACCIDENT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Switzerland, New Zealand, Britain)   By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INTERLAKEN, Switzerland _ As rescue workers in helmets and wet
suits continued searching churning rapids near here for two missing
tourists, the police said Thursday that they had identified two of
the 19 victims of Tuesday's flash flood, a Swiss woman and a man
from New Zealand who were guides on the disastrous canyoning
excursion.
</P>
<P>
   The flash flood turned the small Saxeten Brook near this resort
town into a torrent, crushing 15 men and four women against rocks
and drowning them. Six people were injured.
</P>
<P>
   A local fireman told investigators that he had gone to the top
of the gorge when 45 clients of the Swiss company Adventure World
and their eight guides were preparing to descend to the rapids and
warned them that an approaching storm could prove dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``A firemen in Saxeten warned the young people to be careful,''
said Markus Gerber, commander of the fire department in Wilderswil,
a mountain hamlet that overlooks the Saxeten. ``He told them it was
hazardous.''
</P>
<P>
   Police investigators confirmed Gerber's account.
</P>
<P>
   At least 20 survivors are being kept in the secluded Chalet
Jungfrau in Lauterbrunnen, 13 miles from Interlaken. Reporters are
being kept away by police officers and employees of Contiki
Holidays, a British tour company that had taken 99 clients on two
Swiss tours this week. Forty-four chose the canyoning option
offered in their package, and most of the victims are believed to
be Contiki clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't be offering any canyoning trips anymore, anywhere,''
Bernice Windley, a spokeswoman for Contiki Holidays, told Reuters.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said it could take up to three weeks to identify
all the victims.
</P>
<P>
   Ulrich Zollinger, deputy chief of the Swiss Forensics Institute
in Bern, said at a news conference Thursday in Interlaken that 10
of the 19 bodies had been examined, and that the cause of death was
drowning. But he added, ``We found a lot of bruises on the faces of
the victims, and also found trauma to the brains and internal
organs,'' which he said could have been caused when the victims
crashed into rocks or logs. He said the bodies were found without
helmets or rubber shoes, which had probably been forced off by the
force of the torrent.
</P>
<P>
   In the third day of a tragedy that has turned Interlaken, a
carefree mecca for young thrill-seekers, into a somber retreat,
reporters have been kept away from witnesses, survivors and company
representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Georg Hoedle, the founder of Adventure World, delivered a
statement to the press Thursday, saying he could not give out any
information about the incident, and pleading for understanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is still difficult to comprehend what was happening,''
Hoedle said, referring to the accident. ``While the investigation
is going on, I am unable to give you any further information than
this. I hope you understand our position in this situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The investigation could lead to criminal charges if the
magistrates determine that there was willful negligence. Civil
lawsuits by survivors and relatives of the victims could ensue
regardless of the police findings.
</P>
<P>
   Information about Adventure World's operations has mainly come
from its Web site, which boasts of its safety precautions and says
there are ``at all times emergency exists from the canyon every
400-500 meters.''
</P>
<P>
   Some former clients say their own experience led them to doubt
those claims.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Griesbach, 28, an investment research analyst in Chicago,
said that on a canyoning excursion organized by Adventure World in
June 1997, he shattered his wrist when he slipped while jumping
from a rock down into a churning river.
</P>
<P>
   Griesbach said that he knew instantly he was badly injured, but
that there was no way out of the gorge except by swimming and
climbing down rocks to the bottom of the river with the group,
which he said took several hours.
</P>
<P>
   He said his guides applied first aid but did not have
communications equipment and could not radio ahead for help. He
waited in a van while other clients ate snacks and discussed the
trip before being taken to a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   After surgery, he said, two company representatives visited him
once and told him they had reassessed the safety of the area and
would remove it from their itineraries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was, like, you're telling me now it's not safe?'' he
recalled. ``I was 1 or 2 feet away from dying.''
</P>
<P>
   Griesbach had gone bungee-jumping with Adventure World the day
before and was asked to sign a waiver. No waiver was presented for
the canyoning trip, however. ``I don't know why,'' he said. ``Maybe
they forgot.''
</P>
<P>
   Adventure World representatives could not be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   There are few rules or regulations governing canyoning, which
has grown extremely popular in Switzerland over the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``As of now, there are no rules on canyoning, or legal measures
to control it,'' Stefan Blaettler, deputy commander of the Bern
police, said Thursday. ``Everything is up to the enterprises that
offer the sport. They do it at their own risk.''

NBC'S SASSA PLEDGES FUTURE PROGRAMMING DIVERSITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ As a Japanese-American growing up with a
television habit in the 1960s and 1970s, Scott M. Sassa came to
deeply resent the stereotypical or silly depictions of Asian
characters on such shows as ``Bonanza'' and ``Kung Fu.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeing David Carradine as a Chinese guy really (ticked) you
off,'' Sassa recalled Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at age 40, Sassa finds himself the highest-ranking minority
in network television just as the issue of ethnic diversity swirls
around broadcasters with hurricane force. As president of NBC West
Coast, Sassa has final say over which shows land on NBC's
prime-time schedule and which shows are developed by the network's
production studio.
</P>
<P>
   In January, having just arrived at NBC, Sassa told TV critics
here that diversity was one of his top priorities. Thursday, he
conceded that ``we didn't do as good a job as we could.'' Like the
executives at the other networks, Sassa pledged to make the next
batch of programs more diverse. Unlike the other executives, he
could plausibly say, and did, that ``for me, this is a personal
concern'' as well as a business issue.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, nonwhite faces are markedly few among the new
programs NBC is rolling out. The fall lineup is not likely to
dispel the acid nickname some have attached to NBC _ ``Nothing But
Caucasians'' _ an allusion to the fact that the network has built
its identity on all-white sitcoms (``Friends,'' ``Frasier,'' ``Just
Shoot Me,'' ``3rd Rock From the Sun,'' ``Will &AMP; Grace,'' and of
course, ``Seinfeld''). NBC recently canceled the critically
acclaimed drama ``Homicide,'' which had won praise for being one of
the few TV programs where numerous story lines were built around
minority characters.
</P>
<P>
   Candidly acknowledging that media attention to the diversity
issue has influenced NBC, Sassa cited the additions of several
minority characters in supporting roles on new and existing shows,
such as an Asian-American and a black character to ``ER,'' one
black character apiece to ``Jesse,'' ``Suddenly Susan,'' and ``Law
&AMP; Order: Special Victims Unit.'' A black character who was cut out
of the new ``West Wing,'' a drama set in the White House of a
liberal Democratic president, will be written back in. ``That's one
of the shows we should have done a better job on,'' Sassa admitted.
</P>
<P>
   It was the NAACP that intensified the spotlight on Sassa and
other network executives when the civil rights organization's
president, Kweisi Mfume, lashed out earlier this month at the
``virtual whitewash'' of minority characters on the 26 new fall
programs on the four major networks.
</P>
<P>
   After Mfume threatened to organize a viewing and advertising
boycott, along with possible legal action, the networks hastened to
set up meetings with him. Sassa said Thursday he plans to sit down
soon with Mfume. He said he has not been contacted by a coalition
of Hispanic groups that has called for a viewer boycott during the
week of Sept. 12 to protest the lack of Latino characters on TV.
Asian-American advocacy groups have not yet been as vocal on the
issue of representation on television.
</P>
<P>
   While vowing to follow through on his previous pledge to make
diversity a top priority, Sassa made clear that his goal is
``meaningful diversity'' that makes sense for individual shows, and
does not intend to get ``caught up in the numbers'' or a promise to
integrate each show.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends creatively on whether it makes sense to add an
Asian or a Latino or a Caucasian to the cast,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In developing shows with minority characters, he said, he
intends to focus on promoting positive role models, citing the
history of exclusion and stereotyping of minorities on television.
``In the '50s, it was: Why aren't there people like me on TV? In
the '60s, it was: Why aren't those people on TV acting like we
do?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't just want to see someone who looks like you on TV,''
he added. ``You want to see someone who's a role model, someone you
want to be.''

`INTIMATE UNIVERSE' BODY SERIES CONTINUES TO FASCINATE, TEACH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Intimate Universe: The Human Body'' is aptly named. The
Peabody Award-winning documentary series about human life gets so
close to its subject that viewers may squirm right off the sofa,
though rarely will they see a TV series so informative and so
thoughtfully produced.
</P>
<P>
   The second half of the eight-hour ``Intimate Universe'' has its
North American premiere Sunday and Monday at 9 p.m. on The Learning
Channel. To catch people up, the first half of the BBC series,
which aired in April, will be rebroadcast Saturday from 8 p.m. to
midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Part two encompasses three segments centering on the brain,
aging and death. A fourth segment looks at the amazing technology,
including endoscopic photography, ``time slice'' photography and
computer animation, that helped make the series what it is: a
fabulously engaging look at the processes that keep us alive and,
ultimately, facilitate our demise.
</P>
<P>
   The series smoothly toggles back and forth from extreme
close-ups of, say, a blood clot shutting down an artery to
stunningly illustrative camera work that makes complex scientific
material easy to grasp. A shot of synchronized swimmers, for
example, provides mesmerizing mimicry of the behavior of cells.
</P>
<P>
   The elements of part two are as full of fascinating information
as part one. For instance:
</P>
<P>
   _ When a neuron fires in the brain, the electrical impulse
travels at 250 miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   _ Little of our bodies is actually more than 10 years old. Much
of it, including parts of the skeleton, is continually being
replaced.
</P>
<P>
   _ It takes about 200,000 frowns to etch a furrow in the
forehead.
</P>
<P>
   It's the soothingly avuncular approach of Dr. Robert Winston
that makes ``Intimate Universe'' so appealing. Winston, one of
Europe's leading infertility experts and a member of the British
House of Lords, treats his subject and his audience with enormous
respect, but without the cold aloofness of many documentary
narrators. Winston isn't a hired gun brought in to read a script.
He's a scientist with the engaging manner of a politician and the
on-camera ease of a seasoned news anchor. His curiosity is
infectious, his enthusiasm palpable.
</P>
<P>
   Even in episode seven, ``The End of Life,'' which airs Monday,
Winston's comfortable manner makes society's great taboo _ the
discussion of death _ eminently approachable. The episode follows
the last days of a man dying of cancer. Certainly it is unsettling,
but it is also sensitive and respectful _ no different from all the
other installments that make ``Intimate Universe'' one reason why
TV isn't such a vast wasteland after all.
</P>
<P>
   Intimate Universe: The Human Body. Second half of eight-hour
documentary miniseries about human life, hosted by Dr. Robert
Winston. Sunday and Monday at 9 p.m., The Learning Channel,
repeating Aug. 8 at 2 p.m. Parental guideline rating: TV-PG.

considerable influence with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, on
Thursday offered to step in as an informal mediator to help settle
a dispute that threatens to sidetrack the Middle East peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to meet with Mr. Arafat in a couple of days to
see what can be accepted,'' Mubarak said after a meeting here with
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak at Ras El Tin palace, the second
between the two men in the last three weeks as Barak has dashed
from nation to nation to enlist help in reviving the peace.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has proposed rethinking the terms of the Wye River
memorandum, the latest agreement between Israel and the
Palestinians. But Arafat has demanded that Israel act immediately
to fulfill its obligations, objecting particularly to Barak's call
for a delay in carrying out parts of the accord, which calls for
further Israeli troop withdrawals from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Mubarak did not say whether Barak had persuaded him to accept
his plan to change the terms and timing of the agreement. But
neither did Mubarak echo Arafat's demand to carry it out as
written.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Egyptian leader indicated that he may try to
persuade the Palestinians to work out a compromise to find ``ways
and means'' to implement the accord.
</P>
<P>
   Just hours after Barak made his proposal in a late-night meeting
with Arafat, the Palestinian leader dispatched emissaries to Egypt
and Jordan on Wednesday, seeking help in fending off the Israeli
idea. But Mubarak's language suggested that he might see merit in
Israel's request, and Barak, who smiled though most of a joint news
conference Thursday, seemed plainly pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we choose a bumpy road instead of a main road, we cannot
ask ourselves in retrospect why have bumps,'' Barak said, trying to
make the case that the path toward a comprehensive peace might be
swifter if the two sides agree for now to set aside part of the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Mubarak has long been Arafat's most important Arab patron. In
September 1995, when Yitzhak Rabin was still Israel's prime
minister, it was weeks of prodding and reassurance from Mubarak
that led to Arafat's acceptance of the second and most
consequential stage of the so-called Oslo accords, the one that
spelled out the extent of the most significant Israeli troop
withdrawals.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, with Middle East diplomacy once again moving forward
at a rapid pace, Mubarak seemed intent on reassuring Arafat and
other Palestinians who have been complaining loudly, particularly
over Barak's request for a delay in carrying out parts of the
latest accord. The agreement, signed last fall in Wye River, Md.,
calls for further Israeli troop withdrawals from the West Bank. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Egypt and Israel made peace two decades ago, but the peace has
remained cold, with anti-Israeli sentiment running deep among the
Egyptian public. Israeli officials have hoped that Barak's election
might prompt an improvement in bilateral ties, with steps that
might include the opening of a long-planned gas pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   But Mubarak may be most important for his mediating role, and
there was no indication Thursday that bilateral issues had been
discussed. Both sides said the subject had been the Middle East
peace effort, and that the Palestinian question had been at the top
of the agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking office earlier this month, Barak has devoted nearly
all his time and effort to the quest for a broader Middle East
peace. Thursday's meeting was the latest in a dizzying race
prompted by his vow to seek agreements with Syria, Lebanon and the
Palestinians within the next 15 months.
</P>
<P>
   At the Tuesday meeting between Israel and the Palestinians, the
two sides agreed to discuss Barak's proposal in low-level talks
over the next two weeks, and Barak has pledged to carry out the
accord as written if the Palestinians turn down the request for a
delay.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, the Palestinians have shown no enthusiasm whatsoever
for the idea, which they see as a ploy by Israel to maintain its
hold on Palestinian land. Barak is apparently prepared to go
forward with a second phase of troop withdrawals required under the
accord, following on a first phase carried out last fall.
</P>
<P>
   But he has warned that implementation now of the third and final
phase of the accord would leave 15 Israeli-settlements entirely
surrounded by Palestinian territory, creating a potentially
volatile situation.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than risk violence, Barak would apparently prefer to
defer those withdrawals until the thornier questions that surround
the Israeli-Palestinian relationship, including borders,
settlements and the future of Jerusalem, can be resolved as part of
final-status negotiations. Israeli officials have said those talks
could begin swiftly, perhaps by the end of August.
</P>
<P>
   In public, Barak would say Thursday only that he favors changes
in the ``ways, means, and timing'' of the Wye River accord. But he
maintained his warning tone, saying that ``both sides'' would bear
responsibility if a decision to carry out the accord now led to a
breakdown later.
</P>
<P>
   Both Barak and Arafat spoke by telephone to Clinton on
Wednesday, apparently in hopes of enlisting him on their side of
the argument. The three leaders met in the Moroccan capital, Rabat,
just five days ago, when the funeral of King Hassan provided a
brief opportunity for their first three-way meeting.
</P>
<P>
   After a prolonged stalemate under the last Israeli prime
minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, the Palestinians are plainly eager to
see tangible gains toward a broader peace. Among those who
complained publicly Wednesday about Barak's proposal was Ziad Abu
Zayyad, a Palestinian Cabinet member, who told Israeli Radio: ``We
wasted three years under Netanyahu when there was no advance in the
peace process, and it is too bad that we are wasting time again.''
</P>
<P>
   Mubarak said Thursday that the Palestinian skepticism was
understandable. ``Arafat has his doubts,'' he said. He said that
this was ``not exactly because of Wye, but because of the other
previous agreements that were not implemented'' under Netanyahu,
including the long delay in Israel's withdrawal from the West Bank
town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Mubarak said, the Palestinians should recognize
that ``Barak is keen on implementing'' the Wye agreement and that
taking time to talk about possible arrangements would not be a
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two or three weeks' delay is no problem,'' he said. Asked
whether he had been persuaded by Barak's reasoning, Mubarak would
say only that he had been persuaded that he and his guest had ``a
very good mutual understanding of the peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the other diplomatic steps in recent days has been a visit
by King Abdullah of Jordan to Syrian President Hafez Assad. That
meeting, the latest in a series between Assad and Jordanian
emissaries, came Monday, a day after the Jordanian monarch met with
Barak at the funeral in Morocco, which the Syrian leader did not
attend.
</P>
<P>
   The visit has added to speculation that King Abdullah may be
acting as an emissary between the two sides. And when Barak was
asked Thursday whether the king was serving as a go-between, he
chose not to answer that part of a reporter's question.
</P>
<P>
   Egypt was the first Arab state to make peace with Israel, in the
Camp David accords of 1979, and Barak said that his visit Thursday
reflected his determination to build on what he called that
``cornerstone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we are about to put the on capstones, _ peace with the
Palestinians and peace with Syria,'' the Israeli leader declared.

 &HT;    Gere, Roberts reunited in affable, unlikely `Bride'
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Jim Luksic
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nine years after Pretty Woman, its co-stars and director Garry
Marshall have joined forces again for Runaway Bride, a sugary
romantic-comedy whose components are crisply plugged into place.
</P>
<P>
   What you see is what you get, in slick moderation. And the
luster appears to be wearing off. Even seeing Julia Roberts riding
on horseback to the chords of the U2 anthem I Still Haven't Found
What I'm Looking For doesn't much restore the novelty of the
actress's pairing with Richard Gere.
</P>
<P>
   Plot mechanics pull us into downtown New York, where Gere
portrays columnist Ike Graham (``Journalism is literature in a
hurry.'') His job is to pen diatribes against women for USA Today,
whose editor happens to be his ex-wife Ellie (Rita Wilson).
</P>
<P>
   It isn't long before she fires Ike, not for his provocative
opinions, but because he used factual errors in a piece regarding
Maggie Carpenter (Roberts). The townsfolk of Hale, Md., have
witnessed her wedding debacles: she has left three prospective
grooms in the dust, while another sucker (Christopher Meloni) waits
_ to paraphrase the dialogue's sports parlance _ on deck.
</P>
<P>
   Now unemployed, Ike ventures to our heroine's hinterlands in the
hope of apologizing to Maggie and writing a feature about her next
ceremony's inevitable doom. Far from enthused is her affable but
alcoholic dad, Walter (Paul Dooley), while perpetual bridesmaid
Peggy (Joan Cusack, again contributing more to a role than it
deserves) lends support, however unnecessary; sparks between the
two leads fly inevitably and abundantly.
</P>
<P>
   What unspools is relatively harmless fluff in the fun-loving
hands of Marshall, a sitcom refugee who proved his filmmaking
mettle with Nothing in Common, teetered with Beaches and lost some
integrity with Exit to Eden and Dear God.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall did right himself, to an extent, earlier this year with
The Other Sister. This time he demonstrates a wise awareness of the
picture's limitations and an aptitude for making do. One shot
simultaneously captures Ike's flashy car and the old-fashioned
store from which he's driving away: It's a sharp, economical
glimpse of contrasting worlds. (Such editing, however, was needed
in a scene in which Maggie dangles from a church bell's rope for
what feels like an eternity.)
</P>
<P>
   And the director, who has a nonverbal cameo in a softball game,
assembles another engaging cast, including Hector Elizondo _ though
he and ever-dependable Cusack appear to be pining for stronger
material. Gere is asked to loosen up, and he does so naturally.
Roberts, conversely, seems inconsistent as her character, speaking
intellectually one minute and dimwittedly the next; she fared
better in the superior Notting Hill.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to appreciate a comedy that doesn't take itself
seriously. Amusing as this premise might be, especially videotaped
footage of the title figure's aborted trips to the altar, it
remains preposterous. Any viewer who believes someone would back
out of four weddings _ and that the guests would stand idly by _
should inherit the dunce cap from whoever ran for cover during
Orson Welles' The War of the Worlds broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   Acclaimed cinematographer Stuart Dryburgh (The Piano)
perseveres, but he still can't augment the obtuse, golly-gee script
by Josann McGibbon and Sara Parriott (of Three Men and A Little
Lady infamy). One segment involving a guitar-playing former beau is
as stale as the garage in which it takes place.
</P>
<P>
   Runaway Bride traverses a breezy, winding road to mild thrills.
Country girl Maggie, like Sandra Bullocks' player in Hope Floats,
is truly the Queen of Corn _ and after sifting through this movie's
hokey platitudes, she appears in no danger of losing that label.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Pretty creepy stuff. That's how one woman describes the strange
lore surrounding the Blair Witch. Her words also apply to The Blair
Witch Project, a terrifying low-budget horror film that does for
the woods what Jaws did for water.
</P>
<P>
   Don't see it if you plan to go on an overnight camping trip any
time soon.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike ineffectual Hollywood fright flicks such as The Haunting,
the independent ``mockumentary'' scares the living daylights out of
you without a single special effect or an ounce of gore. Its
terrors lurk just beyond the camera's range, allowing your
imagination to conjure them through the power of suggestion. The
unseen proves to be much more horrifying than anything
visual-effects artists can create.
</P>
<P>
   I left an afternoon screening of the film with my heart racing,
grateful for daylight. That evening I found myself unable to sleep,
seeing the chilling final shot every time I closed my eyes. A local
theater manager said he slept with his television on as a night
light for several days after he saw the film.
</P>
<P>
   The Blair Witch Project has Hollywood studios running scared.
Warner Bros. Pictures moved up the opening of Deep Blue Sea and
Universal pushed back Mystery Men to avoid Blair Witch's expansion
today from limited release to 1,000 screens. Last weekend the
supernatural phenomenon averaged $63,812 per screen on 31 screens,
compared with The Haunting's $11,907 per-screen average on 2,808
screens. The film's Web site (www.blairwitch.com) has had more than
21 million hits to date.
</P>
<P>
   With that success comes the now widespread knowledge that the
film's ingenious premise is fiction. Yet the airtight execution of
directors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez makes it easy to
suspend disbelief and share the vicarious nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1994, student filmmakers Heather Donahue, Joshua
Leonard and Michael Williams hiked into Maryland's Black Hills to
shoot a documentary on the Blair Witch, a local legend whose bloody
history dates to 1785. They were never heard from again. One year
later, their footage was found.
</P>
<P>
   The Blair Witch Project presents their ill-fated adventure,
using both their 16mm black-and-white film and Heather's High-8
color video recordings. Shaky hand-held shots and choppy jump cuts
heighten the film's frighteningly authentic realism.
</P>
<P>
   The Blair Witch legend develops through Heather's filmed
stand-up segments on sites of strange occurrences, such as Coffin
Rock, and through interviews with local residents. The seeds of
horror are planted in these seemingly innocuous scenes. Your mind
later draws on the accounts to psychologically complete the
picture.
</P>
<P>
   The story meanders somewhat as Heather, Mike and Josh trek
through the dense forest. Their camaraderie gives way to conflict
when they become lost and to terror when they are beset by an
escalating series of bizarre and disturbing events.
</P>
<P>
   When Heather cries into the video camera lens that she feels
``hungry, cold and hunted,'' she really means it. The actors shot
the film themselves in eight days, moving between predetermined
points and improvising their scenes. Direction was limited to
written notes left along with food and supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Myrick and Sanchez shadowed the actors unseen and wore them down
physically and mentally by making them move farther each day on
decreasing amounts of food, and by terrorizing them in the night.
The performances, like the film itself, are extremely convincing
and unnerving.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty creepy stuff, indeed.

HURD NOMINATION APPROVED BY SENATE JUDICIARY PANEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ David N. Hurd cleared the first hurdle in his quest
to become a U.S. District Court judge for the Northern District of
New York when his nomination was approved Thursday by the Senate
Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The nomination of Hurd, 62, of Rome, N.Y., is expected to move
shortly to the full Senate for a vote.
</P>
<P>
   The Utica jurist was nominated in February by President Clinton
to fill a federal district judge seat in Albany that has been
vacant since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Hurd, a Democrat and a former trial lawyer who is currently a
magistrate judge for the Northern District of New York, easily
fielded questions from Senate Judiciary Chairman Orrin G. Hatch,
R-Utah, after raising his right hand and swearing to tell the
truth.
</P>
<P>
   Seated at a long table with four other nominees for federal
judgeships, Hurd thanked Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., who
recommended him for the post a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch started the questioning of Hurd by asking him whether he
believes cameras should be allowed in the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   Hurd said cameras aren't allowed in the courtroom in the Second
Circuit except for at ceremonial events, but if that should change,
it would be up to the individual judges to decide.
</P>
<P>
   Under further questioning from Hatch, Hurd said that while he
would be bound by precedents of a higher court, he has no legal or
moral beliefs that would prohibit him from upholding a death
penalty sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch also asked the nominees to comment on the fact that people
sentenced to death often succeed in delaying executions for up to
two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Hurd responded, ``I agree that 10- to 15- to 20-year delays are
much too long and one of the duties of a district judge would be to
expedite cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch warned the nominees against judicial activism, saying he
is disturbed by judges who ``expand their role in unreasonable
ways'' by rendering opinions colored by personal bias or politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``You understand your role is not to make the law,'' except in
cases in which there isn't any precedent, Hatch said. ``You really
need to follow precedent or we lose control of our system.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., in an interview predicted
``smooth sailing,'' for Hurd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judge Hurd has tremendous bipartisan respect,'' Schumer said.
``I think he's a classy addition to the bench.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the Judicial Conference of the United States,
the policy-making body of the federal courts, called on Congress to
quickly appoint a judge to New York's Northern District.
</P>
<P>
   The conference pointed out that the district had the eighth
highest backlog of pending cases _ an average of 664 per judge _ in
the country. The national average is 471 pending cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Northern District has waited far too long for this day,''
said Moynihan, who called Hurd ``superbly qualified'' to fill the
position.
</P>
<P>
   The seat that Hurd, 62, is being considered for has been vacant
since the late U.S. District Judge Con. G. Cholakis stepped down
because of illness.
</P>
<P>
   It's the only remaining vacancy in the 32-county Northern
District of New York, which stretches as far south as Ulster County
up through Albany to the Canadian border and west through much of
the Southern Tier.
</P>
<P>
   The post pays $ 136,700 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Hurd, 62, who grew up in Camillus, N.Y., a suburb of Syracuse,
was accompanied to Capitol Hill by his son Steven, 30, a lawyer in
New York City, and his wife, Connie.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the American College of Trial Lawyers, Hurd was
first appointed as a magistrate judge in 1991 and was reappointed
in January to a second, eight-year term. Magistrate judges are
junior judges in the federal system who may officiate on
preliminary stages of criminal cases, but not at criminal trials.
</P>
<P>
   Hurd practiced law at O'Shea, Griffin, Jones &AMP; McLaughlin from
1967 to 1991. Hurd received his undergraduate degree in 1959 from
Cornell University and his graduated cum laude from Syracuse
University College of Law in 1963.

 &HT;    CBS bets on Bryant Gumbel to end its morning slump.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Diane Holloway
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Chemistry is the key, and that's why
Operation Glass Slipper is so important.
</P>
<P>
   The Cinderella reference is CBS News' code name for its search
for a co-anchor for Bryant Gumbel, the man the network hopes will
become its new Prince Charming in the morning. After years of
embarrassing failure, CBS hopes to succeed with ``The Early Show''
when it debuts Nov. 1.
</P>
<P>
   A glass-walled studio is under construction on New York's Fifth
Avenue, and on-air contributors are being lined up. But no partner
has been found for Gumbel, who left NBC's top-rated ``Today'' two
years ago. The chosen one almost certainly will be a woman,
although Gumbel and executive producer Steve Friedman would not
rule out hiring a man.
</P>
<P>
   Will it be a well-known CBS woman like Lesley Stahl of ``60
Minutes'' or an unknown from within or a star from another network?
Elizabeth Vargas of ABC News has been mentioned. But then so has
Oprah Winfrey, who almost certainly is not a serious contender.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will have to be someone compatible, someone with live news
experience, someone with warmth,'' Gumbel told TV critics gathered
for the annual press preview of the fall season. ``It's a matter of
comfort. Finding the right person isn't as easy as it sounds. .
</P>
<P>
   Friedman, who worked with Gumbel on ``Today,'' pointed out that
Madame X will not have to be a star. Jane Pauley was an unknown
26-year-old anchor from Indianapolis when ``Today'' tapped her, and
Katie Couric was not exactly a household name when she landed the
job opposite Gumbel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Television makes its own stars,'' Friedman said. ``The
important thing for us is to find someone who can do the job.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS has been struggling in the morning news business for many
years and sees its best hope in Gumbel. Such luminaries as Paula
Zahn and Diane Sawyer, now at the helm of ABC's No. 2-rated ``Good
Morning America,'' have preceded him and failed. After retiring
from ``Today'' and presiding over CBS's short-lived newsmagazine
``Public Eye,'' Gumbel is ready to re-enter the morning news war.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Bryant Gumbel who put the 'Today' show on the map in
the '80s,'' Friedman crowed. ``They've really just been building on
that success. Maybe our friends at 'Today' are getting tired of
doing it, and maybe the people who watch are getting tired, too. I
think people miss Bryant. There's nobody better at live,
play-by-play television.''
</P>
<P>
   A quick reality check finds that ``Today'' ratings went up when
Matt Lauer was brought in as Gumbel's replacement. But reality
checks don't dampen CBS's optimism. The network is convinced that
Gumbel's ``Early Show'' will put an end to the network's legacy of
failure in the morning.

UT DEVELOPING ON-LINE SERVICE FOR STUDENTS SEEKING ROOMMATES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By POLLY ROSS HUGHES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ University of Texas students living on campus
may soon be able to steer clear of roommates from hell by applying
a new-fangled solution to an age-old problem.
</P>
<P>
   Student leaders and campus housing officials are developing an
on-line matchmaking service that's set to debut in December. Those
seeking compatible dormitory roommates for the fall of 2000, the
theory goes, can find who best matches their lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't realize this was such an innovative idea,'' said Eric
Opiela, student body vice president who hatched the plan with other
student leaders last spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we do it is you have a series of questions the Web
page will ask you and you click yes or no,'' he said. ``It will
show you a list of other people that have the same criteria.''
</P>
<P>
   The questions will attempt to identify and separate those who
have clashing personal traits or quirks that most often contribute
to roommate conflict: Smokers and nonsmokers, loud music lovers and
quiet types, night owls and early risers, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   Sheila Ochner, director of UT's division of housing and food
services, said students returning to school this fall will be asked
for their ideas in drafting questions for the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Only students applying for housing will have access to the site
and all postings will be voluntary, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman LaDonna Davis of Dallas, who is studying business, said
she'd feel a bit uneasy posting personal information about herself,
even if the access to it is limited. She said you might meet people
you'd rather not, but the idea has potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know roommates that have conflicts over studying because
some are louder than others and play music, some can't stand the
music, so yeah,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a person that's been having a problem with her
roommate. She complains a lot because her roommate comes in, puts
all the lights on, slams doors, goes through drawers and all that
kind of stuff,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Kindsvatter, a graduating senior from The Woodlands near
Houston, said the online service could help alleviate anxieties for
those who want to see just what they might be getting into. Yet she
has doubts that matching roommates on the basis of such things as
sleeping patterns will somehow create eternally blissful dorm life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those kind of things change throughout the year. I don't see
how basic personal information like that would eliminate
conflicts,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Even the idea's biggest supporters acknowledge that there are
some human problems that even technology can't conquer, especially
intolerance of roommates with different sexual orientations.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I think is the worst roommate problem I've seen can't be
solved with a program like this,'' said Opiela, who also has served
as a resident assistant at the Jester Center dorm for two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their conflict was that one of the residents could not accept
that the other was homosexual. He kept coming to my room and saying
I can't deal with this. It's a very difficult roommate conflict to
resolve.''
</P>
<P>
   These days sharing a room is a new experience for a majority of
freshman college students, said Gary Schwarzmueller, executive
director of the Association of College and University Housing
Officers. As a result, the challenges facing housing officials
dealing with disgruntled roommates are greater than in the past
when most children grew up sharing a room with a sibling.
</P>
<P>
   He added the online matchmaking might be more effective for
returning students because kids in high school are often not as
self- aware and are prone to change when they reach college.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Sasse, director of residence life at Texas A&AMP;M University,
said the Aggie approach is simple, fair and objective. All room
assignments are based on the date of application.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've tried lots of different things. Though, to be honest, we
haven't found anything we think is successful. Maybe it's because
parents influence what the students fill out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At North Carolina State University in Raleigh, however, an
elaborate online match-making service gets credit for cutting
roommate assignment requests by a third, said Jim Pappenhagen,
assistant director for university housing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think roommate conflicts will decrease because of this,''
said Opiela who studied the North Carolina system. ``But there's
something to be said for roommate conflict. It builds character.''

ADVERTISING AS ART: COLLECTION OF TV COMMERCIALS IS ALSO A HANDS-ON
PRIMER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERESA MCUSIC 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``If Michelangelo were alive today, he'd probably be working on
Madison Avenue.''
</P>
<P>
   That shocking statement by industry journalist and author
Bernice Kanner reflects the power of what she terms a modern art
form _ advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than movies or TV programming, advertising holds a mirror
up to show us who and what we are _ or long to be,'' she writes in
her new book. ``The language of advertising becomes our vernacular;
their dress, our wardrobes, their mores, our customs. ... Like it
or not, it is a pure expression of the world we live in today.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Kanner needs to take a break from her world as a marketing
correspondent for CBS News, a marketing commentator for Bloomberg
News and a columnist for Working Woman. Maybe her 13 years of
writing the ``On Madison Avenue'' column for New York magazine has
completely warped her vision.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe she's just not afraid to tell us what we instinctively
already know. Regardless, her vision of the advertising age comes
shining through in her book ``The 100 Best TV Commercials ... And
Why They Worked'' (Random House, 252 pages, $29.95).
</P>
<P>
   After just a glance at this book, it's easy to understand why
Kanner is so impassioned about her subject. Who can forget the
powerful image of the Native American man silently letting a tear
roll down his cheek after observing pollution or the young adults
from every nationality singing about teaching the world to sing in
perfect harmony _ and buying them a Coke as well.
</P>
<P>
   This collection of TV commercials was organized by Leo Burnett's
Creative Exchange, an archive of more than 5,000 commercials put
together by the international advertising agency. The list was
organized by Burnett and then passed around to a number of other
creative and advertising industry luminaries.
</P>
<P>
   It is interesting to note that even though most consider the
United States to have elevated advertising to such Everest heights
in the power of persuasion, just 42 of the top 100 commercial
winners were made here. Twenty-eight were from the United Kingdom,
with the remainder from France, Japan, Spain, Brazil and even
Singapore and New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   And it is because of this global look at the industry that the
book loses some of its impact. After all, this is video and audio
we're talking about. Though the commercials from the United States
lose some of their punch on the printed page, it's not hard to
recall experiencing viewing them as commercials.
</P>
<P>
   But when the reader hasn't seen the commercial but is merely
reading the dialogue and scene-setting, it's often hard to imagine
its effectiveness. I'm sure the collection on a master video is
much more compelling than the book in this respect.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for those involved with the industry, this book has many
practical means for hands-on learning.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the Spanish Danone yogurt commercial in 1985. Children
urged their father to eat yogurt, offering such parental
suggestions as ``It'll make your hair curly, Dad.'' Yogurt sales
had dropped 8 percent before the spot, but sales soared 9.9 percent
the year the ad ran and an additional 5.9 percent the next year.
</P>
<P>
   The message: ``Children can be more than just adorable props
grabbing our attention; they can elicit profound emotion in us,''
Kanner writes.
</P>
<P>
   By using the commercials described, she engages the reader in
all the basics and secrets of advertising. ``Demo'' advertising, a
few well-crafted words, a catchy tune, a comedic situation, using
children, using animals, using sex, using violence _ all of this
and more are discussed.
</P>
<P>
   But the book goes further in showing us a history of this
amazing industry. Kanner shows how Apple's 1984 introduction of
Macintosh (in which the product wasn't even shown) was ``probably
the most publicized moment in advertising history.''
</P>
<P>
   Other such moments that have changed the face of a powerful
medium are discussed, further evidence, perhaps, that Michelangelo
would have ended up in advertising.
</P>

   ``Getting Promoted: Real Strategies for Advancing Your Career''
</P>
<P>
   By Harry E. Chambers
</P>
<P>
   Perseus Books, $13
</P>
<P>
   Most career books focus on changing jobs or making the most of
what you have. This one focuses on a third alternative: getting
promoted. Most of us are hard workers, consultant Harry E. Chambers
contends. But many are not being ``visibly efficient'' _ getting
the recognition needed as a crucial contributor to the organization
to be promoted. Think of this as an update to the Broadway show
``How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   ``Buffettology''
</P>
<P>
   By Mary Buffett and David Clark
</P>
<P>
   Simon &AMP; Schuster, $14
</P>
<P>
   Now out in paperback, this bestseller can't be overlooked as one
of the best books about mega-investor Warren Buffett. Written by
insiders, (Mary Buffett is Warren's former daughter-in-law, and
David Clark is an investment analyst and Buffett family friend), it
describes the master investor's strategy, as well as provides
profiles of the 54 companies in which Buffett has invested and
continues to follow. The book's approach is straight-forward and it
provides an interesting history of the most profitable investor out
there.

   ``Getting Along in Family Business: The Relationship
Intelligence Handbook''
</P>
<P>
   By Edwin A. Hoover and Colette Lombard Hoover
</P>
<P>
   Routledge, $29.95
</P>
<P>
   Why do some family businesses last more than a hundred years,
while others collapse before 12 months have gone by? Psychologists
and family business gurus Edwin and Colette Hoover contend that
``getting along'' is the secret. They call it `Relationship
Intelligence.' Using this model, the Hoovers discuss how to
integrate your RQ into your business successfully and then watch it
grow.

WINE MAKERS SAY PROPOSED LEGISLATION WOULD HURT LEGAL SALES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Aug. 1)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The wine industry sees legislation aimed at
stopping teen-agers from ordering its products over the Internet as
something worse than the grapes of wrath.
</P>
<P>
   Mounting a campaign against the measure, which has passed the
Senate and is expected to come before the House this week, the
industry says it would hurt small wineries' efforts to make sales
to adults over the Internet and through mail-order catalogues.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would give state attorneys general broad new
power to go to federal courts seeking enforcement of state liquor
laws. Now the prosecutors may go only to their own state courts.
</P>
<P>
   In 19 states it is illegal for alcohol to be distributed by
direct delivery _ whether bought over the Internet, mail-order
catalogue or phone.
</P>
<P>
   The measure began moving through Congress earlier this year
after Senate Judiciary Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, aired before
his committee a report from television station KUTV in Salt Lake
City. The report showed how a 13-year-old, using a home computer,
ordered a case of beer from a micro-brewery with her older
brother's credit card. The Senate adopted Hatch's legislation in
May.
</P>
<P>
   The identical House measure is authored by Rep. Joe Scarborough,
R-Fla. He says most wineries need not worry about his bill: ``Only
those shippers who violate state alcohol laws will be affected.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. George Radanovich, R-Calif., a lawmaker who also owns a
small winery in Mariposa, Calif., argues that the measure would
have the ``unintended consequence of crippling small wineries in
this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Some state attorneys general have said they need the legislation
in order to target direct alcohol distributors located in other
states.
</P>
<P>
   But most California lawmakers insist there is no evidence that
people under age 21 are actually using the Internet to order wine
and beer despite the TV reports showing how easily it can be done.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., who opposes the measure, says the
rise of the Internet has scared beer and wine distributors, who
have pushed for the legislation because they view direct alcohol
sales as a threat to their profit margins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's against under-age marketing of alcohol,'' Lofgren
said in an interview. ``But it's really a fight between different
parts of the alcohol industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Typically, it takes two or three weeks for wine or beer to be
delivered once it has been ordered from the Internet or a
catalogue. Lofgren and Radanovich contend that most underage
drinkers will likely continue trying to buy alcohol from their
local liquor or convenience store rather than the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Wine makers say the legislation would hurt their efforts to get
all 50 states to allow them to ship their products directly to
out-of-state consumers.
</P>
<P>
   John De Luca, president of the San Francisco-based Wine
Institute, which represents 500 California wineries, said the
industry began its state-by-state effort 15 years ago _ before the
Internet became popular _ when rising numbers of tourists at
vineyards began asking if the wine they had tasted could be shipped
back home.
</P>
<P>
   De Luca noted that New Hampshire recently changed its law to
allow direct shipments and that Kentucky now allows its residents
visiting other states' vineyards to ship wine home to themselves.
But it does not allow direct shipment otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Other states with bans are Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Georgia,
Indiana, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Mississippi, Montana, New York,
North Carolina, North Dakota, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah
and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   With the Internet, wineries and breweries can reach beyond
tourists. Dozens of Internet sites like Beer Across America and
Virtual Vineyards beckon to new customers.
</P>
<P>
   De Luca says Internet sales of alcoholic beverages are minute.
Direct sales of wine from California are less than 1 percent of
total wine sales, he says.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases wineries _ as well as breweries and liquor
producers _ sell their products to distributors, who in turn sell
them to a liquor store or other authorized vendor.
</P>
<P>
   De Luca says the growing number of small wineries going on the
Internet will not hurt distributors because ``the average small
winery is only able to produce a few thousand cases each year and
simply does not have the quantities necessary to accommodate the
needs of wholesalers.''
</P>
<P>
   He says when there were fewer wine producers, distributors could
handle most of them. But the number of vintners has mushroomed. In
1963 there were 377 nationwide. Today there are 1,700 _ with 800 in
California.
</P>
<P>
   The wine and beer distributors say they have no problem with
people who directly sell alcohol legally, but they say legislation
is needed to crack down on people who sell it illegally.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation in Congress would ``maintain a level playing
field for all alcohol beverage sellers making everyone comply with
state laws,'' said Juanita D. Duggan, chief executive officer of
Wine and Spirits Wholesalers of America, Inc., a Washington-based
alcohol distributor trade group.
</P>
<P>
   David Rehr, vice president of the National Beer Wholesalers
Association, notes that the state of Utah, which does not allow
direct shipment of alcohol, recently intercepted 244 cases of beer
from Beer Across America. In Maryland, the Kendall-Jackson wine
company was fined $35,000 for illegal shipments in that state.

ALBRIGHT TELLS KOSOVARS NOT TO ACT LIKE THEIR OPPRESSORS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ There were, no doubt, dark days during
the Kosovo conflict when Madeleine Albright wondered whether she
would manage to do what she did Thursday: address the Kosovar
Albanians in their own capital.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary of state arrived in Kosovo Thursday at a fragile
moment, when acts of revenge against Serbs by Kosovar Albanians
appear to be on the rise, tainting a victory that could be claimed
to be both theirs and hers. So the fiercest supporter within the
Clinton administration of the fight against President Slobodan
Milosevic _ some in Washington called it ``Madeleine's war'' _ had
a message that was celebratory but cautionary.
</P>
<P>
   Her theme appeared almost poignant as she delivered it on the
eve of a Balkan summit meeting with President Clinton in Sarajevo,
Bosnia, and just after the United States pledged $500 million for
the first phase of reconstruction of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is to be a true victory in Kosovo,'' she said, ``it
cannot be a victory of Albanians over Serbs, or NATO over Serbs. It
must be a victory of those who believe in the rights of the
individual over those who do not.''
</P>
<P>
   Revenge, she warned, was not the stuff of democracy. ``You will
not have the support of the world if you are intolerant and take
the law into your own hands,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Six days ago, 14 Serbs were killed at dusk as they were tilling
their fields in Gracko, a mostly Serbian village. Western officials
said Thursday that four suspects had been detained by NATO forces.
</P>
<P>
   The killings caused concern among NATO and U.N. officials that
elements within the Kosovo Liberation Army are determined to force
the remaining Serbs in Kosovo to flee. Numbers are hard to pin
down, but of the 200,000 Serbs believed to be in Kosovo before the
war, fewer than 100,000 are still here, and families are leaving
daily.
</P>
<P>
   Albright talked of the Gracko killings in her speech, saying
critics would use the incident to show that the Kosovar Albanians
would act toward the Serbs ``as the Serb military and police acted
towards you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They say, `See, we are right, the Kosovar Albanians are no
better than the Serbs of Slobodan Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright, who swept into Pristina on a U.S. Air Force C-17, an
aircraft usually used for transporting troops and equipment,
started her day at NATO's headquarters. She met there with the
leader of NATO's troops in Kosovo, Gen. Michael Jackson of Britain,
and the head of the U. N. mission, Bernard Kouchner of France.
</P>
<P>
   Both NATO and the United Nations have blamed each other for a
slow beginning in Kosovo. Despite this, Albright declared herself
satisfied with the progress. For his part, Kouchner said, ``I am
still waiting for active police officers. Without means it is not
easy to move very fast.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons for the dearth of international policemen,
who are supposed to be the backbone of a new police force in
Kosovo, is an argument at the United Nations over whether retired
police officers from member countries can serve as active officers
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Extraordinary security enveloped Albright as she was driven
several hundred yards to the plaza in a bulletproof van, flanked by
heavily armed American security officials on foot.
</P>
<P>
   While Albright, on her first visit to Kosovo as secretary of
state, was holding meetings with political leaders, a shot was
fired in the street outside. Though the circumstances were unclear,
the special SWAT team flown in to protect Albright considered
canceling her public appearance. But Albright, in an ebullient
mood, was determined to press ahead.
</P>
<P>
   She addressed the crowd members as ``friend'' and asked them to
join in a pledge that ``never again will people with guns come in
the night, never again will houses and villages be burned.''
Basking in the applause and chants of approval, the secretary
finished her address with her arms aloft and the thumbs up sign.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Her speech was broadcast live over Radio 21, a private radio
station financed by the U.S. Agency for International Development
and the British government, and thus reached nearly half the
population in the province.
</P>
<P>
   Behind closed doors, her talk was more specific, her aides said.
Albright met with Hashim Thaci, the leader of the Kosovo Liberation
Army and the prime minister of a ``provisional government'' that
NATO and U. N. officials believe has become overbearing.
</P>
<P>
   Under the provisions of the peace settlement, the United Nations
is supposed to govern the civilian side of life in Kosovo. But
because of the slow start by the United Nations, Thaci's men, who
have appointed themselves to ministries, have filled the void.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was clear that the United Nations is in charge,'' one of
her aides said. ``She said there was a need to cooperate with the
United Nations, implicitly urging them not to establish a parallel
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright also met with leaders of other political parties, but
not with Ibrahim Rugova, the pacifist leader who visited Kosovo for
less than a day after the war and then returned to Rome.
</P>
<P>
   At Gracanica, a monastery six miles south of the capital,
Albright met with Bishop Artemije, a leading anti-Milosevic
official of the Serbian Orthodox Church, who expressed his concern
about the safety of the Serbs still in Kosovo.

ABC'S `ONCE' DARES TO PUT FOCUS ON 40S 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Sincerity in the vicinity of Los Angeles is
even harder to find than career waitresses.
</P>
<P>
   So when you stumble across it, and it's combined with genuine
passion, it's like an ecstatic jolt. It warms the cockles and
gladdens the heart.
</P>
<P>
   Of all places, it came spilling out of an ABC press session the
other day for a new fall drama series called ``Once and Again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Once and Again'' is poised to be a rarity itself: an unfolding
story about two characters, 40 years old or so and single parents,
who meet and fall in love.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, stars Sela Ward and Billy Campbell aren't 40 in the
usual flab-and-bag sort of way. But they do stand out in a sea of
teens and 20ish folks on TV this coming season. To be 40 on TV is
to be a codger, a relic, an irrelevant piece of scrap meat. To be
40 and female _ well, ask Ward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a real problem with this issue because turning 40, I
feel like my life is just beginning,'' said Ward, who is 43. ``I
don't think I've ever been happier. I feel right. I feel yummy. I
feel incredibly intelligent. (I have) a lot of life experience to
offer.''
</P>
<P>
   And yummy she is. I think I can call that a consensus vote. But
after Ward finished a six-year run on NBC's ``Sisters,'' she said,
she tried out for a feature film role, only to hear that the
director said afterward, ``What we really want is Sela 10 years
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Ward said, ``I went, `Ah! Does this mean I'm no longer sexually
viable? Does this mean life is over? My career is over?' ... It is
a wasteland for roles for particular women. You know if you look at
actresses playing opposite the Michael Douglases and even Harrison
Ford, you know, excuse me? They can't play opposite someone close
to their own age, or even 15 years younger?
</P>
<P>
   ``Which is one reason why I fell so in love with this script. I
think perhaps unwittingly they've written something that celebrates
age, that at 40 there is life. At 40, there are new experiences. At
40, you can have the same feelings and emotions and state of
expectancy that you had about life when you were 19 and 18.''
</P>
<P>
   By ``they,'' Ward means the show's creators and producers,
Marshall Herskovitz and Edward Zwick. And this veteran team
provided the session's next bolt of fresh air.
</P>
<P>
   Herskovitz and Zwick have good things going on for them on the
big screen. Separately, they've directed several feature films,
including Zwick's ``Glory,'' ``After the Fall'' and ``Courage Under
Fire.'' Zwick won an Oscar for producing ``Shakespeare in Love.''
</P>
<P>
   But television hasn't been altogether kind to Herskovitz and
Zwick. They had a moderate success with ``thirtysomething.'' After
that, they scored critically with ``My So-Called Life'' and
``Relativity.'' Both shows died young and bitterly.
</P>
<P>
   So why persist? Why come back to TV after those disappointments,
when people of their creative stature are in demand for feature
films?
</P>
<P>
   Herskovitz nodded softly and took a breath. ``We have had an
amazing ride in television,'' he said. ``We've had unbelievable
creative freedom. We've had the experience, which by the way we
were completely unprepared for, of what it means to have a show on
the air every week, being seen by millions of people.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, both of us got into filmmaking for very idealistic
reasons. Many of them were illusions, frankly. We had some belief,
which so many of us had in the early '70s, that film could change
the world, that film was a higher calling in some way.
</P>
<P>
   But the film business has been frustrating as well as
stimulating, Herskovitz said. The lesson, he said, is that you
spend two years fashioning an entertainment for moviegoers who
watch it for two hours, then go home and forget it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are wonderful films, memorable films, but most films are
not remembered,'' he said. You create a television show, and it
stays in the culture, week after week, year after year, if you're
successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially if you're lucky enough to be doing a television
show that really gives you a pulpit to preach from, to talk about
the things you're interested in, and the things you want to say to
the world. To be able to do that, week after week, is just
remarkable.''
</P>
<P>
   Just for a minute, it didn't matter that ``Once and Again'' will
occupy the ``NYPD Blue'' time slot for several weeks, then be
pulled from the air for several more weeks, then return in a time
slot yet to be determined.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't even matter that the odds against ``Once and Again,''
as with any show written for adult sensibilities, are almost
criminally long.
</P>
<P>
   For a fleeting moment, it only mattered that one show actually
means something.

SPORTS COLUMN: DECIDING ON A PASSER AND A LINE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As the New York Giants and the New York Jets open
their training camps, the heat is on. Not just this summer's
scorching heat, but the quarterback heat that is always on. The
Giants must decide on their quarterback, the Jets must decide on
their quarterback's bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets know Vinny Testaverde is their quarterback, but they
also know that if they are to represent the AFC in Super Bowl
XXXIV, they must plug the leaks in the dike protecting him from the
ever rising tide of opposing pass rushers.
</P>
<P>
   Two leaks already exist, and a third could develop after their
Sept. 12 opener against the New England Patriots at Giants Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Quite simply, coach Bill Parcells does not possess one
established offensive guard, much less the required two. The depth
chart lists Alex Bernstein at right guard and Doug Karczewski at
left guard, but neither played a down for the Jets last season.
</P>
<P>
   Behind those two strangers are two rookies, the Jets' top draft
choices _ Randy Thomas from Mississippi State and David Loverne
from San Jose State.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an effort to get off to a better start, I'm going to
scrimmage my rookies a bit,'' Parcells has said, alluding to last
season's 0-2 sputter and to his search for two guards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't done it in quite a few years, but I have to see
which guys I'm going to have to use. I'm going to have to make some
personnel moves in this camp and get some guys in there that are
going to keep the wheels of progress moving.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of that progress in last season's 12-4 record developed
because the five linemen that kept Testaverde healthy _ left tackle
Jumbo Elliott, left guard Todd Burger, center Kevin Mawae, right
guard Matt O'Dwyer and right tackle Jason Fabini _ played every
offensive down except for two that Fabini missed. But in the
off-season, Parcells was willing to release Burger, and O'Dwyer
joined the Bengals as a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   The cornerstone of the offensive line, the 305-pound Elliott,
could spring a leak because of his July 9 brawl in a Long Beach,
N.Y., bar. If he is found guilty of a misdemeanor assault charge in
his Sept. 13 court date, orif he pleads no contest (on top of his
guilty plea last September to driving while impaired), there is at
least a chance he could be suspended by Commissioner Paul
Tagliabue. Whatever develops, he is likely to be distracted.
</P>
<P>
   And the efficiency, or inefficiency, of the Jets' offensive line
not only will determine the performance and health of Testaverde,
but also that of running back Curtis Martin. As this retooled line
goes, so will the Jets in their challenge to succeed the Denver
Broncos, now without John Elway, as AFC champions.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants, meanwhile, are not concerned with their offensive
line but they wish they knew who their quarterback will be _ Kent
Graham, the returning incumbent, or the question mark Kerry
Collins, the Carolina and New Orleans discard. Giants historians
assume that Ernie Accorsi, the general manager, did not give
Collins a four-year, $16.9 million contract to be a backup, but
coach Jim Fassel disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kerry's money is a nonfactor,'' Fassel said the other day in
his Giants Stadium office. ``Going to camp, Kent is the starter.
I've told him, `If you perform, I'm happy.'''
</P>
<P>
   In explaining Collins' presence, Fassel mentioned how ``every
NFL team is trying to get more than one'' quarterback, if only as
insurance against the starter being injured. The coach also talked
about Collins' past; he quit Carolina early last season after his
racial slur, allegedly in jest, disillusioned black teammates.
Returning to Charlotte, N.C., with the Saints, he was arrested for
drunken driving.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kerry needed to redirect his life,'' Fassel said. ``His work
ethic, his study habits, his football fundamentals. He's worked
very hard. He's lifted, he's run, he's thrown. But the main focus
is, will he dedicate himself to being a quarterback? So far, he
has.''
</P>
<P>
   Needing to improve on an 8-8 record, the Giants have other
questions. Will cornerback Jason Sehorn, returning from knee
surgery, be as skilled as before? Will Amani Toomer emerge as a
big-play receiver? Will Gary Brown's temporary absence create a
problem at running back? Will center Brian Williams anchor the
offensive line after missing two seasons with damaged vision? But
their big question involves the quarterback. It always does.

SHE MIGHT HAVE A PRAYER FOR MAYOR
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Keep your eye on the sky over Rome next week.
</P>
<P>
   I don't remember the exact code, but I think it's this: A puff
of white smoke will indicate that Angela Alioto has decided to run
for mayor. Of San Francisco, not Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Alioto is vacationing in Roma, but on her way out of San
Francisco Wednesday she stopped at City Hall and took out papers to
run for mayor. Or so say sources who have never been wrong.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean Alioto is officially running, but she's close.
And she was probably pushed a step closer when police Capt. Richard
Cairns took out papers to join the mayoral race.
</P>
<P>
   ``If two or three more men with a real constituency get in this
thing, Angela will  &UR; have  &LR; to run,'' said somebody who knows stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Another political insider theorizes knowingly that Cairns isn't
running in order to take votes away from Frank Jordan, as some
speculate. The insider says Cairns' job will be to pound away at
Tom Ammiano, which Willie Brown can't do for fear of alienating the
gay community. Da Supe will be busy putting out fires set by Cairns
and won't have time to go  &UR; mano a mayoro  &LR; with Brown.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, a gray puff of smoke over Rome will indicate Angela
has taken up cigars.
</P>
<P>
   JOHN F. KENNEDY JR. passed this way not long ago, gave a
memorable speech and never got his thank-you gift.
</P>
<P>
   On May 26, John Jr. spoke to 700 members of the local
advertising world at the Fairmont Hotel. Kennedy was promoting his
political/ &QL; 
celeb magazine George.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just blew everyone in the room away,'' says Mary Arnold,
executive director of the San Francisco Advertising Club. ``He was
extraordinarily bright and marvelously humorous.''
</P>
<P>
   It took four years of wrangling for Arnold to land JFK Jr. as a
speaker, and he requested a low-profile visit. No news media were
informed or invited.
</P>
<P>
   From the speech: ``The big question is whether Hillary will run
for the Senate and if it is unacceptable for someone born in
Illinois who grew up in Arkansas to run in New York. Sort of as
acceptable as someone who was born in Washington, D.C., coming to
San Francisco to get you to buy an ad in a New York magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   John Jr. gave a tiny hint that George wasn't the end point of
his political vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something is wrong that needs to be right,'' he said, ``and a
magazine is a start.''
</P>
<P>
   In appreciation, the Ad Club commissioned a hand-struck pewter
likeness of Coit Tower. Arnold got the piece from the artist and
was ready to ship it to Kennedy when she heard the sad news.
</P>
<P>
   WHY CAN'T Democrats raise funds like Repubs do? Gar Smith might
have the answer.
</P>
<P>
   Gar got a ballot from the Democratic National Committee, to vote
for the top Dems of the century. On the ballot is a plea: ``YES, I
am also including a generous contribution to the DNC.``
</P>
<P>
   There are four boxes where you check off the amount of your
generous contribution. The boxes are for the following amounts: $0,
$0, $0 and Other.
</P>
<P>
   And yet those Democrats are so generous with everyone  &UR; else's &LR; 
money.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe a generous liberal is like a compassionate conservative.
</P>
<P>
   THE PHOTO-OP KING strikes again. San Francisco Mayor Willie
Brown welcomed tennis sensation Venus Williams to town Tuesday, and
famed S.F. photog Scotty Morris suggested that Willie and Venus
stroll onto the lawn outside City Hall for a tennis lesson.
</P>
<P>
   Williams slammed a booming serve, then you know Willie, he
picked up a racquet and fired off a rocket, which smacked Morris in
the leg.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm suing,'' the photog yelped.
</P>
<P>
   Da Mayor glanced around at the 40 or so dignitaries on hand and
told Morris, ``You got no witnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   NOBODY WALKS in Los Angeles, which might explain why 14 UCLA
football players were busted for using handicapped parking placards
they got with phony doctor's notes.
</P>
<P>
   It's the UCLA version of a full-ride scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   And, man, in L.A. you'd think the kids would be hip to the
concept of karma.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad the players didn't discuss the scheme with Drew Bennett,
from Miramonte High in Orinda, who's fighting for the Bruins'
starting quarterback job.
</P>
<P>
   Just a guess, but Drew probably would have told them those
parking spots should go to athletes like his brother Richie, a
student at Cal who had cerebral palsy and is a hell of a wheelchair
basketball player.
</P>
<P>
   MARCEL MARCEAU doesn't normally work with sound effects, but he
doesn't have much choice in his current gig at Theatre on the
Square.
</P>
<P>
   A fan at Tuesday's show says the rapt silence was frequently
broken by the beeps and squeaks of wristwatches and cell phones.
Offenders received severe glarings from their neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   FYI: The proper etiquette at a mime performance, if you're a big
shot who must be cell-available, is to shut off your phone and
pantomime taking calls.

UC MEDICAL TRAINING AND CARE ON CRITICAL LIST, OFFICIALS SAY
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  WASHINGTON _ The ability of the University of California's
medical centers to teach new generations of specialists and treat
the ``sickest of the sick'' is in critical condition, UC officials
warned Wednesday.
<P>
   The officials told reporters at a breakfast meeting that the
1997 cutbacks in Medicare, the huge health care program for the
elderly, are squeezing the centers to the point of damaging care.
</P>
<P>
   ``The system is in desperate trouble,'' said William Gurtner,
vice president of clinical services development at the university.
Teaching hospitals rely on Medicare money to train doctors, and the
UC system has seen its reimbursement cut by $225 million, or about
10 percent of its budget, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat, also urged
Governor Gray Davis in a letter Wednesday to increase state funding
for Medi-Cal, the state-federal program that treats poor patients
and is also pressed for funds.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein warned that California's health care system ``is on
the verge of collapse,'' requiring ``major steps to prevent massive
deterioration.''
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein added a handwritten note at the end of the letter
emphasizing that Medi-Cal's reimbursement rates to providers are
the fourth-lowest in the nation, paying hospitals and physicians
between 4 percent and 39 percent of what private insurers pay for
identical procedures. Feinstein said UC San Francisco-Stanford
Health Care, the fifth-largest MediCal provider in the state, is
losing $80 million a year on MediCal patients.
</P>
<P>
   Health care providers contend that the current round of problems
in Medicare began in 1997 with the balanced-budget pact between
congress and the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Locked in a major budget standoff and unable to agree on more
fundamental reforms of Medicare _ which was growing faster than
just about anything else in the federal budget and projected to go
bankrupt in five years _ the GOP-controlled Congress and the
Clinton administration simply agreed to cut reimbursement rates to
doctors and hospitals as a way to save money.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting Balanced Budget Act took most of its budget
savings out of Medicare, and UC officials said those cutbacks are
starting to squeeze hard now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the consequences of the Balanced Budget Act are
well understood,'' said Mark Laret, director of the UC Irvine
Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   University officials said the UC medical system is hit
especially hard because the teaching hospitals tend to get the
sickest patients, requiring the most complex procedures, from organ
transplants to specialized chemotherapy. And by law, the centers
cannot turn away patients, even if they are uninsured or indigent.
</P>
<P>
   UC medical centers are hardly alone in their complaints. For the
past year, providers throughout the U.S. health care system have
been assailing the 1997 Medicare spending cuts, saying they are
turning out to be about twice as high as the government projected
two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   UC officials said President Clinton's proposal to add a
prescription drug benefit to Medicare could further jeopardize an
already squeezed system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where does the money come from?'' asked Tom Cesario, dean of
the College of Medicine at UC Irvine.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you're giving with the left hand, you're taking from the
right hand.''
</P>
<P>
   James Terwilliger, vice provost at UCLA's medical center said
the drug benefit makes providers ``very nervous'' because estimates
show that most of the added expense will be made up by further
cutbacks on payments to providers.

RAIL RAGE GROWS AMONG RIDERS OF LONG ISLAND RAIL ROAD 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID M. HALBFINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On July 6, as temperatures across New York topped 100
degrees, hundreds of commuters on their way home to Long Island's
North Shore boarded the 5:47 p.m. train at Hunters Point Avenue in
Queens, as usual. And, as usual, within minutes many of them were
cursing the Long Island Rail Road.
</P>
<P>
   Every trip has its aggravations, riders say _ an unexplained
delay, a filthy car, a bottomless seat, a surly ticket-taker. But
for even the toughest-skinned commuters, this was a new low. The
air conditioning in all 10 passenger coaches had broken down.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Kalbacher sat in a pool of her own sweat as far as the
St. James station, an hour-and-a-half trip. She fumed in silence as
other riders voiced bitter fantasies of boycotts, civil
disobedience, even violence against the train's conductors and the
railroad's managers. ``It just made people into monsters,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The 144,000 people who ride the Long Island Rail Road every day
are brimming over with rage. And they have good reason:
</P>
<P>
   _ The railroad's car fleet is literally falling apart. Four out
of five electric coaches are nearly 30 years old, and most coaches
on diesel trains date back to the 1950s. Worse, the 744 oldest
electric coaches never received their scheduled midlife overhauls
in the 1980s, so most are now considered beyond rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   _ A purchase of 134 new diesel coaches, begun several years
late, is another year and a half behind schedule, and the 48
coaches that have entered service so far are riddled with
mechanical, air-conditioning and computer problems.
</P>
<P>
   _ The railroad admits it cannot keep up with the breakdowns. By
this time last year, the mean distance between failures _ how far
the average car travels before breaking down _ was 32,601 miles.
This year, the distance between failures fell to 28,578 miles. By
contrast, at the Metro-North Commuter Railroad, a sister division
of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority that uses trains
nearly identical to the Long Island Rail Road's, the mean distance
between failures was 70,533 miles.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the LIRR's unforgiving network of branches and chokepoints
_ the best known is Penn Station in Manhattan, where morning-rush
trains arrive every three minutes _ minor failures are easily
amplified into near-catastrophes. A problem with a coupler on a
single train last month on Long Island, for example, caused 46
morning trains to arrive late.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no easy fix,'' said Thomas Prendergast, the
railroad's president, who concedes that he cannot expect riders to
be patient much longer. Yet he says he wishes riders would be more
``understanding of what we're dealing with.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, riders were more accepting of the railroad's
shortcomings. The LIRR, the nation's busiest commuter railroad, was
part of what could have been called the unholy trinity of life on
Long Island, along with traffic on the Long Island Expressway and
electric rates under the former Long Island Lighting Co. But the
Expressway now has express lanes. And LILCO's replacement has
actually cut electric rates.
</P>
<P>
   The railroad's commuters, meanwhile, appear to have lost any
interest in why things go wrong sometime around June 1998, when 13
percent of the trains arrived late, shortages of parts made it
impossible to repair many air-conditioning breakdowns, and the
scarcity of spare coaches meant many trains ran hot for days on
end. If anything, riders now seem more apt to believe that, no
matter the problem, the railroad's managers are to blame.
</P>
<P>
   Tempers flare most angrily on the Internet. A number of
commuters have launched Web sites since last fall to provide
outlets for fellow riders' frustrations. At www.ihatethelirr.com,
tales of woe and screeds against railroad managers pop up in
twice-a-day spurts after every rush hour; one rider recently mused
about gathering the garbage from a single train and dumping it on
Prendergast's lawn. Another site, billed as an ``unofficial guide''
to the railroad, has recorded 81,000 hits since September.
</P>
<P>
   The deep displeasure also surfaces in the railroad's customer
satisfaction surveys, distributed annually to the 600 managers who
make up 10 percent of the railroad's work force. Passenger
satisfaction ratings fell in 20 of 21 categories last year, with
the overall rating dropping from a 6.3 out of 10 in 1997 to a 5.4
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in decades, complacency seems to be giving
over to a kind of nascent rail rage. Confrontations between
passengers and crew members have become common, with passengers
refusing to show their monthly tickets as required, and crew
members threatening to eject disgruntled passengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``As it gets hot, the tensions get hotter,'' said George Closs,
who rides from Merrick to Manhattan every morning. ``A lot of
times, the conductors don't even come through. They lock themselves
in their booths, out of fear they'll be lynched or something.''
</P>
<P>
   Prendergast says that comparisons with Metro-North, which is
roughly comparable in size and ridership but is widely considered
the best commuter railroad in New York, if not the nation, overlook
the LIRR's inherent handicaps. Those handicaps, he said, range from
a decades-old history of acrimonious labor relations to Long
Island's greater vulnerability to oceanborne thunderstorms and
other disruptive weather conditions. Above all, he said, is the
LIRR's extraordinary complexity.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all Metro-North trains on its three main lines run into
and out of Grand Central Terminal on four tracks, but the terminal
itself, which is also owned by the MTA, has 78 platforms and
sidings, enough for trains to sit empty for hours.
</P>
<P>
   The LIRR, by contrast, could have been designed by a sadistic
Rube Goldberg. Trains from nine eastern branches converge at
Jamaica, Queens, where they connect with other trains heading to
Brooklyn or Manhattan or elsewhere in Queens. Trains into and out
of Manhattan are limited to four tunnels, two of which are shared
with Amtrak. And in Penn Station, which is owned by Amtrak, the
LIRR is confined to only nine tracks.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The LIRR's continual air-conditioning problems shed light on the
best and worst aspects of the railroad's culture and its
management. After years of passenger complaints and a 2 1/2-year
investigation, the MTA's inspector general issued a withering
report in December that revealed the railroad was letting an
average of four days go by before it even detected hot cars, and
another seven before they were fixed. One in four hot cars took as
long as 20 days to notice and repair.
</P>
<P>
   Train crews were reporting only one in five hot cars, the
inspector general said. The railroad routinely failed to track
repair progress; despite two reports of a breakdown, for example,
one car ran hot for 23 days in August. Air-conditioning repairmen,
stretched extremely thin, frequently performed the same repairs on
the same cars a few days apart because no record of the earlier
work had been made.
</P>
<P>
   Prendergast, 47, responded to the report by embracing some of
its recommendations. He said that a new computer system will
eventually enable the railroad to keep better track of its repair
work, but that system is at least a year away. So, he conceded, he
still has no way of knowing if hot cars are being detected and
repaired any quicker.
</P>
<P>
   The cars stink, passengers say. Closs, of Merrick, was nearly
overcome recently by the stench from a bathroom that had not been
cleaned in days. ``It smelled like a cesspool,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The trains are filthy, passengers say. Edward Devane, of East
Islip, was dozing on the Montauk line the other day when he
awakened to find a roach running down his neck. ``I can't even sit
on this train anymore,'' he said. ``You get on in the morning,
there'll still be beer cans, papers, coffee cups from the night
before. Bugs don't need much to get started.''
</P>
<P>
   But nothing gets a carful of commuters muttering like
psychopaths faster than the fliers dropped on thousands of seats
every month in which the LIRR touts its latest on-time performance
statistics. For June, the railroad reported an overall on-time rate
of 91.6 percent, up from 87.5 percent in June 1998, the railroad's
worst single month in years.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Haynes, a 16-year commuter, snorted at the LIRR's claim
that 88.1 percent of the Montauk line's trains ran on time in June.
``The last three weeks, I haven't had one day without a delay,'' he
said early this month. ``Yesterday there was another major tie-up,
with 85-minute delays in the morning. And then on my way home, the
train was 16 minutes late.''
</P>
<P>
   Many riders simply do not believe the numbers. The leader of one
of the railroad's unions, speaking on condition of anonymity, said,
``I wouldn't, either.''
</P>
<P>
   A 1996 audit of on-time statistics by the inspector general
found no evidence of fraud, though it did find that the railroad
overstated its performance by about 7 percentage points.
Prendergast, clearly exasperated that riders still question the
veracity of the railroad's figures, said that any deliberate
misreporting is impossible because much of the data-gathering is
done automatically by computers.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Prendergast's admirers suggest that he might be more
sensitive to such complaints if he were still a passenger himself.
After two and a half years riding the train to the railroad's
offices in Jamaica from Garden City, Long Island, an uncommonly
short commute, he moved to Staten Island for personal reasons in
1996. He now gets to work by car, and is seldom seen on the train
east of Jamaica, train workers say.
</P>
<P>
   But Prendergast seems deeply hurt by the emergence of the
anti-LIRR Web sites in recent months. ``No other railroad has
them,'' he said, a sheaf of printouts of the more rabid postings in
front of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be extremely frustrating,'' he said. ``I don't turn a
deaf ear to those people at the extreme. But I don't know how much
to deal with it. I don't think this is a representative sample of
what our customers think.''
</P>
<P>
   Prendergast's idea of responsiveness does not seem to be
satisfying many riders.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most recent entries on the www.ihatethelirr.com site
came from Petra Devlin, who said she was amazed that Prendergast
spent a full 45 minutes on the phone with her, answering every one
of her questions. But she said in an interview later that she hung
up feeling miserable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really disgusted,'' Ms. Devlin said. ``He was very nice
on the phone. But he had an excuse for everything. He said the
money for the new trains is in the pipeline, but until they get
here he can't do a thing about lateness. There's nothing he can do
about anything. There's absolutely no hope whatsoever.''

`CRUEL INTENTIONS' TAKES PLOT FROM `LIAISONS'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When ``Les Liaisons Dangereuses'' was published in
1782, its author, Choderlos deLaclos, said that the novel was
intended to shock.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 years later, it continues to jolt the public on
stage and screen, including the 1959 film directed by Roger Vadim
(``God Created Woman,'' ``Barbarella'') and starring Jeanne Moreau.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, there was Stephen Frears' ``Dangerous Liaisons''
(1988), starring Michele Pfeiffer, Glenn Close and John Malkovich,
and then, a year later, Milos Forman's ``Valmont,'' with Colin
Firth and Annette Bening. This fall, Fox will even have an updated,
younger version of it on television, called ``Manchester Prep,'' in
which the action will take place in a ritzy East Coast high school.
Of course, you say, haven't we had that already? It was the film
``Cruel Intentions'' (Sony), which hits video stores Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   So what's with all these ``Dangerous'' visions? In the original
story, Valmont and Marquise de Merteuil, a couple of debauched
aristocratic Parisians and former lovers, spend their days in
pursuit of sexual prey or vengeance. Intent on revenge over a
slight, Merteuil proposes to Valmont that he deflower her enemy's
innocent bride-to-be, Cecile, before the wedding. In exchange,
Merteuil says she will return her sexual favors to Valmont. He
seduces Cecile with ease, unleashing the young woman's sexual
voraciousness. In the meantime, though, Valmont has taken upon
himself a more difficult challenge _ the seduction of Madame de
Tourvel, a woman known for her piety and faithfulness. Valmont's
subtle ploys eventually break her down emotionally, and she
submits, but in doing so he inadvertently discovers his own heart.
There is, however, no happy ending in ``Les Liaisons Dangereuses.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Cruel Intentions,'' director Roger Kumble essentially keeps
the premise intact, adding some modern touches, such as a cross
that unscrews to reveal a tiny spoon and a vial of cocaine. Valmont
and Merteuil become Sebastian (Ryan Phillippe) and Kathryn (Sarah
Michelle Gellar), a rather venomous and amoral stepbrother and
-sister (another twist) who live on New York's Upper East Side and
attend private school.
</P>
<P>
   When Kathryn is entrusted to take care of her cousin, Cecile
(played for laughs by Selma Blair), she takes special delight in
turning the young girl into a sex maniac, even giving Cecile
kissing lessons before Sebastian seduces her. (And unlike the
mannered older version, Kathryn's offer of sexual favors to her
stepbrother is fairly graphic.) But the real object of Sebastian's
obsession is Annette (Reese Witherspoon as the Madame de Tourvel
character), a self-proclaimed virgin willing to wait for Mr. Right.
It is too great a challenge for the narcissistic Sebastian to pass
up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cruel Intentions''' crassness seems particularly calculated.
But it is mostly entertaining. Gellar, best-known as the title
character of ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer,'' is wonderfully venal.
And while ``Cruel Intentions'' reworks the source material in an
MTV ``Real World'' sort of way, it also retains its appeal.
</P>
<P>
   As reprehensible as Valmont (Sebastian) and Merteuil (Kathryn)
are, we enjoy a sort of complicity in their acts. They, in their
own way, represent a type of honesty. They understand their
degenerate natures amid a world of wealthy pretension. So when they
take someone down with them _ even an innocent like Cecile _ we
take secret delight in the scoundrels' success, because it is a
blow against the hypocrites. On the other hand, when they get their
comeuppance, we can also feel good, because their behavior
shouldn't be rewarded. In this way, ``Les Liaisons Dangereuses''
wields a double-edged sword.
</P>
<P>
   In its best version _ Frears' ``Dangerous Liaisons'' _ the story
goes beyond being a mere morality play and becomes a meditation on
sexual power. ``Cruel Intentions'' doesn't rise to that level _ the
characters too world weary and not human enough, the ending too
pat. Nevertheless, it still retains enough jolts to make it a nasty
little pleasure. &QL;

 &HT;    At the year's halfway point, suggestions for Oscar voters
 &HT;    EMBARGOED UNTIL SUNDAY, AUG. 1
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the occasional exception (``The Silence of the Lambs,''
``Fargo''), Oscar voters tend to focus on movies that arrive at the
end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   But here are a few films and early performances from this year
that deserve to be noticed:
</P>
<P>
   MOVIES
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Election'' (R): The leader of the pack is Alexander Payne's
painfully funny high school satire.
</P>
<P>
   It's the follow-up film to the director's biting, underseen
``Citizen Ruth,'' which found laughs in the struggle between
anti-abortion and abortion rights activists. Here the grudge match
is between a well-liked teacher (Matthew Broderick) and a
control-freak student (Reese Witherspoon, in a remarkable
performance), whose bid for student body president he sets out to
derail.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``The Winslow Boy'' (G): This film never steps foot inside a
school. The young student of the title is rarely onscreen. But he's
the catalyst for director David Mamet's crisp remake of the Terence
Rattigan play, an Edwardian British melodrama centering on a
family's determination, at all costs, to clear its good name.
</P>
<P>
   Nigel Hawthorne plays the Winslow patriarch and Jeremy Northam
the barrister who defends the 13-year-old boy on a petty theft
charge. With its British accents and elegant costumes, ``Winslow''
is actually the sort of movie Oscar voters like.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``October Sky'' (PG): Oscar might like this one, too. It's
the old-fashioned but beautifully realized fact-based tale of West
Virginia boys who struggle to build a model rocket. Why? If they
win the science fair, it could mean a ticket out of their dead-end
coal-mining town.
</P>
<P>
   It's a movie rich in texture and place (remember ``Coal Miner's
Daughter''?) with solid performances by Jake Gyllenhaal as the
young hero, Homer, and a smoldering Chris Cooper as his short-fused
dad.
</P>
<P>
   This is one for the whole family and has just been released on
video.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``South Park: Bigger, Longer &AMP; Uncut'' (R): The epithet-laden
antithesis to ``Sky's'' 1950s aw-shucks tone, ``South Park'' is as
cleverly funny as it is gleefully obscene (very much so, in both
cases).
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, the comedy about crude-talking schoolkids
distills the country's current moral climate, as parents and the
media debate the merits of V-chips, censorship and the Motion
Picture Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's many sardonic song-and-dance numbers represent the
final shovel of soil dumped on the corpse of Hollywood's
bright-eyed musical past.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``The Iron Giant'' (PG): The other animated feature (opening
in metro Atlanta on Friday) lies somewhere between the gee-whiz
innocence of ``October Sky'' and the sly humor of ``South Park.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Iron Giant'' isn't trash-mouthed. But its story, about a
young boy who befriends an enormous robot from space, is full of
sharp jokes about its paranoid, Cold War '50s setting (you may
never hear the term ``duck and cover'' again without laughing).
</P>
<P>
   This Warner Bros. movie is beautifully stylized and proves an
animated feature can thrill you without a single Disney-style song.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``The Matrix'' (R): Another kind of sci-fi film, ``The
Matrix'' hit screens with little warning, and low expectations.
After ``Johnny Mnemonic,'' another trip into cyberpunk with Keanu
Reeves, it sounded like a very bad idea.
</P>
<P>
   But thanks to the Wachowski brothers (``Bound''), ``Matrix''
turned out to be one of those rare high-concept action thrillers
that Hollywood gets right.
</P>
<P>
   It's like ``The Terminator,'' ``The Crow,'' ``Dune,'' ``Total
Recall'' and ``Dark City'' all rolled into one and fused into an
adventure that pleases comic-book fanatics and mainstream
audiences.
</P>
<P>
   The special effects are fresh and bracing _ whether it's someone
running up a wall to avoid bullets, or stopping in midair to
deliver a karate kick.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Cookie's Fortune'' (PG-13): On the other end of the scale,
Robert Altman delivered ``Cookie's Fortune,'' a genial character
study of small-town Mississippi in the aftermath of a beloved
matriarch's death.
</P>
<P>
   It's typically Altman _ an unassuming showcase for an ensemble
cast including Charles S. Dutton, Julianne Moore, Glenn Close and
Patricia Neal.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``The Dreamlife of Angels'' (R): Since a movie critic's list
wouldn't be complete without at least one eggheady, subtitled film,
add ``The Dreamlife of Angels,'' Erick Zonca's extraordinary,
nuanced drama about two young women (Elodie Bouchez and Natacha
Regnier, sharing last year's actress prize at Cannes) drifting
through friendship in a small French town.
</P>
<P>
   There's not a false, actory moment in the whole movie.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Limbo'' (R): John Sayles' ``Limbo'' is also the sort of
movie most people would make a point to miss. Don't.
</P>
<P>
   It's a low-key character study about lost souls in Alaska,
giving David Strathairn and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio meaty
roles, and featuring one of the most enigmatic endings of the year.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``The Blair Witch Project'' (R): This brilliantly conceived,
low-budget horror sensation is more than just a buzz-driven
audience sensation. It's also a reminder to the Hollywood suits
that $80 million might get you cool computer-generated ghosts, like
``The Haunting.'' But nothing beats imagination, ingenuity and a
great story.
</P>
<P>
   PERFORMANCES
</P>
<P>
   -- Juliette Lewis and Giovanni Ribisi. The actors' committed
work as mentally challenged lovers kept ``The Other Sister'' from
dissolving into glitzy mush.
</P>
<P>
   -- Cate Blanchett and Angelina Jolie. They play very different
kinds of wives in the air-traffic-control comedy-drama ``Pushing
Tin.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio. In ``Limbo,'' she plays a
down-on-her-luck saloon singer in Alaska, stuck with a surly
teenage daughter and bad luck in love.
</P>
<P>
   -- Sissy Spacek and Christopher Walken. They're a comic,
Eisenhower-era couple in the otherwise lame ``Blast From the
Past.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Diane Lane, Liev Schreiber and Tovah Feldshuh. All three give
lovely, nuanced work in ``A Walk on the Moon.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Reese Witherspoon and Matthew Broderick. The lethal rivals in
``Election.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Rupert Everett and Julianne Moore. For their sultry,
intelligent badinage in ``An Ideal Husband.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Patricia Neal and Charles S. Dutton. As unlikely best pals in
``Cookie's Fortune.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Joaquin Phoenix. He's the only spark of life in the trashy
``Eight Millimeter.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Jeremy Northam and Nigel Hawthorne. They personify the
British stiff upper lip in ``The Winslow Boy.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Hugo Weaving. His ripely deadpan performance as the chief
villain gave ``The Matrix'' a welcome hint of self-mockery.
</P>
<P>
   If the academy ever gave out Oscars for ensemble work,
nominations should go to Omar Epps, Richard T. Jones and Taye Diggs
for ``The Wood,'' and the boys of ``October Sky.''
</P>
<P>
   And there ought to be a special award created for all the good
actors swallowed whole by special effects. Liam Neeson, survivor of
both ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace'' and ``The
Haunting,'' would be a shoo-in for the trophy. Runners-up: Ewan
McGregor (``Phantom Menace''), Lili Taylor (``The Haunting''), Will
Smith (``Wild Wild West'') and Kevin Kline (``Wild Wild West'').

 &HT;    Few Oscar contenders on radar in '99 thus far
 &HT;    EMBARGOED UNTIL SUNDAY, AUG. 1
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   This time last summer, you could predict at least one big Oscar
nominee: ``Saving Private Ryan.'' It hit theaters July 24, setting
a new standard for war films. But the year's other big movies
didn't arrive till fall, Hollywood's traditional season for
unveiling its prestige, trophy-chasing pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Though the mixed critical response to Stanley Kubrick's ``Eyes
Wide Shut'' may translate into Oscar recognition for 1999, we
haven't seen a sure thing such as ``Ryan'' yet. The best of the
year's movies so far include a crowd-pleasing sci-fi mind-bender,
two animated features not by Disney and a talky French movie about
two young women who spend a lot of time doing ... not much.
</P>
<P>
   The first half of '99 has brought us a few terrific pics the
Oscar voters probably won't look at twice. Some of them are too
darkly funny, too wild or too on-the-fringe to fit in with the
types of movies the academy prefers _ epic historical dramas and
period comedies with lots of costumes.
</P>
<P>
   Today we offer a subjective view of some of the best of the
bunch (in no particular order), movies that help us forget the
summer's big-budget, super-hyped disappointments of ``Star Wars:
Episode I _ The Phantom Menace,'' ``Wild Wild West'' and ``The
Haunting.''
</P>
<P>
   Five of the top films _ ``Election,'' ``The Winslow Boy,''
``October Sky,'' ``The Blair Witch Project'' and ``South Park:
Bigger, Longer and Uncut'' _ focus on schoolkids, but in different
ways, their tones veering from very proper to vilely profane. None
is the typical, having-sex-or-killing-aliens teen flicks Hollywood
is churning out overtime lately.
</P>
<P>
   ``ELECTION'' (R)
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the pack is Alexander Payne's painfully funny high
school satire.
</P>
<P>

derail.

``South Park'' is as cleverly funny as it is gleefully obscene

WINE MAKERS SAY PROPOSED LEGISLATION WOULD HURT LEGAL SALES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Aug. 1)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The wine industry sees legislation aimed at
stopping teen-agers from ordering its products over the Internet as
something worse than the grapes of wrath.
</P>
<P>
   Mounting a campaign against the measure, which has passed the
Senate and is expected to come before the House this week, the
industry says it would hurt small wineries' efforts to make sales
to adults over the Internet and through mail-order catalogues.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would give state attorneys general broad new
power to go to federal courts seeking enforcement of state liquor
laws. Now the prosecutors may go only to their own state courts.
</P>
<P>
   In 19 states it is illegal for alcohol to be distributed by
direct delivery _ whether bought over the Internet, mail-order
catalogue or phone.
</P>
<P>
   The measure began moving through Congress earlier this year
after Senate Judiciary Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, aired before
his committee a report from television station KUTV in Salt Lake
City. The report showed how a 13-year-old, using a home computer,
ordered a case of beer from a micro-brewery with her older
brother's credit card. The Senate adopted Hatch's legislation in
May.
</P>
<P>
   The identical House measure is authored by Rep. Joe Scarborough,
R-Fla. He says most wineries need not worry about his bill: ``Only
those shippers who violate state alcohol laws will be affected.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. George Radanovich, R-Calif., a lawmaker who also owns a
small winery in Mariposa, Calif., argues that the measure would
have the ``unintended consequence of crippling small wineries in
this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Some state attorneys general have said they need the legislation
in order to target direct alcohol distributors located in other
states.
</P>
<P>
   But most California lawmakers insist there is no evidence that
people under age 21 are actually using the Internet to order wine
and beer despite the TV reports showing how easily it can be done.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., who opposes the measure, says the
rise of the Internet has scared beer and wine distributors, who
have pushed for the legislation because they view direct alcohol
sales as a threat to their profit margins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's against under-age marketing of alcohol,'' Lofgren
said in an interview. ``But it's really a fight between different
parts of the alcohol industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Typically, it takes two or three weeks for wine or beer to be
delivered once it has been ordered from the Internet or a
catalogue. Lofgren and Radanovich contend that most underage
drinkers will likely continue trying to buy alcohol from their
local liquor or convenience store rather than the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Wine makers say the legislation would hurt their efforts to get
all 50 states to allow them to ship their products directly to
out-of-state consumers.
</P>
<P>
   John De Luca, president of the San Francisco-based Wine
Institute, which represents 500 California wineries, said the
industry began its state-by-state effort 15 years ago _ before the
Internet became popular _ when rising numbers of tourists at
vineyards began asking if the wine they had tasted could be shipped
back home.
</P>
<P>
   De Luca noted that New Hampshire recently changed its law to
allow direct shipments and that Kentucky now allows its residents
visiting other states' vineyards to ship wine home to themselves.
But it does not allow direct shipment otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Other states with bans are Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Georgia,
Indiana, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Mississippi, Montana, New York,
North Carolina, North Dakota, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah
and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   With the Internet, wineries and breweries can reach beyond
tourists. Dozens of Internet sites like Beer Across America and
Virtual Vineyards beckon to new customers.
</P>
<P>
   De Luca says Internet sales of alcoholic beverages are minute.
Direct sales of wine from California are less than 1 percent of
total wine sales, he says.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases wineries _ as well as breweries and liquor
producers _ sell their products to distributors, who in turn sell
them to a liquor store or other authorized vendor.
</P>
<P>
   De Luca says the growing number of small wineries going on the
Internet will not hurt distributors because ``the average small
winery is only able to produce a few thousand cases each year and
simply does not have the quantities necessary to accommodate the
needs of wholesalers.''
</P>
<P>
   He says when there were fewer wine producers, distributors could
handle most of them. But the number of vintners has mushroomed. In
1963 there were 377 nationwide. Today there are 1,700 _ with 800 in
California.
</P>
<P>
   The wine and beer distributors say they have no problem with
people who directly sell alcohol legally, but they say legislation
is needed to crack down on people who sell it illegally.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation in Congress would ``maintain a level playing
field for all alcohol beverage sellers making everyone comply with
state laws,'' said Juanita D. Duggan, chief executive officer of
Wine and Spirits Wholesalers of America, Inc., a Washington-based
alcohol distributor trade group.
</P>
<P>
   David Rehr, vice president of the National Beer Wholesalers
Association, notes that the state of Utah, which does not allow
direct shipment of alcohol, recently intercepted 244 cases of beer
from Beer Across America. In Maryland, the Kendall-Jackson wine
company was fined $35,000 for illegal shipments in that state.

STATIC BEGINS TO CLEAR IN BERKELEY RADIO CONFLICT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn. Calif.) 
 
By ALLAN TURNER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A bitter, months-long dispute at the nation's oldest public
radio station, KPFA-FM in Berkeley, Calif., was set to end Friday
as management ordered padlocks removed from the station's doors and
its suspended staff placed in charge of broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict brought thousands of protesters to the streets of
Berkeley, home of a University of California campus and site of
much 1960s student revolutionary unrest.
</P>
<P>
   At the protest's height, gunshots were fired into studio of
KPFA, flagship of the listener-supported, left-leaning Pacifica
Foundation. Dozens of tents occupied by protesters clogged a nearby
street.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Pacifica chairwoman Mary Frances Berry said
removing guards and reopening the station, which celebrated its
50th anniversary earlier this year, marked the foundation's ``good
faith effort'' to end the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   She said Pacifica directors will monitor progress of the
self-directed staff _ represented by the Communications Workers of
America union _ in meeting foundation goals of increasing
listenership and diversity. Eventually, she said, directors will
appoint an interim station manager.
</P>
<P>
   Berry, who also is chairwoman of the U.S. Civil Rights
Commission, said Pacifica directors will consider offers to buy the
station. With the strongest FM signal in Northern California, the
station serves a market of about 6 million. Stressing the station
is not actively for sale, she said Pacifica specifically will
consider any offer from the city of Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   In an emergency session earlier this week, Berkeley City Council
passed a package of pro-KPFA resolutions and authorized the city
manager to investigate the possibility of buying the station.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is earlier than premature,'' said Berkeley Mayor Shirley
Dean, who Thursday expressed doubt the city ever would acquire the
property. ``We have no information that it's for sale. And no
information on its value. Some tell us $60 million. Some tell us
$80 million ... So, the motion to investigate really doesn't mean a
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Possible sale of Pacifica stations, representation of local
stations on the network's board of directors and concern about
changes in program content were key issues in the protest.
</P>
<P>
   Fueling the controversy was an e-mail from Pacifica board member
Michael Palmer, a Houston real estate broker, to Berry suggesting
that some Pacifica stations, notably WBAI in New York City, might
profitably be sold. Palmer declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Pacifica also owns stations in Houston, Los Angeles and
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Looming over the crisis was the perceived threat that the
Berkeley station, whose audience had dropped to 146,000 listeners a
week, most of them middle-aged white males, might follow the lead
of Pacifica's Houston station, KPFT.
</P>
<P>
   KPFT, under the leadership of general manager Garland Ganter,
dropped its local news programs and foreign-language programs in a
successful effort to boost listenership and revenue. As a result of
Ganter's actions, the station's weekly audience increased from
69,000 to 104,000.
</P>
<P>
   For about two weeks in July, Ganter, 35, oversaw day-to-day
operations of the California station.
</P>
<P>
   KPFA supporters dismissed the Houston station as a ``jukebox''
and as ``sanitized.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this summer, the Houston station was picketed by local
listeners displeased with the station's programming. One protester
likened KPFT's largely musical offerings to ``being on marijuana 12
hours a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Ganter said he plans to reinstitute local news broadcasting, and
possibly a call-in talk program, this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the details of the KPFA dispute were lost in an opaque
swirl of claims and counterclaims, lawsuits and Web site postings.
What emerged, though, was a sense that the community radio station
commands a fiercely loyal listenership _ one that suspected the the
purity of even its closest friends, Pacifica's self-consciously
progressive administrators.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I have a personal stake in all of this,'' said one
protester, David Jameson, 39. ``We're really floundering without
the news. Most people think National Public Radio is a big step
down. This station is my life blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Others handcuffed themselves to the chains that secured the
station's front doors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our policy,'' said one who identified himself only as
``Shorty,'' ``is we've put our chains on the chains of Pacifica
that have closed our doors. We will unhandcuff ourselves only when
the doors are unlocked, the boards removed from the windows and the
staff returned to work.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his comments, Shorty, who occasionally emphasized
his point by gagging himself with a red, white and blue bandana,
had been handcuffed 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   During the protests, Berry and Pacifica executive director Lynn
Chadwick were vilified as vampires intent on gutting the radio
station, which was the first of the network founded by World War
II-era pacifist Lewis Hill and his associates.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, a New York advertising man, envisioned a noncommercial
radio empire dedicated to free speech and intelligent debate.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute between KPFA and its parent foundation became public
in February when Pacifica directors voted to eliminate seats for
directors who also served on individual stations' advisory boards.
That action, they said, was necessary to comply with regulations of
the federal Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which provides
about 15 percent of Pacifica budget.
</P>
<P>
   Critics argued that Pacifica has received federal money since
the early 1970s, apparently without conflict.
</P>
<P>
   In March, popular KPFA general manager Nicole Sawaya was dropped
from management. Although management declined to discuss the
matter, sources suggested directors were displeased with
programming decisions.
</P>
<P>
   In April, a talk show host and volunteer disc jockey were
removed after they violated station policy by discussing the Sawaya
issue on the air.
</P>
<P>
   On July 13, ``Flashpoints'' talk show host Dennis Bernstein was
forcibly removed from the studio as he protested his suspension for
discussing the Sawaya removal on his show. Police in riot gear were
called to the studio to clear it of demonstrators. More than 50
people were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Pacifica officials, deeming the protester-surrounded studio too
dangerous to operate, then padlocked the doors and replaced live
programming with tapes. The first offering was a Marxist-Maoist
analysis of the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``This looks like ethnic cleansing to me,'' Bernstein said last
week as he ``broadcast'' his program through a public address
system set up at the closed station. ``Sawaya was Lebanese. Here we
had a Lebanese woman who brought in an African-American assistant.
Pacifica says it wants diversity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here was a woman who was bringing in diversity. She was going
like a steam roller ... This looks like a hostile takeover to me.
Here at Pacifica, I thought we were speaking truth to power. In
reality, they were using power to fight truth.''

 &HT;    Morning TV heats up with `Later Today'
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ How many cooking demonstrations can Atlantans
watch in one morning?
</P>
<P>
   You'll find out at 9 a.m. Sept. 7, when NBC debuts ``Later
Today,'' a women-oriented news and issues program. It comes on
right after NBC's ``Today'' show and right before ``Peachtree
Morning'' on WXIA, Atlanta's NBC affiliate.
</P>
<P>
   ``At what point does it become saturated? That's an open
question,'' allowed Jeff Zucker, who'll oversee both ``Today'' and
``Later Today.'' ``We'll see. This kind of programming will be on
in Atlanta from 7 to 11 (a.m.). Hopefully it'll work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Later Today'' is NBC's attempt to build on the success of
``Today,'' right down to the borrowed title (``It's like `Today'
only later'' is the promotional line you'll soon be hearing). It
comes at a time when early morning TV is about to become more
competitive than perhaps it's ever been, with both ABC and CBS
ramping up their shows to cut into the big lead held by ``Today.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Later Today'' is essentially an extension of what ``Today''
does during its last half-hour, when news is ratcheted down and
replaced with a mix of entertainment and issue-related segments,
including health, parenting, fashion and ... those cooking
demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   There will be no formal news summaries during ``Later Today''
(and there won't be a weather-
</P>
<P>
   person), but big news will be covered when it breaks out.
</P>
<P>
   Three women host it: Jodi Applegate, an NBC weekend anchor and
MSNBC daytime anchor; Asha Blake, who anchored at a Los Angeles
station; and Florence Henderson, ``The Brady Bunch's'' mom, who
also worked on ``Today'' from 1959-60 as the ``Today Girl,''
conducting interviews, hosting segments and singing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's only the three of us _ I consider ourselves `The
Few,''' Applegate joked, a reference to the couchful of women on
ABC's ``The View.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're staking out a little new ground, but a lot of things are
what you see on the second hour of `Today,''' Applegate added.
``We're not reinventing the wheel. We're just shifting the focus.
We can be a little bit sassier, looser.''
</P>
<P>
   Applegate will open the show from outside the ``Today'' studio
window, but the rest of the program will take place in an enclosed
studio with a live audience. Zucker said the music acts that
sometimes end ``Today'' often play another 25 minutes off the air,
and ``Later Today'' will sometimes show that. Sometimes guests or
segments that were limited on ``Today'' will appear again on
``Later.''
</P>
<P>
   The show was not conceived as a third hour of ``Today,'' but
rather, Zucker said, as that show's ``cousin.'' Having three women
host was a conscious decision, Zucker added, since women viewers
outnumber men at that hour about 3-to-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't mean we won't have men running through,'' he said.
``A male point of view will be heard, but not necessarily on a
daily basis.''
</P>
<P>
   NEW FALL TV SEASON
</P>
<P>
   Exec discusses diversity
</P>
<P>
   It was NBC West Coast chief Scott Sassa's turn to address the
network diversity issue at the TV critics tour in Pasadena on
Thursday. ``This issue is a personal and business concern,'' said
Sassa, who's Asian-American. ``I don't know that I'm qualified to
tell you how African-Americans feel about how they're portrayed on
TV. And I don't think I'm capable of telling you how Latinos feel
about how they're portrayed. But I can tell you how I feel about
seeing Asian-Americans portrayed on TV. And I've got to tell you,
growing up, seeing David Carradine (on ``Kung Fu'') as a Chinese
guy pissed you off.'' As with the other networks, NBC has come
under fire from the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People for lack of diversity in its fall lineup.
</P>
<P>
   The news at NBC
</P>
<P>
   NBC plans to air a ``Homicide: Life on the Street'' movie later
this year. The only holdup is whether the series' co-executive
producer, Tom Fontana, can lock in enough of the most prominent
cast members, including Andre Braugher, for the movie. ``For loyal
`Homicide' fans, it will be some closure they didn't get,'' said
NBC entertainment head Garth Ancier. ... Also in development at
NBC, as a series: ``Not the Bradys,'' from Keenan Ivory Wayans. The
mixed-race takeoff on the old icon will feature a black husband,
white wife and four kids from previous marriages. No word on
whether there'll only be one bathroom. ...
</P>
<P>
   Michael Michele, who turned heads at the ``Homicide'' station
house last season, is yet another new face joining ``ER.'' She'll
play second-year resident Dr. Cleo Finch. Another ``Homicide'' ex,
</P>
<P>
   Richard Belzer, reprises his role as Detective John Munch on
``Law &AMP; Order: Special Victims Unit.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   Other ``ER'' newcomers just announced: Maura Tierney
(``NewsRadio''), Ming-Na (``The Joy Luck Club'') and Croatian actor
Goran Visnjic. With the addition of recurring regulars Alan Alda
and Rebecca De Mornay, it's one crowded ER this season. ... Lots
going on at ``Suddenly Susan,'' too: The magazine becomes a sports
mag, and joining the cast are Eric Idle (``Monty Python''), Sherri
Shepherd (``Everybody Loves Raymond''), Currie Graham (``Money for
Nothing'') and Rob Estes (``Melrose Place''). ...
</P>
<P>
   Jesse L. Martin (Ally McBeal's doomed love interest) joins ``Law
&AMP; Order'' as Lenny Briscoe's (Jerry Orbach) partner, replacing
Benjamin Bratt. ... Tim Matheson joins NBC's ``The West Wing,'' a
new drama set in the White House from ``ER'' producer John Wells
and Aaron Sorkin (``Sports Night,'' ``A Few Good Men''). Matheson
plays the vice president. Martin Sheen is prez. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Third Watch,'' a drama from Wells, premieres Sept. 23 in
``ER's'' time slot, then settles into its regular home at 8 p.m.
Sept. 26. ``ER'' starts Sept. 30, a week after the rest of the
lineup. ... Conan O'Brien will do his show for a week in Los
Angeles, beginning Nov. 9.

   WASHINGTON _ Of all the tax cuts debated so hotly in Congress
this week, one has been raised above the rest as an outrageous
burden: the so-called ``marriage penalty,'' attacked by Republicans
as an unjust levy on those who tie the knot.
</P>
<P>
   It is a popular conservative foil, crystallizing the claim that
taxes are a drain on family values. Under current tax law, some 20
million married couples pay more than they would if they were
single.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike much of the controversy over taxes, the marriage
penalty debate is not just a partisan battle or a clash of economic
philosophy. It is a genuine mathematical puzzle _ one that has
confounded legislators since the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The ``marriage penalty'' stems from the fact that within a group
of married couples with identical incomes, the shares earned by
different wives and husbands can vary dramatically. Among families
with a joint income of $50,000, for instance, one husband-wife team
may contribute $25,000 each, while in another household one spouse
makes $40,000 and the other $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   In our progressive tax system _ in which rich people pay more
proportionally than the poor _ there is no feasible way to have the
members of married couples pay the same amount as they would if
they were single while simultaneously ensuring that all the married
couples in that income class pay equal amounts of taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the intrinsically skewed nature of tax brackets,
someone always pays an unfair share.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can never solve it,'' said Dan Feenberg, an analyst for
the National Bureau for Economic Research in Cambridge, Mass.
``There's no technical fix to this. It's always going to be a
matter of balancing values.''
</P>
<P>
   June E. O'Neill, director of the Congressional Budget Office,
told the House Ways and Means committee last year that because of
the competing interests of fairness and family, there is a
``continuing tension within the tax code.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the one hand, the tax code seeks to levy the same tax with
the same income. On the other hand, it tries to minimize the effect
of marriage on a couple's tax liability,'' she said. ``A tax
structure with progressive rates cannot attain both goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Individuals have paid income tax since 1913, but the debate over
how to handle married couples did not burst onto the national scene
until 1948, after the income tax had been expanded to cover a great
number of taxpayers. Married couples began to issue a complaint
similar to that today: that they were paying more than people who
filed taxes alone.
</P>
<P>
   Congress responded with a law that doubled the number of tax
brackets for married people _ a provision that meant married
couples would not shift into a higher tax bracket simply because
their combined income equalled a greater dollar amount. The new law
favored stay-at-home moms, whose husbands paid less in taxes than
their single counterparts. That fix worked until the 1960s, when
single people suddenly noticed they were paying as much as 40
percent more than their married counterparts _ an inequity that
particularly upset widows and unmarried couples.
</P>
<P>
   To swing the pendulum back the other way, Congress issued new
tax tables in 1969 to lower the so-called ``penalties'' for single
people. In the process, the lawmakers created a penalty for married
individuals. It did not affect many couples _ fewer than 15 percent
in 1971 _ and yet it underscored the tension between trying to tax
married couples and individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Economists note that Congress' efforts have also created a
less-famous side-effect: a marriage ``bonus,'' in which some people
who marry suddenly drop into a lower bracket, depending on how much
they earn together and apart. According to a CBO report, some 25
million couples were getting the ``marriage bonus'' in 1996,
averaging $1,300. Only 20 million actually paid a ``marriage
penalty,'' averaging $1,380 per family.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in an election year in which each side is scrambling to
emphasize the importance of family values, the presence of any
marriage penalty at all is a natural target, especially for
tax-cutting Republicans. Senator William V. Roth, chair of the
Senate Finance Committee, gave no hint of the complexity of the
issue when he took to the Senate floor this week and said that
``American families have been suffering under the unfair burden of
the marriage tax penalty for too long.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, the Senate voted down a Democratic measure
that would have increased the standard deduction for married
people, raising it to $11,550 from the $7,200 couples can deduct
now. Two GOP measures have also been proposed. Only one is expected
to come to a vote: Roth's, which would let married couples decide
whether they want to file separately or apart _ and then let them
file on the same tax return regardless of what they chose. That
proposal would save a couple earning $100,000 approximately $1,500,
a committee spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even if the problem is ``solved'' in this legislative
season, it is unlikely to go away. ``Those,'' Feenberg said, ``are
the mathematical rules.''

MISSING ART LEAVES A GAP IN CROATIAN MUSEUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VUKOVAR, Croatia _ The cool, dark entry hall of the Gradski
Musej, the city museum here, opens onto sunny, spanking white
galleries. But plenty is wrong with this picture.
</P>
<P>
   The trees outside the windows are charred and dying. Some doors
out of the galleries open onto rooms in ruin.
</P>
<P>
   Most importantly, there are no pictures, at least none of the
historic oil paintings with Croatian religious and cultural themes
that were the heart of the museum's collection before the 1991 war
of Croatian independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The museum was shelled and caught fire,'' says Ruza Maric, its
director. ``Some roofs fell in, and one part of the collection was
destroyed. Just before the war, we packed the most valuable pieces
and stored them in the cellars of the Franciscan monastery, but
after the fall of the city these were found and transported to Novi
Sad,'' across the Danube from Vukovar in the Serbian province of
Vojvodina.
</P>
<P>
   The near-destruction of Vukovar made its residents' last stand
one of the enduring horror stories of the war. Now, a year and a
half after the city's return to Croatian sovereignty, repair
workers have replaced most of the radiators, the steam lines, the
electric cables that the Serbs stripped from the museum walls. But
the continuing absence of the collection makes this a truly hollow
restoration. On its walls hang only contemporary works donated by
artists across Europe who heard of the museum's plight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We learned from Belgrade TV that our collection was taken to
Novi Sad, and the minister of culture of Croatia wrote the minister
of culture of Serbia to ask for its return,'' Maric says. ``He
responded that our letter was a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   Through UNICEF and UNESCO, the Croatians were able to compile
lists of Vukovar pieces found in Novi Sad and other Serbian cities,
but nothing has been returned.
</P>
<P>
   Vukovar residents also discovered plans, created by the Serbs
during their four-year rule, to knock down the city's few surviving
baroque buildings and replace them with buildings in the Byzantine
style.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought when the first shell hit that it was the height of
human perversion to damage such beauty,'' Maric says. ``But it was
only the beginning.''

DISCREPANCY IN REIMBURSEMENT RATES FUELS DEBATE AMONG TEACHING
HOSPITALS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When an aspiring doctor does his residency at Beth
Israel Medical Hospital in New York City, the institution receives
more than $57,000 annually from Medicare to defray the cost of
training.
</P>
<P>
   But if the same resident were to train at Houston's Memorial
Hermann Hospital, the Medicare program would pay the Texas hospital
$6,924.
</P>
<P>
   The vast discrepancy in reimbursement rates for
doctors-in-training by the federal health insurance program for the
elderly has long been a sore subject among teaching hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   And the wounds were reopened recently when the New England
Journal of Medicine ran a story that highlighted the vast
differences in how teaching hospitals are treated by Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal study, based on 1996 Medicare cost reports, placed
several pre-eminent New York City teaching hospitals at the top of
the pack in terms of residency reimbursement. Texas hospitals,
meanwhile, ranked at the bottom of the list.
</P>
<P>
   In between fell hospitals from Boston, Philadelphia, Atlanta,
Seattle, New Haven, Conn., North Carolina and California.
</P>
<P>
   Since Medicare was created in 1964, it has helped subsidize
resident training under the assumption that the elderly patients
enrolled in the government program should have access to high
quality teaching hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 direct Medicare payments to teaching hospitals for
residency training nationwide amounted to $2.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   While hospital officials say that residency training costs can
vary somewhat between geographic regions, they are not as great as
those reflected in the Medicare payments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not eight times more expensive in New York than Houston,
Texas,'' said Jeff Brownawell, vice president of managed care and
government reporting at Memorial Hermann Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, say Brownawell and others, is that Medicare is
still relying on an inflexible and outdated 1984 formula.
</P>
<P>
   The formula allowed hospitals to take several factors into
consideration in coming up with residency costs. Those factors
included the number of days Medicare patients spent at the hospital
as well as residents' salaries and the costs for faculty
supervision.
</P>
<P>
   However, when the funding formula was initially devised,
hospitals were given a certain amount of leeway in determining what
they could include in residents' costs.
</P>
<P>
   Many New York City hospitals included the cost of faculty
supervision in their assessments while Texas hospitals such as
Hermann did not, under the assumption that those costs should be
attributed to the medical schools.
</P>
<P>
   Once the formula was in place, hospitals could not change what
went into their residents' costs even after many discovered that
they may have been shortchanged by not including faculty
supervision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you got locked into that rule you couldn't make any
changes,'' Brownawell said.
</P>
<P>
   Brownawell noted that the initial guidelines of what constituted
residency costs were arbitrary. So arbitrary, he noted, that today
there is even a variation among Houston hospitals as to how much
they receive from Medicare for resident training.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Harris County Hospital District receives $2,815
less per resident annually than Hermann, even though they are
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   With the Clinton administration and some in Congress lobbying
for Medicare reform this year, there is some hope that the issue of
how teaching hospitals are reimbursed for training future doctors
will be revisited.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is something needs to be done,'' said Houston
Democratic Rep. Ken Bentsen, whose district encompasses the Texas
Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Bentsen is co-sponsoring a bill that would ensure more
uniformity in payments. The bill calls for Medicare to come up with
a payment system based on an average training cost for residents.
That Medicare reimbursements, however, would be modified for each
institution based on cost of living and wage factors in different
cities.
</P>
<P>
   A Medicare reform plan proposed earlier this year by Sen. John
Breaux, D-La., and Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., would have removed
Medicare from the business of subsidizing resident training.
Instead, teaching hospitals would be reimbursed as part of the
annual appropriations process.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years there have been various efforts to change the
distribution method.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its failed 1994 comprehensive health plan, the
Clinton administration proposed shifting to national average
payments for teaching hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   But the New York congressional delegation, led by Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., has successfully fended off proposals
that would hurt the state's teaching hospitals. And with first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton expected to run for Moynihan's seat in New
York in 2000, there is little likelihood that the Clinton
administration will push any plan that would jeopardize payments to
teaching hospitals there.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the teaching hospitals have devoted most of
their lobbying efforts to fighting efforts to slash overall
Medicare funding for their institutions rather than pushing for a
reorganizing of payments.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the teaching hospitals are lobbying Congress to
restore some of the cuts resulting from the 1997 balanced budget
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Dickler, senior vice president at the American Association
of Medical Colleges, the lobbying group for the teaching hospitals,
agreed that the disparity in Medicare costs did not reflect cost
differentials in training physicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The costs of graduate education are not that disparate,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Dickler also said he did not agree with suggestions that all
teaching hospitals should receive an average reimbursement rate.
Dickler said that some hospitals devote more faculty to resident
training than others.
</P>
<P>
   And he said that his association was not focused on closing the
gap on Medicare payments to teaching hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not one that has been a top priority,'' he said. ``Our
top priority is to try and moderate the balanced budget
provisions.''

CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR ABANDONS IMMIGRATION MEASURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By EVELYN NIEVES    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The landmark 1994 ballot referendum that barred
illegal immigrants and their children from receiving services such
as a public education and became one of the most contentious
political issues in California history, was declared all but dead
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gray Davis, striking a deal with opponents of the
initiative, Proposition 187, after three months of mediation, has
agreed to drop an appeal of a federal court's ruling that found
much of the measure unconstitutional. In turn, the opponents of
Proposition 187, who had blocked the measure in the courts for five
years, agreed to drop all legal challenges against the state.
</P>
<P>
   The pact, which the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals must
approve, permanently bars Proposition 187's core provisions,
including those that prevented illegal immigrants from attending
public schools and receiving social services and health care.
</P>
<P>
   It also voids the requirements that local law enforcement
authorities, school administrators and social and medical workers
turn in suspected illegal immigrants to federal and state
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   All that is left of Proposition 187 are two minor laws that
establish state criminal penalties for creating, using and selling
false documents to conceal illegal immigration status.
</P>
<P>
   Davis stressed Thursday that while itself Proposition 187 might
have been voided, much of its intent was covered by the federal
immigration laws passed in 1996, which like the proposition, denied
illegal immigrants access to most social services. ``The agreement
that has been reached over the months essentially embraces the
spirit of Proposition 187,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But members of civil rights organizations that mounted the
challenge to Proposition 187 under the umbrella of the League of
United Latin American Citizens, were jubilant Thursday, while
proponents of the initiative bitterly complained that Davis was
ignoring the will of the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are so pleased that we can put this ugly chapter behind us
in California,'' said Ramona Ripston, executive director of the
American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California, which held a
news conference Thursday with the Mexican American Legal Defense
and Education Fund to celebrate what they called the end of
divisive politics in California.
</P>
<P>
   But Sharon Browne, a lawyer with the Pacific Legal Foundation in
Sacramento, which helped draft Proposition 187, said that although
another appeal is unlikely, the battle over the initiative ``may
not be over.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have new parties, new plaintiffs, new lawsuits,'' she
said. ``Clearly the agreement represents the position of two
parties who felt the same way. Proposition 187 never really had a
chance because there was no one representing it. The losers in this
case are the people who voted for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 187, the centerpiece of Republican Gov. Pete
Wilson's re-election campaign in 1994, became a national symbol of
anger over illegal immigration. It was also an awakening for
Latinos in California, who had yet to realize their potential for
political clout.
</P>
<P>
   Passage of the measure galvanized Hispanic residents, 77 percent
of whom voted against it, as well as many civil rights groups. In
Los Angeles, it led to one of the largest protests in state
history.
</P>
<P>
   And along with Proposition 209, which banned affirmative action
by the government, and Proposition 227, which ended bilingual
education, Proposition 187 is considered largely responsible for
ending the Republican Party's 16-year hold on the governor's office
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who won the election against the Republican attorney
general, Dan Lungren, by a 20-point margin, had campaigned as an
opponent of Proposition 187 and pledged not to enforce the
provisions that would prohibit 270,000 children from receiving a
public education. But once in office, he decided not to drop the
state's appeal of a ruling last year in U.S. District Court in Los
Angeles that found Proposition 187 unconstitutional because it
conflicted with federal authority in immigration law.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, in one of the first important political tests of his
administration, one month before a May deadline to continue or drop
the appeal, Davis took what those on both sides of the issue called
a mushy middle ground. He asked the federal appeals court to
mediate the dispute over the ballot measure.
</P>
<P>
   In asking for mediation, Davis said that although he opposed
Proposition 187, he was sensitive to the will of the five million
Californians who voted for the measure.
</P>
<P>
   But proponents of the proposition, who unsuccessfully tried to
enter the case as parties, both in U.S. District Court and at the
outset of the appeal, said that the mediation meant that two
opponents of Proposition 187 would decide its merits. Opponents
said that it gave credibility to an unconscionable measure.
</P>
<P>
   The political fallout included a rift between Davis and Lt. Gov.
Cruz Bustamante, who issued public statements rebuking Davis'
efforts to reach a compromise. Bustamante, an outspoken opponent of
Proposition 187, even filed a friend-of-the-court brief aimed at
blocking the governor's efforts to mediate.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, sheriffs in half a dozen counties with large immigrant
populations, who would have been responsible for enforcing
Proposition 187, praised Davis for reaching an agreement,
especially one that retained criminal penalties for illegal
documents but ended the ban on public education for illegal
immigrant children.
</P>
<P>
   Bustamante, in a telephone interview, also praised the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is clearly a great day for mending what was a very dark
period in California politics that was anti-immigrant and highly
charged,'' he said, ``and this will in fact close the door and
start a new chapter.''

MARRIAGE PENALTY': PROBLEM WITHOUT SOLUTION

CLINTON ORDERED TO PAY NEARLY $90,000 TO JONES' LAWYERS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ark., Texas)  (rk) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In what could be the final chapter in Paula Jones'
sexual misconduct lawsuit, a federal judge Thursday ordered
President Clinton to pay nearly $90,000 to Ms. Jones' lawyers in
compensation for extra work they performed due to the president's
false testimony about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The amount was far less than the $496,000 sought by the Jones
lawyers, and Clinton, through his lawyer, said he would agree to
pay the amount specified by Judge Susan Webber Wright Thursday in
Little Rock, Ark. One of the lawyers for Mrs. Jones said he might
appeal Wright's decision as to the amount.
</P>
<P>
   Determining the size of Clinton's financial penalties has been
the only remaining issue in Mrs. Jones' lawsuit charging Clinton
with sexual misconduct while he was governor of Arkansas. The
lawsuit, which was settled last year with Clinton paying her
$850,000 but not admitting guilt, led to the disclosure of the
president's efforts to hide his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky and
eventually to his impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The financial penalty is part of the unprecedented finding of
contempt of court against a president of the United States by a
federal judge. Wright ruled in April that the president had been in
contempt for knowingly lying about his relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky when questioned by Mrs. Jones' lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court takes no pleasure in imposing contempt sanctions
against this nation's president and, no doubt like many others,
grows weary of this matter,'' Wright said in her 19-page ruling
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nevertheless, the court has determined that the president
deliberately violated this court's discovery orders, thereby
undermining the integrity of the judicial system, and that
sanctions must be imposed to redress the president's misconduct and
to deter others who might consider emulating the president's
misconduct,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When he was deposed here by Mrs. Jones' lawyers in January 1998
in Wright's presence, Clinton denied that he had engaged in sexual
relations with Ms. Lewinsky and that he had ever been alone with
her but for a fleeting moment.
</P>
<P>
   After Clinton acknowledged last August an improper physical
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky while she was a White House intern,
Wright reacted angrily, saying she would consider whether his
behavior might constitute contempt of court.
</P>
<P>
   When Wright finally ruled in April that he had been in contempt,
she ordered Clinton to pay the court $1,202 in costs to compensate
the government for her travel costs to Washington to preside over
his false testimony. She also ordered the president to pay Mrs.
Jones' lawyers for any extra costs they incurred due to his false
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Since that ruling, the president's lawyers and those for Mrs.
Jones have been wrangling over how much he owed.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bennett, Clinton's principal attorney, had estimated the
costs to be no more than $33,000. He said Thursday, ``We accept the
judgment of the court and will comply with it.'' White House
officials said that the president's lawyers were examining whether
the president's legal defense fund could be used to pay the costs.
</P>
<P>
   John Whitehead, the head of the Rutherford Institute, a private
conservative group that had paid Mrs. Jones' legal expenses, said
he was disappointed with Wright's decision as to the amount. But he
said he was pleased that ``the bottom line philosophy shows that in
the end not even a president can get away with lying before a
federal judge.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitehead said he was considering an appeal although it is
widely believed that such an effort would face great obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   Wright criticized as excessive the submissions by Whitehead and
that of the Dallas law firm of Rader, Campbell, Fisher &AMP; Pike,
which represented Mrs. Jones.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas law firm, which had sought nearly $438,000, was
awarded $79,999. Whitehead, who had sought more than $58,000 on
behalf of the Rutherford Institute, was awarded $9,484.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The judge said the lawyers were entitled only to fees and
expenses for the period beginning Dec. 23, 1997, when Clinton first
lied about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky by giving false
written answers.
</P>
<P>
   She also calculated a portion of the amount owed the lawyers by
agreeing with estimates that about 20 percent of the president's
Jan. 17, 1998, deposition dealt with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Jones had charged that in 1991, while Clinton was the
governor of Arkansas and she was a state clerical employee, he had
her summoned to a Little Rock hotel room where he made a coarse
sexual proposition. Clinton denied the account, although he
acknowledged he might have had Mrs. Jones brought to the room for
an innocent introduction.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton sought to have the case quashed, but the Supreme Court
in 1997 unanimously ruled that the president was subject to civil
litigation even in office.
</P>
<P>
   At the deposition, Clinton was asked about his relationship with
Ms. Lewinsky, a former White House intern. Clinton testified, ``I
have never had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has contended that his denial of a sexual relationship
with Ms. Lewinsky was ``legally accurate'' under a definition that
Wright had approved. But Wright ruled that Clinton's admission last
August of ``inappropriate'' conduct with Ms. Lewinsky had left it
beyond dispute that he gave false testimony in his January
deposition.
</P>
<P>
   Wright ultimately dismissed Mrs. Jones' lawsuit in April 1998,
saying that the president's behavior, while boorish, did not meet
the standard of sexual harassment under federal law.
</P>
<P>
   In Thursday's opinion, Wright repeated her view that the issue
of Clinton's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky was not central to the
sexual harassment case.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Wright has also referred the matter to the Professional
Conduct Committee of the Arkansas Supreme Court, which has the
power to revoke Clinton's license to practice law or to impose
other sanctions on him.

SERB RELIGIOUS ART BEING DESTROYED ALONG WITH CULTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX TODOROVIC AND CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MUSUTISTE, Yugoslavia _ A bent cross and a heap of rubble lie
where the church stood for nearly seven centuries, on the grounds
of a Serbian Orthodox monastery in this village 13 miles from
Kosovo's capital.
</P>
<P>
   Irretrievably lost in the debris are priceless frescoes by an
unknown 14th century artist who distinguished himself with broad
strokes of white, a bold move in his day. Also gone from the
Dormition of Mother of God Church are early 17th century icons of
Christ and the Virgin Mary.
</P>
<P>
   Destruction of Serb religious and cultural artifacts and
monuments still is occurring, two months after NATO wrested control
of Serbia's southernmost province from the regime in Belgrade. The
threat persists even as world leaders gather in Sarajevo today
(July 30) to forge a strategy for reconstructing the ravaged
region.
</P>
<P>
   Andras Riedlmayer, a Harvard University specialist on the art
and architecture of the Balkans, says the pillage must be seen as
yet another incarnation of the ethnic cleansing that has decimated
the once-polyglot culture of the region throughout the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you destroy the cultural institutions, the houses of
worship and cemeteries that proved people were there in the first
place, you can then proceed to claiming they were never there,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   There are no more Serbs in Musutiste. Almost daily, the houses
they fled are being burned, and local Albanians are in no mood to
discuss the destruction of the church. A Globe reporter and
photographer were detained and questioned by former Kosovo
Liberation Army soldiers for taking pictures there, and a roll of
film was confiscated.
</P>
<P>
   To Albanians, such destruction is simple tit for tat, to be
expected in a village where Serbs expelled the local Muslims and
trashed their mosque before the tide of war turned.
</P>
<P>
   To Serbs, it is a resumption of anti-Serb violence which they
say far predates the rise of Slobodan Milosevic as a nationalist
leader, a continuation of a decades-long effort to erase them from
a piece of the Serb heartland which, even before the recent war,
had become 90 percent ethnic Albanian and Muslim.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame that the people who are destroying our religious
sites cannot differentiate a misguided regime from people who have
lived here peacefully for centuries,'' said Father Teodosije, the
head monk at the 14th century Decani monastery, where Serbian
Orthodox monks now live surrounded by Italian troops from the UN
peacekeeping force, KFOR.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever the context, the destruction is a tragedy to
Western scholars, art historians, and archaeologists.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the frescos and architecture of these medieval
churches are masterpieces,'' said James Wiseman, an archaeologist
and art historian at Boston University who specializes in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a style developed in Kosovo and just to the north in
southern Serbia. . . that reflects the cultural influences in the
region from the second half of the 12th century through most of the
14th century,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The style combines a Romanesque exterior construction and
decoration around doors and windows with an eastern-style building
plan style and way of developing interior spaces _ a true meeting
of East and West. ``The fresco paintings,'' Wiseman said, ``are
more Byzantine.''
</P>
<P>
   So, too, are the politics and propaganda surrounding this issue.
</P>
<P>
   Like many Western specialists in the art and architecture of the
region, Riedlmayer criticizes the Serbs for the initial acts of
cultural destruction, which now are being avenged.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this province in modern times, the majority of the
population was non-Serb,'' Riedlmayer said. ``The presence of
Serbian monuments and cultural properties provided Belgrade's
pretext for the repression of Kosovo.... This was very much used by
Milosevic in his rise to power.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he stressed that he is not critical of Serb efforts to
publicize the current destruction, and is pleased that the former
KLA soldiers who detained the Globe team were bothered that foreign
journalists were looking into the destruction of the church.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad to see these things publicized,'' he said. ``Once it
is well understood that every time you do this you are damaging
your own cause, there will be less of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The war on art and architecture in the former Yugoslavia began
in 1991, said Bonnie Burnham, president of the New York-based World
Monuments Fund, ``when the Serbs attacked cultural property in
Croatia back in '91 _ shelling Dubrovnik and other towns on the
coast, and, especially, destroying Vukovar, where they were
deliberately targeting buildings rather than people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next major milestone was the destruction of the
(internationally renowned white limestone) Mostar bridge by the
Croats,'' she said. ``This became a mode of warfare. Certainly the
Croats retaliated against the Serbs. When the Serbs started
shelling Croat churches, the Croats turned around and shelled the
Orthodox churches.... Nobody's hands are clean, that's for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian monasteries are treasures, she said, but so, too,
were some of the mosques razed in Bosnia and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   While people think of Spain, Istanbul and Damascus as the loci
of great Islamic architecture, builders sent out in the glory days
of the Ottoman Empire evolved an intimate, country-style mosque in
the Balkans that deeply influenced the development of the region's
cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was particularly important was the co-mingling,'' Burnham
said. ``It was a wonderful fabric to behold.''
</P>
<P>
   Serbian Orthodox officials strongly dispute the idea that
actions against cultural and religious targets are a phenomenon
arising from the disintegration of Yugoslavia at the hands of
warring nationalities in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, ``Albanian extremists set fire to the Serbian
patriarchate in Pec,'' said Father Aleksandar Vlajkovic of St. Sava
Serbian Orthodox Church in Wakefield, Mass. ``Part of the complex
was burned to the ground. Milosevic was not in power yet; it was
just after Tito's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recently we heard of three days of mistreatment of nuns by the
KLA and the desecration of the Devic,'' he said. ``NATO said it was
revenge, but that monastery was attacked several times in the '70s
and '80s by Albanian extremists who were trying to frighten Serbian
people and get them to leave the area. Our current patriarch,
Pavle, had his arm broken when he was bishop...
</P>
<P>
   ``These are events we do not forget, and when someone says today
that these are revenge for what Serbian soldiers did to albanians,
I do not agree,'' Vlajkovic said.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the various versions of history, the scholars
plead for the United Nations to stop the destruction now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a scandal,'' Riedlmayer said, ``that the UN, which was
supposed to set up civilian police, has yet to do so. KFOR is a
military force and is not really trained for these functions.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ The government's decision to take charge of
the overhaul of Daewoo, South Korea's second-largest and
most-troubled business agglomeration, has pushed skepticism about
the country's commitment to economic restructuring to the
forefront.
</P>
<P>
   In ordering Daewoo's creditors to roll over $5.8 billion in
loans and provide a further $3.3 billion, the government prevented
a default on short-term loans, a lot of that owed to a
government-sponsored lending agency.
</P>
<P>
   That move may have avoided wider turmoil, as a default by Daewoo
would have sent painful ripples through the economy. It can be read
as a last-ditch effort to impose restructuring on a business group
that has thus far managed to avoid reform in a country where
free-market forces still struggle to assert their influence.
</P>
<P>
   But the government's actions can also be seen as the biggest
sign of the backsliding, damaging the veneer of economic
rejuvenation in Korea, one of Asia's most thriving economies before
the region's financial crisis began two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The support for Daewoo was an eerie reminder of the old order of
things, when government-directed lending and politics, not market
forces, determined the winners and losers in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   President Kim Dae Jung, the former political prisoner whose
ascent to power last year was spurred by the economic crisis, took
office with promises to overhaul the economy and the business
practices blamed for contributing to South Korea's near-disaster.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of his first year in office in February, South Korea
had become the model of efficacy for the harsh economic austerity
measures required by international lending agencies. The economy is
expected to grow 6.5 percent this year, unemployment has retreated,
the currency has stabilized and the stock market is up sharply.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, however, Kim seems distracted from his reform
agenda by politics, and the forces that have opposed him from the
start _ the five large chaebol, as South Korea's powerful,
family-controlled business conglomerates are known, and the
nation's bureaucracy _ have moved quickly to exploit the situation.
</P>
<P>
   He is busy trying to buttress his party to win parliament
elections next April. A number of his top economic advisers have
fallen victim to charges of corruption. His policy of using private
business, primarily the biggest conglomerate, Hyundai, to promote
ties with North Korea is seen by some here as increasingly naive.
</P>
<P>
   ``My impression is that the reform led by Kim Dae Jung is at a
crossroads,'' said Hyun Hong Choo, a lawyer and former politician.
``He can go either way: He can continue to pursue the reform he
laid out when he was elected, or he can buckle to political
pressures and either retreat or simply stall, creating further
confusion.''
</P>
<P>
   These are among the increasing signs of backsliding:
</P>
<P>
   _ The sale of two large banks nationalized in the aftermath of
the economic crisis has stalled.
</P>
<P>
   _ The government's promise to sell state-controlled businesses
has been undermined because bidders balk at paying prices they
consider excessive.
</P>
<P>
   _ Efforts to streamline the conglomerates have been thwarted,
with the two strongest, Samsung and Hyundai, openly defying the
government.
</P>
<P>
   _ Many conglomerates have used accounting gimmicks as well as a
rush of investment from enthusiastic foreigners and mutual funds
they control to mask the size of their debts.
</P>
<P>
   While conceding that such signs are ominous, Kim's supporters
say he is keenly aware that doubts are surging. There are also
signs that reforms are taking hold. Both Commerzbank of Germany and
Goldman, Sachs have successfully invested in South Korean banks.
Royal Phillips Electronics of the Netherlands recently announced an
investment equivalent to $1.6 billion, the largest ever by a
foreign company in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government is also worried about the slowing of the
momentum,'' said You Jong Keun, governor of North Cholla province
and until recently one of President Kim's top economic advisers.
``That's why the president has kept up the pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Others say there were bound to be some relapses, given the scope
of the president's ambitions and how deeply they are intended to
attack the status quo. ``I can see some grounds for criticism, but
at the same time, the ground has been laid, and the momentum is
inevitable,'' said Oh Ho Gen, executive chairman of the Corporate
Restructuring Committee, the agency charged with overseeing
corporate reform.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the government no longer lets healthy businesses
guarantee debts of weak affiliates. It has also curbed corporate
debt issuance and toughened accounting requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the greatest quandary lies in overall monetary policy.
Rejecting the advice of some of its own economists, the government
has lowered the high interest rates it imposed as part of a $58
billion bailout by the International Monetary Fund. That has helped
fuel the economic recovery, but it has also made it less expensive
for the conglomerates to raise money and thus diminished the
pressure for financial restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   Change is obvious at smaller conglomerates. Hanwha group, a
major military contractor, for example, has sold major assets,
formed alliances with foreign investors and reduced its
debt-to-equity ratio to 2-to-1 from 12-to-1. Hanwha, once the
11th-largest conglomerate, is now ``somewhere in the middle,'' said
Lee Yong Ho, the managing director over the group's restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue to look at ourselves and if there's something
we need to do, we'll do it,'' he said.

SEOUL, South Korea: he said.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The biggest conglomerates with the best political connections,
like Daewoo, have not found themselves bereft of credit, which was
the critical factor in pushing their smaller counterparts to
change.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials contend that Daewoo and Hanwha are
different because Daewoo's tentacles extend so deep into the South
Korean economy that to allow it to founder would derail the
country's recovery. They note that the intervention they mounted
was attached to several strings, including sweeping asset sales and
a pledge by Daewoo's chairman and founder, Kim Woo Choong, to use
part of his own fortune to reduce the group's $47.5 billion debt.
</P>
<P>
   But oddly, the government has said that Daewoo should keep its
most prized business, auto manufacturing, although that would be
the easiest to sell. The reasons behind this apparent inconsistency
help explain why South Korea's biggest chaebol remain a potent
political force.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daewoo is the eye of the storm,'' said Jung Tae Soo, the
director of the Seoul office of Arthur D. Little Inc., the
management consultant.
</P>
<P>
   President Kim and the ruling parties want Daewoo to take over
the assembly line of Samsung Motors, currently under bankruptcy
protection. Samsung's production facility is in Pusan province in
the south, an opposition stronghold. With an election pending, the
president and his fragile coalition cannot afford the job losses
from a Samsung plant closing.
</P>
<P>
   That consideration is widely believed to be behind Daewoo's
reprieve. ``Samsung Motors is located in Pusan, and that means a
lot,'' Jung said. ``Business decisions are not made on business
rationales.''
</P>
<P>
   The Daewoo crisis may have been created partly by the skillful
maneuvering of the Samsung group, the third-largest chaebol, and
its chairman, Lee Kun Hee.
</P>
<P>
   The government had pushed Samsung into negotiations with Daewoo
earlier this year. Samsung was to acquire Daewoo's electronics
business, and Daewoo was to get Samsung's car company.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations did not progress smoothly, however. Samsung
Electronics, a semiconductor giant with a global investor base, had
no great desire to acquire a third-rate competitor. Daewoo was
hardly in a position to absorb Samsung Motors, which was losing
roughly $6,000 on every car it produced.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on June 30, Samsung halted the haggling and said it was
putting Samsung Motors into bankruptcy, threatening the future of
the politically sensitive Pusan plant. ``It was Samsung's decision,
not ours,'' a government official said.
</P>
<P>
   The government scrambled to put together some damage control,
stressing that Lee Kun Hee had pledged his own assets to erase
Samsung Motors' debts _ and that Daewoo was still a likely buyer
for the Pusan plant.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Samsung intended to create political turmoil may never
be disclosed. But Lee and his family will likely end up richer
because of the episode. In order to unlock the value of the
collateral he pledged, shares of Samsung Life Insurance, the
government is allowing him to take that business public. Analysts
say the publicly traded shares will be worth far more than their
face value.
</P>
<P>
   In one final act of arrogance toward the government, Samsung
recently confirmed that Samsung Life made $450 million in loans to
the Samsung car company earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   The big chaebol like Samsung ``are more of a small empire than
the government itself,'' Oh of the Corporate Restructuring
Committee said.
</P>
<P>
   Even Daewoo, the weakest of the big five, has managed to stymie
reform.
</P>
<P>
   Seven months after a deal was struck to sell Korea First Bank,
one of two banks nationalized in the aftermath of the crisis, to an
American investor group, Newbridge Capital Ltd., the bank still
belongs to the South Koreans. Speculation is rampant that the deal
has stalled because the bank is one of Daewoo's three largest
creditors, and the government is worried that Newbridge will use
aggressive Western-style tactics to recover the bank's loans.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials seem to sense some need to restore
momentum. Word in the market is that South Korea will complete the
long-delayed sale of Seoul Bank, the other bank it nationalized, to
the HSBC Corp. by Aug. 2. The government announced it would float
shares in the state-controlled gas importer, having failed to find
a buyer at its price. Some are finding solace in its stance on
Daewoo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess this is the time for the government to reaffirm its
support for reform and pursue it vigorously,'' Hyun, the former
politician, said. ``I remain rather optimistic.''

 &HT;    BellSouth introducing high-speed phone lines
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ BellSouth announced on Thursday its long-awaited entry
into the race to deliver high-speed lines to business customers.
</P>
<P>
   Using the technology known as digital subscriber lines _ DSL _
BellSouth is offering companies, government and universities five
different transmission speeds in 30 cities through BellSouth's
nine-state region.
</P>
<P>
   Key to BellSouth's strategy, the ploy is aimed at retaining
company customers by providing a broad range of cutting-edge
features.
</P>
<P>
   Faster connections make it more feasible for companies to use
videoconferencing, electronic commerce, telecommuting and links to
other branches of a company or agency.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth's service is aimed partly at heading off a host of
rivals, including upstarts like Covad Communications and Level 3,
entering its largest markets _ especially Atlanta. Competitors
attack what is probably the most lucrative piece of BellSouth's
business, offering packages of telecommunications services,
including high-speed access, to companies.
</P>
<P>
   For consumers, DSL competes with cable modems _ the high-speed
connection being gradually introduced by cable companies. The phone
companies lag in the race for consumers, but the more critical
market for BellSouth is among businesses, said analyst George
Peabody of the Aberdeen Group.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth is wise to make the move, he said. ``The
communications industry is getting more and more competitive. And
the incumbent phone companies have the most to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of BellSouth's $23 billion-a-year revenues comes on its
nine-state home turf.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth rolled out DSL to consumers last summer, an offering
that had a somewhat rocky launch, with BellSouth unable to deliver
the service to many interested customers.
</P>
<P>
   DSL's greatest advantage for the phone companies is its ability
to use existing copper lines. However, those lines can generally
not carry the same transmission rate to customers more than 18,000
feet from a central office. BellSouth has promised to steadily add
the equipment needed to extend the reach of DSL. But for
businesses, which will pay from $85 to $850 a month for DSL, the
company would likely install whatever equipment is needed to
connect a specific customer.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth's consumer DSL offers Internet access at speeds up to
1.5 megabits per second. The business offering includes a low-end
version with 768 kilobits per second starting at $85 a month, a 1.5
megabits-per-second version from $150, a 2 to 4 megabits service
for $335 and a 4 to 6 megabits version for $725. Upload speeds _
from the user to the Internet _ are typically slower. BellSouth
also offers a version in which download and upload speeds match, an
offering that would support videoconferencing, BellSouth said.
Installation for all the DSL variations is $300.

 &HT;    MindSpring signs with chat provider, e-commerce service
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ MindSpring Enterprises announced two new partners this
week to provide additional content for the MindSpring home page.
It's all part of MindSpring's previously stated plans to make its
home page more useful to its 1.2 million subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based Internet access provider has lined up popular
chat and community site Talk City to provide online chats and
events to MindSpring users.
</P>
<P>
   The California-based Talk City is one of the most popular sites
for online chats and special events. The company also designs
customized electronic community events and does online market
research for a variety of clients including Cox Interactive Media
and BellSouth. Talk City is also able to build customized chat
rooms to suit the particular needs of any Web site. (Cox
Interactive, an investor in Talk City, is owned by Cox Enterprises,
parent company of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.)
</P>
<P>
   MindSpring also announced a deal with another Web site called On
Now (www.onnow.com), which allows users to browse Internet-based
events happening in real time or to search for events up to two
weeks in advance.
</P>
<P>
   The addition of these services is part of MindSpring's
long-stated plan to make its home page more attractive to users and
potential users. The company announced plans Tuesday to step up its
marketing and advertising efforts to attract nearly one million new
subscribers by this time next year.
</P>
<P>
   For its business customers, MindSpring announced a deal on
Tuesday with the privately-held Nexchange, an Atlanta-based company
that connects buyers and sellers over a network of thousands of Web
sites, to help MindSpring business customers make more effective
use of electronic commerce on their Web sites. MindSpring also has
a deal with Norcross-based Headhunter.net that allows MindSpring
Biz customers to place job postings on the service at discounted
prices.

 &HT;    Scientific-Atlanta making purchases
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Scientific-Atlanta has announced two investments in
companies and technologies designed to speed up systems that
deliver cable TV programming to customers.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based company, one of two leading providers of
equipment and software to the cable TV industry, is continually
looking for ways to enhance its product line for the operators who
are its customers.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Scientific-Atlanta has agreed to invest $13 million
in Bookham Technology, which makes a manufacturing process that
shrinks complex optical circuits that are ordinarily the size of a
deck of playing cards down to the size of a silicon chip.
</P>
<P>
   ``We anticipate that this technology will enable us to initiate
important performance improvements and cost reductions in our
Prisma optical products,'' said Paul Connolly, Scientific-Atlanta's
vice president of marketing and network architectures.
</P>
<P>
   Scientific-Atlanta's Prisma Optical network products are used to
send video, voice and data over fiber-optic networks, which a
growing number of cable operators are now installing.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate deal, Scientific-Atlanta said it planned to buy
the Megaflex and Photon business units of Memphis-based Thomas &AMP;
Betts.
</P>
<P>
   Terms were not disclosed, but the purchase is expected to close
within 90 days, said company officials.
</P>
<P>
   Megaflex and Photon make critical connectors and components for
analog and digital networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This acquisition will further strengthen our ability to lead
the industry with the most comprehensive fiber-optic system
architecture available for our customers,'' said Connolly.
</P>
<P>
   Scientific-Atlanta supports both current analog cable TV systems
and the new digital ones. It is pushing, however, a new digital
network called the Explorer 2000. It enables a host of new
services, including digital television, high-speed access to the
Internet and e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   The company's clients include some of the industry's biggest
operators, including Time Warner and Atlanta-based Cox
Communications.

 &HT;    GOING FOR THE GOLD: Atlanta covets `sports capital' title
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Scarlett might be getting benched in favor of the
Falcons, the Hawks, the Braves and the Thrashers.
</P>
<P>
   That is, if city promoters can convince a group of journalists
that Atlanta is the ``Sports Capital of the World.''
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Convention and Visitors Bureau, the Metro Atlanta
Chamber of Commerce and the Atlanta Sports Council will host a
four-day media update and showcase Aug. 11-14, touting the Atlanta
sports machine and its economic impact on the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not attacking places like New York and Boston as it
relates to the tradition of sports and who has the most titles,''
said Bill Howard, ACVB vice president of marketing, tourism and
communications. ``It's just one aspect of the city of Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   It could be a tough sell, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``No way can it replace New York,'' said a skeptical Leon
Carter, deputy sports editor at the New York Daily News, who has
visited Atlanta several times. ``When you talk about a city being
the sports capital of the world, then it means the Knicks cannot
come into Atlanta and have half the crowd rooting for them. ... You
have to look and see exactly how many fans go to the Hawks
basketball games and how many go to the Falcons football games. Do
they sell out those games?''
</P>
<P>
   USA Today Sports Editor Monte Lorell thought the ``Sports
Capital of the World'' billing was ``a great goal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say it's one of the sports capitals,'' said Lorell, who
was invited to the event but won't be able to attend because of
prior commitments. ``Atlanta will soon have a team in each of the
four major sports _ once the Thrashers come on _ and they have
college teams. It's at a crossroads of sorts for sports.''
</P>
<P>
   Without a doubt, the city has made some headway. The Sporting
News recently released its ranking of the 20 best cities for
sports. New York-Long Island-New Jersey captured the top spot,
followed by Dallas-Fort Worth and Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta jumped to fourth from 16th, largely because of a good
performance by the Falcons. Detroit, which was No. 1 last year,
fell to seventh.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, season ticket sales for the National
Basketball Association Hawks at the new Philips Arena are moving
slower than those for the Thrashers, joining the National Hockey
League.
</P>
<P>
   Invitations for the event were sent to about 100 journalists
from around the country, many of whom work in sports. So far, about
17 journalists have confirmed, including writers with overseas
publications and from The Wall Street Journal, the Los Angeles
Times, Southern Living and Travel Weekly, said the ACVB's Howard.
All expenses are paid, although some journalists may opt to pay a
nominal fee of $100. Others may choose to foot the entire bill.
About one-third have chosen the nominal fee, said Howard, adding
that some are local and won't need hotel and air accommodations.
</P>
<P>
   The showcase includes dinner with heavyweight boxing champ
Evander Holyfield; a Braves game; a tour of Philips Arena and a
meeting with Stan Kasten, president of the Turner Sports-owned
Braves, Hawks and Thrashers.
</P>
<P>
   Howard points to the city's hosting of several major sporting
events, including the 1996 Centennial Olympic Games, Super Bowl
XXXIV in 2000 and the Women's Final Four in 2003 as evidence of its
growing sports presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you put the total inventory of everything we have
together, it's a pretty dynamic story in terms of
accomplishments,'' he said. ``I think it's a pretty big story to
tell.''
</P>
<P>
   The hope is that journalists will spread the word that Atlanta
has the ability to host major events and enhance the city's image.
That wasn't the case in 1996, when thousands of journalists from
around the world descended on Atlanta for the Olympics and in some
cases panned the city, particularly on transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Why invite more scrutiny?
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any apologies to make,'' Howard said. ``Our
research has shown that the vast majority of consumers did not have
an unfavorable experience in Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   City promoters aren't just bent on telling a sports story.
Sports mean big business, from packing restaurants to filling hotel
rooms and airline seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have definitely, up to this point, felt the impact of the
Braves when they're in town. And with the onset of Philips Arena,
we also hope to benefit from the Thrashers and the Hawks,'' said
Charles Powell, general manager of the recently opened Embassy
Suites at Centennial Olympic Park.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympics brought in $5.1 billion. Next year's Super Bowl is
expected to have an economic impact of $250 million and the NCAA
Final Four in 2002 is expected to bring in $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   Howard said the city plans to promote its other attractions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hope people look at you as a very diverse city,'' he said.
``People don't come here for just one reason; they come here for
many reasons.''

PITTSBURGH, BOSTON LAW FIRMS TO MERGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Pittsburgh-based law firm Kirkpatrick &AMP; Lockhart will
acquire the 125-year-old Boston firm of Warner &AMP; Stackpole, the
latest in what legal industry observers say is likely to become a
frenzy of law firm mergers in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Some 35 Kirkpatrick &AMP; Lockhart lawyers who already work in
Boston will move into Warner &AMP; Stackpole's State Street offices
after the merger becomes official Aug. 1, forming a combined office
of about 80 lawyers, partners at both firms said.
</P>
<P>
   Kirkpatrick &AMP; Lockhart, with offices in Boston, Pittsburgh, New
York, Washington, D.C., Miami and Harrisburg, Pa., will have about
500 lawyers after the merger.
</P>
<P>
   In the deal, the smaller Warner &AMP; Stackpole will gain the
national presence and resources many small and midsized firms say
is now necessary to survive in the increasingly cutthroat business
of practicing law, the firm's partners said Thursday. But it will
lose its 125-year-old name.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bittersweet situation,'' said Gordon Stevenson, a
Warner &AMP; Stackpole managing partner. ``There are pluses and
minuses. In the end, we felt there were more pluses.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Kirkpatrick &AMP; Lockhart, whose Boston practice
focused mainly on litigation, began courting Warner &AMP; Stackpole
almost seven months ago, largely because it wanted the firm's
lucrative corporate work, said Phil Fina, managing partner of the
Pittsburgh firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a long mating dance,'' he said. ``They were going to be
surrendering a name and a 125-year identity, and they wanted to
make sure it was going to be a good fit. The history of law firm
mergers is littered with those that fell apart so that was
important to us too.''
</P>
<P>
   Such mergers are likely to become common in Boston over the next
year as national firms look for a foothold in Boston's raging
economy and native midsized firms struggle for a way to compete,
legal observers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just about every midsized firm in town is at least talking
about it right now,'' said Jane Sender of Jane Sender Legal Search,
a Boston consulting and head-hunting service for law firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every midsized firm feels pressure,'' she said. ``Their
overhead is high, and they feel pressure to compete with the big
firms. They're looking to the national firms for resources and
economies of scale.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before Thursday's deal, the trend was becoming evident in a
half-dozen mergers since 1998, observers said. Among them were
deals like one late last year in which the Boston law firm
Sherburne, Powers &AMP; Needham merged with Holland &AMP; Knight, creating
the fifth-largest law firm in the country with 840 lawyers and
offices in 18 cities.
</P>
<P>
   And in May, Rochester, N.Y.-based Nixon, Hargrave, Devans &AMP;
Doyle announced plans to merge with Boston's 145-year-old Peabody &AMP;
Brown, creating a 450-lawyer practice. The combined firm, called
Nixon Peabody, ranks among the top 50 US law firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of activity is going to pick up,'' said one Boston
lawyer who asked not to be identified because of ongoing merger
talks. ``It's the buzz all over town. It's practically all lawyers
around here talk about anymore.''

   ``I'd say it's one of the sports capitals,'' said Lorell, who
was invited to the event but won't be able to attend because of
prior commitments. ``Atlanta will soon have a team in each of the
four major sports _ once the Thrashers come on _ and they have
college teams. It's at a crossroads of sorts for sports.''
</P>
<P>
   Without a doubt, the city has made some headway. The Sporting
News recently released its ranking of the 20 best cities for
sports. New York-Long Island-New Jersey captured the top spot,
followed by Dallas-Fort Worth and Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta jumped to fourth from 16th, largely because of a good
performance by the Falcons. Detroit, which was No. 1 last year,
fell to seventh.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, season ticket sales for the National
Basketball Association Hawks at the new Philips Arena are moving
slower than those for the Thrashers, joining the National Hockey
League.
</P>
<P>
   Invitations for the event were sent to about 100 journalists
from around the country, many of whom work in sports. So far, about
17 journalists have confirmed, including writers with overseas
publications and from The Wall Street Journal, the Los Angeles
Times, Southern Living and Travel Weekly, said the ACVB's Howard.
All expenses are paid, although some journalists may opt to pay a
nominal fee of $100. Others may choose to foot the entire bill.
About one-third have chosen the nominal fee, said Howard, adding
that some are local and won't need hotel and air accommodations.
</P>
<P>
   The showcase includes dinner with heavyweight boxing champ
Evander Holyfield; a Braves game; a tour of Philips Arena and a
meeting with Stan Kasten, president of the Turner Sports-owned
Braves, Hawks and Thrashers.
</P>
<P>
   Howard points to the city's hosting of several major sporting
events, including the 1996 Centennial Olympic Games, Super Bowl
XXXIV in 2000 and the Women's Final Four in 2003 as evidence of its
growing sports presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you put the total inventory of everything we have
together, it's a pretty dynamic story in terms of
accomplishments,'' he said. ``I think it's a pretty big story to
tell.''
</P>
<P>
   The hope is that journalists will spread the word that Atlanta
has the ability to host major events and enhance the city's image.
That wasn't the case in 1996, when thousands of journalists from
around the world descended on Atlanta for the Olympics and in some
cases panned the city, particularly on transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Why invite more scrutiny?
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any apologies to make,'' Howard said. ``Our
research has shown that the vast majority of consumers did not have
an unfavorable experience in Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   City promoters aren't just bent on telling a sports story.
Sports mean big business, from packing restaurants to filling hotel
rooms and airline seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have definitely, up to this point, felt the impact of the
Braves when they're in town. And with the onset of Philips Arena,
we also hope to benefit from the Thrashers and the Hawks,'' said
Charles Powell, general manager of the recently opened Embassy
Suites at Centennial Olympic Park.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympics brought in $5.1 billion. Next year's Super Bowl is
expected to have an economic impact of $250 million and the NCAA
Final Four in 2002 is expected to bring in $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   Howard said the city plans to promote its other attractions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hope people look at you as a very diverse city,'' he said.
``People don't come here for just one reason; they come here for
many reasons.''

DEAL LINKS LOTUS AND MULTIMEDIA SOFTWARE MAKER MACROMEDIA 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   In an effort to become a leader in delivering education through
computer networks, Lotus Development Corp. is linking up with
multimedia software maker Macromedia Inc. in a multimillion-dollar
deal that includes a product acquisition and licensing rights.
</P>
<P>
   Lotus, a wholly owned subsidiary of IBM Corp. based in
Cambridge, Mass., said it is especially interested in the corporate
training side of what is called ``distance learning'' and includes
delivery of traditional college courses by computer.
</P>
<P>
   Lotus chief executive Jeff Papows said in an interview that
companies nationwide spent about $62 billion last year on training
workers. ``Sixty percent of that is planes, trains and crappy
food.'' By delivering the courses on computer networks, much of
that money could be saved, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can make a concentrated effort here to claim real
leadership in that space and really dominate this market,'' Papows
said.
</P>
<P>
   Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, but Rob Burgess,
chairman and chief executive of San Francisco-based Macromedia,
said it would generate at least $30 million a year in licensing
revenue for his company over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a huge part of Lotus's future,'' said Papows. He
described the deal as vital in his effort to expand the company
beyond its present stronghold in corporate groupware _ including
Lotus Notes and Microsoft Corp.'s rival Exchange software. That
market will be saturated soon, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, Lotus will purchase Pathware, a Macromedia
product used by businesses to design distance-learning courses.
These courses can be taken via the Internet or a company's internal
computer network. Pathware will be combined with Lotus
LearningSpace, software that allows users in different locations to
link their computers to form an electronic classroom.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Lotus will license Macromedia's Authorware, Flash
and Shockware software for use in its distance-learning software
products. Lotus will also act as a distributor of Macromedia
software, which will boost Macromedia's access to software buyers
at the Fortune 1000 companies that are Lotus's prime customers.
</P>
<P>
   Macromedia's Burgess said the addition of his firm's software
will allow Lotus LearningSpace users to develop multimedia courses,
mixing sound, animation and video images with plain text.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're multisensory creatures. Given a choice, people will
always prefer a multimedia experience,'' Burgess said. ``What this
allows you to do is create a much richer experience.''

GOP MOVES CLOSER TO SENATE PASSAGE OF $792 MILLION TAX CUT 
</HEADLINE>

(mk) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans moved closer Thursday to Senate passage
of a $792 billion tax cut over the opposition of President Clinton
and congressional Democrats, but still face the difficult task of
uniting the party on what form the tax cuts should take.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate took up dozens of amendments to the tax bill
Thursday, rejecting the broadest of them and heading toward a vote
on final passage late Thursday or Friday. The Senate bill was all
but certain to pass with its major provisions intact, including a
reduction in the lowest personal income tax rate.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to make political points, Democrats offered a series of
amendments, including one that would have postponed the tax cuts
and another that would have carved out money to provide a
prescription drug benefit within Medicare. All of them were
defeated, on largely party-line votes.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate also voted down an attempt by conservative
Republicans to rework the $792 billion tax bill to include a
reduction in all income tax rates and in capital gains tax rates,
provisions that are included in the House version of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate was also considering a host of special-interest
amendments. Sens. Mitch McConnell and Jim Bunning of Kentucky, both
Republicans, sought a change that would benefit horse owners by
reducing to one year from two years the length of time they would
need to own a horse before being able to sell it at a favorable
capital gains rate.
</P>
<P>
   The House passed its version of the $792 billion Republican
tax-cut plan last week. Once the Senate has finished work on its
legislation, appointees from both chambers will begin meeting to
hash out the many variations in their bills: Some reflect
fundamental differences in approach to tax cuts and others reflect
the priorities of interest groups with a political or economic
stake in the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Given that Republicans have no higher priority this year than
passing a tax cut _ even though they know Clinton will veto it _
they will almost certainly reach a compromise among themselves in
the next week on what the tax package should look like.
</P>
<P>
   ``The debates will be of high energy and great commitment, but I
think it gets done,'' said Rep. Michael Castle, R-Del., one of a
handful of House Republicans who think the $792 billion tax cut is
too big. ``Those committed to getting this bill done are more
committed to getting it done at $792 billion than to any particular
provision.''
</P>
<P>
   But getting there may not be easy. And even after the House and
Senate negotiators reach agreement, they could face a tricky task
in selling the deal to their members, especially in the House,
where a renegade group of moderate Republicans is watching closely
to make sure their concerns are addressed in the final package.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are significant differences both in approach and in
structure in the House and Senate bills,'' said Trent Duffy, a
spokesman for Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the Ways and
Means Committee. ``Conferencing them will be challenging.''
</P>
<P>
   The House bill is generally more appealing to conservatives in
both chambers than the Senate bill, which was written to draw some
support from Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill, which was written by Archer, is built around a
gradual reduction in all income tax rates, a provision that
Republicans say would benefit those people who pay the most in
taxes but that Democrats say disproportionately rewards the
wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate version, which was written by Sen. William Roth,
R-Del., chairman of the Finance Committee, provides a smaller
income tax cut and directs a greater proportion of it to
middle-income households than the House bill. It would reduce only
the lowest income tax rate, bringing the current 15 percent bracket
down to 14 percent and expanding the bracket to higher income
levels.
</P>
<P>
   But the Senate version goes further than the House version in
addressing the so-called marriage penalty, a primary goal of social
conservatives, one of the most influential of Republican
constituencies. The Senate plan would almost eliminate the penalty
_ which leaves many two-income couples paying more in taxes than if
they were single _ by eventually allowing married couples to file
as if they were single.
</P>
<P>
   The House plan would limit its marriage penalty provisions to
people who use the standard deduction, meaning that it would do
little for higher-income couples, who almost invariably itemize
their deductions.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill contains a reduction in the top rate on capital
gains to 15 percent from 20 percent, while the Senate version has
no provision for capital gains.
</P>
<P>
   The House and Senate negotiators will have to maintain a
delicate political balance, retaining the appeal of the package
both to the conservative wing of the party and the moderate wing.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping that balance will be especially challenging in the
House, where Republicans have a razor-thin majority. A group of
Republican moderates in the House objected to the size and
composition of the original bill last week, forcing concessions
from the party's leaders intended to assure that the tax cuts would
not lead to renewed budget deficits.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Thursday, a group of those same moderates circulated a letter
demanding that the party retain a feature of the House bill that is
certain to bring intense objections from the Senate. The House bill
contains a ``trigger'' that would allow the income tax reductions
to take place only if the interest cost on the national debt does
not rise.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen of the Republican moderates had signed the letter by
Thursday night, suggesting that the leadership could have trouble
passing the final version of the bill if it does not include the
trigger.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of us have told the leadership that without a hard
trigger we will have difficulty supporting the bill,'' said Rep.
Fred Upton, R-Mich.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill has a procedural wrinkle that could also give
the negotiators heartburn. It would require that the tax cuts be
rescinded after 10 years, a provision that would be unappealing to
conservatives in the House.

PATRIOTS READY TO ANNOUNCE SIGNING OF TWO NO. 1 DRAFT PICKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMITHFIELD, R.I. _ The Patriots did not announce the signings of
their two No. 1 draft picks _ Boston College center Damien Woody
and Ohio State linebacker Andy Katzenmoyer _ Thursday, but hope to
do so at Friday's opening of training camp at Bryant College.
</P>
<P>
   Patriots vice president of business operations Andy Wasynczuk
has a streak of no rookie ever holding out while he's been in
charge of the team's contracts, and he doesn't intend to blemish
his record this year _ though Woody's deal was still cloudy as of
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots will enter camp another veteran short after the
team let Willie Clay go to save the $1.5 million they were
scheduled to pay him this season. While the Patriots brass had
wanted the team to get a little bit older, it's even younger now.
</P>
<P>
   With 34 new players on the preseason roster since the end of the
1998 season, the Patriots' coaching staff will be looking at 23
rookies, 11 first-year, 15 second-year, seven third-year and six
fourth-year players. Only 23 players on the roster have five or
more years experience.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots did not acquire that savvy veteran leader as they
had hoped, though Terry Allen is still a possibility if the Barry
Sanders-less Detroit Lions don't scoop him up.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots will be returning from a disappointing 9-7 season
in which at one time or another there were 16 starters injured.
Training camp may be a tad tougher this year as coach Pete Carroll,
who appears to be on the hot seat, is expected to enforce the use
of pads more than he did a year ago in the hope that players will
be tougher and less injury-prone for the start of the season Sept.
12 at New York vs. the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll will basically have to get the Patriots back to or close
to the Super Bowl again, or risk being on the short end of this
winter's evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   Many coaches who have gone 10-6 and 9-7 would have job security
for many years, but not Carroll, who succeeded a legendary coach
who has gone to the Big Game.
</P>
<P>
   While the offseason program was well-attended, it was nothing to
gloat about. The good news is the major players who stayed away _
Ty Law, Bruce Armstrong, Ben Coates, and Zefross Moss _ appear to
be in excellent shape. Law, who may be on the verge of a new deal,
continued his work with track coach Bob Kersee and intends to press
the Patriots to become a multi-dimensional player.
</P>
<P>
   The issues haven't changed much from the end of the season,
except the team has added the riddle of who replaces Clay.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll claims the replacement comes from a list of Chris
Carter, rookie Tony George, and Larry Whigham.
</P>
<P>
   The most striking issue will be finding a running back to
replace the injured Robert Edwards. LSU's Kevin Faulk will get the
chance unless the Patriots sign Allen or pick up a running back
from Miami's dirty dozen.
</P>
<P>
   The other player who will draw major attention is Terry Glenn.
Recovering from a fractured ankle, it remains to be seen whether
Carroll will approach Glenn differently in terms of trying to
preserve him for the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Another area of concern is the offensive line and replacing
veteran center Dave Wohlabaugh. The Patriots need their line to
run-block better. A smashmouth approach will be emphasized by new
coach Dante Scarnecchia, but the leadership in this area has to
come from Armstrong, whose run-blocking suffered last season
because he played with a fractured leg. Armstrong is under 300
pounds for the first time since his rookie season.
</P>
<P>
   Woody should eventually be more than a capable replacement for
Wohlabaugh. Potentially more talented than Wohlabaugh, it becomes
vital that Woody is signed so he doesn't miss a good portion of
training camp, which certainly gives him the edge in negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Woody has been working in Foxborough, Mass. since May 15 when he
quit Boston College after the draft. If he starts to understand the
offense, then Woody's athleticism should take over and make him a
dominating player.
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, Willie McGinest is to that unit what Glenn is to
the offense. When McGinest is sound and rushing the passer, it
opens up opportunities for Chris Slade and for the secondary to
make a play.
</P>
<P>
   To McGinest's credit, he has left no stone unturned in trying to
strengthen the area around his groin to prevent the strains and
pulls from the past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   If all are healthy and participating and if Clay can be
replaced, the Patriots have one of the best defenses in the league.
They have All-Pro caliber players in Law, Lawyer Milloy, Ted
Johnson, Chris Slade, McGinest, an emerging Chad Eaton, and a
seasoned veteran in Henry Thomas. Tedy Bruschi and Brandon Mitchell
could blossom this year, and Tebucky Jones bears watching, as does
the aggressive Katzenmoyer.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, the entire season rests on the arm and the
finger of Drew Bledsoe. As the Patriots found out at crunch time a
year ago, without Bledsoe, they are not capable of beating the
big-time teams.

MONEY MANEUVERS RAISE SUSPICIONS ON RUSSIA'S CENTRAL BANK 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ From its 19th-century headquarters in Moscow, the
Central Bank of Russia commands an empire that stretches across
Russia and beyond. It employs 100,000 people and owns a rich
selection of properties, including holiday spas, apartment
buildings and stables, as well as branch offices, valued in 1997 at
$1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   It has a controlling interest in two Russian banks and five
foreign commercial banks _ a curious legacy from Soviet days _ and
indirectly, a mysterious but handy offshore investment company,
based on the island of Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   That Jersey company, known as Fimaco, has for months been the
center of a controversy that has tantalized the bank's many
critics, inside and outside of Russia. Although recent
investigations by Russian prosecutors and international auditors
have found no criminal violations in the Central Bank's dealings
with Fimaco, many experts say the operations definitely skirted the
edge of normal Central Bank rules and ethics.
</P>
<P>
   Most attention has focused on Fimaco's 1996 operations, when the
Central Bank used it as a back-door conduit to invest in Russia's
short-term treasury bills, known as GKOs, which were then just
becoming available to foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   According to an internal Central Bank document obtained by
Nikolai Gonchar, a crusading Russian legislator, at least $855
million was shifted through Fimaco from the bank's hard-currency
reserves onto the market for the Treasury bills from February to
October 1996 alone.
</P>
<P>
   When Gonchar first made these charges, bank officials, past and
present, denied them, in some cases vehemently. This month, they
came forward with a new explanation: the Central Bank did shift
money through Fimaco _ a subsidiary of Eurobank, a French bank in
which the Russian Central Bank owns 78 percent _ but only as a way
of testing the entry of foreign investors on the GKO market.
</P>
<P>
   But this latest explanation has also fallen flat, particularly
among investment analysts who follow the GKO market. ``You don't
need hundreds of millions of dollars to test that kind of
mechanism,'' said Tom Adshead, senior analyst for Troika Dialogue,
a Moscow-based investment bank. ``It is very peculiar for a central
bank to set up a hidden structure to conduct such procedures. Why
test it, when they built it?''
</P>
<P>
   Gonchar, a dogged parliamentary deputy from Moscow, is also not
satisfied. ``The main question,'' he said recently, ``is where are
the profits from these operations?''
</P>
<P>
   From its start in 1991, Fimaco's operations have been highly
secretive.
</P>
<P>
   By 1993, the year when the Jersey-based investment company was
acquired by Eurobank, a directive had been issued by a Central Bank
official ordering that Fimaco operations be kept off the books.
</P>
<P>
   Nor were any of the transactions involving Fimaco ever put
before the Central Bank's board of directors, said Alexander
Khandruyev, vice chancellor of the Academy of National Economy who
as deputy chairman of the Central Bank, served on its board from
1992 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Central banks _ including the Federal Reserve _ commonly invest
in their home securities market, but only as buyers on secondary
markets. In Russia, the Central Bank, together with its affiliate
Sberbank, were known to dominate 50 percent of the GKO market.
</P>
<P>
   But what troubles Khandruyev most are indications that the bank
was not just playing the GKO market, but pumping it up with the
help of national currency reserves. ``According to unwritten laws
practiced by central banks, central banks do not buy their own
securities with their official currency reserves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For months now, Central Bank officials have said that they first
began to use Fimaco in the early 1990s as a way to shelter Russian
reserves from creditors looking to retrieve their Soviet debt. Its
existence was camouflaged behind Eurobank, the Paris-based bank
that, like its sister banks supported by the Central Bank of
Russia, survived the collapse of the Soviet banking system with a
healthy dose of credits from Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian Central Bank, born of a Soviet communist system that
avowedly disdained capitalism, has historically cloaked its
operations in a secrecy that goes beyond even the reticence typical
of central banks around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Central Bank is the biggest and most powerful financial
oligarch in Russia,'' said Andrei Illarionov, director of the
Institute of Economic Analysis, and a harsh critic of the bank.
``Its leadership is virtually independent. There is no
transparency. In many countries, central banks are independent but
in Russia's case, the Central Bank does not report to anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   This month, at a series of news conferences, past and present
bank officials announced that a three-month audit of the bank's
relationship with Fimaco had found no ``substantial'' violations of
normal procedure.
</P>
<P>
   They also produced a letter from the Russian prosecutor
general's office _ which first made public the charges involving
Fimaco last February _ saying that no evidence of ``embezzlement or
misappropriation'' had been found.
</P>
<P>
   The full audit of Fimaco's operations by PricewaterhouseCoopers,
the Central Bank's preferred auditing firm, is being released by
the International Monetary Fund. The fund has not raised any
objections in public, and has approved disbursement of another $4.5
billion financial package for Russia, aimed at keeping the country
afloat at least through parliamentary and Presidential elections
next year.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But so far no one has been willing or able to explain why the
Central Bank of Russia acted as it did. Why did the bank transfer
part of its hard currency reserves, via a complicated chain of
intertwined financial institutions onto a highly speculative
domestic debt market, against private advice from both the IMF and
the bank's own auditing firm? According to estimates compiled by
Gonchar, the Central Bank from 1993 to 1996 channeled an average of
$2.7 billion a year to Fimaco, money that eventually was recycled
back into the bank's coffers in Moscow. Central Bank officials have
defended this operation, noting that many central banks invest
money abroad. However, it is traditional to use established
investment firms, typically chosen on the basis of tenders.
</P>
<P>
   Fimaco's 1996 transactions, described in an Oct. 4, 1996,
document signed by the deputy director of foreign operations for
the Central Bank, were different.
</P>
<P>
   The money was returned to Russia, via Eurobank, Fimaco's parent
company, and then through Evrofinance, the first Moscow-based
foreign bank licensed to buy GKOs on behalf of foreigners and which
listed as its parent companies Fimaco and Eurobank.
</P>
<P>
   According to Eurobank's 1996 annual report, Evrofinance's
presence in Moscow ``enabled Eurobank to place more than $3.4
billion in GKOs on behalf of foreign investors _ that is 40 percent
of total foreign investment in this financial product in 1996.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Central Bank document, it directed $855 million
onto the GKO market via Fimaco in 1996. Fimaco, in turn, having
bought the GKOs, then deposited an equal sum in Eurobank, where it
earned interest at rates ranging around 5.5 percent a year.
According to Gonchar, these amounts were returned to the Central
Bank. What he insists is not accounted for are the profits earned
on the lucrative GKO market. At the time, yields on GKOs hovered
around 200 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were incredibly profitable operations,'' Gonchar said.
``The bank received money from the International Monetary Fund,
from the World Bank very cheaply. The money was invested in GKOs,
which in 1996 were earning 180 to 240 percent. Imagine the kind of
profits. Where are they?''
</P>
<P>
   Some suspect that the real purpose of this operation in 1996 was
to generate more money for the Russian government, then caught in a
web of extravagant election year promises given by President Boris
Yeltsin. To the general relief of the West, Yeltsin defeated his
communist challenger, Gennadi Zyuganov, to win a second term.
</P>
<P>
   Others have guessed that like any elaborate plumbing system,
this one was bound _ maybe even designed _ to leak, in the form of
commissions, risk margins and other profits collected along the
way.
</P>
<P>
   There may have been other reasons, such as tax avoidance or
simply a chance to test unorthodox financing mechanisms required by
Russia's shallow and fragile debt market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Central Bank of Russia was more creative than others,''
said a Russian banker familiar with the Central Bank's operations.
``There were a lot of young people working there, with very good
brains.'' In those years, he said, the Central Bank's main goal was
not to generate profit for itself, but to control a shaky GKO
market, and bring down the dizzying rise in yields.
</P>
<P>
   But in so doing, critics argue, the Central Bank assumed
conflicting roles on the GKO market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the problem is the conflict within the Central Bank,
which on one hand is supposed to be the regulator of commercial
banks, and on the other hand, was their competitor on the GKO
market,'' said Dmitri Vasilyev, the chairman of Russia's Federal
Securities Commission and an outspoken critic of the Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
   This month, the bank's chairman, Viktor Gerashchenko _ a
formidable veteran of the old Soviet banking system _ used the
PricewaterhouseCoopers audit's findings to try to put the Fimaco
matter to rest, promising to correct accounting practices by
January 2000 to prevent inflation of foreign reserves.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Gerashchenko insisted _ again _ that the audit showed
nothing essentially wrong with Fimaco, only what he termed ``a
certain deviation from traditional instructions.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Sergei Dubinin, the Central Bank chairman from
1994 to 1998, proclaimed at a news conference, ``All slanders that
were loudly proclaimed have been refuted.''
</P>
<P>
   Dubinin then made his first attempt to explain away what he
called an ``artificial'' scandal. According to him, the transfer of
Central Bank money onto the GKO markets was done in 1996 to test
the mechanism by which foreign investors could put money on the GKO
markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Naturally, it was necessary not only to allow'' foreigners to
enter the GKO market, Dubinin said, ``but also to show certain
techniques how it had to be done. Eurobank showed it, and by so
doing, it opened the road for other investors. This is its role.
There was nothing else behind it.''
</P>
<P>
   Khandruyev, Dubinin's former deputy chairman, sounded less sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the auditors' conclusions confirm that the Russian Central
Bank used its own currency reserves to buy securities, having
insider information, and influencing the profitability of those
securities,'' he said, And ``remember that although the Finance
Ministry issued GKOs, the Central Bank and Sberbank controlled 50
percent of the market, making them its trend-setters _ if certain
issues of the GKOs, which were highly profitable, were acquired by
Fimaco via an indirect route, I would consider this a violation of
moral and ethical principles. But it is not a matter of criminal
law.''

FORMER STATE DEPARTMENT EMPLOYEE ACCUSED OF VISA IMPROPRIETIES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., Ind.)  (rk) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A House panel Thursday accused a former State
Department employee at the American embassy in Beijing of
improperly granting visas to Chinese citizens seeking entry to the
United States, sometimes approving entry documents for friends of a
Democratic fund-raiser in return for gifts, money and favors.
</P>
<P>
   The employee, Charles M. Parish, was transferred out of his job
in 1996 and investigated by the State Department's Diplomatic
Security Service, the department's inspector general and finally
the FBI. He retired in 1998 without being charged with wrongdoing
and with a pension.
</P>
<P>
   Parish, who had been subpoenaed to testify Thursday before the
House government Reform and Oversight Committee, quickly departed
after he refused to answer questions. Parish cited his
constitutional right against self-incrimination, and when asked
whether he would decline to answer every question put to him, he
said he would.
</P>
<P>
   Although the investigation of Parish is closed, Republican
lawmakers on the committee have been examining his activities in
connection with the panel's long-running inquiry into campaign
finance improprieties in the 1996 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   In a report issued Thursday, the committee said it had found
evidence that Parish received gifts from Cofco, a Chinese
state-owned food products conglomerate, and BNU Corp., a real
estate company in Phoenix that is a wholly owned subsidiary of
Cofco. In return, the committee said, Parish supplied visas for
Cofco officials.
</P>
<P>
   But the committee report did not unearth any additional evidence
indicating that Parish had performed favors for anyone connected to
efforts to raise money from Asian-Americans or from Chinese
nationals, like the military and intelligence officials who
secretly funneled money to the Democrats in the 1996 presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony to the committee on May 11, one Democratic
fund-raiser, Johnny Chung, told the panel that he had met Parish
while trying to get a visa for the head of a large Chinese beer
company, the Haomen Group. Chung said that he had developed a close
relationship with Parish and estimated that he had approved 25 to
30 visas for Chung's business clients.
</P>
<P>
   Chung testified that in 1995 he had witnessed the chairman of
the beer company, He Yun Jei, hand Parish a bag containing bundles
of Chinese currency along with several Chinese passports that
needed to be stamped with visas permitting entry into the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1995, Chung took Parish, Parish's sister and a
girlfriend to a Democratic National Committee fund-raiser and a
private reception with President Clinton, he testified. Chung later
provided other favors for Parish, his secretary and his
girlfriends.
</P>
<P>
   In Parish's absence, Thursday's hearing focused on what Rep. Dan
Burton, R-Ind., and chairman of the committee, said was the State
Department's botched handling of the investigation of Parish.
</P>
<P>
   At the hearing, department officials acknowledged that they had
not examined Parish's bank accounts, had not tried to review all
his visa files and had narrowed their inquiry to his relationship
with just two Chinese citizens even though there were several
complaints against him.

LATEST STATISTICS SPUR INFLATION FEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The nation's nonstop economic expansion created the highest
increase of wages since 1991, the federal government reported
Thursday, fueling fears that the strong growth has finally unleased
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department said wages and benefits rose 1.1 percent in
the second quarter, a report that sent the financial markets into a
tailspin. Investors fear that the Federal Reserve would seize upon
the spike to justify another hike in interest rates in August in
order to keep inflation in check.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average plunged as much as 258 points,
before recovering slightly to close down 180.78 points, 1.65
percent, at 10,791.29.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inflation risk shows up loud and clear in today's reports,''
said Allen Sinai of Primark Decision Economics in Boston. The
reports suggest ``the Federal Reserve might have to tighten sooner
than expected. One more dose of tightening, maybe two, maybe
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, the Commerce Department reported that gross
domestic product, or GDP, grew at a 2.3 percent annual pace during
the second quarter. It was a dramatic slowing from the breakneck
4.3 percent expansion rate during the first quarter, a pace many
economists believed was unsustainable, even alarming.
</P>
<P>
   A slowdown had been expected and even welcomed, because it would
act as a natural deterrent to inflation. But attention Thursday was
riveted to the seasonally adjusted Employment Cost Index, which is
closely watched by the Fed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The GDP news is all good news,'' said Barry Bosworth, an
economist at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank.
</P>
<P>
   Bosworth cautioned that it is too early to firmly conclude, from
one wage report, that inflation will take off. For the average
worker, Bosworth said, the report ``should be seen as good news and
signals a return to a more sustainable path of growth.''
</P>
<P>
   The spike in the wage index, however, caused concerns because
labor costs account for a large portion of consumer prices. The
latest quarter's rise of 1.1 percent marked an acceleration from
the two previous quarters, when the index rose half a percentage
point on average. It was the biggest quarterly jump since a 1.2
percent increase in the second quarter of 1991, the bureau said.
</P>
<P>
   The employment cost index has risen 3.2 percent since June 1998.
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street, the report put investors on edge.
</P>
<P>
   The bond market slumped, as yields on the benchmark 30-year US
Treasury bonds rose to 6.07 percent from a close the previous day
of just over 6 percent. During the day yields touched 6.12 percent,
the highest level since June 25.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks plunged in reaction to a hammering in the bond and stock
futures markets, which open before the stock exchanges, said Ned
Riley, BankBoston Corp.'s chief investment officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was across-the-board selling of cyclical (stocks), as
well as technology, health care, and financials,'' Riley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still at a very high valuation level'' in the stock
market, Riley said, and ``any adverse news can puncture that
utopian environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Economists for months have predicted a labor market that is
tight as a drum would begin to drive up wages as businesses compete
for workers. As wages rise, they can, in turn, fuel inflation by
increasing prices for goods and services that workers produce or
provide. US unemployment in June, at 4.3 percent, remains at
30-year lows.
</P>
<P>
   Inflationary pressures eased last fall for two reasons,
economists said. Global financial turmoil prompted a plunge in
commodity prices, particularly oil. And worker productivity
continued to rise, easing any wage pressures. These forces combined
to dampen inflation, which in more normal times would be a
byproduct of strong growth.
</P>
<P>
   This unusual period of low inflation has helped to sustain the
longest peacetime expansion in US history.
</P>
<P>
   But prices for oil on world markets have risen as the global
economy has strengthened. Crude oil topped $21 a barrel Thursday
for the first time since November 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Against this backdrop, a jump in the employment cost index
confirmed investors' worst fears about what Federal Reserve
chairman Alan Greenspan and the Federal Open Market Committee would
do when they meet to set monetary policy on Aug. 24.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan has been on the lookout for inflation, warning
repeatedly that it may lurk around the corner. Greenspan's warnings
continued this week in congressional testimony, even though the Fed
in June had already boosted interest rates by a quarter point, to 5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The wage spike ``is the kind of thing the Fed chairman is
worried about, that the economy is too stretched and it may be
putting some upward pressure on inflation,'' said James O'Sullivan,
economist for J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co., a New York securities firm.
</P>
<P>
   Economists will closely watch July's unemployment report for
more signs of expanding employment _ and, potentially, wage
increases.
</P>
<P>
   O'Sullivan and others said a closer inspection of the wage
report, in truth, revealed a mix of messages.
</P>
<P>
   For one, wage hikes were inflated by an increase in compensation
for workers on Wall Street, where broker commissions swelled during
a sizzling rally in stocks. Mortgage bankers and real estate
brokers also brought in higher commissions in a housing market in
which homes sell like hotcakes.
</P>
<P>
   The average of the first- and second-quarter employment cost
indexes is an increase of about three-quarters of a percentage
point, in line with last year's quarterly gains.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the employment cost index report tells you is wage
inflation is broadly stable,'' said William Dudley, chief economist
for Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co.

through. But it takes forever to get going, and the romantic-comedy
results pale in comparison to the 1990 original.

OFFICALS STUDY STOWAWAY'S BREACH OF LOGAN SECURITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Abraham Derman, the 17-year-old who stowed away on a
British Airways London-bound flight, made his daring trek over a
fence and across restricted space at Logan International Airport in
the traditional garb of a Hasidic Jew, aviation sources said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   That makes Derman's July 12 escapade, which he planned to
impress Israeli spies, even more remarkable because it makes it
unlikely that he could he blend in as someone who belonged in
restricted airport areas.
</P>
<P>
   Hasidic Jews typically wear long dark coats, wide-brimmed hats
and have side locks of hair and beards. Derman reportedly has the
wispy beginnings of a beard.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is an obvious failure of security,'' said an aviation
security specialist who spoke on condition that his name not be
used.
</P>
<P>
   Derman, of suburban Brookline, scaled a perimeter fence, walked
unchallenged for 2 miles across restricted areas, including at
least one active taxiway, and gained access to the 747 jet by
climbing the outside stairs of the jetway, an enlosed walkway
connecting the airport boarding area and the aircraft's doorway,
and passing through a door that should have been locked.
</P>
<P>
   Two sources said Derman reached the plane by using the exterior
stairs to the jetway from the tarmac after a ramp mechanic propped
the door open.
</P>
<P>
   He hid on the tarmac near the airplane and made a well-timed
dash up the stairs as the first group of passengers boarded Flight
214, British Airways's daily 8:10 p.m. flight to London.
</P>
<P>
   A source familiar with the investigation into Derman's trip said
the teenager reads spy novels and hoped to impress the Mossad, the
Israeli intelligence agency, with his stunt. Derman wanted to fly
on to Israel from London's Heathrow International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   His attempt ended after Heathrow airport security discovered
Derman in a restricted area.
</P>
<P>
   Sources also said Thursday that the teen was thwarted at least
once, and possibly as many as five times, by airport personnel
earlier July 12 when he first tried to gain access to the tarmac
from inside Terminal E.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd be in a restricted baggage handling area and someone
would confront him and he'd say, `I'm lost.' The kid looks like he
is 13,'' said one source familiar with the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The airport is owned and operated by the Massachusetts Port
Authority.
</P>
<P>
   After being turned back by airport workers inside the Logan
terminal, Derman walked along a perimeter fence north of the
airport, then climbed the fence and either cut the razor wire on
top or found a section in which the wire was torn and jumped down
onto the airfield.
</P>
<P>
   Airport employees, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
they have been instructed to question anyone not familiar to them
who is in a restricted area and ask for their identification no
matter their age.
</P>
<P>
   One source said Thursday that when Derman entered the airplane,
he first sat in a seat reserved for flight attendants.
</P>
<P>
   After an attendant told him to take his assigned seat, he moved
to a coach seat that belonged to someone else. Forced to yield the
coach seat, Derman moved to the more upscale business section and
stayed there for the flight to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating the
incident and could levy fines against Massport, British Airways,
and Derman himself.
</P>
<P>
   Security specialists said Derman's ability to breach the fence
at Logan is not remarkable because most US airports do not monitor
perimeter fences with cameras or electronic sensors.
</P>
<P>
   At least twice in the past year unauthorized individuals have
gained access to ramp areas at Logan. In both cases the individuals
were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   State officials have said they will not bring criminal charges
against Derman because of his age and because his parents
understand the severity of his actions.

BUSH CAMP SAYS PRESIDENTIAL FRONT-RUNNER NOT OVERCONFIDENT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Dateline changed to Austin sted of Houston) 
 
By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ From the beginning of his presidential campaign,
Gov. George W. Bush has said he will take nothing for granted,
shunning the idea that the GOP nomination is essentially his.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think `anointed' is something that I suspect others are
trying to attribute to this campaign. And `anointed' kind of means
that you're not working for anything. I'm working,'' Bush told the
Milwaukee Journal Sentinel last week. ``I take nothing for
granted.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush has been criticized for taking Hispanic support for
granted by declining to attend three conventions of Hispanic
activists. Bush is on vacation, with a campaign stop here and
there, in the two weeks before the Iowa straw poll. And Bush is
vacillating on whether to participate in a Florida GOP convention
debate of presidential candidates in October.
</P>
<P>
   With a major lead in the polls and $30 million in the bank, Bush
and his campaign staff apparently have the self-confidence to take
a pass when other candidates are scrambling for attention.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes said Bush's absence from
conventions and his vacation have nothing to do with being
overconfident.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is why he is interrupting his vacation to go to Iowa next
week and New Hampshire on Saturday, and he will be back in Iowa the
week after that,'' Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has made a number of visits to Iowa,'' Hughes said. ``He is
working very hard and our organization is working very hard to earn
votes in Iowa.''
</P>
<P>
   But as of Thursday, the total number of Bush's days in Iowa were
four, according to the National Journal's The Hotline.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, here is the number of days some of his GOP
opponents have spent campaigning in Iowa: Lamar Alexander, 28; Gary
Bauer, 19; Pat Buchanan, 19; Elizabeth Dole, 17; Steve Forbes, 19;
and Dan Quayle, 14.
</P>
<P>
   Orrin Hatch, who launched his presidential campaign earlier this
month, has spent the same number of days in Iowa as Bush. Alan
Keyes has been there once. And John McCain, who is passing on the
Aug. 14 straw poll in Ames to concentrate his struggling campaign
elsewhere, has been to Iowa once.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the ease of Bush's positioning comes from his record
fund-raising and his standing in GOP primary and general election
polls.
</P>
<P>
   An NBC/Wall Street Journal poll released Thursday had Bush
leading for the GOP nomination by 59 percent, followed by Dole at
11 percent. And in a general election match-up with Democratic
front-runner Vice President Al Gore, Bush led 50 percent to 37
percent.
</P>
<P>
   And 48 percent of those surveyed said Gore would not be elected
president, while 44 percent said they thought Bush would be
elected. A whopping 84 percent said there is little or no chance
that they would support Gore for president.
</P>
<P>
   But the poll also contained evidence that Bush's days as the
golden candidate may be waning.
</P>
<P>
   While he wins in the horserace numbers, 64 percent of those
surveyed said there is little or no chance they would support Bush
for president. And 56 percent said his record $37 million in
fund-raising is excessive and a sign of what is wrong in politics,
against 29 percent who said they saw Bush's fund-raising as an
impressive sign of broad-based support.
</P>
<P>
   Bush already has had a rocky road on his quest for minority
votes in his presidential campaign, which has set its sight on
capturing a larger than normal share of the Hispanic vote.
</P>
<P>
   Bush first caught criticism for not attending the Unity
conference of minority journalists in Seattle where he was
campaigning. But then, when Bush dropped by the convention to
mingle, he caught additional fire for not speaking.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Bush has skipped the conventions of the League of
the United Latin American Citizens and the National Association of
Latino Elected and Appointed Officials. Earlier this week, he was
criticized for not attending the National Council of La Raza
conference in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of our people are a little angry he didn't show up,'' La
Raza President Raul Yzaguirre said. ``If he's taking us for
granted, he's misreading our community.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said the criticism is unfair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush has not attended any conventions this summer,''
Hughes said. ``We planned June and July as our introductory tour of
America to meet with supporters in different states and to
highlight some aspects of his message, such as faith-based
institutions and schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said the Aug. 8 meeting of the National Urban League will
be the first time this summer that Bush has had any convention
speech on his schedule. Hughes said he missed the La Raza
convention because he goes to Maine on vacation with his family
this time every year.
</P>
<P>
   ``So it is a little out of line for these groups to suggest that
there is something else intended other than the fact he spends this
week every year with his family in Maine,'' Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   But while the governor was in Maine, his wife, Laura, was
campaigning in Iowa Thursday and Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Perverill Squire, a political science professor at the
University of Iowa, said he does not believe Bush's lack of a
full-bore campaign before the straw poll will hurt him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much of this is going to be dictated by the organization
you've already got on the ground,'' Squire said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So for him it can be portrayed as a normal person taking his
vacation. I don't think anyone is going to read into it that he is
arrogant or smug,'' Squire said. ``He can get away from it in a
fashion that the other candidates can't afford.''
</P>
<P>
   There already is a move to make the Iowa straw poll the last
before the Iowa caucuses early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has passed on an Alabama straw poll in late August, and the
Florida Republican Party has canceled its plans for its traditional
convention straw poll in October. Bush's brother, Jeb, is Florida's
Republican governor.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign also has declined to commit to a possible
candidate debate at the Florida convention, which has led some of
his opponents to cry foul.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush has made clear that his strategy to win the
nomination is simply to buy it,'' said Brian Kennedy, political
director for the Alexander campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he is going to debate anywhere, I would think he'd do it in
his brother's back yard before a friendly crowd,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he doesn't feel like he's capable of debating on those
terms, I don't know why we should expect he'll be able to debate Al
Gore in the fall of 2000 when the whole country is watching and the
presidency is at stake.''

   Q. Save me. My company recently brought in a ``team-building
expert'' to work with my department. The guy was straight out of a
``Dilbert'' cartoon, asking us to share all kinds of personal
stories and participate in goofy trust-building exercises. I
thought the nightmare would end when he left, but my boss seems to
have bought into this stuff. She started this morning's staff
meeting by having us go around the table and share something about
ourselves ``that no one else knows.'' How can I make it clear that
I'm uncomfortable with this touchy-feely stuff without alienating
my boss? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. If it's any consolation, you're not alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard dozens of these stories,'' said Eileen C. Shapiro,
a management consultant and author of ``The Seven Deadly Sins of
Business'' (Capstone, 1998). ``This is common, and it's
appalling.''
</P>
<P>
   Although team-building is important, this type of exercise is
counterproductive, she said, explaining that ``it doesn't recognize
the boundaries between people's personal lives and what they have
to contribute to their businesses.'' For some people, sharing
personal tidbits is no problem. For others, it makes them feel even
more vulnerable and less comfortable with their colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The single most effective way to do team-building is to work
on an important and difficult, but not intractable, problem, and
solve it together,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sharing personal stories lacks such a clear goal, said Peter
deLisser, a leadership coach and author of ``Be Your Own Executive
Coach'' (Chandler House Press, 1999). And there is no way to tell
when the exercise may blow up in the boss's face. ``There's always
the risk that somebody's going to bleed their heart,'' he said.
``Somebody is going to wind up very embarrassed.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, how can you avoid participating? You could be direct.
DeLisser suggested that next time it's your turn to share, just
say, ``One thing that no one else here knows about me is that I
hate these questions.'' But that could be what he calls a ``CLM'':
a career-limiting move.
</P>
<P>
   A less radical first step is to talk with colleagues. ``If
others are uncomfortable, perhaps a small group could go into the
boss and say, `We really respect the team-building you're doing,
but we're uncomfortable with the amount of personal disclosure
you're looking for,''' Ms. Shapiro advised.
</P>
<P>
   But be positive. ``Your manager may be staking part of her
identity on doing this team-building and may be feeling that this
is part of the way she's going to get ahead,'' Ms. Shapiro said.
</P>
<P>
   If you are the only person who loathes these exercises, or if
you and your colleagues fear that the boss won't listen, you may
need to adapt a bit. Look at it as a game, Ms. Shapiro and deLisser
said. Think in advance of simple, benign stories that can be
shared. ``That way, you've taken part,'' deLisser said. ``You've
done what your boss asked, but you didn't risk yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   And as you play along, keep your fingers crossed that the boss
eventually tires of hearing about everyone's personal life. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT, Mich. _ Shares of DaimlerChrysler AG took a pounding on
two continents Thursday after it turned in flat second-quarter
earnings, hurt mostly by weaker-than-expected profits from Chrysler
models.
</P>
<P>
   The company, formed in November when Daimler-Benz AG bought
Chrysler Corp., said its second-quarter adjusted net income fell
.03 percent, to 1.48 billion euros, or $1.53 billion, compared with
the 1.49 billion euros, or $1.534 billion, that the two companies
combined earned in the quarter a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue rose roughly 10 percent, to 37.33 billion euros, or
$38.48 billion from 33.87 billion euros, or $34.92 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had expected more. Their consensus was that
DaimlerChrysler would earn $2 a share in the second quarter,
according to First Call Corp., which tracks earnings. But the
company earned 1.47 euros, or $1.52, a diluted share, down from the
1.52 euros, or $1.64 a share in the period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In Frankfurt, Germany, shares of DaimlerChrysler dropped 5.45
euros, or 6.8 percent, to 74.25 euros. They fared even worse in the
United States, falling $7.4375, or 8.75 percent, to $77.5625.
</P>
<P>
   ``Expectations were not met,'' said Scott F. Merlis, a managing
director and head of the automotive practice at Wasserstein Perella
Securities Inc. ``It is a paradox that the earnings were so
disappointing because the company continues to set sales records.''
</P>
<P>
   He said profits suffered because rebates were higher than
expected in North America and Europe and because of heavy losses
from the Smart car in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Executives defended the financial results. ``These are quite
good numbers,'' said Juergen E. Schrempp, the co-chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kept our eyes on the ball and continued to grow the
business profitably,'' Schrempp said. ``We expect this trend of
profitable growth to continue in the second half of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   David B. Healy, an auto analyst with Burnham Securities, said
DaimlerChrysler's earnings in the second quarter suffered from
three problems: heavy losses in the Asian and Latin American
operations of the former Chrysler, continued losses on Daimler's
Smart car in Europe and the weakness of the euro, which made
European profits worth less when converted into dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Because the reporting of quarterly earnings remains fairly new
for DaimlerChrysler, the company might have made conservative
accounting choices that will result in better profits later this
year, particularly as economies from the merger begin to be
realized, Healy said. But he added that the steep fall in
DaimlerChrysler's shares Thursday suggested that many investors did
not believe this.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the hottest American sales market ever, profits were
lower than expected from the mass-market brands sold under Chrysler
Corp. marques because higher rebates and other incentives were
required to keep people buying in the United States and because
unit sales outside North America fell 20.1 percent in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Second-quarter operating profits for Chrysler, Plymouth, Dodge
and Jeep brands rose just 1.4 percent, to $1.36 billion compared
with $1.34 billion in the quarter a year earlier. Revenue for those
lines rose 9.6 percent, to $16.77 billion from $15.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Robert J. Eaton, the other co-chairman, said sales continued
their sizzling pace this month and that sales of Chrysler's
minivans, which had seemed to be flagging, were picking up. ``We're
going to have a very strong July, headed by minivans,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The luxury Mercedes-Benz line fared better. Operating profits
for Mercedes and Smart jumped 17.8 percent, to $635 million, from
$539 million in the second quarter of last year. The tiny Smart car
remains unprofitable, but the gains came from rising Mercedes
sales, particularly high-profit sales of the Mercedes M-class sport
utility vehicle, built in Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   Operating profits from sales of DaimlerChrysler's commercial
vehicles dropped 1.2 percent, to $329 million from $333 million in
the second quarter of last year. Profits were hurt by the economic
crisis in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings from DaimlerChrysler's aerospace unit jumped 21.1
percent, to $195 million. The company plans to merge its aerospace
unit, known as Dasa, with the Spanish state aerospace company,
called Casa.
</P>
<P>
   Eaton said that the company had found many synergies since the
$36 billion deal combining the two automakers and that
DaimlerChrysler was on track to meet its goal of finding $1.4
billion in savings this year. Of the 1,200 separate projects
undertaken this year to combine the companies, 31 percent are
complete and 80 percent will be finished this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although executives expect further consolidation in the auto
industry, DaimlerChrysler is concentrating on making its own deal
work rather than shopping for other auto companies to buy. ``We are
not looking for any further acquisitions, except if something would
pop in front of us,'' Schrempp said.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the performance of DaimlerChrysler's stock since
the merger, there is still some work to be done. In Europe,
DaimlerChrysler's stock has risen 4.3 percent since the deal was
completed. In the United States, the company's stock price, which
is traded on the New York Stock Exchange, has fallen 7.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Schrempp continued Thursday to campaign for DaimlerChrysler's
inclusion in the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, a step that
would increase demand for its shares by index mutual funds. He
explained the stock's poor performance this way: ``Most analysts so
far have us on buy, but not sufficient people have bought us yet.''

`INTIMATE UNIVERSE' BODY SERIES CONTINUES TO FASCINATE, TEACH

<P>
   ``Intimate Universe: The Human Body'' is aptly named. The
Peabody Award-winning documentary series about human life gets so
close to its subject that viewers may squirm right off the sofa,
though rarely will they see a TV series so informative and so
thoughtfully produced.
</P>
<P>
   The second half of the eight-hour ``Intimate Universe'' has its
North American premiere Sunday and Monday at 9 p.m. on The Learning
Channel. To catch people up, the first half of the BBC series,
which aired in April, will be rebroadcast Saturday from 8 p.m. to
midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Part two encompasses three segments centering on the brain,
aging and death. A fourth segment looks at the amazing technology,
including endoscopic photography, ``time slice'' photography and
computer animation, that helped make the series what it is: a
fabulously engaging look at the processes that keep us alive and,
ultimately, facilitate our demise.
</P>
<P>
   The series smoothly toggles back and forth from extreme
close-ups of, say, a blood clot shutting down an artery to
stunningly illustrative camera work that makes complex scientific
material easy to grasp. A shot of synchronized swimmers, for
example, provides mesmerizing mimicry of the behavior of cells.
</P>
<P>
   The elements of part two are as full of fascinating information
as part one. For instance:
</P>
<P>
   _ When a neuron fires in the brain, the electrical impulse
travels at 250 miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   _ Little of our bodies is actually more than 10 years old. Much
of it, including parts of the skeleton, is continually being
replaced.
</P>
<P>
   _ It takes about 200,000 frowns to etch a furrow in the
forehead.
</P>
<P>
   It's the soothingly avuncular approach of Dr. Robert Winston
that makes ``Intimate Universe'' so appealing. Winston, one of
Europe's leading infertility experts and a member of the British
House of Lords, treats his subject and his audience with enormous
respect, but without the cold aloofness of many documentary
narrators. Winston isn't a hired gun brought in to read a script.
He's a scientist with the engaging manner of a politician and the
on-camera ease of a seasoned news anchor. His curiosity is
infectious, his enthusiasm palpable.
</P>
<P>
   Even in episode seven, ``The End of Life,'' which airs Monday,
Winston's comfortable manner makes society's great taboo _ the
discussion of death _ eminently approachable. The episode follows
the last days of a man dying of cancer. Certainly it is unsettling,
but it is also sensitive and respectful _ no different from all the
other installments that make ``Intimate Universe'' one reason why
TV isn't such a vast wasteland after all.
</P>
<P>
   Intimate Universe: The Human Body. Second half of eight-hour
documentary miniseries about human life, hosted by Dr. Robert
Winston. Sunday and Monday at 9 p.m., The Learning Channel,
repeating Aug. 8 at 2 p.m. Parental guideline rating: TV-PG.

 &HT;    Late race unfamiliar for Braves
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For all the pennants the Braves have won this decade, they
haven't done a whole lot of racing lately.
</P>
<P>
   The nip-and-tuck days of the early '90s are long gone. The
Braves haven't been in a pennant race since 1993, when they fought
the San Francisco Giants until the last day of the season to earn
their third playoff trip in a row. The next year, a strike
eliminated a potential stretch battle with the Montreal Expos.
</P>
<P>
   But they've got one now. A 7-8 record since the All-Star break,
an 11-3 record in that span by the New York Mets, a rash of
season-ending injuries for the Braves, and the National League East
is anything but secure.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves haven't been out of first place after July since
1994. At the end of July last year, they led by 14 games. The lead
was 6 1/2 in 1997, seven in 1996 and eight in 1995. Today, it's a
half-game over the Mets, with third-place Philadelphia coming to
town today for a three-game series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're being pushed,'' said pitcher Greg Maddux. ``It creates
excitement. Instead of waiting for the playoffs to get here, we're
actually trying to get in. Right now, I'm more excited coming to
the park. It's almost August and we're being chased.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Glavine agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been telling everybody for years now that nothing's
guaranteed and nothing's easy,'' he said. ``And I think for a few
years people may have believed that. This year, nothing's going to
be easy. So you take it a game at a time, a series at a time, try
and win your games. If you do that, the teams behind you can't
catch you. You can't worry about anything other than that day's
ball game. You can't afford to look too far ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   The language might sound familiar to some of the Braves, but
only a few. Of the '99 Braves, only Glavine, John Smoltz, Otis
Nixon and Brian Hunter were here in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Just Glavine, Smoltz, Greg Maddux, Javy Lopez, Chipper Jones and
Ryan Klesko remain from the 1994 team. Jones was out that season
with his knee injury; Lopez is missing the rest of this season
because of his.
</P>
<P>
   But Jones said the circumstances aren't all bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen us pull together,'' Jones said. ``I think it's
helped our chemistry a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   The year the Braves won it all, in 1995, they went 20-7 in July,
which matched an Atlanta franchise record for the most wins in a
month. Each of the last four seasons, they have clinched the
division with a couple of weeks to spare. This year, they'll have
to do some work to re-create that scenario.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd always like to have a nice, comfortable cushion,''
Glavine said, ``but there again, there's always that argument,
assuming you get to the playoffs, 'Are you a better team because
you had a big lead all year long, or are you a better team because
you've been battle-tested all year long?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I tend to think the more you're forced to play in tight ball
games and win your way into the playoffs, the more ready you are
for that atmosphere when you get there,'' he said. ``But it doesn't
hurt to have a lead and rest guys, either.''
</P>
<P>
   So, for now, the Braves are doing their best to think in terms
of today's game and this series.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try not to worry about it,'' Jones said. ``You go out and
play your game. You do the things that have made you successful and
gotten you to this point. ... So you go out there, you play
relaxed, one-ninth of the equation. You do your part, throw four
good at-bats up there, play good defense and let the chips fall
where they may. . . .
</P>
<P>
   `` If they match you win for win, you can't really help it,''
Jones said. ``But I feel like we have yet to play our best baseball
of the year.''

MARKET PLACE: SEC LOOKING AT FUNDS THAT BOOST INITIAL PERFORMANCE
WITH IPOs  
(rk) 
 By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ July was a tough month for shareholders of
Internet-stock funds, but not for the lucky few in the Enterprise
Internet fund.
</P>
<P>
   The tiny new fund has soared almost 65 percent since its
introduction on July 1, while other Internet funds have declined
about 10 percent. With just $18 million in assets, few investors
know about the fund, but that will most likely change once it
starts turning up on lists of top-performing funds.
</P>
<P>
   Smart stock picking? Perhaps. But even the fund's investment
adviser acknowledges that a good deal of the outsized gains have
come from what industry officials say is a common, though hard to
track, practice: Fund companies filling a small young fund with hot
initial public offerings that balloon its early performance record.
</P>
<P>
   Fund companies, which generate huge stock-trading commissions,
have enormous influence with the investment banks that underwrite
stock issues, and they wield it to grab allocations of offerings
that are sure to rise. There have been plenty of these issues this
year as Internet offerings have doubled or tripled on their first
trading days.
</P>
<P>
   But many industry officials say some fund companies misuse the
allocation of initial offerings to stuff a disproportionate share
of hot new issues into newer and smaller funds to sharply raise
returns and attract more money from investors.
</P>
<P>
   This practice is drawing increased scrutiny from the Securities
and Exchange Commission, which says improving the allocation of
initial offerings is one of the top compliance weaknesses the
mutual fund industry needs to address.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say initial offerings should be distributed
proportionally within fund families because the underwriters grant
them in return for trading and other business they get from the
funds _ costs ultimately borne by fund shareholders. Moreover,
lopsided allocations can lead to performance records for smaller
funds that, while technically true, are impossible to repeat and
give investors a misleading impression of the fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``The smaller the fund, the greater effect that hot IPO's could
have on its performance,'' said Douglas J. Scheidt, chief counsel
in the SEC's investment management division, which oversees the
mutual fund industry.
</P>
<P>
   Once the fund grows, it would need many more hot initial
offerings to have the same effect on performance, ``so investors
could be misled into believing that a small fund's great
performance could continue, when in fact that fund's ability to get
the same proportion of hot IPOs is far less realistic,'' Scheidt
said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Enterprise Internet fund, which is managed by Fred
Alger Management, which oversees more than $12 billion in assets,
the company's chief executive, David D. Alger, said at least some
of the fund's hot performance could be attributed to initial
offerings. He said that was also probably true of another new fund
Alger manages, Enterprise Multi-Cap Growth, which has gained 70
percent since July 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the slightest input of IPOs would make an impact on'' the
Internet fund, Alger said. ``Some funds you could never give enough
IPOs to get it up 60 percent a month.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said the fund had received only its appropriate
allocation of new stock issues, which he said were doled out evenly
among various funds on a rotating basis. He added that he hoped no
one took the new fund's record as indicative of future performance.
``I don't want anyone to think that 60 percent a month is going to
continue,'' Alger said.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Ugolyn, chief executive of Enterprise Capital Management
in Atlanta, a unit of Mony Group Inc., the New York life insurer,
added that even though the Internet fund was small, having it run
by a much larger investment adviser has given it ``the opportunity
to participate in some well-known IPOs.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Lori Richards, director of the SEC's compliance
office, urged an audience of mutual-fund executives to look more
closely at how initial offerings are allocated within their fund
families.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen lots of problems in how fund groups allocate IPO
shares internally, and we've received complaints concerning the
allocation of hot IPOs,'' Ms. Richards said in a speech on June 10.
``Problems seem to range from the intentional to the sloppy. You
will want to review the allocations not only individually, but over
time, to  &UR; e &LR; nsure that they are consistent and fair.''
</P>
<P>
   SEC officials declined to say whether they were considering
taking action against any fund families for improper allocations of
initial offerings.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's best-known enforcement action in this area came in
1995, when it settled a case against the Account Management Corp.,
a Boston investment adviser, after determining that the company,
among other things, had disproportionately allocated $218,460 in
profits from funneling initial offerings to a select group of
favored clients. The company, which paid a $100,000 fine, neither
admitted nor denied wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, the agency settled a case with McKenzie Walker
Investment Management, of Greenbrae, Calif., after contending that
the firm misallocated shares of initial offerings to clients who
paid fees based on investment results over those who paid set fees.
McKenzie Walker agreed to pay a $100,000 fine and reimburse profits
of $261,000.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Barbash, the SEC's former director of investment
management and now a lawyer in private practice, said that legally,
allocations must be made within fund groups so they do not
advantage or disadvantage one fund over another. But getting more
specific than that raises some thorny issues, he said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, could a fund company legitimately withhold shares
of a hot initial offering from a deep-value fund _ one that invests
only in stocks with low price-to-earnings ratios _ if the initial
offering is of a high-flying Internet company? Or what if the fund
does not have the cash on hand to buy shares of an initial
offering?
</P>
<P>
   Most fund families already try to allocate initial offerings in
a fair manner, Barbash said. But, he said, ``history would suggest
that there are always some groups out there that have had an
inclination to allocate simply for performance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You are always going to have some industry members who play to
the edge,'' Barbash said.

GOP MOVES CLOSER TO SENATE PASSAGE OF $792 MILLION TAX CUT

 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans moved closer Thursday to Senate passage
of a $792 billion tax cut over the opposition of President Clinton
and congressional Democrats, but still face the difficult task of
uniting the party on what form the tax cuts should take.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate took up dozens of amendments to the tax bill
Thursday, rejecting the broadest of them and heading toward a vote
on final passage late Thursday or Friday. The Senate bill was all
but certain to pass with its major provisions intact, including a
reduction in the lowest personal income tax rate.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to make political points, Democrats offered a series of
amendments, including one that would have postponed the tax cuts
and another that would have carved out money to provide a
prescription drug benefit within Medicare. All of them were
defeated, on largely party-line votes.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate also voted down an attempt by conservative
Republicans to rework the $792 billion tax bill to include a
reduction in all income tax rates and in capital gains tax rates,
provisions that are included in the House version of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate was also considering a host of special-interest
amendments. Sens. Mitch McConnell and Jim Bunning of Kentucky, both
Republicans, sought a change that would benefit horse owners by
reducing to one year from two years the length of time they would
need to own a horse before being able to sell it at a favorable
capital gains rate.
</P>
<P>
   The House passed its version of the $792 billion Republican
tax-cut plan last week. Once the Senate has finished work on its
legislation, appointees from both chambers will begin meeting to
hash out the many variations in their bills: Some reflect
fundamental differences in approach to tax cuts and others reflect
the priorities of interest groups with a political or economic
stake in the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Given that Republicans have no higher priority this year than
passing a tax cut _ even though they know Clinton will veto it _
they will almost certainly reach a compromise among themselves in
the next week on what the tax package should look like.
</P>
<P>
   ``The debates will be of high energy and great commitment, but I
think it gets done,'' said Rep. Michael Castle, R-Del., one of a
handful of House Republicans who think the $792 billion tax cut is
too big. ``Those committed to getting this bill done are more
committed to getting it done at $792 billion than to any particular
provision.''
</P>
<P>
   But getting there may not be easy. And even after the House and
Senate negotiators reach agreement, they could face a tricky task
in selling the deal to their members, especially in the House,
where a renegade group of moderate Republicans is watching closely
to make sure their concerns are addressed in the final package.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are significant differences both in approach and in
structure in the House and Senate bills,'' said Trent Duffy, a
spokesman for Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the Ways and
Means Committee. ``Conferencing them will be challenging.''
</P>
<P>
   The House bill is generally more appealing to conservatives in
both chambers than the Senate bill, which was written to draw some
support from Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill, which was written by Archer, is built around a
gradual reduction in all income tax rates, a provision that
Republicans say would benefit those people who pay the most in
taxes but that Democrats say disproportionately rewards the
wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate version, which was written by Sen. William Roth,
R-Del., chairman of the Finance Committee, provides a smaller
income tax cut and directs a greater proportion of it to
middle-income households than the House bill. It would reduce only
the lowest income tax rate, bringing the current 15 percent bracket
down to 14 percent and expanding the bracket to higher income
levels.
</P>
<P>
   But the Senate version goes further than the House version in
addressing the so-called marriage penalty, a primary goal of social
conservatives, one of the most influential of Republican
constituencies. The Senate plan would almost eliminate the penalty
_ which leaves many two-income couples paying more in taxes than if
they were single _ by eventually allowing married couples to file
as if they were single.
</P>
<P>
   The House plan would limit its marriage penalty provisions to
people who use the standard deduction, meaning that it would do
little for higher-income couples, who almost invariably itemize
their deductions.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill contains a reduction in the top rate on capital
gains to 15 percent from 20 percent, while the Senate version has
no provision for capital gains.
</P>
<P>
   The House and Senate negotiators will have to maintain a
delicate political balance, retaining the appeal of the package
both to the conservative wing of the party and the moderate wing.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping that balance will be especially challenging in the
House, where Republicans have a razor-thin majority. A group of
Republican moderates in the House objected to the size and
composition of the original bill last week, forcing concessions
from the party's leaders intended to assure that the tax cuts would
not lead to renewed budget deficits.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Thursday, a group of those same moderates circulated a letter
demanding that the party retain a feature of the House bill that is
certain to bring intense objections from the Senate. The House bill
contains a ``trigger'' that would allow the income tax reductions
to take place only if the interest cost on the national debt does
not rise.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen of the Republican moderates had signed the letter by
Thursday night, suggesting that the leadership could have trouble
passing the final version of the bill if it does not include the
trigger.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of us have told the leadership that without a hard
trigger we will have difficulty supporting the bill,'' said Rep.
Fred Upton, R-Mich.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill has a procedural wrinkle that could also give
the negotiators heartburn. It would require that the tax cuts be
rescinded after 10 years, a provision that would be unappealing to
conservatives in the House.

 &HT;    Reeves: No trading holdout Anderson
 &HT;    By Matt Winklejohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Greenville, S.C. _ Falcons coach Dan Reeves acknowledged after
the first practice of training camp that the Washington Redskins
called to ask if holdout running back Jamal Anderson was available
to be traded.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins, who have three first-round draft choices next
yearl, are not alone in this regard.
</P>
<P>
   ``They called and other teams have called, and we've said we
don't want to trade Jamal,'' Reeves said. ``We wouldn't have been
where we were last year without Jamal. Jamal makes us as good as we
can be. We want Jamal here.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, three weeks ago David Ware, the Atlanta-based agent for
Barry Sanders, called Falcons officials offering to broker a
Sanders-for-Anderson trade.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons told Ware no thanks, partly because Sanders is 31.
Also, the Lions weren't likely to consider trading Sanders because
that would have cost them more than $7 million against the salary
cap.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Washington officials also inquired in Detroit about
whether the Lions would trade Sanders, who announced his retirement
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson probably isn't going to show up at training camp any
earlier than next week.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons have said they will not negotiate with him or his
agent until he shows up.

 &HT;    Falcons begin training camp
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Greenville, S.C. _ With a change in perspective, it was possible
as the Falcons began training camp Thursday at Furman University to
consider their backfield half full rather than half empty.
</P>
<P>
   True, All-Pro Jamal Anderson wasn't there, as he remains holed
up and holding out in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   But Byron Hanspard was back in full gear for the first time
since tearing up his left knee last summer.
</P>
<P>
   That, and the sights and sounds unique to training camp were
enough to pick up the spirits of coach Dan Reeves, who began the
day handing out rings to returning members of last season's NFC
Championship team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just to smell the grass and everything, you know the season is
coming,'' Reeves said. ``We miss Jamal, but I'll tell you what: if
Byron gets back to 100 percent of where he was . . . we'll have a
very good running game.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, who is seeking a new contract, was indeed missed.
Several running backs had a hard time hanging onto the football.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was too hot.
</P>
<P>
   It was 98 degrees when the team took the field. After lightning
and rain forced the team under cover for 20 minutes, the
temperature dropped to the mid-80s.
</P>
<P>
   Hanspard, who averaged 6.3 yards as a rookie in `97 when he had
three of the 12 longest runs in franchise history, will be back out
there today, as two practices are scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The knee feels strong,'' he said. ``I've never had any doubts,
but it was a matter of getting out here and getting that first
lick, taking that first hit.''
</P>
<P>
   That came Thursday when defensive end Chuck Smith cracked him,
and ripped the ball out of Hanspard's hands.

FACING REBELLION, HOUSE LEADERS BACK AWAY FROM VOTE ON HEALTH
CARE

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House Republican leadership, facing another
rebellion from some moderate and conservative Republicans, backed
away from plans to consider legislation on managed health care next
week, with Speaker Dennis Hastert conceding Thursday that a vote
before the August recess is now unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to dispense with a politically potent issue that
divides his party, Hastert, R-Ill., earlier this week moved to
bypass the normal committee process and put a senior group of
Republicans in charge of writing a modified version of the Senate's
managed care bill to bring to the floor for a vote next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday some House Republicans rebelled and reached out to
House Democratic leaders on the health issue. Rep. Greg Ganske,
R-Iowa, who is a plastic surgeon, accused Republican leaders of
``going back to the old days of stacking the deck against anything
that doesn't happen to fit in to the special interests of insurers
and HMOs.''
</P>
<P>
   And Rep. Charlie Norwood, R-Ga., a dentist who is usually a
staunch conservative, said he would demand a comprehensive health
care bill. ``Not frosting,'' he said, ``it's got to be the whole
cake.''
</P>
<P>
   Norwood said the Senate Republicans' bill, which passed on a
near party line vote earlier this month, ``isn't worth the paper
it's written on.''
</P>
<P>
   Emerging from a closed-door party caucus Thursday morning,
Hastert did not completely rule out a House vote next week, but
sought to dampen expectations that it would happen. ``We're working
on it,'' he said. But then he described the chances of a vote next
week as about as likely as a ``70-yard field goal'' in a football
game.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the afternoon, Rep. Dick Armey, R-Texas, the House
majority leader, said the likelihood of the issue coming to the
floor before the fall was ``diminishing.'' But, he added, ``we
haven't given up on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastert's struggle on health care was just another sign of the
difficulty he has had running the House with a majority so small
that only a five-vote swing can doom legislation. And as Congress
moves toward the busiest time of the year, each day brings new
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, House Republican leaders succeeded in passing their
$792 billion tax cut, but only after making concessions to both
moderates and conservatives. And House leaders are also struggling
to pass spending bills that require deep cuts in domestic spending.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, Republicans maintained party unity on managed
care despite a veto threat from President Clinton, passing a bill
that provided some protections for patients but complied with their
party's desire for only limited regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Senate bill's provisions on emotional issues like
access to emergency rooms outside a managed-care network, as well
as access to specialists and obstetrician-gynecologists, applied
only to the 48 million people in self-financed health plans usually
offered by large employers not regulated by states.
</P>
<P>
   But such people are rarely in health maintenance organizations
with the kinds of strict ``gatekeeper'' arrangements that have led
to many consumer complaints.
</P>
<P>
   House leaders favor a limited approach to health care
regulation. But Ganske, Norwood and another doctor _ Rep. Tom
Coburn of Oklahoma _ are leading a group of 20 to 60 Republicans
who are more sympathetic to the Democrats' approach, which seeks to
provide stronger protections for all 161 million Americans covered
by private health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   An intense competition was under way Thursday for their
allegiance.
</P>
<P>
   Several senior Republicans, under Hastert's instructions, were
trying to write a bill that could gain enough Republican votes to
pass. One congressman close to the negotiations said the
Republicans were seeking to broaden the protections for all those
with private insurance. They were also seeking to create a stronger
independent appeals process than the one contained in the Senate
bill for people who want to contest an HMO's decision to deny care.
</P>
<P>
   But a senior Republican aide said it was turning out to be
extremely difficult to calibrate the bill to win enough votes. ``In
many cases it's a zero sum game,'' he said. ``In many cases some
won't vote for the bill if X is in there and some will only vote
for the bill if X is in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Armey said that the issue of whether to expand the right to sue
a managed care provider was particularly thorny. In the Senate,
Republicans turned back an attempt by Democrats to expand the right
to sue health maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans have virtually no room to maneuver. They managed
to eke out passage of a managed care bill by a 216-210 vote last
year. But now there are five fewer Republicans, making the math
impossible unless the bill is changed to accommodate some
dissidents. And several Republicans who voted for the bill last
year insist they will not support a similar measure this year.
</P>
<P>
   In a highly unusual move, Ganske met Thursday with Rep. Dick
Gephardt, D-Mo., the House Minority leader, in search of a
bipartisan compromise. It was their second meeting in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   Such a cross-party appeal to the Democratic leader was almost
without precedent in this partisan year. Democrats are hoping to
win back the House in the next election and both parties are
putting a premium on party unity.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the Republican doctors Thursday, Gephardt said, ``I
respect deeply their sincerity. They have practiced medicine or
dentistry or nursing and they understand these issues from their
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can find a way to get a bipartisan bill that we can
pass, we are going to try to pass it.''
</P>
<P>
   Norwood was negotiating with Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., who is
the lead sponsor of the Democrats' managed care bill, and aides to
both men indicated that they were extremely close to an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   John E. Stone, a spokesman for Norwood, said only small issues
remained, adding that Norwood was checking back with Republicans
who are supporting him on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Republicans control the floor, Democrats can force
a bill to a vote through a special petition. Such a petition effort
rarely succeeds because supporting one is viewed as an act of
disloyalty to the majority party. So far 181 Democrats have signed
a petition on health care: no Republicans have signed.

FRENCH RETALIATE AGAINST DUTIES ON FOIE GRAS AND SHALLOTS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Canada, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Italy, Ga.)   By CRAIG R. WHITNEY  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Hit the French in the breadbasket, and they strike back.
Gallic resentment and retaliation ran rampant this week after the
United States and Canada levied customs duties of 100 percent on
imports of foie gras, Roquefort cheese, mustard and even shallots
in protest against the European ban on hormone-treated North
American beef.
</P>
<P>
   About 150 farmers in southwestern France occupied a McDonald's
restaurant on Tuesday in Auch, slapping posters on the windows that
said, ``No hormones in foie gras country.'' The franchisee, and
most of the beef it serves, are French, an employee in Auch said.
In any case, the occupation was over Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But a pancake restaurant in Dijon, Burgundy, informed its
customers that it would slap a 400 percent duty on Coca-Cola.
Although Coca-Cola is not imported from the United States but
formulated and bottled in France by French subsidiaries of the
parent company, the restaurant, Creperie Domino, charges 50 francs,
more than $8, a bottle, instead of 10 francs.
</P>
<P>
   The owner, Luc Olivier, described the move as a gesture of
solidarity with French producers affected by the American tariffs.
</P>
<P>
   France would seek compensation for its farmers from the European
Union in Brussels, Belgium, the Agriculture Minister Jean Glavany
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Canada imposed the sanctions because the
European Union has refused to lift its ban on beef treated with
hormones, even though the World Trade Organization in Geneva agreed
with the North Americans that the ban was more protectionism than
consumer protection and approved $116.8 million in sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers in Brittany, which exported 4,500 tons of shallots to
the United States last year, may be among the first to claim
damages. An exporter, Pascal Jaouen, said the wholesale price would
rise, from $1 a pound to $1.70, with the tariffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This measure could lead to more production of shallots in the
United States, which raises very few of them now,'' Jaouen said.
</P>
<P>
   Danish hams, Italian tomatoes and German soups are also on the
American list, which includes handbags, linens and cashmere among
luxury items that are the focus in another trans-Atlantic trade
dispute over European protection for banana imports from former
colonies.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that would actually lead Europeans to buy
hormone-treated beef if the European Union agreed to let in any of
it is unknown. The French daily Le Monde quoted Peter Scher, the
U.S. deputy trade representative, as saying the United States was
willing to work out labeling agreements.

 &HT;    Holtz game to rebuild Gamecocks
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Birmingham _ It was fitting that the last coach to speak during
the 1999 SEC Football Kickoff was South Carolina's Lou Holtz.
Nobody in his right mind would want to follow his act.
</P>
<P>
   When Holtz entered the Sheraton Hotel at 11:20 a.m. Thursday, a
dozen television cameras were waiting for him at the top of the
escalator. ``I was wondering what all those people had found out
about me and figured that I was probably in trouble,'' said Holtz,
who was whisked away into an interview room before the mob could
descend upon him. ``Then I realized it. This is the SEC.''
</P>
<P>
   It was quite a reception for a man who is taking over a program
that went 1-10 last season and was picked to finish fifth this
season by the media in the rugged SEC East. But what Holtz has is
something that South Carolina has lacked in its long but uneventful
football history _ star power. ``Lou Holtz is going to be good for
South Carolina, and he's going to be very good for the SEC,'' said
Mississippi State coach Jackie Sherrill, who as coach at Texas A&AMP;M
once trounced Holtz and Notre Dame in the Cotton Bowl. ``We haven't
seen too many guys like him around here.''
</P>
<P>
   Holtz won a national championship at Notre Dame in 1988,
performed magic tricks on ``The Tonight Show'' with Johnny Carson
and gets paid what is a year's salary for some just to give a
45-minute motivational speech.
</P>
<P>
   If there were any doubters before, Thursday's events proved that
Holtz is different.
</P>
<P>
   His address was one part prayer meeting, one part pep rally and
one part stand-up comedy routine. South Carolina has won just a
single bowl game in its history, but the 61-year-old Holtz is
convinced he can win in Columbia _ maybe not immediately, but soon.
``You might have noticed that I am not a young man,'' Holtz said.
``I don't have time for any eight-year rebuilding plan. But if I
didn't believe we could win at South Carolina, I wouldn't have
taken the job.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Holtz didn't want to take the job and turned it down on
three separate occasions. It took the insistence of his wife, Beth,
to return him to the sidelines Beth Holtz has been battling throat
cancer for more than a year, and Holtz did not want to jump back
into the profession while she was still in danger. Holtz reported
Thursday that his wife is doing fine and that the prognosis for her
is good.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is very special,'' he said. ``I don't pray for her; I pray
to her.''
</P>
<P>
   Holtz conceded that he does not have enough players to contend
with Tennessee, Florida and Georgia for the SEC East championship.
But with each concession he made to the shortcomings of the
program, Holtz would launch into an extended pep talk about how the
obstacles could be overcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at all at the schedule we play'' _ Tennessee, Florida
and Clemson are the last three games _ ``and the lack of winning
tradition we have and you ask, 'How can we win?' `` Holtz said. ``I
have believed all my life that there is an answer for every problem
that you face. You just have to go out and find it. I never
promised South Carolina we were going to win. I just promised them
that we wouldn't forfeit.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everything has been positive since Holtz arrived at
South Carolina. Last week, he officially dismissed running back
Troy Hambrick, the team's leading rusher the past two seasons.
Hambrick had sat out spring practice in an attempt to improve his
academic situation. Hambrick regained his eligibility but later was
found guilty of violating an undisclosed team rule. Last Friday,
Holtz told Hambrick he was through.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, it's a priviledge to play at a place like South
Carolina, not a right,'' Holtz said. ``If we're going to be
successful at South Carolina, we have to change. Everybody has to
change.''

TWO ATLANTA FIRMS ARE LEADERS IN `DAY TRADING' 
</HEADLINE>
  (With GA-SHOOT and related stories.) 
(mk) 
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The two brokerage houses where a gunman opened fire Thursday in
Atlanta, killing nine people, are among the most well known firms
specializing in day trading, the fast and furious, minute-by-minute
trading of stocks by computer.
</P>
<P>
   With offices in 23 cities across the country, All-Tech
Investment Group Inc., based in Montvale, N.J., is one of the
nation's largest day trading specialists. Momentum Securities, a
day trading firm in Houston, has branches in Chicago, Milwaukee and
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   A bull-market phenomenon, day trading has caught the fancy of
throngs of investors who believe they can profit from the smallest
of stock price changes in the course of a trading day. An estimated
5 million investors day trade currently, accounting for 15 percent
of the volume in Nasdaq stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Some trade in offices like All-Tech's in Atlanta, others trade
from their homes. Clients of the roughly 100 day trading firms in
the United States are typically required to put up at least $50,000
to open a trading account. Some firms, including All-Tech, offer
courses in day trading which train interested customers for a fee.
</P>
<P>
   All-Tech Investment Group's chief executive officer, Harvey
Houtkin, has been something of a day trading evangelist. A former
professional stock trader, he started the firm that later became
All-Tech in 1983. He calls himself the father of electronic stock
trading and has written two investing books on day trading
techniques, one with a drawing of a burglar's mask on the cover.
</P>
<P>
   Houtkin did not return a phone call seeking comment on the
shootings. But he told The Associated Press that his employees told
him that the suspected gunman, identified by authorities as Mark
Barton, hadn't traded since April.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (the gunman) was a former client,'' Houtkin said.
</P>
<P>
   Momentum Securities, founded in 1995, is run by James Lee, who
is also president of the Electronic Traders Association, a lobbying
group for electronic trading firms. Momentum Securities planned to
become a public company through a stock offering, according to a
news report late last month.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, All-Tech filed plans with the Securities &AMP; Exchange
Commission to issue stock in a public offering but the deal was
never done. At that time, the company said it had approximately
1,500 customers in 22 offices nationwide. These customers made
between 2,000 and 3,000 trades per day, according to documents
filed with the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   Day trading firms have come under fire in recent months from
securities regulators who believe the firms do not warn investors
adequately about the risks of losing money day trading. In May,
All-Tech settled a complaint brought by the Securities Division of
the Commonwealth of Massachusetts that a branch office of the firm
in Watertown, Mass., had misled customers with deceptive
advertising and misused customer funds. Matthew Nestor, director of
the Securities Division, said Thursday that the branch had
approximately 130 customers and that the firm's advertising
essentially said that day trading ``was easy, profitable and
anybody could do it.'' In settling with regulators, All-Tech agreed
to pay a $50,000 fine and reimburse customers $228,000, and said it
would not solicit customers from Massachusetts for two years.
</P>
<P>
   At its board meeting Thursday and before news of the shooting
emerged, the National Association of Securities Dealers approved a
measure requiring day trading firms to disclose to their customers
the risks associated with the trading practice. Mary Schapiro,
president of NASD Regulation Inc., said the rule will help protect
investors in an increasingly sophisticated environment.
</P>
<P>
   All-Tech's Web site downplays the risks in day trading. ``The
amount of money you can lose is directly related to your degree of
discipline in following the trading techniques our affiliate
All-Tech Training Groups, Inc., teaches.'' Elsewhere, the web site
stated: ``Electronic Day Trading attracts people dead-ended or
unhappy in their current field of endeavor and people with a desire
to make trading their life's work.''

 &HT;    Vols picked to be champs;
 &HT;    Carter chosen best QB
 &HT;    By Stan Arey
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Birmingham _ Tennessee was picked Thursday to repeat as
Southeastern Conference champion by the writers and sportscasters
at the SEC's annual football kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   Florida, a perennial threat, finished a distant second.
</P>
<P>
   The preseason picks in the Eastern division of the conference
are, Tennessee, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, South Carolina and
Vanderbilt. In the West, they are Arkansas, Alabama, Ole Miss,
Mississippi State, LSU and Auburn.
</P>
<P>
   In the voting for the preseason All-SEC offensive and defensive
teams, Florida placed only receiver Travis Taylor and center Zac
Zedalis, while Tennessee had seven on the two squads.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia sophomore Quincy Carter, last season's SEC freshman of
the year, was chosen over Tennessee's Tee Martin as the first-team
quarterback and Bulldog senior Orantes Grant was chosen as a
first-team linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   Quotable
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky coach Hal Mumme on why he chooses to go for it on
fourth-and-long so often: ``Dementia, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi State coach Jackie Sherrill on the media: ``We've
been through the spring, the summer, and now it's talking time.
It's up to all you writers to interpret what all the coaches say.
But I don't know of any coach who'll tell you the truth about their
team, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Mumme on senior linebacker Jeff Snedegar: ``He's the epitome of
a linebacker. We had to institute a no-contact rule in practice
because he was hurting so many people. I hesitated bringing him
here today because he only knows three words and none of them are
printable.''
</P>
<P>
   Snedegar on why he chose Kentucky over Ohio State and Michigan:
``Kentucky people are nice. Everyone else was rude.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-2, 243-pounder said he thinks that Kentucky's defense will
be the stronger part of the team this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can hold people to somewhere between 14 and 21 points, I
think we'll win. If it gets much over 21, we'll have a hard time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats allowed 38 points per game two years ago and 30
points last season.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander for Heisman
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the University of Alabama has decided to
push one of its players for the Heisman. Tailback Shaun Alexander
is the chosen one.
</P>
<P>
   The talented senior said, ``If I win it, I'll win it for Bart
Starr and Joe Namath and Cornelius Bennett and some of the other
great Alabama players who never got a chance at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Zow's the man at Bama
</P>
<P>
   Alabama coach Mike DuBose says that, contrary to popular belief,
there is no question about who the quarterback is in Tuscaloosa.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no quarterback controversy,'' DuBose said. ``Andrew
Zow is the starter, and Tyler Watts will get a chance to play. ``
</P>
<P>
   Life after Couch
</P>
<P>
   Mumme has installed Valdosta's Dusty Bonner as the quarterback
who will follow NFL No. 1 draftee Tim Couch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dusty has an unflappable personality and he'll have no trouble
following Couch,'' Mumme said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a freshman, we sent him in to throw a pass on a
fourth-and-long on a fake punt, and he completed it for a long
gain. Most freshmen's eyes would have gotten big as saucers, but
not his.''
</P>
<P>
   Game times
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia-South Carolina game Sept. 11 in Athens will be
televised by ESPN2 with kickoff set for 5 p.m. and Georgia's Nov.
27 game at Georgia Tech has also been scheduled for television with
a 1 p.m. kickoff on ABC.

   The politician, Neelan Tiruchelvam, 55, had risked death for
years pursuing a negotiated or legislated settlement of the strife
between the mainly Buddhist ethnic Sinhalese majority and the Hindu
Tamil minority in Sri Lanka, off the southern tip of India.
</P>
<P>
   ``He represented the essence of peace, sanity, good will _ all
the abiding human values,'' said Savitri Goonefekere, a law
professor who had taught Tiruchelvam. ``The horror of it is that
such horrible violence has killed such a gentle man.''
</P>
<P>
   Although no one claimed responsibility for the killing in
Colombo, the capital, the police blamed guerrillas of the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, who have been fighting for an
independent homeland for the Tamils in a conflict that has left
more than 50,000 dead.
</P>
<P>
   Tiruchelvam, a Tamil, favored a peaceful resolution that would
provide Tamils a share of power and autonomy within a united Sri
Lanka, an idea that the guerrillas rejected. As a member of
Parliament and a Harvard-educated legal scholar, he had helped
draft a package of constitutional changes that President Chandrika
Kumaratunga, a Sinhalese, was expected to introduce in a month or
two.
</P>
<P>
   The disaffection of the Tamil minority is rooted in decades of
discrimination by the Sinhalese majority. Tiruchelvam had been a
critic of successive governments for their obstinacy in dealing
with Tamil grievances. But he always promoted a resolution through
peaceful negotiations and legal reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was probably the most articulate and renowned spokesperson
for moderate Tamil opinion,'' said P. Saravanamuttu, executive
director of the Center for Policy Alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, India and the United Nations condemned his
assassination. The U.N. secretary general, Kofi Annan, called it
``an act of terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   Tiruchelvam, who led the International Center for Ethnic Studies
in Colombo, was often consulted by visiting journalists, diplomats
and scholars. And he well knew that his temperate views made him a
target for separatist rebels, who have used assassination in the
past to kill political leaders in their way. But he shrugged off
danger in a fatalistic good-humored way.
</P>
<P>
   The string of killings is impossible to ignore. The Liberation
Tigers were accused last year of killing two mayors of Jaffna who
belonged to Tiruchelvam's party, the Tamil United Liberation Front.
They were also accused of lobbing a grenade in 1997 that killed a
member of Parliament, also from the Tamil United Liberation Front.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel group is also widely believed to have dispatched the
suicide bombers who killed President Ranasinghe Premadasa in 1993
and Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neelan knew that he was working against tremendous odds, and
he was quite aware of the risks, but he always believed one has to
take risks and work toward broader goals,'' said Jayadeva Uyangoda,
a professor of political science at the University of Colombo.
</P>
<P>
   The police said Tiruchelvam left his home in an exclusive area
of the city, Cinnamon Gardens, Thursday morning, heading for his
office, when a suicide bomber leaped from the side seat of a
motorcycle and set off the deadly explosion a short walk from the
prime minister's house.
</P>
<P>
   The bomber's body blew apart, and Tiruchelvam's mutilated body
slumped over in the back seat of his Nissan. His driver and
bodyguard were seriously wounded. The motorcycle driver, who is
thought to have been wounded, escaped.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, human rights advocates and scholars gathered at
Tiruchelvam's home to comfort his wife, Sithie, and their son,
Mithran, 24. Their other son, Nirtuganan, 26, had not reached
Colombo.
</P>
<P>
   Jayampathy Wickramaratne, a lawyer on the committee for the
proposed constitutional changes, said Tiruchelvam had been eager to
see the president offer the plan in Parliament and was optimistic
that the opposition, the United National Party, would be forced to
support it.

ALBRIGHT HEARS CHEERS,JEERS IN BALKANS

Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia _ As President Clinton and other world leaders
headed here in search of a durable peace in the Balkans, Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright was confronted by the region's enduring
tensions during a visit to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, who stopped Thursday in the Kosovar capital, Pristina,
on her way to the gathering in Sarajevo, was jeered by a crowd of
Serbs as her motorcade visited a monastery. But earlier, in a
speech to ethnic Albanians, she was cheered amid chants of
``U.S.A.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright, the highest ranking U.S. official to visit Kosovo,
brought a message of restraint and reconciliation, telling a crowd
of ethnic Albanians, ``democracy cannot be built on revenge.''
</P>
<P>
   While Albright held meetings with political leaders, a shot was
fired in the street outside.
</P>
<P>
   In Sarajevo, members of the European Union held preliminary
meetings with leaders of the region to press a message of inclusion
should the nations end differences that have fueled years of ethnic
war.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's summit, first envisioned by Clinton and German
Chancellor Gerhardt Schroeder, was designed to launch the Balkan
Stability Pact, an outline for rebuilding the southeastern corner
of Europe much like the Marshall Plan put western Europe back on
its feet following World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The Balkans are one of Europe's poorest, least-stable and most
war-torn regions.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton arrives in Sarajevo after an overnight stay at
Aviano air base in Italy, he is scheduled to meet with the Bosnian,
Croatian and Muslim members of Bosnia's joint presidency. Later,
before the summit formally opens, Clinton is scheduled to meet
privately with the prime ministers of Bosnia's two states, Slovakia
and Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
   The summit is seen as a first step to putting the Balkans
states, Albania, Bosnia, Bulgaria, Croatia, Slovenia, Macedonia and
Romania on the road toward economic, political and security
integration with the rest of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   During the three-hour summit, most of which will be conducted
behind closed doors, regional leaders will present their plans for
political and economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   The commitments will be used by the European Union and the
United States in determining whether and how quickly the Balkan
nations are admitted as members of the E.U., NATO and the World
Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Sarajevo was picked by European Union planners as the summit
site for its symbolic value. Here, in 1914, the assassination of
the heir to the Austrian throne triggered World War I. In the early
1990s, the city was scene of some of the fiercest fighting of the
Bosnian war.
</P>
<P>
   Today, four years after the Croats, Muslims and Bosnian Serbs
traded fire in the streets, Sarajevo has yet to return to normal.
Many buildings bear scars of the conflict _ pock-marks from
bullets, walls sheared off by artillery shelling, and piles of
rubble from mortar fire.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment runs at about 50 percent, according to the United
Nations, largely because of delays in funding for privatization
programs. The largest and steadiest supplier of jobs are the UN
agencies overseeing Bosnian reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our meeting (in Sarajevo) I think symbolizes our shared hope
for the region,'' said Sandy Berger, the president's national
security adviser. ``We're ending the 20th century in Sarajevo with
the nations of Europe and North America coming together to talk
about how to build a peaceful region.''
</P>
<P>
   Conspicuously absent from the session will be Yugoslavian
President Slobodan Milosevic, an indicted war criminal who was not
invited, largely to re-emphasize to his Serb followers that until
he is driven from office, Yugoslavia will remain cut off.
</P>
<P>
   During the summit and in meetings later with regional reporters,
Clinton will press his case against Milosevic. He plans to draw
distinctions between the Milosevic government and the Serbian
people and renew his insistence that Yugoslavia receive only
humanitarian aid _ mostly food and medicine _ until a new
government is installed in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message (to the Serbs) will be simple: with Milosevic, you
are excluded and isolated from the rest of Europe,'' Berger said.
``With a government committed to democratic reforms and
international cooperation, we are prepared to help bring Serbia
into the European mainstream.''
</P>
<P>
   Leery of funding any project that might aid the Milosevic
government, the U.S. has balked at a proposal by the European Union
to help rebuild Serbia's energy infrastructure, which was damaged
during the 79-day air war.

YUGOSLAV OPPOSITION LEADER BALKS AT CHALLENGING MILOSEVIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Dragoslav Avramovic is sorely tempted to
heed the call, but he's nearly 80 and has serious kidney troubles,
and he's not really sure the moment is ripe.
</P>
<P>
   Avramovic, a frail, unlikely looking technocrat, is the most
popular opposition figure in Yugoslavia, revered for beating back
hyperinflation in 1994. The Clinton administration and the
foundering Alliance for Change here are pushing him to become the
prime minister of Serbia, the overwhelming power base in
Yugoslavia, and thereby take a leading role in the effort to oust
Slobodan Milosevic from the presidency of the Yugoslav federation.
</P>
<P>
   But Avramovic, who speaks modestly but enjoys the spotlight,
really is not convinced, he said in an interview on Wednesday, just
before leaving on Thursday for Sarajevo, to attend a Balkan summit
conference as the representative of the Serbian political
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm conscious of the pressure, and every morning I have a
serious self-examination about whether to get in deeper and
deeper,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The country badly wants change, but not revolution, he said, and
the opposition ``has to have a theory about how it's going to work
out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You just can't move from day to day without some idea of how
it's going to work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Alliance for Change, to which Avramovic belongs, and its
rival, the Serbian Renewal Movement, which is led by Vuk Draskovic,
both suggest the naming of a transitional government that they hope
Milosevic will be forced to accept by popular pressure. That
government is supposed to bring Yugoslavia back to the world's good
graces and organize new elections, while Milosevic is supposed to
resign.
</P>
<P>
   A key member of the alliance, Vuk Obradovic, a former general,
has openly pushed Avramovic to accept the leadership, as has the
alliance coordinator, Vladan Batic. Avramovic, who will be 80 in
October, is the least controversial possibility, with the broadest
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would agree to serve, Avramovic sighed.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, will there be a transitional government?'' he said.
``How will it take place?'' He continued, ``There's a theory that
it will end up with a general strike, with all these people in the
streets, but that's not clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Second, he said, ``I'm not a young man, my health is not the
best, and while I'll do what I can, I naturally have some
reluctance to take on something with such demands.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there is his wife, Marija, ``who thinks whatever I do
is wrong,'' he said. ``My wife says her whole life has been
centered around me and public affairs,'' he continued, ``and it's
high time to have some family life.''
</P>
<P>
   The country demands and needs a change of leadership, he says.
``The pressure comes from the feeling that there is no prospect for
improvement now, for citizens or for their children,'' he said.
``The prevailing uneasiness and demonstrations reflect this lack of
perspective, and people in the streets reflect this pessimism and
need for change.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, he said, Milosevic has been in power 10 years, ``and
there is an internal fatigue of a sort and a lack of imagination.''
While Milosevic ``must feel it's not all his fault and the world
illegitimately pushed him into a corner over Kosovo,'' Avramovic
said, ``the government should not have gotten into a situation
where the whole world is our enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   Avramovic, a socialist and lawyer who spent more than 20 years
working with the World Bank, is disarming but shrewd. He says he
wants to do no harm to the opposition, which he thinks is improving
in its ability to work together. But he also has a healthy regard
for the tactical strength of Milosevic and his ability to keep a
tightly constrained economy afloat.
</P>
<P>
   Avramovic served Milosevic from 1993 to 1996, mostly as governor
of the central bank, probably saving the regime by ending
hyperinflation.
</P>
<P>
   His actions made him wildly popular. By ordering the exchange of
12 million old dinars for one new dinar equal to the German mark,
he stabilized prices, wages and pensions, expanded the economy and
gave the poor, old and working class not only hope, but sustenance.
</P>
<P>
   He was dismissed in May 1996 after calling for the government to
resign after a dispute over monetary and fiscal policy, when he
urged curbs on renewed inflation and refused to hand out loans
indiscriminately. His popularity increased, and he is known as Deda
Avram, or Grandpa Avram.
</P>
<P>
   He agreed to lead the list of opposition candidates in the 1996
federal and local elections, and the list of the coalition Zajedno
itself bore his name, as the list of the ruling coalition bore the
name of Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   But shortly before the elections, Avramovic pulled out and
insisted on taking his name off even the collective list. Many of
the opposition were hurt and furious; Avramovic said simply that
his health was too poor, but there were rumors, which he denies,
that he was somehow blackmailed.
</P>
<P>
   This week, he talked about the decision, as he has rarely done.
His health was indeed poor, he said; while he is off dialysis now,
he was then having it three times a week, and his blood pressure
was too high. But he also said he felt there were too many
divisions within Zajedno, and that he ``was pushed into deciding
who would get what post, which was not my job.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a politician by training or by instinct,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And last, ``the coalition was moving too much to the right for
my taste,'' both economically and politically, with too much of a
nationalist tinge, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nationalism continues to disturb him, especially as the world
wants ``a non-domineering nation in Yugoslavia.'' He thinks Kosovo
was a disaster and could have been kept within Yugoslavia had
Milosevic agreed to make it a federal republic, instead of removing
all its autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   The Milosevic government is not yet printing money, he said, and
while there is a deep recession, basic commodities and food are
probably adequate for the winter and at relatively stable prices.
</P>
<P>
   But electricity is another matter. Many Yugoslavs heat with
electricity, and the distribution system and the refineries were
badly damaged by NATO bombs. Some government ministers say they
think that supplies will be one-third less than last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can import electricity, will we have the hard currency
for it, and if we get it, can we transmit it?'' Avramovic said.
``Really, this is the main threat to the regime.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many middle-aged Americans have taken to heart the advice to
plan for retirement _ by socking money away in 401(k) plans, IRAs
and other investments. But few have given much thought, experts
say, to a long-term plan for their lives _ how they'll spend their
time and energy. With longevity increasing, that can be just as
important.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think about life itself _ how you'll want to allocate your
time and resources,'' said Dr. Margery H. Silver, a clinical
instructor in psychology at Harvard University Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone who wants to start a business at age 55 will need a
chunk of money,'' Dr. Silver noted, as will someone who wants to go
back to school to prepare for a new career. And those who want to
focus on family and volunteer work will need enough income from
pensions and investments.
</P>
<P>
   Which of these life choices is best depends on the individual.
What is not good is the loneliness and inactivity often faced by
those who drift into retirement with no clear agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't use the models of your grandfather or your fathers
and mothers,'' said Dr. James E. Birren of the University of
California at Los Angeles. ``They didn't have the gift of long life
that we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Birren, who founded the gerontology program at the University of
Southern California in 1965 and is now associate director for the
Center on Aging at UCLA, said, ``I'm 81, but I haven't learned how
to spell retirement yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack A. Berman, 84, of Los Angeles, has reduced his work hours
but enjoys an activity-filled life. A former business professor at
the Chicago campus of Northwestern University, he moved to Los
Angeles in 1953 and opened his own business as a manufacturers'
representative in electronics, but also kept teaching others in his
field.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, Berman sold his business, but he has continued
teaching, having conducted 11 seminars in Tokyo, for example, for
the International Marketing Council of Japan. ``Transition is a
better word than retirement, Berman said. ``You need to plan ahead
so you can make the transition to something that is new and
creative.''
</P>
<P>
   Berman mentioned a friend who retired as a physician but, having
also been a musician, organized a chamber orchestra. ``Others I
have known have stopped working at the traditional 65 and died
within five years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To help adults in transition think productively and to define
their interests, Birren has organized classes in what he calls
``guided autobiography.''
</P>
<P>
   He asks the participants to chart how much time they spend in 10
areas: family, friends, health and body, homemaking, career and
work, money, education, religion, leisure and public service, as
well as personal pursuits like travel and crafts.
</P>
<P>
   Birren, a co-author of ``Where to Go From Here: Discovering Your
Own Life's Wisdom in the Second Half of Your Life'' (Simon &AMP;
Schuster, 1997), advises keeping a time diary to get an accurate
picture, then considering where to add or cut back.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Silver of Harvard said the goal ``is to live your full life
potential in good health,'' learning how to handle and shed stress,
devoting time to exercise and proper nutrition and, most of all for
those over 50, ``seeking a new infusion of ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Berman seems the personification of this. ``It would be a
terrible thing for me to wake up in the morning and wonder what I
was going to do today,'' he said. But he is hardly all work and no
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we get older, it is even more important to have fun,'' he
said, ``do challenging things, exercise the brain.'' Thirteen years
ago, Berman, then a widower, met Pearl Brown, a widow and clinical
psychologist; they married two years later _ after taking dancing
lessons so they could do a head-turning waltz at the reception.
</P>
<P>
   Now they go dancing twice a week, having appeared two years ago
in a dance scene in the Jack Lemmon-Walter Matthau film ``Out to
Sea.'' ``I'm definitely younger than I was when I met her,'' Berman
said. His wife, who still has a three-day-a-week psychology
practice, water-skis daily at their summer home at Lake Arrowhead,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   While such activity may be unusual among their generation, it
may not be when younger generations reach their age. There are
70,000 centenarians in the country today, Dr. Silver said, but ``we
know that something like three million baby boomers are going to
live to be 100,'' and that the fastest-growing population group is
85 and older.
</P>
<P>
   ``That has broad implications for retirement planning,'' said
Dr. Silver, who with Dr. Thomas Perls wrote ``Living to 100''
(Basic Books, 1999). Such longevity, she said, may mean second or
third careers.
</P>
<P>
   Edmund Aleks, 59, retired four years ago from the Los Angeles
District Attorney's office and now runs his own investigative
service. ``It was a great job, a great department,'' he said. ``I
left a happy guy.'' A good pension and a couple of lucky
investments let him strike out on his own, working as he chose.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the importance of health, he said he works out at least
four times a week at the Los Angeles Athletic Club and plays
racquetball with old friends from work. Most important, he has more
time to talk with his son, a third-year resident in anesthesiology
in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think any father in the world,'' he said, ``thinks he
spends enough time with his son or daughter.''

<P>
   The sassy New Beetle has become a highly recognizable symbol of
Volkswagen's resurgence in the United States, but the real
workhorse in the showroom has been the company's best seller _ the
less retro, more roomy Jetta sedan.
</P>
<P>
   The American small-car market has been dominated by Japanese
auto makers who have churned out sturdy, sporty models year after
year. Volkswagen, after a decade of dwindling sales and quality
problems, has undergone something of a renaissance lately by
re-energizing its styling with fresh, curvaceous lines, refocusing
its advertisements to attract young buyers and recalculating how it
dresses up its cars.
</P>
<P>
   VW had pretty much been an also-ran to the coolly efficient
Honda Civic, one of the best-selling small cars, and other foreign
entries. VW was also hurt by a reputation for slipshod quality,
though it seems to have made some solid gains on that score lately.
</P>
<P>
   This year, on the heels of New Beetlemania and a midsized Passat
that got plenty of praise from most car critics, VW is offering a
restyled Jetta, the four-door-with-a-trunk based on its hatchback
sibling, the Golf. With the Jetta, VW is trying to take on the
pint-sized competition by offering a more spirited car under the
hood with a lot of standard features and people-pleasing details
inside.
</P>
<P>
   Starting at $17,325, compared with $13,200 for the lowest-priced
Civic DX sedan or $15,245 for the best-selling Civic LX version, VW
is boldly suggesting that although these cars are about the same
size, more money buys a lot more car in the Jetta.
</P>
<P>
   This was no small gamble for VW, because so many buyers in this
market make up their minds based on reputation and value, two
categories in which the Japanese, especially Honda, have excelled.
But so far, the strategy is paying off: sales of the new Jetta are
up 26 percent over last year while sales of Civic sedans are off a
bit this year.
</P>
<P>
   In a test of both the Jetta GL, the least-costly version, and a
Honda Civic sedan, I found that while you quickly sense the Jetta's
power and acceleration, its handling was not as proficient as the
Honda's. The Jetta leaned slightly but noticeably in turns, and the
engine and suspension produced a tad more road noise and a harsher
ride than that of the smoothly competent Civic.
</P>
<P>
   But the Jetta stood out in two aspects. One is its delightful
styling. Big, bold wheel openings play off a smooth, arcing roof
that provides a styling touchstone for all VW models and echoes
through to the arched eyebrow over the instrument cluster.
</P>
<P>
   I loved the way the top half of the adjustable steering wheel,
like the bigger Passat's, lined up neatly with the curve of the
dash in front of me. And the gauges, backlit with neon blue and
highlighted with bright red needles, finished off an eye-catching,
sporty cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   The other plus is that the product planners have done their
homework. They have studied the Civic and other popular small cars
feature by feature and either matched the competition or gone them
one better.
</P>
<P>
   The stripped-down Jetta GL comes with many features that other
auto makers put only on higher-line models. It has
air-conditioning, power locks, a compact disk player and a keyless
locking system. Honda Civics offer these features, but only on the
more expensive LX and EX versions.
</P>
<P>
   In the safety area, VW has two front air bags and two side air
bags in both front seats. The Civic has two front bags, none on the
side. On the Jetta, anti-lock brakes are standard; the Civic
includes this safety feature only on its top-of-the-line EX, which
starts at $17,145 with a manual transmission.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the Jetta has three adjustable head restraints in its rear
seat, with lap-and-shoulder belts for three passengers, too. The
Civic has two built-in headrests and lap-and-shoulder belts; there
is only a lap belt for the center passenger.
</P>
<P>
   The Civic is a larger car, with a wheelbase four inches longer
and an overall length three inches beyond the Jetta's. The
difference is seen in the Civic's leg room, which is slightly
better, both front and rear, though VW improved the Jetta's leg
space this year by an inch over the previous model.
</P>
<P>
   The Jetta has the larger trunk _ though neither could swallow my
bag of golf clubs. For that, I used the folding rear seat to stow
them lengthwise. Both the Civic and the Jetta have lockable,
folding, two-piece rear seat backs in 60/40 splits.
</P>
<P>
   Smartly, though, VW has placed the locks for the seat backs near
the passenger doors on both sides of the seat; Honda's one lock is
in the center, requiring you to get in the seat and turn around to
unlock it.
</P>
<P>
   Up front, the Jetta is powered by a 2-liter four-cylinder engine
with a cast-iron block and two valves in each cylinder. Its 115
horsepower is plentiful, but what is truly impressive is its
considerable torque at modest speeds. But it does not do much for
fuel economy. With a five-speed manual gearbox, the Jetta registers
a so-so mileage rating of 24 city and 31 highway; the rating is
22/28 with a four-speed automatic.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, VW added a turbo-charged, direct-injection
diesel to its Jetta line. The 2-liter engine gets a whopping 42/49
miles a gallon; prices start at $18,520.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the Civic's leanly efficient base engine _ a
1.6-liter, aluminum-block four-cylinder _ produces 106 horses and
manages a thrifty 32/37 miles a gallon with a five-speed manual
(28/35 with a four-speed automatic). This is the first gasoline
power plant to meet California's tough low-emission standard.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Jetta and the Civic offer bigger engines on more
expensive versions. VW has a top-of-the-line GLX with a 2.8-liter,
174 horsepower V6. The Honda Civic EX uses Honda's
variable-valve-timing technology for a more efficient, cleaner
engine that produces 127 horsepower from a 1.6-liter, four-cylinder
power plant. The V6 Jettas begin at more than $20,000; fully
loaded, they exceed _ gulp _ $24,000.
</P>
<P>
   While the Jetta struck me as a very well conceived car, I did
catch a few goofs. One was that the neatly adjustable cup holders
that pop out of the dash obstruct access to a storage bin and the
driver's view of the top of the stereo. And while the sun visors
include lighted vanity mirrors for both front occupants, the
mirrors are covered by lids that, when you flip them up, block the
light embedded in the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   And one final annoyance. The windshield wipers kept noisily
slapping the body of the car. Was this bad adjustment or a Janis
Joplin retro touch?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE TRACK A small car with some big-car touches but a
not-so-trim price.

UNAUTHORIZED DAYS TO REMEMBER  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 1)

   (italics)People may use terms like truancy and playing hooky.
But as the mail indicates, sometimes a little unauthorized time off
from work can lift the spirit and refresh the soul _ if you don't
get caught.(end italics)  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One summer Friday, when he was Philadelphia bureau chief for The
Associated Press, George Zucker decided to spend a day at the race
track. ``If there's any emergency, call the clubhouse,'' he told
his deputy. ``The maitre d' has a telephone.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, writes Zucker, who is now retired and lives in
Haverford, Pa., ``just as I was getting down to some serious
losing, the maitre d' came to the table and said my office was on
the phone.''
</P>
<P>
   The caller was the deputy. ``New York needs to talk to you right
away,'' he said. ``I told them you were on the road, and I would
try to track you down.''
</P>
<P>
   Zucker writes: ``Public phones weren't available during racing
hours, so the track's public relations guy said I could use the one
in his office. He showed me to his desk and closed the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as my boss came on the line, the stentorian voice of the
track announcer boomed from an office speaker: `The horses for the
fifth race are now entering the track!''' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Having found our dream house in another state, my wife and I
considered ourselves fortunate to find jobs in the same company,''
writes Will Hall, a scientist who is now retired and living in
Springvale, Maine. She was a secretary to a vice president; he was
a research supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   But they soon found their workplace unfriendly. ``Driving to
work one morning, we joked about playing truant until we thought of
a way we could work it,'' Hall writes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found a phone, and I called my office to say that we were
terribly ill, perhaps from the slightly odd-tasting fried shrimp
we'd had for dinner. Then we drove to Atlantic City, where we saw a
couple of shows, enjoyed some good food and drinks and very
carefully avoided getting too much sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several days later, as we were driving to work, we were struck
by the idea of trying it again; but we thought better of it and
determined that we had better find new jobs. Still, it would have
been fun to call in sick again and tell them we had finished the
fried shrimp.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One day, Kathy Gambrell of Washington decided to award herself a
day off from her job as an office manager for a doctor and to pay a
visit to Baltimore's Inner Harbor. So she called her boss and said
she was caring for a sick relative.
</P>
<P>
   The boss said that since she had to go to an all-day meeting
anyhow, it was OK for Ms. Gambrell to miss work.
</P>
<P>
   So Ms. Gambrell wasted no time boarding an Amtrak train for
Baltimore. ``And who should get on the same train, sitting two
seats in front of me on the Metroliner?'' Ms. Gambrell writes. ``My
boss, headed to an all-day conference in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   ``She never said whether she saw me or not, though I assume she
did. I was wearing shorts, a T-shirt and sandals and did not
exactly have an elderly relative in tow.
</P>

be somewhere else.'' &QL;

   In the summer of 1969, Martin Wakesberg, now of Burnt Hills,
N.Y., was 20 years old and working at his first full-time summer
job, as a file clerk for a scrap metal company in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was scheduled to work July and August with no time off, as
my raison d'etre was to fill in for the regular employees who would
take vacation,'' he said. ``But of course, as everyone knows, this
was the summer of Woodstock, and all my friends were going. What to
do?''
</P>
<P>
   He called in sick and went.
</P>
<P>
   ``The following Monday I went to work as scheduled. Later that
morning, I was filing papers and daydreaming about the past weekend
when my supervisor came up behind me and said quite matter of
factly, `So, how was Woodstock?' Without missing a beat, I turned
and replied, `Great!'
</P>
<P>
   ``He just smiled and walked away.''
</P>
<P>
   Wakesberg offers an epilogue: ``To this day, I have used my sick
days honestly.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL;

</P>
<P>
   ``Use truancy as a tool,'' is the advice to managers from Audri
J. Carr, the manager of new product sourcing and a project team
leader at Lucas Aerospace, a division of TRW in Aurora, Ohio. ``Use
it as a reward. Be understanding. Promote it quietly and within
reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Carr, who believes that more time off than a standard two
weeks a year fosters creativity, loyalty and productivity, cites
the example of a manager in her group who runs three times a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has now been joined by several other engineers who run with
him,'' she writes from Shaker Heights, Ohio. ``Lunch is supposed to
be 30 minutes. What with the four-mile run itself, changing
clothes, then showering and changing back, that time pushes one and
one-quarter hours at least.
</P>
<P>
   At first it bothered me. Was he abusing the time out for lunch?
Then I decided the real question was: Did he perform on the job?
Were his assignments completed well and on time? The answer was
yes. So let them run. Running is a great stress reliever.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Carr writes that she would rather manage ``a motivated,
productive employee than one with perfect attendance.''

GRAYING, IN BLACK AND WHITE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 1) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By FRED BROCK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the baby boomers age and the oldest of them contemplate
retirement, corporate purveyors of goods and services are
increasingly taking notice.
</P>
<P>
   As ads for products from bifocal contact lenses to Viagra
attest, the graying of America is forcing manufacturers and
retailers to shift away from an obsession with youth.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is the trend more evident than in publishing. In
addition to personal finance magazines, for which retirement topics
have become a monthly staple, there are an increasing number of
books on senior subjects. Here is a sampling: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FREE FOR ALL Everybody likes to get free stuff and two books
make it easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Best Free Things for Seniors,'' by Linda and Bob Kalian
(Roblin Press, $14.95), deserves praise for its directory of free
prescription drug programs. Most people, including many doctors,
don't know that the pharmaceutical industry has a tradition of
providing many prescription drugs free to people who can't afford
them, regardless of age.
</P>
<P>
   Company by company, the book explains how to qualify. Most drug
makers require a doctor's opinion of whether a person is needy,
along with some financial information.
</P>
<P>
   For low-income people on Medicare, which doesn't pay for
prescription drugs, such information could be vital indeed. The
same is true for low-income people of any age who lack health
insurance, or whose insurance doesn't cover drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The book also has a section on how to receive free or low-cost
dental care through various clinics and colleges, or from dentists
who volunteer their time.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the rest of the book is less helpful. Much of the
free stuff is not limited to seniors, and too many offers are
frivolous, like free recipes. In a section on finding money to send
their children to college, readers are advised to contact an
insurance company for a free computer disk on the subject; no
advice is provided, however, on how how to get rid of the insurance
agent who is likely to come with that disk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unbelievably Good Deals and Great Adventures That You
Absolutely Can't Get Unless You're Over 50,'' by Joan Rattner
Heilman (Contemporary Books, 11th edition, $11.95) is mainly
related to travel, a topic limited to a single chapter in the
Kalians' book. Maybe these authors ought to combine their resources
and write one book. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   RETIREMENT MATTERS If you're worried that you're not saving
enough for retirement, take a deep breath, relax and read ``The
Late-Start Investor,'' by John F. Wasik (Henry Holt, $14.95). It is
full of tips on rescuing yourself from spendthrift ways and on
investing more intelligently. Cash in life insurance policies if
you have no dependents, the book advises, and get rid of one of
your cars or buy a used car instead of a new one.
</P>
<P>
   Then take the money you save and invest it, Wasik says. He
describes various investment options clearly, explaining the risks
and rewards of each. A chart shows that if you could save just $100
a month at an 8 percent rate of return, compounded monthly, you
would have $18,417 in 10 years (or $48,329 in 18 years). Now if you
could just save $500 a month ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Retire and Thrive,'' by Robert K. Otterbourg (Kiplinger Books,
second edition, $22.50), addresses some nonfinancial issues of
retirement, like what to do with yourself when you quit working.
The book is most illuminating in its dozens of short profiles of
people who have happy and fulfilling retirements through volunteer
work, teaching and the like. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FUTURE VIEW ``Age Power: How the 21st Century Will Be Ruled by
the New Old,'' by Dr. Ken Dychtwald (Penguin Putnam, $24.95), will
arrive on the shelves later this month. It sees the aging of the
population as a series of train wrecks that can be prevented only
through measures like postponing the age at which people can
collect Social Security _ and means-testing for recipients.
Dychtwald, a psychologist and gerontologist, uses statistics for
his forecasts that may underestimate economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   A better look at the same subject is last year's ``America the
Wise: The Longevity Revolution and the True Wealth of Nations,'' by
Theodore Roszak (Houghton Mifflin, $25). It sees opportunity where
Dychtwald sees disaster. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fred Brock is an editor at The Times. His column on the approach
to and arrival at retirement appears the first Sunday of each
month. E-mail: fbrock(AT)nytimes.com. &QL;

   If America's streets and highways seemed devoid of Saturns on
Friday and Saturday, it was because tens of thousands of the cars
were converging on sleepy Spring Hill, Tenn., with headlights
shining and horns honking.
</P>
<P>
   The owners attended a two-day festival orchestrated by Saturn,
the General Motors unit, which called the event a ``homecoming''
because the cars are built at a sprawling factory there.
</P>
<P>
   Saturn fans drove from across the nation, with caravans from Los
Angeles, Seattle, Minneapolis, Boston and Miami stopping at Saturn
dealerships along the way to pick up more enthusiasts.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, one of the caravans passed through Secaucus, N.J.,
headed south on the New Jersey Turnpike.
</P>
<P>
   The owners were given tours of the factory, heard Hootie and the
Blowfish, Tim McGraw and Faith Hill in concert, and test-drove
Saturn's new sedan, the 2000 LS. A Staten Island couple planned a
wedding in Spring Hill to coincide with the event.
</P>
<P>
   Just in case anyone attending missed the point that a Saturn is
more than just a car, performers in a rhythm and dance routine used
car parts as musical instruments to tell the history of the
company.

 &HT;    Waltrip to confirm 2000 is final season
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Indianapolis Motor Speedway is NASCAR's next stop, and it also
will be the site for the retirement announcement of one of the
sport's legendary drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Darrell Waltrip, a three-time Winston Cup champion, has
scheduled a news conference for Thursday morning in Indianapolis.
After more than a year of speculation, Waltrip, 52, is expected to
confirm that the 2000 season will be his last behind the steering
wheel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is sad to see (Waltrip) retire, but I guess it is good when
someone can call it quits on their own terms,'' said Phillipe
Lopez, crew chief of the No. 66 Ford.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was all Darrell's decision,'' Lopez said. ``He is just at
a point where he wants to see and do other things in life,
especially be at home more with his family.''
</P>
<P>
   Travis Carter, co-owner of Kmart Racing, said, ``Time waits for
no man; (it's) time to move on'' for Waltrip.''
</P>
<P>
   Waltrip has been racing in NASCAR since 1972 and leads all
active drivers in career victories with 84. He is one of the few
``old-time greats'' remaining on the stock-car circuit, along with
Dale Earnhardt and Bill Elliott.
</P>
<P>
   Waltrip's retirement plans probably will boost the popularity of
the driver, who has not won a race since Darlington in 1992. Team
officials already are preparing for next season's farewell tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had meetings to discuss the pros and cons for next
year,'' Lopez said. ``Next to Jeff Gordon, (Waltrip) may have the
most highly publicized car next year. We are going to do everything
in our power to make sure Darrell goes out with a bang at each and
every race.''
</P>
<P>
   Waltrip needs to qualify
</P>
<P>
   The pressure is on Waltrip in more ways than one at Indy. He
used his last remaining car-owner provisional to earn a spot at
Pocono. He will have no such security at the Brickyard 400, needing
a qualifying time to participate in one of the season's biggest
races.
</P>
<P>
   Disabled list
</P>
<P>
   Winston Cup points leader Dale Jarrett probably will be without
the services of a key crew member in Indianapolis. Brian Clark, the
left-rear tire-changer for the No. 88 Ford, suffered two broken
toes during a Jarrett pit stop at Pocono on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctor said I should sit out four-to-six weeks, but I am
not one to let an injury slow me down,'' said Clark, who is on
crutches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am shooting to be back by Indy, but I know there is only a
slim chance of that happening. I'm probably looking at missing one
or two races _ well, definitely not more than one.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Hall, a tire-carrier for Kenny Irwin, took the place of
Clark at Pocono because his driver already was out of the race.
Hall might continue to be a temporary substitute at the Brickyard
400, because both the Jarrett and Irwin teams are owned by Robert
Yates Racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very important for us to have a good tire-changer,'' crew
chief Todd Parrott said. ``You've got to have a guy that can use
all of his arms or legs. It can mean the difference between a
second or two on a pit stop, which can be the difference in winning
a race.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark, 28, broke his left big toe and second toe when the car's
tail pipe landed on his foot.
</P>
<P>
   Extra laps
</P>
<P>
   A blown tire at Pocono has blown away Jeff Gordon's chances of
winning a record-trying third Winston Cup trophy in a row. He is
sixth in the points, 492 behind Jarrett.

   John Cabrer did not think. He just ran toward the noise. He saw
a man running right at him. The man's face was purple and red and
all twisted up with panic. ``Call the police!'' the man was
screaming, over and over.
</P>
<P>
   In the chaos after a mass shooting in an Atlanta office
building, Cabrer kept going. Security guards were running
everywhere. He crossed a walkway and found himself at the emergency
exit of All-Tech Investment Group. He looked inside a large room.
He saw a man with a bullet hole in his cheek. Silently, the man was
feeling his body to see where he had been hit.

   A few feet away, a man was on his back, eyes wide open, not
moving. Cabrer went to him. There was blood. Cabrer leaned forward
and began CPR.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd never done it before,'' said Cabrer, 30, an analyst for
the Georgia State Tollway Authority. ``When I pressed on his chest,
I could feel his ribs cracking. When I blew into his lungs, it was
coming right back out. He was gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Cabrer stood up and looked around. He saw another man on the
floor. Dead. Shot in the chest. Covered in blood. And then another
man. Also dead.
</P>
<P>
   Now people were rushing into the room. But the room was quiet,
or it seemed that way to Cabrer. The senses, he said, go a little
strange when you find yourself wandering the scene of the latest
American massacre.
</P>
<P>
   He noticed something on the floor. It looked like a 9 mm bullet,
a hollow point. He recognized it because he has his own 9 mm
handgun. Nearby, he saw what looked to him like the shell casing
from a .45-caliber bullet.
</P>
<P>
   Two guns, he thought.
</P>
<P>
   Cabrer looked for someone to help. The room was perhaps 40 feet
long. It had two long conference tables in the middle. There were
lots of chairs and computers. He started clearing chairs out of the
way. It seemed a useful thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   By the front of the room, a young woman was slipping into shock.
She had been shot in the hip, Cabrer said. People were covering her
with clothes to keep her warm. Off to her left was a man with
bullet wounds in his chest.
</P>
<P>
   Cabrer noticed an ambulance, and then a couple of paramedics.
``They really weren't prepared for what they saw,'' he said, his
voice sympathetic.
</P>
<P>
   The man with the chest wounds seemed to be alive when they took
him away. Cabrer wondered if the man would live. He heard a police
officer questioning someone. One snippet of the interview stuck in
his mind.
</P>
<P>
   The witness said the gunman walked into the office and said, ``I
hope this doesn't ruin your trading day.'' And then he walked into
the manager's office, closed the door, and started shooting, the
witness was telling the police officer.
</P>
<P>
   Cabrer looked into the manager's office. ``There was blood all
over the wall,'' he said.

BAY STATE EXPECTED ENACT HIGHEST MINIMUM WAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL CROWLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The Massachusetts Senate passed a $1.50 hike in the
minimum wage Thursday, all but guaranteeing that Bay State workers
will soon enjoy the highest such wage in the nation at $6.75 per
hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing's a done deal,'' said Massachusetts AFL-CIO
president Robert J. Haynes, ``and we're thrilled.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill, minimum-wage workers would see their paychecks
swell by 75 cents per hour in January 2000, and by another 75 cents
a year later.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Paul Cellucci is expected to sign the bill, bringing a
long-running political drama to a swift and unexpected conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Ilene Hoffer, a Cellucci spokesman, said the governor would
``look forward to signing'' the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks to be a wage hike that's very similar to what the
governor proposed, without the indexing to inflation that we think
would have been detrimental to the economy,'' Hoffer said.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, a significant hike in the state's $5.25 hourly
wage had seemed a long shot at best. House Speaker Thomas M.
Finneran had blocked prior efforts to raise the wage rate, and
Cellucci had called for a more modest, 90-cent increase.
</P>
<P>
   But Finneran dramatically changed his position on July 12,
proposing a $1.50 increase that was passed by the House the
following day. And Cellucci now agrees that the economy can sustain
the 29 percent wage increase.
</P>
<P>
   Senate President Thomas F. Birmingham, who has long sought a
higher wage, had hardly expected to follow the more fiscally
conservative Finneran's lead on the issue. But he gladly ushered
the wage bill through an uncontested voice vote in his chamber
Thursday, bringing the Senate in agreement with the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a victory for the hard-working people of the
Commonwealth,'' Birmingham said after the vote. ``This sends the
message that work does pay, and if you work for a living in the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts you ought to earn a living.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, a full-time minimum-wage earner in Massachusetts
takes home $10,920 per year. The federal poverty line for a family
of three is $13,300. Under the new law, the minimum wage will pay
$14,040 per year in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent report by Northeastern University's Center
for Labor Market Studies, 262,000 Massachusetts workers currently
earn less than $6.75 per hour with 93,000 of those workers earning
between $5.25 and $5.75 per hour.
</P>
<P>
   Although a political consensus has quickly formed around the
issue on Beacon Hill, business leaders and some conservatives
remain convinced that an increased minimum wage could endanger the
state's economy and scare off new business.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the economy here is very, very good, we are concerned
about the long-term impact the miniumum wage may have on the
creation or maintenance of minimum wage jobs,'' said Brian Gilmore,
a spokesman for the Associated Industries of Massachusetts (AIM).
</P>
<P>
   ``Minimum wages are at best public relations exercises, and
legislators enagage in them to satisfy their constituents, and
particularly their union consituents,'' said David Tuerck,
executive director of the Beacon Hill Institute, a conservative
think tank at Suffolk University. Tuerck warned that minimum wage
workers become ever more vulnerable to recession-triggered layoffs
as their pay rises.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those concerns, Massachusetts is about to leap ahead of
several other states to lead the nation with its wage rate. Oregon,
now the highest-paying state, requires an hourly pay of at least
$6.50 per hour. Washington state's wage will rise to $6.50 in
January 2000 and Connecticut's will reach $6.15 next year.
</P>
<P>
   The federally-mandated minimum wage is currently $5.15.
</P>
<P>
   Tuerck insisted that Massachusetts outpaces the rest of the
nation at its peril.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is another signal to the rest of the country that this
state is unfriendly to business, and a signal to investors thinking
about opening up fast food franchises that they might want to put
their money someplace else where they won't face as hostile a labor
environment,'' Tuerck said.
</P>
<P>
   But Birmingham disputed that notion Thursday, saying it is ``a
badge of honor'' for Massachusetts to be number one in the nation
in wages for its lowest-paid workers. ``It's a cause for
celebration that Massachusetts leads the country,'' Birmingham
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Lazere, a senior analyst at the Washington, D.C.-based Center
on Budget and Policy Priorities, noted that many Capitol Hill
observers expect the federal minimum wage to be raised to $6.15 in
the next year. ``I think there is the political will for it,''
Lazere said.
</P>
<P>
   The final Bay State bill will not link, or ``index,'' the
minimum wage to the inflation rate, a move some had proposed to
ensure wages keep pace with the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate passed an indexing provision earlier this year, but
Finneran and Cellucci oppose indexing, and Birmingham was willing
to yield on the issue for now.
</P>
<P>
   The wage law would not require employers to raise the base
hourly pay given to waiters and waitresses whose income, including
tips, already equals or exceeds the new wage rate.
</P>
<P>
   The law must still be formally enacted by the House and Senate,
votes considered a formality now that the two chambers have already
overwhelmingly passed identical wage bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no surprise in today's vote, but one year ago the
prospects for low-wage workers in Massachusetts looked pretty
bleak,'' said state Rep. James J. Marzilli, the House's leading
advocate for a wage hike.

MUTUAL FUND INDUSTRY TAKES TO THE WEB LIKE A DUCK TO WATER 
</HEADLINE>

Non-subscribers can make individual purchase by calling (888)

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 1)  
 (Eds: The word (star) in story should be replaced by the symbol)

 By ABBY SCHULTZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Click on ``buy.'' Click on ``sell.'' Click on ``payoff.''
</P>
<P>
   The mutual fund industry has joined the rush to the Internet
over the last two years _ and the move seems to be benefiting both
the fund companies and many of their customers.
</P>
<P>
   Investors can buy funds on the sites of many no-load fund
companies or through the sites of one of several brokerage firms
that offer fund supermarkets. To avoid losing customers to online
firms, many no-load fund groups, including the Vanguard Group,
American Century Investments and T. Rowe Price Associates, have
opened their own online brokerage firms, trading individual stocks
and sometimes offering thousands of funds beyond their own.
</P>
<P>
   Such supermarkets will be the conduits for the bulk of all fund
purchases by 2003, with most investors relying on fund company
sites for information only, according to James Punishill, author of
a report on Internet investing for Forrester Research, a consulting
firm in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   By 2003, Forrester predicts, investors will hold $1.2 trillion
in mutual fund assets in Internet-based accounts, up from an
estimated $128 billion by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   The most noticeable change brought by the Internet, however, has
been its capacity to deliver detailed research to virtually all
investors, no matter how much they have to invest. Using that
information _ which is often free _ investors can compare funds
before making choices.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of Web sites offer performance figures as well as
portfolio tracking, so investors can monitor their holdings and the
shifts in their asset mix of stocks, bonds and cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``The self-directed investor has at their disposal what five
years ago professional investors didn't even have at their
disposal,'' said Cebra Graves, Internet strategist at Morningstar
Inc., the financial publisher in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Morningstar's Web site lets investors compare funds and
portfolio holdings at no charge (www.morningstar.net). For varying
fees, investors can gain access to more detailed screens and data.
Morningstar also supplies data to other companies like
E(star)Trade, whose site provides free access to research and
sorting tools using end-of-quarter data.
</P>
<P>
   The Mutual Fund Education Alliance, an association of no-load
funds, offers a site at www.mfea.com with fund industry news,
investment planning tools and links to fund company sites.
Investors can register on the site to gain access to a personal
portfolio tracker.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the Internet lets investors get the information
they need when they want it. ``Inevitably, you didn't get the
brochure at the right time and, inevitably, the information you
need isn't in there,'' said Shelton S. Unger, head of on-line
services at Vanguard.
</P>
<P>
   With the Internet, a great deal of information is available
immediately, she added, and you ``sort of find your own path.''
Vanguard recently updated an investment planning service to allow
investors to prepare online for retirement, college or other
investment objectives. The service considers the user's risk
tolerance and time horizon, among other factors.
</P>
<P>
   One bonus for the fund industry is that many investors who know
the Internet are willing to receive routine information, like
shareholder reports, online instead of in the mail. That can help
keep down a fund's expenses. When an investor requests a prospectus
over the phone, for example, Vanguard spends $10 to $12 to respond
_ in labor costs for the phone representative and for printing and
mailing.
</P>
<P>
   Internet use is climbing at Vanguard: 37 percent of all
shareholders used the Web to get information or to make a
transaction in the first quarter of 1999, up from 20 percent a year
earlier, Ms. Unger said.
</P>
<P>
   The trend is evident elsewhere. At Charles Schwab &AMP; Co., 45
percent of all mutual fund transactions were on the Internet in
mid-June, up from 25 percent a year ago and 16 percent at the
beginning of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we see is that the process of investing is easier, richer
than it's ever been before,'' said Jeffrey M. Lyons, senior vice
president for mutual funds marketing at Schwab. Instead of
searching through magazine and newspaper articles for information
and advice, investors can go online to sort through thousands of
funds and run through detailed asset allocation scenarios for
growth or value investing as well as domestic or international
choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, immediately, they click a button and invest in the
fund,'' Lyons said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Schwab and other companies say the ease of Internet trading has
not caused investors to flip rapidly in and out of funds. Schwab
customers are charged a redemption fee if they sell shares within
six months of purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Brian C. Murray, general manager for E(star)Trade's mutual fund
group, which reserves the right to charge a fee for sales made
within three months, said, ``There appears to be an even stronger
buy-and-hold ethic than I expected.''
</P>
<P>
   The fund industry has also found the Internet to be useful for
reaching retirement investors. The 401(k) Forum is an
Internet-based retirement investment adviser hired by companies to
offer personal 401(k) advice to their employees.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity Investments, which already offers extensive Web-based
services to its retirement plan participants, is now offering a
service aimed at small businesses, ``e401k,'' that is a 401(k) plan
sold and maintained entirely over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the success of the Internet as a means for research, the
average investor remains a little reluctant to click and invest.
That largely reflects how many people began using the Internet just
last year, Forrester's Punishill said. In fact, most fund investors
with Internet access visit fund company sites only for tasks like
checking on a portfolio balance or downloading a prospectus,
according to a survey taken last fall and published by American
Century.
</P>
<P>
   Although 46 percent of Internet users with funds visited fund
Web sites in 1998 _ up from 28 percent in 1996 _ only 9 percent
bought or sold shares, up from 3 percent in 1996 but down from 11
percent in 1997, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason for their reluctance is the fear that the
Internet is not a secure place to conduct business. Some 52 percent
expressed concerns about making Internet fund transactions, though
that share was down from 68 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   People who buy funds on the Internet are more likely to use fund
supermarkets, where they can get consolidated statements and gain
access to funds from other companies, Punishill said. Although fund
companies have been forming their own brokerage firms, virtually
none of them _ with the exception of Fidelity and Vanguard _ will
be able to compete effectively with the big discounters, he
asserted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very few fund companies will have the resources or know-how to
turn themselves from a mutual fund company into a brokerage firm,''
Punishill said. ``They are different business models altogether.''
</P>
<P>
   Some experts say the majority of investors are unlikely to ever
use the Internet to buy or sell funds. Eli E. Neusner, a senior
consultant at Spectrem Group, a financial services consulting firm,
argues that as a percentage of mutual fund investors, those
investing online will peak in just a few years.
</P>
<P>
   Investors can be overwhelmed by the amount of information on a
Web site, Neusner said, and often prefer to speak with an adviser
for guidance, particularly when dealing with complicated issues
like estate planning or saving for a child's college education.
</P>
<P>
   On the Internet, he said, ``no one has found a thoroughly
efficient way of walking an uncomfortable investor or even a
moderately experienced investor through a financial strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   But Graves at Morningstar predicted that on-line technology
would evolve to the point that any client could use the Internet to
talk with a financial adviser online. Once that happens, he said,
``the Internet is no longer a technology that favors one
demographic over another.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Preparing for a presentation to the news media, Hugh
Stuart-Buttle was wondering how best to promote the products that
his company, Ciba Specialty Chemicals, markets for protection
against ultraviolet rays. A scrap of childhood memory came to mind:
his mother, when he was a fair-haired young boy playing outdoors,
imploring him to cover up under the bright sun.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart-Buttle smiled at the recollection and used it to lead
into the presentation he was rehearsing. ``That's the issue we want
to talk about today,'' he continued, eyes scanning an imaginary
crowd of reporters as he led into a description of the products'
``unique technological strength'' against the power of the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Seated across the conference table with a stopwatch in her hand,
Karen Berg, a communications consultant, nodded approvingly.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart-Buttle, the vice president for communications of Ciba's
North American division in Tarrytown, N.Y., was working to master a
technique that comes naturally to powerful speakers in politics or
the arts but until recently was seldom heard in business contexts:
personal storytelling as a way of enlivening speeches, sales
pitches, training sessions and other presentations on otherwise dry
or technical topics.
</P>
<P>
   Teaching the technique has become a thriving business for
consultants like Ms. Berg, who typically charges $3,000 to $4,000
for a session like the two and a half hours she spent with
Stuart-Buttle and a colleague a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that engages the mind's eye is more memorable than
just getting up and spouting off data,'' said Ms. Berg, chief
executive of Commcore Communication Strategies in White Plains,
N.Y. ``They will remember the visual images.''
</P>
<P>
   In the latest annual report of the Walt Disney Co., for example,
Michael D. Eisner, the chief executive, departed from the
boilerplate of sales figures and product lines that leads off many
companies' reports. To illustrate the changes in his company's
business, he wrote instead of watching the seasons change from his
office window.
</P>
<P>
   Communications consultants say that grabbing and holding an
audience's attention is more difficult than ever in a world glutted
with information. Relating to the audience on a personal level is a
way through the clutter.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are time-starved, they're drained, their attention span
is shorter, they're full of stress,'' Ms. Berg said.
</P>
<P>
   Consultants say companies with complex products and services _
those in science and technology, accounting and engineering _ most
often want help with ``soft'' communications skills like
storytelling.
</P>
<P>
   The companies see such techniques as providing an edge over
rivals that hawk similar products or services in more prosaic ways,
said James F. Hennig, a motivational speaker based in Chandler,
Ariz., who leads seminars on negotiation skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who are very relationship-oriented in their approach to
business communication and business deals do a lot better, because
they make people feel comfortable,'' Hennig said.
</P>
<P>
   But it can be difficult to persuade people who are accustomed to
dealing in facts and figures that telling a roomful of strangers
about personal experiences can help them achieve business goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm skeptical that it's going to be easily and quickly
accepted,'' said Susan Nurre, a Dallas-based management consultant
with the Computer Sciences Corp., a computer software and services
company with a large consulting division. ``It seems like quite a
few people would hesitate to tell a story, because they think
stories have to be about their grandmother.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Nurre herself is sold on the technique. In 1996,
Computer Sciences and Executive Communications Group of Englewood,
N.J., developed a program to teach storytelling skills to thousands
of employees in the consulting division of Computer Sciences, and
Ms. Nurre took to heart what she learned.
</P>
<P>
   One story she uses to good effect with her colleagues relates
how she improved her relationship with her mother-in-law, who
speaks Farsi but not English, by learning a few key Farsi phrases
as a sign of respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I use that story and tie it to the fact that as consultants,
we have to speak our clients' language,'' Ms. Nurre said. ``We
can't go in there spouting our language, because that won't make
sense to them. We need to show that we're respecting them and we
believe that what they're doing is important.''
</P>
<P>
   While it is impossible to quantify the value of storytelling to
her company's business, she says she believes it has helped gain
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Executive Communications Group has begun offering the
storytelling training to others in one-on-one sessions and in
one-day ``executive storytelling'' seminars. The first seminar,
held last year, attracted about 100 business people who paid $400
to $500 apiece, said Frank Carillo, the president of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Giuliano, the chairman, says he sometimes meets resistance
from executives who think storytelling has no place in serious
business. He responds with examples of analogies that clients have
drawn from the least likely sources, like fairy tales or fishing
trips, that when handled deftly conveyed useful business lessons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really requires a high level of strategy,'' Giuliano said.
``That's what differentiates executive storytelling from telling a
story across the kitchen table _ the strategic development and
intent of the story.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Satow, the president and a founder of a start-up
investment firm, Eclipse Trading, in New York, worked with Ms. Berg
at Commcore when he was preparing himself to seek investors.
</P>
<P>
   After learning the storytelling technique, he blended personal
stories and business information in presentations that brought
Eclipse several partners, including the giant brokerage firms
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and Salomon Smith Barney. One story he
often told was about the company's earliest days.
</P>
<P>
   He and Eugene Choe were working as lawyers for the Securities
and Exchange Commission when then they decided to leave their jobs
in April 1997 and found Eclipse, which is developing a system to
give individual investors access to after-hours trades.
</P>
<P>
   Soon afterward, Satow's wife, Barbara, told him she was
pregnant. ``I was sitting there thinking to myself, `My God, I'm
not making any money and she's pregnant,''' he says. ``In fact,
during that entire period, she kept working.''
</P>
<P>
   Relating that anecdote, Satow said, helped him demonstrate to
potential investors that he was dedicated to Eclipse despite the
stresses of a new venture.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're interested in the journey and what it took to get
there,'' he said.

WAY SEEN CLEAR FOR LARGEST TAX-CUT IN US HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senate Republicans Thursday thwarted threats to
their proposed $792 billion tax cut from across the political
spectrum, as they rebuffed a conservative effort to sweeten the
plan for the wealthy and scuttled Senator Edward M. Kennedy's push
to trim the breaks in favor of prescription-drug coverage for
Medicare recipients.
</P>
<P>
   A $500 billion compromise plan also buckled under the weight of
the Republican majority, as a bipartisan team of moderate sponsors
abruptly withdrew the measure rather than endure a crushing defeat.
</P>
<P>
   The developments cleared the way for the GOP majority to pass
the largest tax cut in history Friday despite warnings from Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and members of both parties that
the package may be more extravagant than the government can afford.
</P>
<P>
   The showdown reflected the strength of a new generation of
conservative leaders in the Senate who have consolidated their
power since the departure of former majority leader Bob Dole, a
more moderate conciliator, in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Lurching toward high-stakes negotiations with the White House
over the tax plan, leaders of the GOP juggernaut seized every
chance to portray President Clinton and his allies as the enemies
of fiscal restraint. ``Any dime that I can keep out of the hands of
the spenders and put in the hands of the taxpayers, I will,'' said
Senator Larry E. Craig of Idaho, chairman of the Senate Republican
Policy Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, bursting back into the political donnybrook after the
death of his nephew, John F. Kennedy Jr., wasted little time in
depicting the Republican majority as protectors of the privileged
at the expense of the poor. Deriding the GOP tax package as a boon
for ``the three-martini lunch'' crowd, Kennedy tried unsuccessfully
to counter a pledge from GOP leaders to address the lack of
prescription drug coverage for Medicare recipients in future
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why ask senior citizens to wait?'' he shouted on the Senate
floor. ``Why should they always have to be the ones to wait? Why
are they always left behind? It's a question of priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's initiative was defeated, 55-45, on a procedural vote,
with every Repbublican opposing the plan but one: Senator Arlen
Specter of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Only one Democratic senator, John B. Breaux of Louisiana, voted
against Kennedy's proposal to set aside an unspecified part of the
tax breaks to provide the first prescription benefit for Medicare
recipients since the program was established in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy also was expected to force the Senate to vote during the
tax debate on his plan to raise the minimum wage to $6.15 an hour
by September 2000, up from the current rate of $5.15 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before Kennedy's Medicare measure was defeated, Clinton
renewed his vow to veto the $792 billion plan, though the president
continued to leave open the door to as much as $300 billion in tax
cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope we can get a bipartisan agreement that will save Social
Security, save and reform Medicare, continue to invest in education
and get this country out of debt,'' Clinton told reporters at the
White House. ``If we do those big things first, there's still money
left for a good size tax cut. But what is being done now is
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, who has led
the GOP assault on Clinton's tax-cut policy, endured a setback
Thursday when a group of moderate GOP senators joined the unified
Democratic minority to kill an alternative, $792 billion tax-cut
plan sponsored by Republican Senator Phil Gramm of Texas and
supported by Lott.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, much like the $792 billion measure the House passed
last week, would have cut taxes by 10 percent across the board and
further reduced capital gains taxes. Both moves would have
benefited high-income taxpayers and corporations far more than the
chief Senate Republican plan, whose key element calls for reducing
the 15-percent income-tax rate to 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   With nine Republicans joining all 45 Democrats in opposing
Gramm's plan, the measure was defeated, 54-46, on a procedural
vote. Every New England senator voted against the Gramm plan except
Judd Gregg and Bob Smith of New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the political fray, Senator John F. Kerry appealed to the
Senate to devote as much as $20 billion to restore health-care
services that have diminished because of reduced Medicare
reimbursements.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry, whose measure was expected to be voted on Friday, cited
recent layoffs at Massachusetts General Hospital and cutbacks at
South Shore Hospital as examples of the need to increase the
Medicare reimbursements and ease a ``fundamental crisis'' in the
delivery of health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to consider the impact on our hospitals, home health
care, and rural communities,'' he said. ``And I beg my colleagues
to try to find the money that is going to save us from the loss of
the crown jewels of the American health care system, our teaching
hospitals.

GAS PRICES TOP SUMMER'S LIST OF CONFLICTS IN RUSSIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The major contenders in Russia's 2000 presidential
election already are slinging mud by the bucketful, the Kremlin is
under criminal investigation and the Communist Party's
once-unassailable base in Parliament is developing serious stress
cracks. But as political issues go, it is safe to say all that
pales next to this summer's national fixation: the price of a liter
of gas.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the world's largest oil-producing nations, ordinary
Russians are combusting over the rising cost of ``benzin,'' and
everyone from President Boris Yeltsin to lowly regional legislators
is seeking cover from the political fallout.
</P>
<P>
   Since last winter, when the world was awash in oil and prices
were relatively low, gasoline prices have nearly doubled in Moscow,
and in parts of the nation they nearly tripled before retreating
this month to levels that are merely scandalous.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons behind the increase range from a sharp rise in the
price of crude oil recently, which made the already devalued
Russian oil a world-class bargain, to the fact that the shaky ruble
has given Russian oil companies a ravenous appetite for hard
currency. The result is that Russian crude is leaving the country
on trains, tankers and in pipelines.
</P>
<P>
   That has placed Yeltsin's government in a political bind, forced
either to endorse a free market that is draining consumers' wallets
or to impose the sort of heavy-handed state controls that it
professes to despise.
</P>
<P>
   In the worst-hit areas _ St. Petersburg and southwest Russia's
Black Sea region _ gas supplies have at times all but dried up,
allowing profiteers to prey on helpless motorists and, at times, on
one another.
</P>
<P>
   The Moscow newspaper Kommersant reported this week that some
vacationers returning from Black Sea resorts were reduced to buying
gas for as much as $2 per liter, the equivalent of $7.50 a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   And in St. Petersburg, an executive at an oil company that was
accused of price-fixing and creating artificial gas shortages was
killed on Monday as he rode to work in his armor-plated Chevy
Blazer. His no-nonsense assailants attacked him during rush hour
with Kalishnikov automatic rifles and rocket-propelled grenades.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they presume the attack stemmed from a business
dispute as St. Petersburg's fuel companies are in a bitter war for
control of the city's retail gasoline market.
</P>
<P>
   Customers have, so far, been more forgiving. ``Some customers
just buy these cards _ it's a kind of a credit card _ and those who
have these cards had no problem with filling their tanks.'' Irina
Senko, an attendant at a busy station in central St. Petersburg,
said in an interview. As for the rest, ``They were angry,'' she
said. ``I explained to them that the refinery wasn't working, or
something.''
</P>
<P>
   At least some oil companies say they are innocent bystanders in
this economic carnage. One of the biggest, Lukoil, boasts that it
has continued to supply gasoline to its chain of more than 1,000
service stations even as competitors' pumps went dry.
</P>
<P>
   The company recently doubled gasoline production at a remodeled
refinery in in south-central Russia, and plans to boost production
at a second revamped refinery.
</P>
<P>
   In the company's view, the spokesman said, Russia's gas crunch
is due more to increased domestic demand than a desire for foreign
currency.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen O'Sullivan, a petroleum analyst and research director
for United Financial Group in Moscow, an investment firm, said that
explanation is unlikely. But don't blame the oil companies, he
added: they are simply behaving like businesses everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can get paid late, if at all, in a currency that's under
threat of devaluation, or they can get dollars,'' he said. ``The
oil companies are making a perfectly rational decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The government persuaded major oil companies and other
businesses to sign a so-called voluntary pledge to ``exclude
unwarranted price hikes'' this year. The International Monetary
Fund called the pact interference in the markets; private experts
predicted it would lead to shortages, which is apparently what
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did the pledge halt the rise in gas prices, because it did
not apply to the vast majority of the nation's service stations _
mom-and-pop operations, beyond the oil companies' control _ which
continued to set prices according to supply and demand.
</P>
<P>
   On July 23, the government proposed another tack: doubling the
petroleum-export tax. That would have benefited the government,
which already is enjoying a oil-tax windfall from the higher prices
and exports. But whether it would curb exports much is debatable
because exporting oil is highly lucrative for the oil companies.
With their considerable political clout, they fought the idea.
</P>
<P>
   So on Wednesday, officials abandoned that notion and pledged to
crack down on smuggling, promote increased oil production and use
unnamed ``economic measures'' to ensure that the gas drought in
parts of the nation ends.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed by Russia's Interfax news service to explain what that
meant, Deputy Prime Minister Nikolai Aksyonenko said it ``will
depend on people, since prices are determined by demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``In other words,'' he said, ``gasoline prices may increase.''

STOCKS TUMBLE SHARPLY AND BROADLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY JR.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices tumbled sharply and broadly Thursday
after the government reported that employers paid unexpectedly
large wage and benefit increases during the spring quarter, making
it more likely _ but by no means certain _ that the Federal Reserve
will again increase interest rates to avert inflation.
</P>
<P>
   As traders reacted to a 1.1 percent jump in the Labor
Department's Employment Cost Index, the main gauges remained in
negative territory throughout the session. The Dow Jones industrial
average finished down 180.78 points, or 1.65 percent, at 10,791.29,
but that was somewhat above its low.
</P>
<P>
   For a while the Dow's slide was the biggest since May 27, but
the late firming made it less severe than a 191.55-point selloff
early last week.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 stock index skidded 24.37 points, or
1.78 percent, closing at 1,341.03, while the recently-battered
Nasdaq market took the biggest hit, dropping 65.83 points, or 2.43
percent, to 2,640.01.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers, chiefly the labor costs, were worse than
expected,'' said Jeffrey Applegate, chief U.S. strategist at Lehman
Brothers. ``This makes another Federal Reserve tightening more
likely than not.''
</P>
<P>
   A separate Labor Department report showed a sharp cut in
first-time claims for unemployment insurance last week, suggesting
the extremely tight labor market continued into summer. Market
operators took little comfort from a Commerce Department estimate
that the economy's growth rate was slower than had been expected
during the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Trading volume quickened a bit, but analysts said much of the
weakness reflected program trades by professionals and there was
little evidence of indiscriminate selling.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just a correction, not the beginning of anything we
should be concerned about,'' said Jeffrey Rubin, research director
at Birinyi Associates. ``It's not your grandmother going and
throwing the baby out with the bathwater.''
</P>
<P>
   Others were less sanguine. For example, Richard McCabe, chief
market analyst at Merrill Lynch, said, ``It looks like a resumption
of the downswing that started last week'' when investors who had
bet correctly on very strong second-quarter profits decided to cash
in. And the next upward push is unlikely to occur before the Fed's
Aug. 24 policy meeting, he said, with the interim clouded by fears
that the central bank will find much to fret about, especially next
Friday's report on the labor market in July.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Rich, a trader at BT Brokerage, largely agreed. ``We're
seeing some serious selling'' because of interest-rate jitters, he
said, expressing disappointment that good corporate earnings, the
best since the first quarter of 1997, have been rewarded with such
heavy profit-taking.
</P>
<P>
   Bond prices also slumped Thursday on rate fears, putting
pressure on financial stocks, with J.P. Morgan falling 3 3/8 to 130
5/8, leading the decline of the blue-chip Dow average.
</P>
<P>
   Only four of the 30 Dow stocks gained. The only sizable gains
were from Procter &AMP; Gamble, up 2 to 88 1/8, and Minnesota Mining,
up 1 11/16 to 90 13/16. Both reported profits that beat
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Gold stocks, one of the most depressed groups, finally managed
to gain, with Newmont Mining rising 1 1/8 to 19 3/8.
</P>
<P>
   Waste Management was a major casualty, skidding 5 1/4 to 25
15/16 after warning again of lagging profits. The shares, which
traded at 60 in early May, hit a new low of 24.
</P>
<P>
   In a prominent initial public offering, Net2Phone's shares
surged as high as 29 1/2 from 15 before closing at 26 9/16. A total
of 18.7 million changed hands, meaning that each of the 5.4 million
shares issued averaged more than three different owners.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues swamped advancing ones on the New York Stock
Exchange by 2,242 to 809, and there were 166 new lows compared with
31 new highs.
</P>
<P>
   Major European stock markets, which were open long enough to
digest the American economic news, closed with even bigger losses,
ranging from 2.8 percent in Paris to 3.4 percent in Frankfurt.
Mexico's Bolsa dropped nearly 4 percent while stock prices climbed
1.6 percent in Tokyo.

HOUSTON MAYOR SEEKS TO MEND RIFT OVER BILINGUAL EDUCATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JULIE MASON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Mayor Lee Brown is attempting to seal a rift among
Houston's minority politicians over bilingual education before it
spills into this year's municipal elections.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who campaigned on the promise that he would be the mayor
``for all of Houston,'' is convening a a closed-door ``unity''
session Saturday of black and Hispanic elected officials.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting follows a divisive vote last week by Houston
Independent School District trustees in favor of a policy that
emphasizes learning English ``as rapidly as individually
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-2 vote split along ethnic lines, with black and Anglo
board members voting in favor of the policy against the board's
Hispanic members save one _ Gabriel Vasquez, who also is a
candidate for City Council.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a small coterie of Hispanic officials led by state Sen.
Mario Gallegos, D-Galena Park, are assailing Vasquez's vote on the
issue as a ``sell-out,'' and bringing the fight into the city
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Vasquez, one of four candidates for the open seat, is being
backed for the race by many of Brown's political supporters.
</P>
<P>
   The closed-door meeting, set for Saturday morning at a downtown
barbecue restaurant, is aimed in part at airing out the bad
feelings on all sides and staving off an all-out brawl.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who has no authority over the school district,
nevertheless is being touted by both factions as a welcome
peacemaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``No politician likes to get involved in another politician's
business,'' said state Rep. Garnet Coleman, D-Houston. ``To stick
your nose in, it really has to be something extraordinary. And this
is one of those cases.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Vasquez said bilingual education is not an issue
for him in the city elections. Beyond that, he declined to mix it
up with Gallegos.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's two different races, frankly,'' Vasquez said Thursday.
``Others may try to use this breakfast to their own ends, but I am
out there talking about neighborhoods and improving
neighborhoods.''
</P>
<P>
   Gallegos, whose mother, Olga Gallegos, is a Houston school
trustee opposed to the new bilingual education policy, said he
wasn't planning to get involved in the City Council race _ until
now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm backing anyone but Gabriel Vasquez,'' Gallegos said.
``Anyone who would sell out to English-only, they have no business
on council. We are taking this to the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   The trustees' vote is the first time HISD has adopted a board
policy on bilingual education.
</P>
<P>
   Under the policy, non-English-speaking children in the
bilingual-education program would be moved into English as soon as
they can demonstrate proficiency in English reading.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters describe the policy as a middle ground between those
who believe in English immersion and those who think children
should spend years studying academic subjects in their native
language.
</P>
<P>
   Although short of the ``English-only'' directive described by
Gallegos and others, the policy is far from the final word on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman, who along with other black legislators are supporting
Gallegos and Hispanic House members opposing the plan, said origins
of the problem lie in the manner in which the policy was shaped and
adopted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be that the policy they passed is fine, but a certain
percentage of the people this has affected feel the policy has been
rammed down their throats,'' Coleman said. ``That is when people
start to distrust their government.''
</P>
<P>
   But Vasquez countered that opponents of the plan were repeatedly
invited to participate in the process and just as often rejected
efforts by trustees to work on a compromise.

CELLS FROM A MOUSE EMBRYO ARE CONVERTED INTO SPECIALIZED BRAIN
CELLS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wis., Mass.)   By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Biologists have converted cells from the embryo of a mouse into
specialized brain cells capable of repairing a brain defect.
</P>
<P>
   The research, reported in an article in Science that is being
published Friday, lends substance to the hope of using human
embryonic stem cells to replace any of a patient's diseased tissues
and organs.
</P>
<P>
   The first of many steps in this grand design is to learn how to
drive these embryonic cells down particular lineages toward each of
the many different types of mature cell found in the adult body.
The Science article, by Dr. Oliver Bruestle of the University of
Bonn, in Germany, and by other authors, suggests that it may easier
than expected to mix suitable cocktails of growth factors to govern
these transformations.
</P>
<P>
   Using growth factors developed in earlier work, the researchers
converted mouse embryonic cells into all-purpose brain cells and
then into a specialized type of brain cell that wraps neurons in a
sheaf of the insulating material known as myelin.
</P>
<P>
   When the cells were injected in rats that are genetically
incapable of making myelin, they successfully clad the rat neurons
in insulation. If human embryonic cells can be converted into
myelin-making cells the same way, the method could eventually help
treat human neurological disorders, the authors say.
</P>
<P>
   Human embryonic stem cells, derived from surplus human embryos
created in fertility clinics, were first grown successfully by Dr.
James A. Thomson of the University of Wisconsin. Thomson said he
planned to work with one of the authors of the mouse experiment,
Dr. Ian D. Duncan of the University of Wisconsin, to see whether
human embryonic cells can be converted to myelin-making brain cells
with the same methods.
</P>
<P>
   Among the many technical problems in using human embryonic cells
as therapy is that of rejection by the patient's immune system. A
much-discussed approach would be to take one of Thomson's stem
cells, which can be grown in profusion, and to replace the cell's
nucleus, containing its DNA, with a nucleus from one of the
patient's skin cells.
</P>
<P>
   The main body of an embryonic cell is thought to be capable of
``reprogramming'' a nucleus inserted into it. The embryonic stem
cells would then be almost identical to those from which the
patient's body was originally generated. Converted into brain
cells, say, they should present no challenge to the patient's
immune system.
</P>
<P>
   Human embryonic cells cannot form an embryo because they lack
the embryo's other component, a sphere of organizing cells that are
not themselves part of the embryo but help shape the developing
embryonic cells into an organized structure. Left to themselves,
embryonic stem cells in the laboratory will often develop into a
chaotic mass of different tissues known as a teratoma.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have derived mouse heart cells from a teratoma and
have shown the cells will work efficiently in a mouse. But the
Science article seems to be one of the first to report that
embryonic cells were taken directly down a desired lineage by
manipulation with growth factors.
</P>
<P>
   An expected advantage of stem cell therapy is that it is not
necessary or even desirable to take cells to their fully
differentiated or adult form. They need to be immature cells,
appropriate for the tissue into which they are injected but young
enough to respond to the local cues under which they will continue
their development.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message coming out from a lot of different studies is that
embryonic stem cells are very plastic,'' said an author of the
Science article, Dr. Ronald D.G. McKay of the National Institutes
of Health. ``You coax them a little bit, and they slip into these
states.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Thomson and other researchers with private funds are
free to work on human embryonic stem cells, government-financed
scientists cannot do so because Congress has prohibited federal
funds from being spent on research in which human embryos are
destroyed. The Clinton administration recently ruled that this
interpretation did not apply to the use of Thomson's cells, and the
National Institutes of Health is about to publish guidelines under
which research may proceed. But opponents of abortion hope Congress
will specifically ban federal financing of stem cell research.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists are eager to move ahead under appropriate guidelines.
``In terms of the political debate, this says we are getting better
at taking embryonic stem cells, which can give rise to all cell
types, and are directing them down a particular lineage,'' said Dr.
Evan Y. Snyder, a brain cell expert at Harvard Medical School.

TEAMSTERS CHIEF INITIATES ANTI-CORRUPTION EFFORT 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ James P. Hoffa, the president of the teamsters,
Thursday announced his union's most ambitious anti-corruption
effort in decades in a move that he said was designed to keep the
teamsters free of organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa named a highly regarded former prosecutor to head the
effort and said the teamsters would establish new ethical
guidelines for its leaders and members, and would establish new
internal procedures to guarantee that ethical violations are
investigated and punished.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a one-shot deal,'' Hoffa said at a news conference
here at the headquarters of the International Brotherhood of
Teamsters. ``It's being pursued on a number of levels to make sure
our union is corruption-free.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa, who became the teamsters' president in March, made clear
that one reason he was instituting the in-house effort was to
persuade the federal government to end its decadelong supervision
of the 1.4-million member union.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been under government supervision for 10 years,''
Hoffa said. ``It's time for a fresh review of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa announced that Edwin H. Stier, 59, a former federal and
state prosecutor in New Jersey, would oversee the anti-corruption
effort.
</P>
<P>
   Stier vowed to determine whether any organized crime influence
remained within the union, and, if it did, he said he would push
the teamsters to move against any such links.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time now to help the union develop the capacity to police
itself, to make sure that any evidence of corruption or organized
crime influence is dealt with by the union itself,'' Stier said.
</P>
<P>
   Several labor experts praised Hoffa's initiative as an important
first step to show that he is serious about cleaning up a union
that had been long considered the nation's most corrupt, until
federal intervention in 1989 forced out more than 200 teamsters'
officials accused of corruption.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Hoffa said he had come to respect Stier because of the job he
did as the trustee who supervised the cleanup of Local 560, the
4,400-member organization in Union City, N.J., that had been
regarded as the union's most mob-dominated local.
</P>
<P>
   That local was once headed by Anthony Provenzano, a captain in
the Genovese crime family who was convicted of murder and who
investigators say had played a role in the 1975 disappearance of
Hoffa's father, James R. Hoffa, who headed the union from 1957 to
1971.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa's father went to prison after being convicted of jury
tampering and pension fraud, and prosecutors said the father worked
closely with organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   Stier said he took the job only after he had been convinced that
the younger Hoffa was intent on rooting out corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am convinced,'' Stier said, ``that Jim Hoffa and the leaders
of this union are committed to running a clean union and are
determined to remove any remaining vestiges of organized crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa said he would seek to arrange a meeting with Mary Jo
White, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, who is the government
official in charge of the federal supervision of the teamsters.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa said he would seek a dialogue in which he hoped to impress
the government about the seriousness of the union's anti-corruption
efforts _ all with any eye to persuading the government to end
federal supervision.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. White has declined to say whether the federal supervision
should continue.

INS MAY FREE 289 IMMIGRANTS IN TEXAS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DEBORAH TEDFORD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A shift in the Immigration and Naturalization
Service's detention policy could mean the release of 289 immigrants
held in Texas facilities _ some of whom have been held for years.
</P>
<P>
   INS spokeswoman Mariela Melero said bonds of $1,500 to $5,000
have been set for 308 detainees in the 18-state Central Region.
</P>
<P>
   She acknowledged that some detainees have been in custody for
years, but said the average time of those eligible for release is
unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Immigrants released on bond or personal recognizance will be
free until issuance of a final removal order, and their release
will not affect deportation proceedings, Melero said.
</P>
<P>
   Among those released is Roberto Obregon, whose wife, Miriam,
said having him back at work means she can afford school supplies
and a few extras.
</P>
<P>
   The family of nine lost their income and insurance when Roberto
Obregon, a legal resident for 10 years, was picked up in March by
INS agents who found he had gotten a third drunken driving citation
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need him for moral and economic support,'' Miriam Obregon
said. ``When he was (in detention), I had a hard time buying food
for the house. My kids would ask me why I couldn't buy soda water
from the store, or something from a restaurant.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the new policy took effect July 12, said INS spokeswoman
Luisa Aquino, 30 others have been released from the Houston
detention facility.
</P>
<P>
   INS officials announced earlier this month that some immigrants
with criminal records could be freed on bond, pending the outcome
of deportation proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   The change in policy was based on rulings from 13 federal courts
that the INS has some discretion in detention matters. The agency
had interpreted the Immigration Reform Act of 1996 as mandating
detention, pending deportation for immigrants who had felony
criminal convictions.
</P>
<P>
   But the court decisions restored the agency's discretion to free
immigrants deemed no danger to the community nor a flight risk,
said Melero.
</P>
<P>
   Immigrants convicted of nonviolent offenses now are eligible for
release from detention if they completed their sentences prior to
Oct. 9 and have not received a final removal order.
</P>
<P>
   Melero said INS workers in the Central Region have reviewed
3,330 cases to determine eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the change in detention policy, the 1996 law
dramatically changed the status of all immigrants, including
resident aliens. The law broadened the list of crimes that trigger
deportation to include theft and even some infractions for which an
immigrant received deferred adjudication.
</P>
<P>
   Because the law is retroactive, an immigrant who has had a good
record for years after a minor scrape with the law could find
himself behind bars awaiting deportation.
</P>
<P>
   INS officials estimate the revised policy could reduce the
detention population of 17,400 by about 5 percent, Melero said.
</P>
<P>
   A local immigration attorney said the change is positive for
detainees and their families.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people have good cases, but they just give up because
they can't stand sitting in jail'' for months or years, said Robert
Kahn.
</P>
<P>
   The deportation process can take two years or longer, he said.
Frustration among detainees is especially high during Texas'
summers because many are housed in small county jails that don't
have air conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   Kahn said seven of his clients have been released on bond under
the new policy, and many of his colleagues have been able to reopen
old cases for INS review.
</P>
<P>
   He said the most positive aspect of the change is that it will
allow former detainees to work during the lengthy detention
process. Resident aliens are not entitled to court-appointed
attorneys, and they can't hire counsel if they can't work, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most detainees are left to present their own cases before an
immigration judge, facing opposition from experienced INS
attorneys, Kahn said.

 PROCTER &AMP; GAMBLE EARNINGS TOP WALL ST. EXPECTATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DANA CANEDY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble Co. may finally be breaking out of a slump. The
consumer products giant, which has been struggling with a sluggish
international business and a need for bigger successes from new
products, reported robust quarterly earnings growth Thursday that
beat analyst expectations.
</P>
<P>
   For its fourth quarter ended June 30, P&AMP;G posted net income of
$414 million, or 29 cents a share, after a $385 million after-tax
charge for restructuring. There were no charges in the comparable
period a year earlier, when the company earned $684 million, or 47
cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding the charge, profits from operations rose 16 percent to
$799 million, or 55 cents a share, surpassing the 53 cents analysts
had forecast. Revenues rose 2 percent to $9.45 billion on flat unit
volume. Currency translations reduced sales by 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Investors, who had not been pleased with the company's
inconsistent performance during the past year, were impressed
Thursday. P&AMP;G's shares rose $2, to $88.125, though the stock is
still trading far below its 52-week peak of $103.812 reached on
April 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was impressed with the earnings, but I continue to await
volume accelerations,'' said Amy Low Chasen, an analyst with
Goldman, Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   P&AMP;G continues to suffer from weakness in some foreign markets,
particularly Russia, which has been gripped by an economic crisis.
It has also been hurt by stiffer competition in the laundry and
hair-care businesses in Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But the company is also beginning to benefit from the recovery
in some foreign markets, notably in Asia. Its growth for the
quarter and year was strongest in North America, where results were
helped by popular new products such as Febreze, a fabric freshener
that has become one of P&AMP;G's most successful introductions in
recent years, and Dryel, a home dry-cleaning kit, along with a
handful of other promising new products.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see a lot of new-product activity coming, which should jump
start volume growth again,'' said Sally Desloch, an analyst with
J.P. Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   For the year, excluding reorganization costs, P&AMP;G earned $4.14
billion, or $2.58 a share, a 10 percent increase. Revenue rose 2.6
percent to $38.125 billion. What is more, the company's
cost-cutting efforts seem to be paying off. For the year, the
margin on core net earnings was 10.9 percent _ the highest in 58
years, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, ``we are pleased with our continued strong earnings
performance despite economic difficulties in key emerging markets
and the impact of currencies around the world,'' said Durk I.
Jager, the company's president and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   P&AMP;G predicts that greater revenue and profit gains are ahead,
thanks to a worldwide reorganization of its business that is
intended to speed product development and produce a more nimble
operation by streamlining the company's notoriously bureaucratic
culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have our new organization structure in place, and we
anticipate significant benefits over the coming fiscal year and
beyond,'' Jager said.
</P>
<P>
   P&AMP;G said it expected to increase long-term annual sales growth
to 6 percent to 8 percent and growth of per-share earnings to 13
percent to 15 percent during each of the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   The company's ``Organization 2005'' plan will cost $2 billion
after taxes over the next six years but is expected to generate
annual after-tax cost savings of about $900 million by 2004. As
part of the reorganization, P&AMP;G will cut 15,000 jobs worldwide
beginning next April and will close up to 10 underperforming
plants.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Lance Armstrong one-day victory tour hit town
Thursday for a whirlwind sweep of television shows, news media
interviews and promotional appearances. Then, before most New
Yorkers could get a glimpse of the 27-year-old Texan who battled
back from debilitating treatment for cancer to win the Tour de
France Sunday, the visit was over and Armstrong was headed back to
Europe for more bicycle races.
</P>
<P>
   The trip was choreographed by Nike, a longtime sponsor.
Everywhere Armstrong went, people cheered and yelled thank you.
Several times, cancer survivors told him what an inspiration he had
been.
</P>
<P>
   ``That has been the nicest part,'' he said during a news
conference. ``I have a responsibility to tell my story and
encourage people who have cancer to stay strong. At every stage of
the tour, people would come up to me and tell me they were
supporting me. It's a big community, unfortunately. The thing I'm
most proud of is being a cancer survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   In October 1996, Armstrong learned he had testicular cancer that
had spread to his abdomen, lungs and brain. Two operations and
intensive chemotherapy have left him cancer-free, and he has been
riding better than ever. There was no time to ride Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole day has been crazy _ good crazy,'' he said during a
midday interview. ``I didn't expect all this. I knew the race was
going to get significant play in the States, but I didn't think it
would be like this.''
</P>
<P>
   This was his ambitious 48-hour timetable that began Wednesday
afternoon in the Netherlands where he finished fifth in an
exhibition criterium race and didn't end until Friday afternoon,
back in the Netherlands, for another criterium _ a short race
around downtown streets:
</P>
<P>
   WEDNESDAY, THE NETHERLANDS, 11 p.m. Boarding of a Nike 15-seat,
two-bed corporate jet with his wife, Kristin; his agent, Bill
Stapleton, and Nike officials.
</P>
<P>
   THURSDAY, NEW YORK AREA, 1 a.m. Landing at Teterboro (N.J.)
Airport.
</P>
<P>
   2 a.m. Arrival at the SoHo Grand Hotel for a quick nap.
</P>
<P>
   4:30 a.m. Wake-up call.
</P>
<P>
   6 a.m. Television interview on ``CBS This Morning.''
</P>
<P>
   7:30 a.m. Television interview on NBC's ``Today'' show.
</P>
<P>
   8 a.m. Television interview on ABC's ``Good Morning America.''
</P>
<P>
   9 a.m. Visit to the New York Stock Exchange, where he walked
around the floor. (``It was unbelievable the way they cheered and
wanted to touch him,'' Stapleton said. ``I think that's when he
realized the impact he had made on America.'')
</P>
<P>
   10:15 a.m. Arrival at Nike Town store in midtown, for public
relations videos.
</P>
<P>
   11 a.m. Nike Town news conference before 100 reporters, 12
television camera crews and hundreds of enthusiastic customers and
fans who packed the two flights of balconies off the lobby. He gave
the Trek bike he rode in the Tour de France to NikeTown to display
around the country, and Nike gave him a $25,000 check for the Lance
Armstrong Foundation whose mission is to publicize cancer and help
find a cure. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani presented him with a crystal
Big Apple and a proclamation announcing that Thursday was Lance
Armstrong Day in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Noon. One-on-one interviews, mainly with television. (``I'm
tired,'' Armstrong said, ``but I'm having a good time.'')
</P>
<P>
   1:30 p.m. Meeting with Bud Greenspan, the Olympic filmmaker who
will produce a movie about his life.
</P>
<P>
   2 p.m. Satellite media interviews.
</P>
<P>
   4:30 p.m. Rest and dinner.
</P>
<P>
   7 p.m. Taped interview for ``Late Show With David Letterman.''
</P>
<P>
   9 p.m. Taped interview via satellite for ``Larry King Live.''
</P>
<P>
   11 p.m. Scheduled departure to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   FRIDAY, BELGIUM, NOON. Scheduled arrival in Brussels. (``I won't
even have time to get jet lag,'' Armstrong said.)
</P>
<P>
   Afternoon Another criterium in nearby Heerven, the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   This breakneck pace will continue into the foreseeable future.
Armstrong is scheduled to ride in six criteriums in eight days, a
tradition for Tour de France winners. In each race, he is wearing
the yellow jersey of the Tour leader, ``so I can bring the Tour to
people from neighboring countries,'' he said, ``and let them feel
they are part of the race.''
</P>
<P>
   The schedule does not faze him.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are all the things I have to accept,'' he said. ``I have
to realize this stuff won't be here forever. I have a chance to
tell my story. I did prove there is life after serious cancer.
After I recovered, my doctor told me my cancer was probably among
the worst 2 or 3 percent he had ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   In a week, Armstrong and his wife will fly home to Austin,
Texas, where the city will honor him Aug. 9. He has no immediate
race plans. He will pass up the world championships in October
because his wife is expecting their first child then.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to no interviews, no autographs, no
anything,'' he said. ``I just want to go back and resume our normal
lives.''

   ATLANTA _ In the deadliest shooting spree in Atlanta history, a
securities day trader apparently killed nine people Thursday
afternoon in two office buildings in the city's glitzy Buckhead
business and entertainment district. Another 12 people were injured
during the chaotic rampage, seven of them from gunshot wounds.
</P>
<P>
   The man eluded a massive police manhunt for five hours, and then
killed himself in his van after police pulled him over at a service
station in nearby Cobb County.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell said the suspect, Mark O. Barton,
44, also apparently is connected to the recent killings of three
other people in an apartment in suburban Stockbridge, about 15
miles southeast of Atlanta. Campbell said that those victims are
believed to be Barton's wife and two children. The Stockbridge
killings took place before the Buckhead shootings, but it was
unclear exactly when, Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   Barton, a chemist who traded in his lab coat for the high-risk
life of an independent stock trader, also reportedly was a suspect
in the 1993 bludgeoning deaths of his former wife and her mother in
Cedar Bluff, Ala. He was never charged in those killings.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta shootings took place on a sweltering Atlanta day
when the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 180.78 points, a loss
of 1.6 percent, raising suspicions by investigators that recent
trading losses may have contributed to Barton's rampage.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened today is a tragedy of massive proportions,''
Campbell said Thursday afternoon, his face locked in a
sweat-dampened grimace. ``We are praying for the families and
praying for our city.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's incident marked the third shooting spree in the
Atlanta area in less than three months. On May 20, a 15-year-old
student at Heritage High School in nearby Conyers took a gun to
school and shot six students, none of them fatally, before being
captured by school administrators. Then on July 12, an Atlanta man
killed six members of a family before killing himself in an
apparent domestic dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The shootings in Buckhead began around 2:50 p.m., when Barton,
dressed in shorts and a shirt, walked into the All-Tech Investment
Group office at Two Securities Center. Without warning or
provocation, he began to fire with two weapons. Barton had traded
at the office in the past but not recently, the company said in a
statement released from its headquarters in Montvale, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Barton ``came into our office and after speaking to the branch
manager, suddenly stood up and for no apparent reason opened fire
on the branch manager and his secretary,'' said the statement from
All-Tech. ``This man then went into our main trading room and began
indiscriminately shooting at our customers. The man then ran out of
our office and continued shooting in another part of the office
building.'' Four people were killed in that building.
</P>
<P>
   Barton managed to cross bustling Piedmont Road and walked into
another brokerage firm in Building 8 of Piedmont Center, a
sprawling office campus. He opened fire there as well, killing five
people, police said.
</P>
<P>
   For confused hours after the shootings, police seemed to have
few clues to Barton's whereabouts or his method of escape. Aided by
specially trained police teams, dogs and helicopters, a
suite-by-suite search was conducted of the buildings where the
shootings occurred, as well as the leafy grounds surrounding the
office parks. THe search came up empty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no idea where Mr. Barton is,'' Campbell told reporters
late Thursday afternoon. ``We do not know whether he has fled the
scene on foot or by car.''
</P>
<P>
   But at about 8:20 p.m., Campbell returned to a bank of
microphones near the scene of the crimes and announced that
Barton's green Aerostar van had been pulled over by police in Cobb
County, just northwest of Atlanta. Barton committed suicide in the
vehicle, Campbell reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``This brings a very tragic day to an end,'' he said. ``I don't
know if any of us can understand why something like this occurs.
All we can do is comfort the families and pray for our city.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ From its 19th-century headquarters in Moscow, the
Central Bank of Russia commands an empire that stretches across
Russia and beyond. It employs 100,000 people and owns a rich
selection of properties, including holiday spas, apartment
buildings and stables, as well as branch offices, valued in 1997 at
$1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   It has a controlling interest in two Russian banks and five
foreign commercial banks _ a curious legacy from Soviet days _ and
indirectly, a mysterious but handy offshore investment company,
based on the island of Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   That Jersey company, known as Fimaco, has for months been the
center of a controversy that has tantalized the bank's many
critics, inside and outside of Russia. Although recent
investigations by Russian prosecutors and international auditors
have found no criminal violations in the Central Bank's dealings
with Fimaco, many experts say the operations definitely skirted the
edge of normal Central Bank rules and ethics.
</P>
<P>
   Most attention has focused on Fimaco's 1996 operations, when the
Central Bank used it as a back-door conduit to invest in Russia's
short-term treasury bills, known as GKOs, which were then just
becoming available to foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   According to an internal Central Bank document obtained by
Nikolai Gonchar, a crusading Russian legislator, at least $855
million was shifted through Fimaco from the bank's hard-currency
reserves onto the market for the Treasury bills from February to
October 1996 alone.
</P>
<P>
   When Gonchar first made these charges, bank officials, past and
present, denied them, in some cases vehemently. This month, they
came forward with a new explanation: the Central Bank did shift
money through Fimaco _ a subsidiary of Eurobank, a French bank in
which the Russian Central Bank owns 78 percent _ but only as a way
of testing the entry of foreign investors on the GKO market.
</P>
<P>
   But this latest explanation has also fallen flat, particularly
among investment analysts who follow the GKO market. ``You don't
need hundreds of millions of dollars to test that kind of
mechanism,'' said Tom Adshead, senior analyst for Troika Dialogue,
a Moscow-based investment bank. ``It is very peculiar for a central
bank to set up a hidden structure to conduct such procedures. Why
test it, when they built it?''
</P>
<P>
   Gonchar, a dogged parliamentary deputy from Moscow, is also not
satisfied. ``The main question,'' he said recently, ``is where are
the profits from these operations?''
</P>
<P>
   From its start in 1991, Fimaco's operations have been highly
secretive.
</P>
<P>
   By 1993, the year when the Jersey-based investment company was
acquired by Eurobank, a directive had been issued by a Central Bank
official ordering that Fimaco operations be kept off the books.
</P>
<P>
   Nor were any of the transactions involving Fimaco ever put
before the Central Bank's board of directors, said Alexander
Khandruyev, vice chancellor of the Academy of National Economy who
as deputy chairman of the Central Bank, served on its board from
1992 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Central banks _ including the Federal Reserve _ commonly invest
in their home securities market, but only as buyers on secondary
markets. In Russia, the Central Bank, together with its affiliate
Sberbank, were known to dominate 50 percent of the GKO market.
</P>
<P>
   But what troubles Khandruyev most are indications that the bank
was not just playing the GKO market, but pumping it up with the
help of national currency reserves. ``According to unwritten laws
practiced by central banks, central banks do not buy their own
securities with their official currency reserves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For months now, Central Bank officials have said that they first
began to use Fimaco in the early 1990s as a way to shelter Russian
reserves from creditors looking to retrieve their Soviet debt. Its
existence was camouflaged behind Eurobank, the Paris-based bank
that, like its sister banks supported by the Central Bank of
Russia, survived the collapse of the Soviet banking system with a
healthy dose of credits from Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian Central Bank, born of a Soviet communist system that
avowedly disdained capitalism, has historically cloaked its
operations in a secrecy that goes beyond even the reticence typical
of central banks around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Central Bank is the biggest and most powerful financial
oligarch in Russia,'' said Andrei Illarionov, director of the
Institute of Economic Analysis, and a harsh critic of the bank.
``Its leadership is virtually independent. There is no
transparency. In many countries, central banks are independent but
in Russia's case, the Central Bank does not report to anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   This month, at a series of news conferences, past and present
bank officials announced that a three-month audit of the bank's
relationship with Fimaco had found no ``substantial'' violations of
normal procedure.
</P>
<P>
   They also produced a letter from the Russian prosecutor
general's office _ which first made public the charges involving
Fimaco last February _ saying that no evidence of ``embezzlement or
misappropriation'' had been found.
</P>
<P>
   The full audit of Fimaco's operations by PricewaterhouseCoopers,
the Central Bank's preferred auditing firm, is being released by
the International Monetary Fund. The fund has not raised any
objections in public, and has approved disbursement of another $4.5
billion financial package for Russia, aimed at keeping the country
afloat at least through parliamentary and Presidential elections
next year.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But so far no one has been willing or able to explain why the
Central Bank of Russia acted as it did. Why did the bank transfer
part of its hard currency reserves, via a complicated chain of
intertwined financial institutions onto a highly speculative
domestic debt market, against private advice from both the IMF and
the bank's own auditing firm? According to estimates compiled by
Gonchar, the Central Bank from 1993 to 1996 channeled an average of
$2.7 billion a year to Fimaco, money that eventually was recycled
back into the bank's coffers in Moscow. Central Bank officials have
defended this operation, noting that many central banks invest
money abroad. However, it is traditional to use established
investment firms, typically chosen on the basis of tenders.
</P>
<P>
   Fimaco's 1996 transactions, described in an Oct. 4, 1996,
document signed by the deputy director of foreign operations for
the Central Bank, were different.
</P>
<P>
   The money was returned to Russia, via Eurobank, Fimaco's parent
company, and then through Evrofinance, the first Moscow-based
foreign bank licensed to buy GKOs on behalf of foreigners and which
listed as its parent companies Fimaco and Eurobank.
</P>
<P>
   According to Eurobank's 1996 annual report, Evrofinance's
presence in Moscow ``enabled Eurobank to place more than $3.4
billion in GKOs on behalf of foreign investors _ that is 40 percent
of total foreign investment in this financial product in 1996.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Central Bank document, it directed $855 million
onto the GKO market via Fimaco in 1996. Fimaco, in turn, having
bought the GKOs, then deposited an equal sum in Eurobank, where it
earned interest at rates ranging around 5.5 percent a year.
According to Gonchar, these amounts were returned to the Central
Bank. What he insists is not accounted for are the profits earned
on the lucrative GKO market. At the time, yields on GKOs hovered
around 200 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were incredibly profitable operations,'' Gonchar said.
``The bank received money from the International Monetary Fund,
from the World Bank very cheaply. The money was invested in GKOs,
which in 1996 were earning 180 to 240 percent. Imagine the kind of
profits. Where are they?''
</P>
<P>
   Some suspect that the real purpose of this operation in 1996 was
to generate more money for the Russian government, then caught in a
web of extravagant election year promises given by President Boris
Yeltsin. To the general relief of the West, Yeltsin defeated his
communist challenger, Gennadi Zyuganov, to win a second term.
</P>
<P>
   Others have guessed that like any elaborate plumbing system,
this one was bound _ maybe even designed _ to leak, in the form of
commissions, risk margins and other profits collected along the
way.
</P>
<P>
   There may have been other reasons, such as tax avoidance or
simply a chance to test unorthodox financing mechanisms required by
Russia's shallow and fragile debt market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Central Bank of Russia was more creative than others,''
said a Russian banker familiar with the Central Bank's operations.
``There were a lot of young people working there, with very good
brains.'' In those years, he said, the Central Bank's main goal was
not to generate profit for itself, but to control a shaky GKO
market, and bring down the dizzying rise in yields.
</P>
<P>
   But in so doing, critics argue, the Central Bank assumed
conflicting roles on the GKO market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the problem is the conflict within the Central Bank,
which on one hand is supposed to be the regulator of commercial
banks, and on the other hand, was their competitor on the GKO
market,'' said Dmitri Vasilyev, the chairman of Russia's Federal
Securities Commission and an outspoken critic of the Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
   This month, the bank's chairman, Viktor Gerashchenko _ a
formidable veteran of the old Soviet banking system _ used the
PricewaterhouseCoopers audit's findings to try to put the Fimaco
matter to rest, promising to correct accounting practices by
January 2000 to prevent inflation of foreign reserves.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Gerashchenko insisted _ again _ that the audit showed
nothing essentially wrong with Fimaco, only what he termed ``a
certain deviation from traditional instructions.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Sergei Dubinin, the Central Bank chairman from
1994 to 1998, proclaimed at a news conference, ``All slanders that
were loudly proclaimed have been refuted.''
</P>
<P>
   Dubinin then made his first attempt to explain away what he
called an ``artificial'' scandal. According to him, the transfer of
Central Bank money onto the GKO markets was done in 1996 to test
the mechanism by which foreign investors could put money on the GKO
markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Naturally, it was necessary not only to allow'' foreigners to
enter the GKO market, Dubinin said, ``but also to show certain
techniques how it had to be done. Eurobank showed it, and by so
doing, it opened the road for other investors. This is its role.
There was nothing else behind it.''
</P>
<P>
   Khandruyev, Dubinin's former deputy chairman, sounded less sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the auditors' conclusions confirm that the Russian Central
Bank used its own currency reserves to buy securities, having
insider information, and influencing the profitability of those
securities,'' he said, And ``remember that although the Finance
Ministry issued GKOs, the Central Bank and Sberbank controlled 50
percent of the market, making them its trend-setters _ if certain
issues of the GKOs, which were highly profitable, were acquired by
Fimaco via an indirect route, I would consider this a violation of
moral and ethical principles. But it is not a matter of criminal
law.''

POLICE INVESTIGATE WOODSTOCK RAPES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., Ohio, Pa.) (rk) 
 By PAUL ZIELBAUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Amid growing reports of sexual assaults at last
weekend's Woodstock concert, the New York state police began
interviewing people who were crisis counselors at the show and
reviewed videotapes Thursday for evidence of rapes that the police
said occurred in the campground and near the main music stage.
</P>
<P>
   As of late Thursday, the police said they knew of four rapes at
the three-day event, in Rome, N.Y. Three of them were believed to
have occurred in Woodstock's sprawling 260-acre campground and to
have involved women who were dragged into tents and raped by one or
more men, said Capt. John Wood of the state police.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth woman was said to have been raped in the ``mosh pit'' _
a circle of body-slamming dancers _ directly in front of the stage
where the rap-metal band Limp Bizkit was playing on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Drugs or alcohol, or a mixture of both, played a role in each
case, Wood said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to those four cases, others who attended the
concert, or who knew people who did, suggested that at least two
other rapes occurred and that sexual abuse of women, including some
who went topless, happened frequently during the performances.
</P>
<P>
   Though Woodstock '99 had billed itself as a reincarnation of the
peace and love spirit of the original concert in 1969, news of the
rape allegations and the violent melee that ended the concert on
Sunday night have reduced the sprawling concert site, inside a
former Air Force base, to a somber crime scene. No one knows
exactly why it turned out that way, though the police and other
people, including some who paid $150 a ticket to attend the
festival, blamed the concert promoters for booking hardcore
rap-metal bands that provoke their fans to violence.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Lang, the creator of all three Woodstock concerts,
conceded Thursday that if he could have last weekend back, he would
have chosen more mellow bands.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I knew it was coming, I might have done a little different
booking,'' Lang said in a telephone interview. ``I would have tried
not to have had as edgy a bill as we had. I would have programmed
the days better, tried to spread them out a bit more.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said the bands were not to blame for the concert's list
of problems and that many of today's most popular performers, like
Korn, Limp Bizkit and Rage Against the Machine, all of which played
at Woodstock '99, make crowd control extremely difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``They generate a lot more excitement in the audience, a lot of
spontaneity and intense energy,'' Lang said. ``You can't just sort
of stop that. You have to let people to come back gradually. It's
just sort of hard to regulate that.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the three rapes in the Woodstock campground each
occurred in tents and involved men not known by the women they
attacked. The first assault happened around 11 p.m. Friday, Wood
said, when an unidentified white man dragged a 32-year-old Ohio
woman into a tent. About 24 hours later, a 20-year-old Buffalo,
N.Y., woman was assaulted on Saturday night in a tent by a man she
had met in the campground, the captain said.
</P>
<P>
   The third assault at the campground, he said, was between 2 and
4 p.m. on Sunday, when as many as three men attacked a 20-year-old
Virginia woman in a tent after they had taken the designer drug
Ecstasy. ``She just woke up in a tent unfamiliar to her and she
realized she had been sexually assaulted,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth woman, 24 and from Pittsburgh, was sexually assaulted
by two men around 9 p.m. on Saturday as all three stood near the
mosh pit as hardcore rap-metal band Limp Bizkit played before
thousands of delirious fans.
</P>
<P>
   The woman told the police both men raped her in the mass of
people. ``After the incident,'' Wood said, reviewing the woman's
account, ``she figures that the best way to get out of there was to
body surf. She asked somebody in the crowd to help her on out. They
hoisted her up and she body surfs on out.''
</P>
<P>
   In three of the cases, the police were told of the rapes after
the women sought help in medical tents around the concert. The
woman from Buffalo returned home and went to see a doctor there,
who reported the case to the state police, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Finding the men who committed the rapes will be difficult, the
police said. ``We're dealing with hundreds of thousands of people
from all over the United States,'' Wood said. ``The victims are
unacquainted with the perpetrators, they can't give us a name, and
these people have scattered.''
</P>
<P>
   With few other avenues, the police will review 65 hours of
Woodstock television coverage, as well as videotape from cameras
connected to cranes that roamed over the crowd near the stages
during performances.

ADVERTISING: ICE-CREAM MAKERS SUFFER THROUGH HOT SUMMER OF FLAT
SALES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Pa.)   (af)  
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   July has been declared National Ice Cream Month by one of the
industry's chief trade groups, and, with local conditions
resembling one of the circles of hell, far be it from us to argue.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, it is hard not to notice the relentless
marketing that ice-cream makers have put in place _ from movie
tie-ins to associations with Nascar drivers to spinoff products
like candy and children's clothing. Such tactics are a sign that
the titans of ice cream are experiencing a competitive inferno of
their own.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Americans consume an average of 23.3 quarts of ice
cream a person each year, sales in grocery stores are flat and have
been for some time. Profits are equally uninspired, especially when
dairy prices are relatively high. Companies that manage to grow do
so by snatching market share, sparking battles that have grown
particularly intense lately.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the efforts of Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream Inc., the
industry giant based in Oakland, Calif., which had $1 billion in
sales last year. Dreyer's markets its ice cream as Edy's on the
East Coast, and also produces Starbuck's and Godiva ice creams.
</P>
<P>
   The company has posted two consecutive money-losing quarters,
which it blames on a variety of developments, including butterfat
prices, discounting by competitors and the loss of a Ben &AMP; Jerry's
distribution contract. The company is tapping all kinds of sources
_ National Football League teams, movies, the Nascar driver Jeff
Gordon, even the Girl Scouts _ to try to bring in better results.
</P>
<P>
   The latest effort is built around Mia Hamm, the star forward for
the United States soccer team that won the Women's World Cup last
month. Ms. Hamm's photograph, in a charging-down-the-field pose,
appears on cartons of the company's frozen yogurt, and Dreyer's is
sponsoring a contest in which the top prize is a soccer clinic, led
by Ms. Hamm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our original intent was to find a figure who was very much
tied to the family element, and soccer is a huge piece of America's
fall time period with their children,'' said Mary Gold, managing
director for marketing at Dreyer's. The deal was locked up several
months ago, she added. ``We happened to like what Mia stood for as
a figure. We had no idea the team would win the World Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   The company has not always been so lucky. Last year it decided
to bet on the movie ``Godzilla,'' marketing an ice-cream flavor
called Godzilla Vanilla, which was sold in grocery stores beneath a
giant cardboard cutout of enormous claws.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had been nervous, because the movie met with lukewarm
receptions in theaters,'' Miss Gold admitted. ``But there were a
lot of families that didn't even go to see the movie, but bought
the ice cream.''
</P>
<P>
   Practically the same thing happened this year, when the company
licensed the rights to ``Wild, Wild West,'' another movie that has
fallen short of the expectations fostered by its extensive advance
hype. Again, Miss Gold insisted, ice cream sales appeared to be
doing fine despite the movie's reviews.
</P>
<P>
   A big name in the superpremium category is also going into high
gear to win over consumers. At Ben &AMP; Jerry's Homemade Inc., the
last few weeks have seen the release of a limited-edition flavor
called Marbled Mint Chunk; a line of frozen smoothies, meant to
capitalize on the popularity of juice-bar smoothies; a new
ice-cream sandwich concept, named after s'mores, that old campfire
standby, and a fleet of ``Scoop Trucks,'' which dispense free ice
cream in six United States cities, all to try to improve sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing like giving away ice cream,'' noted Mary Lou
Kelley, the company's director of product marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Dreyer's plans to launch its own line of Ben &AMP;
Jerry's-style superpremium ice cream in September. The brand, to be
called Dreamery, will include flavors named Banana Boogie, Black
Raspberry Avalanche and Chocolate Truffle Explosion, a spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kelley said Ben &AMP; Jerry's was aware of the Dreyer's move.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we make the best product and we deliver what our
consumers love and we're focusing on our own business,'' she said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy's Microbatch, a comparatively tiny, year-old company
based in Philadelphia, is also handing out free samples and coupons
for free pints. The company's top five markets, all in the
Northeast, have what are known as ``Secret Service teams'' whose
mission is to conduct what a spokeswoman called ``guerrilla
marketing,'' using a combination of samples, T-shirts, magnets and
stickers to pique people's interest in the product.
</P>
<P>
   The spokeswoman, Michele Parenteau, refused to disclose sales
figures, though she said the products were on sale in 6,000 places,
up from 1,000 in January.
</P>
<P>
   Some ice-cream makers are turning to the clothing business to
try to improve grocery-store numbers. Klondike bars, owned by
Unilever PLC, are about to be interpreted as children's jackets and
pajamas, thanks to a recently concluded licensing agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to go after things that are more in tune with creamy
ice cream, rather than the vivid colors of a Popsicle,'' said
Carole Francesca, president of Broad Street Licensing, which
handles the rights to both Klondike and Popsicle, another Unilever
unit.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Francesca's company refurbished Popsicle's image last year,
trying to make it more ``edgy,'' in her words, and more appealing
to children on the verge of adolescence. ``It's very kidlike, but
very today,'' she said of the new look, which is built around
bright colors and zippy lettering.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the company is trying to extend the brand into
areas including clothing (Popsicle tank tops and shoes) and candy
(products meant to taste like Creamsicles are to be on sale next
year). And the nostalgia audience hasn't been forgotten, Ms.
Francesca said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are regenerating artwork from the '50s and '60s on
products, everything from the Franklin Mint to collectible
Christmas ornaments,'' she said. Earlier this summer, she added, a
revival of the ``Polly Popsicle'' doll, along with her friends
Freddy Fudgsicle and Carrie Creamsicle, sold out on the Home
Shopping Network almost immediately. And there were no calories.

<P>
   Continuing to wrestle with severe problems unleashed by a
botched merger and a troubled business strategy, First Union Corp.
announced Thursday that its president, John R. Georgius, would
retire by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Georgius, 54, will be succeeded by G. Kennedy Thompson, 48, who
currently oversees the capital markets business at First Union, the
nation's sixth largest bank.
</P>
<P>
   The move followed an unscheduled board meeting at the company's
Charlotte, N.C., headquarters that fueled speculation on Wall
Street that First Union might be taken over or that its chief
executive, Edward E. Crutchfield, might lose his job because of the
bank's travails.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of those scenarios came to pass Thursday, though, and
people close to the bank said that Crutchfield was determined to
see the bank through its current woes.
</P>
<P>
   In trading Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange, shares of
First Union rose $1.125, or 2.4 percent, to $48, on a day that saw
most bank stocks and the broader market beaten down.
</P>
<P>
   Georgius' future at the bank came into question in May after
First Union, a bank formed through costly, rapid-fire acquisitions,
warned that profits for the second quarter and the year would fall
far below previous estimates. It was the second time this year that
First Union had to revise earnings estimates sharply downward, and
it left the bank with a credibility problem and doubts among
analysts and investors about its future.
</P>
<P>
   Georgius, who said in an interview in May that he thought his
job was secure, has overseen First Union's ``future bank''
initiative. That strategy aimed to make the company a leader in the
electronic delivery of banking services through such channels as
the telephone and the Internet but has fallen well short of that
goal thus far.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of First Union's growth and accomplishments, and I'm
confident in the direction the company is going,'' Georgius said in
a statement Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Although the bank cast Georgius' retirement as a lifestyle
decision, executives close to the company said that his departure
was forced because of First Union's problems. To a large extent,
Georgius is taking the fall for Crutchfield's mistakes. Crutchfield
has been the leading architect of First Union's merger spree, which
ran into serious problems after last year's expensive and bungled
takeovers of Corestates Financial Corp. and Money Store Inc.
</P>
<P>
   First Union posted second-quarter operating earnings of $801
million, down 9.3 percent from about $883 million in the period a
year earlier. Revenue in the quarter was stagnant at $3.55 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm amazed that it's taken the board this long to act,'' said
Nancy Bush, an analyst with Ryan Beck &AMP; Co.. ``There's always been
the potential at First Union that's never realized. As a customer
of the bank, it's my dream that they're bought by Wells Fargo.''
</P>
<P>
   But other analysts said they had faith that First Union would be
able to right itself and forestall an outright takeover. They also
made note of the strong underlying power of First Union's earnings,
which, even though they are depressed, are still among the best in
the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always thought that this is a company that has
problems, but it's not broken,'' said Sandra Flannigan, an analyst
with Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.. ``In our opinion, the stock is
undervalued, and for people who can be patient, this should be a
great investment.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts, many of whom blindly took First Union's earnings
projections to heart last year, have been largely skeptical about
the company's more recent promises to revive profitability. But the
bank, which will roll out new strategic initiatives in meetings
with analysts next week, said it was confident it would reach
earnings targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fully expect to meet our previously announced earnings
projections,'' said Virginia Mackin, a First Union spokeswoman. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, First Union's new president, also was named to the
bank's board of directors Thursday and has emerged as the leading
candidate to succeed Crutchfield if First Union remains
independent. Thompson is a well regarded executive who has won
praise for his effective management of the bank's capital markets
business, which involves such activities as mergers and
acquisitions advice, syndicated lending, and debt and equity
underwriting.
</P>
<P>
   But Thompson, a 23-year veteran of First Union, does not have
extensive experience in consumer banking, and that is where First
Union is having its most significant problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simply changing one member of senior management without
significantly changing strategy or tactics is not enough to change
the short-term outlook for the bank,'' said Diane Glossman, an
analyst at Lehman Brothers Inc. ``Until we see what they do with
`future bank,' nothing changes.''

ENERGY SECRETARY ORDERS SECURITY TRAINING AT DEFENSE-RELATED
FACILITIES
</HEADLINE>
  (ATTN: Colo., Ga., Idaho, Mo., Nev., Tenn., Texas, Wash.) 
 (sw) 
 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Energy Secretary Bill Richardson has ordered a
one-day stand-down next week of many of the Energy Department's
research and defense-related operations for counter-espionage and
security training in the wake of charges that China had stolen
nuclear secrets from a government weapons laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson ordered the department's defense-related facilities,
except its three nuclear weapons laboratories, shut down on Aug. 3
for mandatory security training, including sessions on computer
security. The government's nuclear weapons labs _ Los Alamos,
Sandia and Lawrence Livermore _ had already completed
security-related stand-downs and are not covered by the new order.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson had ordered a work stoppage in April at the three
nuclear weapons laboratories, when classified computer networks
containing nuclear weapons secrets were shut down for two weeks.
Richardson had also ordered cyber-security training at the labs
after learning that Wen Ho Lee, a scientist at Los Alamos who has
been questioned during the FBI's investigation of China's possible
theft of nuclear secrets, had downloaded extensive data on nuclear
weapons from a classified computer system into an unclassified
network. There was also evidence that someone had accessed those
files once they were in the unsecure system.
</P>
<P>
   Lee was fired in March for alleged security violations. A
federal grand jury in Albuquerque, N.M., has been hearing evidence
in the Los Alamos espionage case, but Lee has not been charged. His
lawyer, Mark C.Holscher of Los Angeles, has stated that his client
is not guilty of the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Lee has been scheduled to speak publicly about the case for the
first time on the CBS program ``60 Minutes'' on Sunday. On the
program, Lee stated that he did download secret information from a
classified computer to a nonclassified one at Los Alamos, but that
he did so only as a routine part of his job, according to a news
release by ``60 Minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI and Energy Department failed to monitor Lee's computer
use for nearly three years while he was under investigation, in
part because the Justice Department rejected an FBI request to seek
court authorization to wiretap and monitor him electronically.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy over the government's handling of the case had
prompted Richardson to take a series of high-profile steps to
tighten security at the labs. He had focused much of his attention
on the need for greater computer security, both at the laboratories
and throughout the Energy Department.
</P>
<P>
   Next week's stand-down at the defense-related sites had been
recommended by the Energy Department's new security chief, Eugene
Habiger, a retired Air Force general and former chief of the U.S.
Strategic Command.
</P>
<P>
   He had urged Richardson to extend the computer and security
training already mandated for the nuclear weapons labs to
defense-related facilities that handle classified information but
which had not yet been subject to intensive review.
</P>
<P>
   ``The security problems at DOE extend to sites beyond the
nuclear weapons labs,'' Richardson said in an interview. ``We've
had problems with safeguards and security at some of the
non-weapons sites, some of which have received low security
ratings. We are sending a signal to the employees that security is
a top priority.''
</P>
<P>
   The facilities affected by the stand-down will be Savannah
River, in Georgia; the Y-12 plant at Oak Ridge, Tenn.; the Pantex
plant in Amarillo, Texas; the Idaho National Engineering and
Environmental Lab in Idaho; the Hanford nuclear site in Richland,
Wash.; the Nevada test site near Las Vegas; the Rocky Flats
facility near Denver, and the Allied Signal plant in Kansas City,
Mo.
</P>
<P>
   Employees at the facilities will be required to attend a series
of security-related seminars, including cyber-security, export
regulations, terrorism and how to handle disgruntled employees.

RENO DENIES REPORT THAT SHE'LL RESIGN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno said Thursday that she
had no plans to step down and disputed reports that she was
considering resigning to become the dean at a Florida law school.
</P>
<P>
   There had been speculation in legal circles that Reno, who is 61
and the longest-serving attorney general this century, might leave
before the end of President Clinton's second term.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Reno denied a report in Washingtonian Magazine, a
monthly publication, that she was close to accepting the dean's
post at the Florida State University College of Law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never wanted to be dean of a law school,'' Reno told
reporters at her weekly Justice Department news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about how long Reno will remain as the country's top
legal officer seem to be fueled in part by concerns about her
health.
</P>
<P>
   She has Parkinson's disease, a degenerative nerve condition, and
some aides have said the symptomatic tremors in her hands and arms
have noticeably increased. Reno has said she feels no ill effects
from her condition.
</P>
<P>
   When she was asked Thursday whether she would resign before
Clinton left office, she said, ``As I've told you before, I always
take it a day at a time, but I know of no reason why I would
change.''

DETROIT, STILL BLIGHTED, PUTS HOPES IN CASINOS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ROBYN MEREDITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ With glittering lights and the roll of dice, a casino
opened here Thursday, the first of a number of promised attractions
that Detroit is counting on to bring long-lost prosperity back to
its blighted streets.
</P>
<P>
   The MGM Grand Detroit is the first of three casinos due to open
before the end of the year, making Detroit the largest city in the
United States with casinos. Two new sports stadiums will follow
close on their heels, and the momentum has helped persuade the
Compuware Corp., maker of software, to announce plans to move its
headquarters and 6,000 workers downtown from the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   The three casinos are expected to add 7,000 to 8,000 jobs in
Detroit, where the unemployment rate, 7 percent, is more than
double the suburban rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The casino represents a piece of the puzzle that will be of
enormous help that will enhance the city's economy and image,''
Mayor Dennis Archer said. ``People will want to come to Detroit.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Henry Ford invented the assembly line, Detroit has
been a gritty city; only the fleeting glamour of the Motown era
interrupted its dirt-under-the-nails image. But just as Las Vegas
used a string of casinos to transform itself from a lonely stretch
of desert to a neon mecca, Detroit is hoping that opening casinos
and building ballparks will make it a tourist destination as well.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of adding tens of millions of dollars to annual tax
revenue persuaded a once-skeptical electorate to vote last spring
to allow three casinos here. The three will eventually be situated
on the city's waterfront, right across the Detroit River from a
pair of competitors: government-run casinos in Windsor, Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   Until those permanent Detroit casinos can be built, the city
will make do with three temporary, less expensive versions,
including the $220 million MGM Grand, which sits next to a highway
downtown. They will stay open 24 hours a day, every day of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   At the MGM Grand, owned by the Las Vegas casino giant of the
same name, bright lights beckon visitors to slot machines, some of
which cost just a nickel to play. There are 80 table games _
blackjack or baccarat, pai gow or poker _ along with three
restaurants, where gamblers can have something as simple as
macaroni and cheese or as steady as a steak.
</P>
<P>
   Except for all the card tables and slot machines, the place
looks like a strip club. Most of the decorations are of the
two-legged variety, well-built young women wearing white-and-gold
outfits cut low in front and high behind. These are the Grandettes,
the waitresses and hostesses who serve up drinks and smiles to the
customers.
</P>
<P>
   By winter, two more casinos are expected to open. And then
thoughts will turn to the two new stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   The Detroit Tigers will play their last home game at historic
Tiger Stadium on Sept. 27 and will start up next April at Comerica
Park, which construction crews have been working on all year. The
new stadium, made of light brown brick, will replace one of the two
oldest major league ball parks; Tiger Stadium opened on the same
day in 1912 as Fenway Park in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The Ford family, which owns the Detroit Lions, has promised to
build a $225 million football stadium next to the baseball park
and, says Thomas J. Lewand, the Lions' vice president, could break
ground for it by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Having pro football games downtown again will itself benefit
Detroit, which long ago lost the Lions to suburban Pontiac. But
developers say the double-stadium complex is planned specifically
not only to draw suburbanites into the city but to keep them there
for a few extra hours.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Ilitch, owner of the Tigers and the Detroit Red Wings
hockey team, said that he planned a number of retail stores and
restaurants and even a children's carousel in the stadium complex
and that an Embassy Suites hotel would sprout just beyond right
field. The last new hotel here was built two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Ilitch believes that while the casinos will provide thousands of
jobs, their impact on the city as a whole could be overstated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the people, when they go into the casinos, are not
going to leave them,'' he said. ``There's some spinoff from the
casinos, but I don't think they're going to be the saviors by any
means.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, a momentum has been created in Detroit, and
``the city will turn around.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, it has a long way to go. Race riots in 1967 caused
the flight of tens of thousands of white residents, which in turn
left this the nation's poorest big city. Detroit hit bottom in the
1980s, when a recession caused widespread layoffs in the auto
industry just as crack hit the streets of the inner city.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, boarded-up skyscrapers mar the downtown skyline, and
on hot days people with nowhere better to be can be found whiling
away the hours under trees in vacant lots, trying to stay cool.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor hopes to help some of those people, too, with taxes
collected from the casinos. The city and the state will divide 18
percent of the gross profits from the casinos _ 55 percent of the
tax share goes to Detroit and 45 percent to Michigan, which plans
to spend the money on educational grants statewide. The city
expects $250 million in casino taxes in the next four years.
</P>
<P>
   Laying down their share will be people like Leona Monit, 49, a
waitress from nearby Garden City, Mich. She said the casino would
bring both good and bad to the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good is a lot of jobs,'' said Ms. Monit, who was so eager
to wager at the MGM Grand that she lined up two hours before it
opened at 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bad is a lot of people are going to gamble who can't
afford to,'' said Ms. Monit, who by 7:30 said she was even for the
night, playing slots.
</P>
<P>
   Among some of the gamblers, there was a buy-at-home sentiment.
Gloria Wheeler, 58, who works on a pickup truck assembly line in
Pontiac and was playing the slots Thursday, said that she had been
driving to the casinos in Windsor but that ``it is better to turn
over the money in the city.''

LONG-DISTANCE GIANTS REPORT SOLID RESULTS FOR QUARTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The nation's two largest long-distance telephone carriers, AT&AMP;T
Corp. and MCI Worldcom Inc., Thursday announced strong quarterly
financial results _ propelled, paradoxically, by just about
everything except long-distance telephone service.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's results underscored the fact that at the
long-distance industry's highest levels, the big growth
opportunities are not to be found in telephones anymore, at least
not in the kind of phones that plug into wall jacks.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the recipe for growth in the long-distance business
seems to be to expand into new markets while chopping costs in the
old ones.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, MCI Worldcom's pro forma revenue from standard
phone service rose only 5.6 percent over the comparable period last
year, while revenue from corporate data services increased 29.1
percent and Internet revenue grew 59.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue from international services increased 55.6 percent. (The
pro forma figures are calculated as if Worldcom and MCI were
already a combined company in the comparable period of 1998, and
they exclude MCI Worldcom's interest in Embratel, a Brazilian
communications company.)
</P>
<P>
   The combined performance fueled overall pro forma revenue growth
of about 10.4 percent, to $8.3 billion from $7.5 billion in the
comparable period of 1998. At the same time, MCI Worldcom, the No.
2 long-distance carrier, cut operating expenses to $6.5 billion
from $6.7 billion in the second quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The revenue growth and cost cuts helped create a 175 percent
rise in pro forma earnings per diluted share, from 16 cents to 44
cents. Those earnings matched estimates by analysts surveyed by the
First Call Corp., a financial research firm.
</P>
<P>
   When Worldcom's acquisition of MCI and its investment in
Embratel are taken into effect, reported revenue for the company
increased to $8.9 billion from $2.6 billion. Earnings rose to 45
cents a share from 21 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Taken in a vacuum, the figures for AT&AMP;T, the No. 1 long-distance
carrier and the nation's biggest communications company, were not
as strong as MCI Worldcom's. But in the context of AT&AMP;T's
continuing awakening from slumber, the company's results were at
least as impressive.
</P>
<P>
   Showing AT&AMP;T's fastest growth in three years, the company's pro
forma revenue increased 6.7 percent, to $15.8 billion from $14.8
billion in the comparable period of 1998. The pro forma figures are
calculated as if AT&AMP;T had already completed its acquisitions of
Tele-Communications Inc. and of parts of IBM's Global Network unit
by the second quarter of last year.
</P>
<P>
   Including the TCI and IBM deals, but discounting one-time
charges and gains and discounting some outside investments, AT&AMP;T
reported earnings of 49 cents, or $1.6 billion, down from 54 cents
a share, or $1.47 billion in the same period last year. The
per-share dilution was an effect of AT&AMP;T's issuing shares in the
TCI acquisition, but the 49 cent per-share figure beat the
consensus estimate of analysts polled by First Call by a penny.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest sign of strength for AT&AMP;T came in its wireless unit,
which posted a revenue gain of 42.4 percent, to $1.8 billion from
$1.3 billion, excluding AT&AMP;T's acquisition of Vanguard Cellular
Systems Inc. and the sale of AT&AMP;T's paging business.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most important figure in AT&AMP;T's results
reflected the company's sales, general and administrative spending,
which is often seen as a reflection of a company's ``leanness.''
AT&AMP;T spent 22.1 percent of its revenue on such expenses in the
latest quarter as it pared its work force, a big drop from the
comparable period of 1998, when that figure was 25.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called SG&AMP;A figure has long been a benchmark for Worldcom
managers, who had pushed that figure to less than 20 percent before
acquiring MCI. In the last quarter, the figure for MCI Worldcom was
24.4 percent, though SG&AMP;A figures cannot be compared directly
because different companies calculate them in slightly different
ways.
</P>
<P>
   Showing the effect of the TCI and IBM deals, AT&AMP;T reported
quarterly revenue of $15.7 billion, up from $13.2 billion in the
comparable period of 1998. Earnings increased to $1.6 billion, or
49 cents a share, from $1.1 billion, or 42 cents a share.

MARTHA STEWART TO SELL $100 MILLION IN STOCK 
</HEADLINE>
 STEWART-NYT  (yn) 
 By GERALDINE FABRIKANT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For those who wish they could be Martha Stewart, now at least
they can own a piece of her company.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stewart, the doyenne of domestic details, is selling $100
million in stock in her company, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia
Inc., according to documents filed Thursday with the Securities and
Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Investors will be able to buy stock in a company dominated by
the monthly homemaking bible, Martha Stewart Living, but whose
television, merchandising and Internet businesses are growing
robustly.
</P>
<P>
   But even as Ms. Stewart sells a stake in her company, she is
retaining control of an empire that had $180 million in revenue
last year, slightly more than twice the sales it had two years
earlier. Though the company will issue class A shares, which will
have one vote each, Ms. Stewart will own all the class B shares,
which have 10 votes each. Still, the figures do not indicate how
much of the company she will eventually own because they do not
detail how many shares the company will have to sell to raise the
$100 million.
</P>
<P>
   The document also says the company is reorganizing the ownership
of the company. Of the proceeds raised in the offering, Ms. Stewart
may spend up to $42 million to buy out the remaining 6.2 percent
stake owned by Time Warner under the terms of an agreement reached
in 1997. Time Warner had been an initial backer of Ms. Stewart's
magazine, the basis of her empire, but Martha Stewart Living
reportedly spent $75 million in 1997 to buy out most of the
magazine operation.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stewart's company has also agreed to sell a 5 percent stake
to Kleiner, Perkins, Caulfield &AMP; Buyers, a venture capital firm in
San Francisco, for $25 million. As part of that deal, Kleiner,
Perkins will receive a warrant that it can exercise for $21
million, allowing the firm to buy into any Internet business set up
by the company.
</P>
<P>
   That investment puts the total value of the company at slightly
less than $500 million because Kleiner, Perkins is getting more
than just the equity stake.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stewart has been expanding her company, particularly in
merchandising, a move that bolsters her brand name and image and
generates higher profit margins than the magazine operations. For
example, publishing revenue of $127 million represented 70 percent
of the company's $180 million in sales last year. A year earlier,
publishing had represented about 81 percent of the company's $132
million in sales.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, merchandising, which was 5.1 percent of 1997 sales,
rose to 8.3 percent of sales last year. The company has also been
expanding its Internet business, where sales jumped to $14.7
million last year from $4.8 million in 1997, though the division is
not yet profitable. Ms. Stewart has also been pushing ahead with
television projects to exploit the brand name.
</P>
<P>
   The document also discloses that Ms. Stewart earned $5 million
in salary and bonus last year.
</P>
<P>
   The company expects to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange.

IN PARCHED MARYLAND, GOVERNOR DECLARES DROUGHT EMERGENCY 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the nation's capital and the surrounding region
continued to bake through a long, hot dry spell, Gov. Parris
Glendening of Maryland on Thursday declared the first statewide
drought emergency in his state's history.
</P>
<P>
   ``This drought is a serious problem,'' the governor said, ``but
we do not intend to let it become unmanageable.''
</P>
<P>
   Glendening spoke from the edge of the Liberty Reservoir, which
serves the Baltimore area. The reservoir's water level is 24 feet
below normal, and two other reservoirs are also very low, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is, if water consumption continues at the current
rate, there is only a 35-day supply in these reservoirs,''
Glendening said, noting that the three reservoirs served more than
1.8 million people in Greater Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's declaration, accompanied by pledges of financial
aid for farmers whose crops have been stunted, included a long list
of suggestions for conserving water: Take shorter showers, do not
wash cars, leave the lawn and flowers to the mercy of the sun.
</P>
<P>
   But Glendening said conservation measures might not be voluntary
for long. He has formed a drought task force that will submit
recommendations for water-use restrictions within a week.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, a spokeswoman for Mayor Anthony Williams said
city officials were continuing to monitor the Potomac River, which
supplies the city's water. The river is running below normal for
this time of year, but there is no need yet for emergency
restrictions, the mayor's representative said.
</P>
<P>
   In Virginia, a drought task force has been meeting regularly, a
spokesman for Gov. James Gilmore said. Water supplies are still
adequate in most parts of the state, though there have been
scattered problems in central and western Virginia, the spokesman
said. If the dry spell goes on, it could cause forest fires, he
warned.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the summer, daytime high temperatures in Washington,
parts of Maryland and in the Virginia suburbs of the capital have
been well over 90, nothing unusual for the region in June, July and
August.
</P>
<P>
   But rainfall has been well below normal. From May 29 through
Thursday, Baltimore County had 3.8 inches of rain, just under half
of normal, the National Weather Service said. The District of
Columbia and the Virginia suburbs recorded 3.2 inches, just over 40
percent of normal.
</P>
<P>
   But the water scarcity was not created in two months. The region
usually has mild winters, and last winter was not only mild but
almost free of snow. There was only light rainfall in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland, especially, has been hard-hit. For the last three
years, rain and snow have been far below normal, Glendening noted.
Crops have dried up _ the governor's drought declaration provides
for $3 million in emergency assistance for farmers _ fish have died
in the Chesapeake Bay, and wild fires have been epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the weather around Washington has often been
humid, as though the sky is ready to unleash torrents of rainfall.
Sometimes, the sky has become tantalizingly purple; there have been
ominous breezes and rumbles of thunder.
</P>
<P>
   And then, too often, there have been only a few drops of rain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if we did get normal rainfall over the next few months,
the drought could continue to worsen,'' the Weather Service noted
in a statement released on Wednesday.

 _ SF CHRON   E-Tailer Wins Backing of Marc Andreessen 
 &HT;     By Peter Sinton 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Accompany Inc., the San Francisco startup that aims to change the
way goods are bought on the Internet, has won the support of one of
Silicon Valley's well-known wunderkind.
<P>
   Netscape co-founder Marc Andreessen, 28, has invested about
$500,000 in the year-old company, and Accompany announced yesterday
that he has become a director. He joins Forbes magazine Publisher
Rich Karlgaard, Mayfield Fund general partner Kevin Fong and
Accompany CEO Jim Rose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Accompany lets individuals and small businesses get the same
discount prices previously reserved for large companies,'' said
Andreessen, now chief technology officer at America Online.
``Aggregated buying is the next wave in e-commerce, and Accompany
is leading the way.`'
</P>
<P>
   In traditional online auctions like those run by eBay, the
greater the number of bidders, the higher the prices. That's good
for sellers but not buyers. Accompany Inc. is out to change this
e-commerce equation by allowing multiple bidders to drive down
prices. In other words, the more buyers, the greater the discounts
on digital cameras, computers and scores of other goods.
</P>
<P>
   Another company that is letting individuals and small businesses
band together for volume discounts is Mercata Inc., the Bellevue,
Wash., company financed by Microsoft billionaire Paul Allen's
Vulcan Ventures.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Accompany has raised about $5 million of private
financing, including about $3.5 million from Mayfield Fund of Menlo
Park. Accompany was started last year by Rose, 25, who studied
comparative cultures at Duke University before becoming a
management consultant and shifting his focus to comparison shopping
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred thousand web browsers visit  &LR; www.accompany.com
 &LR; each month, according to Rose, and up to 5,000 make purchases. He
said they pay from 5 to 30 percent less than they would for a
single unit of the same product at another e-tailer. On Wednesday,
for example, 50 Accompany customers bought Palm V handheld
computers for $315 each. By contrast, the best price among 44
online merchants tracked by Cnet was $347.95.
</P>
<P>
   Accompany's prices to buyers include the 2.5 to 9 percent
commissions the company takes on each purchase. Accompany now lists
only about 200 products a day, much less than Mercata's.
</P>
<P>
   Accompany's offerings also are less diverse. Although it offers
the occasional Weber portable grill, Big Bertha golf club or Pierre
Cardin luggage, Mercata now has many more listings outside the
electronics niche.
</P>
<P>
   When consumers bid on Accompany, there is no certainty how low
the final price will be. Volume discounts ultimately depend on how
many others submit bids. The only guarantee is that prices won't go
up.
</P>
<P>
   Andreessen believes that Accompany, Mercata and perhaps a few
other companies are poised to build big businesses. ``One of the
underappreciated aspects of the Net is that it lends itself to ad
hoc group formation,'' he said. ``Chat rooms may not be big
moneymakers, but letting individuals band together to get discount
pricing is a killer idea. Everyone will want to be part of the
biggest buying club.''
</P>
<P>
   The July 26 issue of ComputerLetter published by Technologic
Partners suggests that the manufacturer's suggested retail price
could be an endangered species. It notes that nine
comparison-shopping engines have been acquired by bigger online
companies during the past two years for between $17 million and
$180 million.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Amazon.com bought Junglee, Yahoo acquired ViaWeb,
America Online purchased PersonaLogic, Microsoft bought CompareNet
and Cnet acquired KillerApp.
</P>
<P>
   These services let prospective buyers browse for bargains and
buy online. Returns, repairs and service can be a problem, but
ComputerLetter editorial director Jack Wilson believes that pricing
and procurement services have a bright future. ``One of the great
uses of the Web is to put individuals or small businesses together
into buying conglomerates that have more clout,'' he said.

<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ One fine day this summer, wreckers toppled six
towering smokestacks along the Monongahela River.
</P>
<P>
   Once part of a huge coke works but long idle, they were the last
vestiges of Big Steel left within the Pittsburgh city limits. The
mills that once employed tens of thousands of workers and made a
third of the world's steel have vanished like ghosts at dawn. Iron
City, aka Steeltown U.S.A., is no more.
</P>
<P>
   But having survived the truly grueling loss of most of its heavy
industry, Pittsburgh is alive and well and getting better. It has
had not one renaissance but two, and a third is under way, fueled
by an intense local pride and a gritty determination to bounce
back. Two new downtown stadiums (one for baseball, the other for
football), a new theater designed by Michael Graves and a new
convention center are on the way. Designed by Rafael Vinoly, the
$231 million convention center is to have a roof in the shape of a
catenary curve; water running off the building's cooling towers
will make it glitter by day, and interior lights will set it aglow
at night.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Pittsburgh is hard at work, striving to forge
a new economic identity as a high-tech center and a regional
medical capital.
</P>
<P>
   Cultural life has a fresh elan as well, sparked partly by the
hip, innovative Andy Warhol Museum _ ``the posthumous home of the
King of Pop,'' as someone called it. The 53rd Carnegie
International, one of the world's premier surveys of contemporary
art, will open in November at the Carnegie Museum of Art with works
by 40 established and relatively unknown artists from 17 nations,
including installation art and video as well as paintings and
sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   The century-old Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, under the
energetic, Latvian-born Mariss Jansons, one of the most prominent
of the young conductors who have emerged in recent years from the
Baltic countries, will open its season this fall not with a safe
selection of Beethoven or Brahms but with Schoenberg's immense,
romantic, seldom-performed ``Gurrelieder.'' Among the soloists will
be two of the more sought-after singers of the day, the Canadian
tenor Ben Heppner and the American mezzo-soprano Jennifer Larmore.
</P>
<P>
   And of course Pittsburgh glories, as ever, in its magnificent
site, first scouted by George Washington as a British major in
1753. The city lies deep within the Allegheny Mountains, where the
Allegheny River meets the Monongahela to form the broad Ohio. Ernie
Pyle wrote once that this was a place of ``hills, mountains,
cliffs, valleys and rivers, up and down, around and around, in
betwixt,'' much better suited to goats than people.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of antique funiculars, called inclines here, still slide
up and down the steep face of Mount Washington, across the water
from the skyscrapers packed into downtown Pittsburgh at the tip of
the Golden Triangle.
</P>
<P>
   Max King, the former editor of The Philadelphia Inquirer, who
moved to Pittsburgh this year to become the executive director of
the $1.5 billion Heinz Endowments, sees a vibrancy in downtown
Pittsburgh that is lacking in Philadelphia, and with industry
having abandoned the riverfronts, he sees ``a once-in-a-lifetime
chance'' to redevelop them to public benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pittsburgh's economic troubles spared it the sprawl that is
disfiguring Philadelphia,'' he said. ``There, the hole is quickly
emptying into the doughnut; all the action is in the suburbs. But
Pittsburgh _ the city itself _ is still the center of this region,
and it's holding.''
</P>
<P>
   There are, to be sure, plenty of problems. Race relations are
not the best. Pockets of urban rot persist not only in the
burnt-out mill towns up and down the river valleys and in the slums
in the city itself, but also downtown. A tacky T-shirt store and a
wig shop stand incongruously, for example, across the street from a
new Lazarus department store.
</P>
<P>
   The jury is still out on job creation, here as in other Rust
Belt cities like Cleveland and Detroit. Pittsburgh's population is
as old as those in some Sun Belt retirement cities, because too
many of the area's most talented young people leave in search of
economic opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   A City of Amenities
</P>
<P>
   But for those who stay or move here, the amenities are many.
Leafy, close-in suburbs like Shadyside and Squirrel Hill. A low
crime rate. Good schools. Moderate housing and living costs.
Extensive parks. A terrific zoo. Three identical suspension
bridges, all painted primrose yellow, crossing the Allegheny side
by side. Three substantial universities: Carnegie Mellon, strong in
science and technology; Duquesne, known for the liberal arts and
law, and the University of Pittsburgh, a medical powerhouse where
some of the pioneering work in liver transplants was carried out.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh has its own vernacular. ``Redd'' means clean, as in
``redd off the table,'' and ``youns'' is the plural of ``you.'' It
has a certain innocence as well. Maybe, as some here complain,
Pittsburgh is provincial (or, to adopt the kinder phrase, used by
one local businessman, ``not very cosmopolitan''). But it also
lacks the edgy aggressiveness of many larger cities.
</P>
<P>
   This is, after all, the hometown of Fred Rogers, the kids'
sweet-natured friend Mr. Rogers, whose program is made at WQED, the
nation's first public television station.
</P>
<P>
   You arrive in Pittsburgh from the west, where the airport is
situated, by way of the Fort Pitt Tunnel. One minute you are
cruising along amid wooded hills, the next you are in the
half-mile-long tube, and then you emerge onto a bridge. Dead in
front of you is Pittsburgh's skyline, a sudden, dramatic,
exhilarating sight, akin to spying the New York or San Francisco
skyline from a steamship in the days before the dawn of jet travel.
</P>
<P>
   The air is clean, the rivers are bright and clear, and if the
sun is shining, John Burgee and Philip Johnson's PPG Place, the
Houses of Parliament in London transmuted into a glass office
building, catches your eye at once.
</P>
<P>
   But of course the approach didn't always look so splendid.

 _ SF CHRON  
 Two Companies Will Help Consumers Skirt AT&AMP;T's Lock on
Cable  System 
 &HT;     By Deborah Solomon 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
While San Francisco may not have forced AT&AMP;T to open its cable
system to competitors just yet, some Bay Area residents still will
get a choice for high-speed Internet access via cable TV lines.
<P>
   Two companies, RCN Corp. of New Jersey and Seren Innovations of
Minnesota, are building state-of-the-art digital cable systems in
parts of the Bay Area. They plan to offer high-speed Internet
connections, digital TV and local and long-distance phone service
over their networks.
</P>
<P>
   RCN, which plans to build a system that stretches across the Bay
Area, is laying fiber in San Francisco, San Mateo, Daly City, South
San Francisco and Redwood City. It plans to start offering service
to some customers by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Seren is building a fiber-optic network in Concord and plans to
expand to Walnut Creek, Danville, Pleasant Hill, Clayton and
unincorporated parts of Contra Costa county. The system should be
up and running in Concord by the end of this year as well.
</P>
<P>
   By constructing two-way digital networks, both companies will be
the Bay Area's first challengers to TCI Cable, which has been the
main provider of cable TV in the region. RCN and Seren also will be
the region's first viable competitors to Pacific Bell for local
phone service.
</P>
<P>
   Their entrance is important in the wake of an intense debate
between AT&AMP;T, which now owns TCI Cable, and Internet service
providers, such as America Online.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, AT&AMP;T is the only choice in the Bay Area for cable
modem service. Although the technology is available only in about
41 Bay Area communities so far, AT&AMP;T is spending billions to
upgrade its cable plants in San Francisco and other cities to
handle high-speed Internet service.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T offers customers cable Internet connections 50 to 100 times
faster than traditional dial-up modems through its affiliate,
Redwood City's ExciteAtHome.
</P>
<P>
   AOL and other ISPs want to offer their customers superfast
Internet connections as well and have been fighting with AT&AMP;T over
access to TCI's cable lines. AOL and ISPs want ``open access'' so
that their customers can get cable modem access without having to
go through ExciteAtHome.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, where the issue recently was debated, AOL and
its supporters complained that AT&AMP;T and ExciteAtHome would have a
monopoly on high-speed Internet access if other ISPs could not
piggyback on AT&AMP;T's lines. City officials disagreed on Monday,
saying they would wait several months before deciding whether to
force AT&AMP;T to open its network.
</P>
<P>
   But industry watchers say competition from RCN and Seren most
likely will prompt AT&AMP;T to open its network. And consumer advocates
say it will lead to cheaper prices and better service.
</P>
<P>
   ``AT&AMP;T is going to have to make a decision _ do we encourage
other people to come in and build another system, or do we allow
people to come on and use our network?'' said Frank Murphy, a
telecommunications analyst with First Union Capital Markets in
Richmond, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy said AT&AMP;T probably will choose the latter so it can make
money off the companies that use its lines, instead of losing
business to competitors.
</P>
<P>
   RCN officials say they welcome open access and will make their
lines available to other ISPs who want to pay for the access.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's little rationale for not having open access,'' said
Paul Sigmund, RCN's executive vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Seren officials said they will decide on open access once their
network is built.
</P>
<P>
   Even without open access, RCN and Seren plan to offer
competitive prices to AT&AMP;T and TCI.
</P>
<P>
   Seren offers discounts on bundled packages of cable, phone and
Net services in the areas where it operates. The company has not
set prices for Contra Costa, but it charges about $40 per month for
Internet service and between $12 and $35 for cable TV in
Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston and Washington, D.C., RCN charges $31 per month for
cable TV but offers a discount to customers if they also purchase
another service. Its cable Internet service is about $40 per month,
the same price as ExciteAtHome's.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy said RCN's attitude and pricing has made the company a
success in markets where it competes.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Manhattan, when RCN builds out a network and starts
offering service, they have more than a 50 percent acceptance
rate,'' Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that because RCN is building its network from scratch,
it's more up to date than TCI's cable, which is more than 20 years
old in some cities, including San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``Competition is good, and customers will benefit from having a
choice,'' Murphy said.

   Determined Mayors
</P>
<P>
   It took a series of determined mayors to change the city's face,
starting in the 1950s with David Lawrence, who adopted the slogan
``Smoke Must Go.'' He and successors like Peter Flaherty and
Richard Caliguiri made common cause with business leaders, notably
Richard King Mellon.
</P>
<P>
   Rachel Carson, who grew up not far from here, would have been
proud of what they accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   In its heyday as the self-described Workshop of the World,
Pittsburgh was an industrial inferno. Only half a century ago, the
rivers teemed with tugs and barges, and the mills poured brown and
green ooze into the water and black and gray soot into the skies,
so much so that street lights often had to be kept on all day. One
week in 1948, 30 people were killed by smog in the grimy little
borough of Donora (where, incidentally, the baseball hall-of-famer
Stan Musial grew up).
</P>
<P>
   ``Blackest place I ever saw,'' said the 19th-century English
traveler Anthony Trollope, and he knew grim industrial landscapes
at home.
</P>
<P>
   But Pittsburgh produced steel in prodigious quantities. At the
end of World War II, United States Steel, the first billion-dollar
corporation in history when it was formed in 1901, made twice as
much steel as the entire Soviet Union. Set against that, what was a
little pollution?
</P>
<P>
   Enormous Fortunes
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh also produced enormous fortunes for men like Andrew
Carnegie, an immigrant from Scotland who built a steel empire;
Henry Clay Frick, the king of coke, the baked coal essential to the
steel-making process, who was first an aide and then a rival to
Carnegie, and Andrew Mellon, the banker who financed the new
magnates and grew rich in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Mellon money built the National Gallery in Washington, and when
Andrew Mellon's son, Paul, died this year at the age of 91, he had
given it more than 1,000 pictures, including two van Goghs and 12
Winslow Homers in a final bequest, as well as $75 million in cash.
Frick money built New York's finest small art museum. Carnegie
money built libraries around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Only small fractions of their wealth stayed in Pittsburgh,
though their names grace monuments, buildings, parks, streets and
museums.
</P>
<P>
   To work in the mills, peasants came from all over Europe. A sign
from one Carnegie plant, preserved in the excellent (if clumsily
named) John Heinz Pittsburgh Regional History Center, warned of
danger in English, Italian, Hungarian, Slovak and Serbo-Croatian.
My great-grandfather was one of those hardy spirits, and his son,
my grandfather, worked in nearby Jeanette, which was for some time
the center of the American glass industry. My father was born
there.
</P>
<P>
   Myths grew up about industrial Bunyans like Joe Magarac, a
Hungarian who could derail a locomotive with his little finger, and
Steve Mestrovic, a Serb who could supposedly twist a 500-pound
steel bar into a pretzel. In real life, the tough river towns where
the immigrants settled produced more than their share of sports
heroes, especially pro football quarterbacks, including Johnny
Unitas, Joe Montana, Jim Kelly, Joe Namath and George Blanda.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh quickly became a battleground between labor and
capital. In the notorious Homestead strike of 1892, Pinkerton
detectives employed by Frick clashed with workers; 20 people were
killed and 300 wounded. The Amalgamated Association of Iron and
Steel Workers was crushed. Industry won the battle, but labor won
the war, decades later, when Philip Murray organized the United
Steel Workers Union. Now plans are afoot to bring the site of the
strike and other steel-industry landmarks under the aegis of the
National Park Service.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks streamed into Pittsburgh as well, and soon built a
thriving subculture. The Pittsburgh Courier was the nation's
leading African-American newspaper, and the city produced a
seemingly endless flow of jazz stars, from Billy Strayhorn to
Erroll Garner to Mary Lou Williams. Before the integration of major
league baseball, the Pittsburgh Crawfords and the Homestead Grays
flourished on the black circuit with players like Josh Gibson and
the inimitable Satchel Paige.
</P>
<P>
   Sports still loom large here, as befits the city's six-pack
image, though the relatively small population (350,000, with
1,335,000 in Allegheny County) makes supporting big-league teams
difficult. The Pittsburgh Penguins, twice National Hockey League
champions in recent years, were faced with bankruptcy until a judge
approved a plan under which Mario Lemieux, the team's greatest star
until he retired in 1997, took control of the team.
</P>
<P>
   Legends live on, like Pirates infielder Bill Mazeroski's
improbable last-of-the-ninth home run to beat the Yankees, 10-9, in
the seventh game of the 1960 World Series, and Steelers running
back Franco Harris' ``immaculate reception'' of Terry Bradshaw's
deflected last-gasp pass to win a crucial playoff game in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Architectural Highlights
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh is rediscovering its significant architectural
heritage and urging visitors to do the same. Southwestern
Pennsylvania has two of the very greatest American buildings, Henry
Hobson Richardson's Allegheny County Courthouse and Jail, in
Pittsburgh, and Frank Lloyd Wright's wonderful cantilevered country
villa, Fallingwater, an hour to the southeast.
</P>
<P>
   Fallingwater was built for Pittsburgh merchant Edgar Kaufmann,
who cooked up a number of other projects, most of them never built,
with the master of Taliesen. Plans and models can be seen in a show
at the Carnegie Museum through Aug. 27.
</P>
<P>
   The courthouse _ a great castlelike structure of rusticated
granite, with a 325-foot tower _ is connected to the jail by a
Bridge of Sighs like the one that links the Doge's Palace and the
jail in Venice. It is a massive, masculine ensemble; the voussoirs,
or blocks, that form the main entrance, one of Richardson's
trademark Romanesque arches, are eight feet long. Yet there is
nothing clumsy or heavy about the structure.

 PITTSBURGH: the structure.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Richardson whets your appetite for more, walk down Grant
Street. On the way you will see Frick's Union Trust Building
(1915), with a breathtaking stack of nine balconies, crowned by a
round stained-glass skylight, and a froth of terra-cotta turrets,
balustrades, pinnacles and balustrades on the roof; the Koppers
Building (1929), in an urbane Art Deco style, and the USX Building
(1970), a bold tower in Cor-Ten steel, which oxidizes to a deep
red-brown, protecting against deterioration.
</P>
<P>
   The USX Building, by Harrison &AMP; Abramovitz, looks much less
dated than the slightly earlier buildings from the same hands, New
York's Metropolitan Opera House and Avery Fisher Hall at Lincoln
Center. Its exoskeleton of vertical beams is filled with water and
antifreeze as a fire retardant.
</P>
<P>
   In a real sense the USX Building is a continuing advertisement
for the company that built it, once named U.S. Steel. So is the
former Alcoa Building (1953), nearby on Sixth Avenue, whose skin is
formed of preformed aluminum panels, and the glass-faced PPG Place
(1984), on Third Avenue, which was built by a company formerly
called Pittsburgh Plate Glass.
</P>
<P>
   A Cultural Catalyst
</P>
<P>
   No family has done more for Pittsburgh, especially for the arts
in Pittsburgh, than the Heinzes, purveyors to the world of 57
Varieties _ actually, today, more like 5,700. It was H.J. Heinz II,
known as Jack, who had the idea that cultural resources could aid
in jump-starting an economic revival here. He bought four abandoned
movie theaters downtown and helped turn them into the Cultural
District, anchored by Heinz Hall, home to the Symphony.
</P>
<P>
   Fritz Reiner, William Steinberg, Andre Previn and Lorin Maazel
all helped to mold the orchestra's global reputation, but Heinz
dollars balanced the organization's budget. Without them, as Gideon
Toeplitz, the managing director, said several years ago, Pittsburgh
would have ``a small regional orchestra rather like the Wheeling
Symphony just down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   In December, the new home of the Pittsburgh Public Theater will
open across the street from Heinz Hall with a world premiere of a
play by August Wilson, a Pittsburgh native. Designed by Michael
Graves, with a great copper cowl giving its facade a distinctive
appearance, it has a Heinz connection, too. It was partly financed
by the friends of, and named for, Anthony J.F. O'Reilly, H.J. Heinz
Co.'s 's Irish-born chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Next door will stand a fountain designed by Louise Bourgeois.
</P>
<P>
   Drama is a many-layered thing in Pittsburgh. Apart from the
Public Theater and the musicals that also play in the Cultural
District, there are the venturesome City Theater on the South Side
and Karla Boos' lively Quantum Theater, which performs in spaces
either discovered or improvised.
</P>
<P>
   Neither opera nor dance is big-league yet, but the city has an
amazing number of dance organizations, large and small. The most
prominent is the Pittsburgh Ballet Theater, whose artistic
director, Terrence Orr, has steered it away from the Balanchine
tradition toward that of his alma mater, American Ballet Theater.
</P>
<P>
   The Phipps Botanical Gardens, an 1893 gift from Henry Phipps,
one of Carnegie's sidekicks, has a 13-room Victorian conservatory,
one of the finest in the country. And the Frick Art Museum, a
country cousin of the New York showplace, exhibits the collection
of Henry Clay Frick's daughter, Helen; its highlights are a
magisterial Rubens portrait and works by the Sienese masters Duccio
and Sassetta.
</P>
<P>
   Bones and Art
</P>
<P>
   But the heaviest hitters here, in addition to the Symphony, are
the Carnegie and Warhol museums.
</P>
<P>
   The Carnegie complex, in Oakland, east of downtown, includes a
museum of natural history, renowned for its dinosaur collection, as
well as the art museum, headquarters for the International, whose
curator this year is Madeleine Grynsztejn. Since its beginning, the
art museum has concentrated on the art of the 19th and 20th
centuries _ ``the Old Masters of tomorrow,'' as Carnegie himself
put it.
</P>
<P>
   Paintings, sculpture and the decorative arts are intermingled to
good effect in galleries occupied by the permanent collection.
Take, for instance, the room devoted to the Arts and Crafts
Movement; there, furniture by C.F.A. Voysey and Harvey Ellis and
copperware by W.A.S. Benson keep company with two huge, newly
acquired Pre-Raphaelite canvases by Burne-Jones.
</P>
<P>
   First-rate pictures by the likes of Cezanne, Kirchner and Degas
(a smashing portrait of the engineer Henri Rouart) lie ahead. But
most intriguing to me was a selection of pioneer American
abstractionists like Burgoyne Diller, George L.K. Morris and
Stanton Macdonald-Wright.
</P>
<P>
   Over at the Warhol, installed in an old seven-story building
renovated by the New York architect Richard Gluckman, you are
greeted by a big cobalt-blue self-portrait of the artist,
wide-eyed, spiky-haired. The building is filled with Warhol's
collections (milk glass, shoes of famous people); Warhol's
wallpaper (I liked the pink-and-yellow cow pattern); Warhol's
films; Warhol's portraits of Mao, Liz and Mick; Warhol's books and
Warhol's archives _ 605 identical boxes filled with everything from
the master pack rat's mail to the original images on which he based
his famous silk screens.
</P>
<P>
   A Pittsburgh native whose parents came from the Carpathian
Mountains in central Europe, Warhol once wrote: ``You live in your
dream America that you've custom-made from art and schmaltz and
emotions just as much as you live in your real one.'' The museum is
Andy's world, custom-recreated.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh has taken to it slowly; Thomas Sokolowski, the
director, says, ``It's a sober city, very Presbyterian.'' Of the
65,000 visitors to the museum last year, half came from out of
state, many from Japan and Germany. But Sokolowski keeps plugging.
He has started a Friday happy hour and has big plans for musical
events, including a staging of the Satie-Poulenc-Ravel triple bill
``Parade,'' as big a scandal in its day as Warhol in his.

 _ SF CHRON  
 Net Instant Messaging Sides Forming  &HT;     By Tom Stein 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
The nation's most prominent technology companies may be forced to
choose sides in the skirmish over Internet instant messaging.
<P>
   America Online said yesterday that it would team up with Apple
Computer to develop new products that will allow Macintosh
customers to communicate in real time with users of AOL's Instant
Messenger (AIM) service.
</P>
<P>
   The move threatens to pit AOL and Apple against Microsoft, Yahoo
and a host of smaller instant messaging companies, who are
clamoring for open standards in the market.
</P>
<P>
   They accuse AOL of hijacking the instant messaging space and
denying consumers the right to conduct chat sessions with whomever
they wish. AOL, in turn, says Microsoft is bulldozing its way into
the market at AOL's expense.
</P>
<P>
   AOL said it formed an advisory group that includes its chief
technology officer, Marc Andreessen, and Apple interim chief
executive Steve Jobs to set standards for sending instant messages
online.
</P>
<P>
   The group includes Sun Microsystems Inc. Chief Scientist Bill
Joy, Novell Inc. Chairman Eric Schmidt and RealNetworks Inc.
Chairman Rob Glaser. Microsoft was also invited to join the group.
</P>
<P>
   As things stand now, the 40 million users of AIM officially can
only exchange online instant messages with one another and not with
friends and family members who use a competing product, such as
Microsoft's new MSN Messenger or Yahoo Messenger.
</P>
<P>
   But AOL is now saying it will create software that will allow
Mac users to chat online with friends and colleagues who are part
of AOL's Instant Messenger network. The companies were
intentionally vague about details. Officials declined to say
exactly what new products were in the works or when they would be
available.
</P>
<P>
   Apple of Cupertino has become a more significant force in the
computer world with the success of its candy-colored iMac
computers. In June, Apple was the No.3 PC-maker in retail and mail
order sales, with 11.2 percent of the market, according to PC Data.
</P>
<P>
   Instant messaging programs, which can be downloaded free off the
Internet, are wildly popular among Web surfers. The software is
used to locate ``buddies'' online and send and receive text
messages in real time.
</P>
<P>
   Some industry watchers believe the AOL-Apple deal has clear and
ominous implications. ``AOL is trying to create its own standards
body,'' said Rob Enderle, an analyst with Giga Information Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message is that to get certified, you'll first need AOL's
approval.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Microsoft, Yahoo and others hope to adopt
standards created by an independent body that would allow their
messaging products to work with one another. Proponents of open
standards draw comparisons with e-mail, noting that it would be
ridiculous if a person running Lotus Notes could not exchange
messages with a business partner on, say, Microsoft Outlook.
</P>
<P>
   Though AOL and Apple are mum about future plans, there is some
speculation that next-generation versions of AIM &UR;  &LR; will come
preloaded on Apple's iMac computers.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Dym, vice president of marketing at instant messaging
company Tribal Voice Inc. in Scotts Valley, said he was in
discussions earlier this year to co-brand his company's messaging
software on Apple products. ``It was a bit of an ego blow, but I
guess they decided to go with AOL,'' joked Dym.
</P>
<P>
   ``AOL has built the biggest and best instant messaging service
in the world,'' Jobs said in a statement. ``We're partnering with
AOL to create instant messaging products that will further enhance
the Internet experience for Macintosh users.''
</P>
<P>
   An Apple spokesperson would not comment on whether the AOL deal
is exclusive or on Apple's position in the open standards debate.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say the AOL-Apple announcement is just a case of
bad timing and does not reflect Apple's intention to side with AOL
over Microsoft. ``This is not an agreement that was just thrown
together in the last week,'' said Mark Levitt, an analyst with IDC.
``This is more an indication that Apple is enjoying a successful
comeback and has partners like AOL who want to develop software for
its platform.''
</P>
<P>
   But some observers believe Apple, which eagerly accepted a $150
million investment from Microsoft two years ago, is straddling both
sides of the fence. ``This looks to be a classic case of
`coopetition,' said Richard Dym. ``Only in Silicon Valley can you
be friends and enemies at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Hostilities between AOL and Microsoft first broke out last week
when Microsoft introduced its own instant messaging product called
MSN Messenger Service. It immediately raised eyebrows because,
unlike other messaging products, it boasted interoperability
features that tapped into AOL's offering.
</P>
<P>
   But AOL cried foul and said Microsoft was gaining unauthorized
access to its servers by asking people who downloaded the software
to first provide their AOL passwords. AOL attempted to block the
connection, but Microsoft continued to one-up AOL by releasing new
versions of its software that circumvent any attempts to stop it.
As of yesterday, Microsoft had released five versions of the
software in nearly as many days.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft said it plans to release a version of MSN Instant
Messenger on the Mac platform by the end of the year.

 PITTSBURGH: in his. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Enjoying Pittsburgh
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh is 365 miles southwest of New York City. Here is a
sampling of attractions and places to stay and eat in the area,
along with travel information:
</P>
<P>
   Where to Stay
</P>
<P>
   DOUBLETREE HOTEL, 1000 Penn Ave., (412) 281-3700. Renovated only
this year, the Doubletree is Pittsburgh's freshest hotel, with a
light-filled, four-story atrium lobby. Theaters are just a couple
of blocks away, and an enclosed walkway leads to the convention
center. Though pretty prosaic, the rooms are a good deal roomier
than the chain hotel standard. Double rooms: $189 weekdays; $119 to
$189 weekends.
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH HILTON, Gateway Center, (412) 391-4600. In a city
that woefully lacks a top-drawer hotel, the Hilton is blessed with
those three cardinal virtues: location, location and location.
Overlooking the junction of the Allegheny and Monongahela, with 711
rooms and 38 suites, it is a convention hotel par excellence, with
all the pluses and minuses that go with that. The crisp, smallish,
up-to-date rooms on the top floors are the best. Double rooms: $199
to $250.
</P>
<P>
   SUNNYLEDGE, 5124 Fifth Ave., Shadyside, (412) 683-5014. Oakland
once had a pair of fine big hotels, the Schenley and Webster Hall.
Both are long gone, alas, but this eight-room red-brick inn
provides a classy refuge for visitors to the universities and the
museums. All mod cons: minibars, cable television, Jacuzzi tubs,
hair dryers and Frette linens. Double rooms: $199 to $189; suites,
$275.
</P>
<P>
   WESTIN WILLIAM PENN, 530 William Penn Place, (412) 281-7100.
Henry Clay Frick built this Beaux-Arts pile to house his business
friends when they came to town. After countless face lifts, the old
girl is handsome enough, with enormous crystal chandeliers in the
Palm Court. But the service is disheartening, with breakfast cards
sometimes left dangling on doorknobs, unfilled, and desultory
delivery of baggage and messages. Today's nabobs send their
visitors down the street to the veddy private Duquesne Club. Double
rooms: $169 to $229, weekdays; $99 to $169, weekends.
</P>
<P>
   Where to Eat
</P>
<P>
   CAFE ALLEGRO, 51 S. 12th St., (412) 481-7788. The cooking is a
tad uneven at this relaxed spot next to the 1915 South Side Market
House, just off post-industrial Carson Street; one night recently,
the veal chop was tasty and sweet seared scallops were nicely mated
with a tangy tangerine-juice reduction, but smoked trout was too
dry and soft-shell were crabs overcooked. Still, the spirit is
willing; baffled at first by a request for cheese at meal's end,
the kitchen quickly improvised an appealing assortment.
</P>
<P>
   CASBAH, 229 S. Highland Ave., Shadyside, (412) 661-5656. This is
the lead restaurant of an entrepreneurial duo who call themselves
Big Burrito Inc. The menu is Mediterranean: tagines from Morocco,
fearlessly fiery merguez sausage from Tunisia, pasta, a dense
ragout of lamb with couscous. Flavors are as emphatic as a smack in
the chops. Terrific wines, especially the Rhones, and a sultry,
sand-colored decor with hanging lamps reminiscent of Venice and
Fortuny.
</P>
<P>
   STEELHEAD GRILL, 112 Washington Place, (412) 394-3474. An
outpost of Drew Nieporent's empire (and hence a sibling of New
York's Tribeca Grill and Nobu), this is the city's top table, for
my money. Greg Alauzen, a hometown boy, concocts a shellfish
chowder that would delight any Down Easter, and serves skillfully
grilled shrimp on a bed of linguine with a rich basil-lemon sauce.
The wines are chosen by the savvy Daniel Johnnes of Montrachet.
</P>
<P>
   TESSARO'S, 4601 Liberty Ave., Bloomfield, (412) 682-6809. You're
tired of beurre blanc and balsamic vinegar and waiters named Clyde.
You need a joint with no attitude. In Pittsburgh, Tessaro's fills
the bill perfectly: a bar in a working-class neighborhood with Sam
Adams on draft, decadently juicy half-pound burgers cooked on a
hardwood grill, and plenty of good cheer. No french fries, no
dessert, no reservations, just sensational meat.
</P>
<P>
   LA CUCINA FLEGREA, 2114 Murray Ave., Squirrel Hill, (412)
521-2082. The room is plain and tiny, but the minute you walk in,
you know you're in the right place. It smells Italian, not
Italian-American. Anna Fevola comes from a village north of Naples,
and her cooking has that superbly unadorned clarity of flavor we
all long for. Order the grilled sausage, with charred edges, served
underneath a blanket of bitter rapini. BYOB.

NOISE, SCREAMING AND BLOOD EVERYWHERE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs to add 11 new grafs at end, beginning with `Cabrer took in
these ...' No pickup.)   (With GA-SHOOT)  
(th) 
 By DAVID BARSTOW    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Cabrer did not think. He just ran toward the noise. He saw
a man running right at him. The man's face was purple and red and
all twisted up with panic. ``Call the police!'' the man was
screaming, over and over.
</P>
<P>
   In the chaos after a mass shooting in an Atlanta office
building, Cabrer kept going. Security guards were running
everywhere. He crossed a walkway and found himself at the emergency
exit of All-Tech Investment Group. He looked inside a large room.
He saw a man with a bullet hole in his cheek. Silently, the man was
feeling his body to see where he had been hit.
</P>
<P>
   A few feet away, a man was on his back, eyes wide open, not
moving. Cabrer went to him. There was blood. Cabrer leaned forward
and began CPR.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd never done it before,'' said Cabrer, 30, an analyst for
the Georgia State Tollway Authority. ``When I pressed on his chest,
I could feel his ribs cracking. When I blew into his lungs, it was
coming right back out. He was gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Cabrer stood up and looked around. He saw another man on the
floor. Dead. Shot in the chest. Covered in blood. And then another
man. Also dead.
</P>
<P>
   Now people were rushing into the room. But the room was quiet,
or it seemed that way to Cabrer. The senses, he said, go a little
strange when you find yourself wandering the scene of the latest
American massacre.
</P>
<P>
   He noticed something on the floor. It looked like a 9 mm bullet,
a hollow point. He recognized it because he has his own 9 mm
handgun. Nearby, he saw what looked to him like the shell casing
from a .45-caliber bullet.
</P>
<P>
   Two guns, he thought.
</P>
<P>
   Cabrer looked for someone to help. The room was perhaps 40 feet
long. It had two long conference tables in the middle. There were
lots of chairs and computers. He started clearing chairs out of the
way. It seemed a useful thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   By the front of the room, a young woman was slipping into shock.
She had been shot in the hip, Cabrer said. People were covering her
with clothes to keep her warm. Off to her left was a man with
bullet wounds in his chest.
</P>
<P>
   Cabrer noticed an ambulance, and then a couple of paramedics.
``They really weren't prepared for what they saw,'' he said, his
voice sympathetic.
</P>
<P>
   The man with the chest wounds seemed to be alive when they took
him away. Cabrer wondered if the man would live. He heard a police
officer questioning someone. One snippet of the interview stuck in
his mind.
</P>
<P>
   The witness said the gunman walked into the office and said, ``I
hope this doesn't ruin your trading day.'' And then he walked into
the manager's office, closed the door, and started shooting, the
witness was telling the police officer.
</P>
<P>
   Cabrer looked into the manager's office. ``There was blood all
over the wall,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Someone said the gunman shot the manager's secretary. Someone
else said that a woman ran from the office, and that the gunman ran
out after her and shot her, too. Someone said the man may have lost
some money in the market.
</P>
<P>
   Cabrer took in these stray bits of conversation as he lingered
in the bloodied offices. He felt oddly curious. He was not really
frightened, though his heart felt like it was trying to beat its
way out of his chest.
</P>
<P>
   From across the walkway, Cabrer's boss was watching him from the
offices of the tollway authority. ``That's my Generation X guy,''
Dan Guimond, 47, the director of the tollway authority, thought to
himself as he watched Cabrer helping the paramedics.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday afternoon, Guimond had been going over his budget,
trying to figure out pay raises for his staff.
</P>
<P>
   A man ran into the offices, breathless. ``Call 911! Call 911! A
man with a gun in our offices,'' the man said.
</P>
<P>
   Guimond noticed that man's eyes were watering. Then Guimond
called 911.
</P>
<P>
   A second man ran into the tollway offices. ``I'm glad you got
out,'' the second man said to the first. Guimond offered them
water. The first man asked for a Coke. Guimond brought him a Coke.
The man placed it against his neck. The second man wanted to call
his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Guimond thought of his 37 employees. He locked the entrance
door. He ordered everyone to close all the window blinds. He told
people to gather together in the central rooms, away from windows.
There was no panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we were cool about it,'' Guimond said. ``You joke that
these things are becoming just another daily event. `Oh, another
mass shooting.' Just this one happens to be across the way. We're
getting so numb to it.''
</P>
<P>
   In time, Guimond said he and his employees felt safe to stand at
the windows and watch. They saw police officers, and more officers,
and then still more arrive, as if the entire Atlanta Police
Department was coming. They counted the number of ambulance gurneys
that left the offices. First one, then two more, then a few more.
They counted, as Guimond put it, three ``walking wounded.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside, in the courtyard, a water fountain bubbled away.
Inside, in a blood-spattered room, John Cabrer, a man who likes to
parasail and sky-dive, held a bag of saline solution for a
paramedic fighting to save a life.

   BIG GAIN IN LABOR COSTS RAISES FEAR OF HIGHER RATES
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department reported that the so-called employment cost
index rose 1.1 percent from the first to the second quarter of the
year, its biggest increase in eight years. The unexpected gain
overshadowed a separate government report that showed the robust
American economy took a breather in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Stock and bond prices plunged as investors appeared worried that
Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, who closely monitors
the employment gauge, might be more likely to favor raising
interest rates to keep inflation in check.
</P>
<P>
   STOCK AND BOND PRICES TUMBLE
</P>
<P>
   Stock and bond prices fell on inflation fears. The Dow Jones
industrial average declined 180.78 points, or 1.65 percent, to
10,791.29. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index skidded 24.37
points, or 1.78 percent, to 1,341.03, and the NASDAQ composite
index decreased 65.83 points, or 2.43 percent, to 2,640.01. The
yield on the 30-year Treasury bond increased to 6.07 percent from 6
percent on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Securities Dealers board authorized
its staff to step up preparations for converting the NASDAQ stock
market into a publicly traded company.
</P>
<P>
   TRASH Hauler Issues Profit Warning
</P>
<P>
   Waste Management warned for the second time this month that its
second-quarter earnings will be tepid at best. Though the company
announced several steps, including the resignations of Gregory T.
Sangalis, its general counsel, and Earl E. DeFrates, its chief
financial officer, to improve its forecasting ability and shore up
its bottom line, Wall Street was not appeased. Investors sent the
shares down $5.50, to $25.9375, less than half the $60 the stock
peaked at May 4.
</P>
<P>
   REJECTION OF AIRLINE DEAL EXPECTED
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Transportation is expected to reject the
three-year effort by American Airlines and British Airways to win
approval to share revenue and to coordinate schedules and fares.
But the two carriers said they would broaden their cooperation in
other ways.
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN PUNISHES CREDIT SUISSE
</P>
<P>
   Japanese authorities imposed severe sanctions on the Credit
Suisse Group, closing a six-month investigation into the firm's
sale of derivative securities intended to help Japanese banks and
companies hide huge losses.
</P>
<P>
   PROCTER &AMP; GAMBLE TOPS FORECASTS
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble, aided by successful new products and
recovering foreign markets, reported robust quarterly earnings that
beat Wall Street expectations.
</P>
<P>
   MARTHA STEWART TO ISSUE STOCK
</P>
<P>
   Martha Stewart, the doyenne of domestic details, plans to sell
$100 million in stock in her company, Martha Stewart Living
Omnimedia, according to documents filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. Investors will be able to buy stock in a
company dominated by the monthly magazine Martha Stewart Living,
but whose television, merchandising and Internet businesses are
growing robustly.
</P>
<P>
   STRONG EARNINGS FOR AT&AMP;T AND MCI
</P>
<P>
   The nation's two largest long-distance telephone carriers, AT&AMP;T
and MCI Worldcom, posted strong quarterly earnings. MCI met
forecasts and AT&AMP;T was a bit higher.
</P>
<P>
   2 WEEKS GIVEN TO RESOLVE DISPUTE
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission have been given two weeks to resolve a dispute over
whether the firm must produce all the information the federal
government agency has subpoenaed in a sex discrimination case,
people briefed on court proceedings said.

HILLARY CLINTON TALKS TAXES, BUT RESIDENCY ISSUE PERSISTS

<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMIRA, N.Y. _ Hillary Rodham Clinton came to this Republican
patch of upstate New York Thursday intent on embracing what
Democrats see as a major issue in next year's congressional
elections: The Republican drive to put through the largest federal
tax cut since 1982. But she also found herself again discussing the
question of whether someone who does not live in New York could
represent it in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady, on her third week of touring the state since she
officially began exploring a Senate race, sought to frame her
latest ``listening forum'' around the Republican tax bill being
debated in Washington, which President Clinton has said he would
veto.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a debate going on in the Senate about a nearly $1
trillion Republican tax cut that I believe would damage most New
Yorkers,'' Mrs. Clinton said. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who is likely
to seek the Republican nomination for the Senate seat, declined
Thursday to say if he supports the proposal advanced by fellow
Republicans in Washington, though he has said he supports using
some of the federal surplus for a tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Mrs. Clinton sought to turn the topic to Republican
fiscal policy with what were her most partisan remarks since she
began this tour, she twice found herself answering questions from
Elmira residents about her interest in representing a state where
she has never lived.
</P>
<P>
   Both of the residents were cordial, and afterward, both said
they were impressed by her answers. Nonetheless, their questions,
coming after the first lady has spent a fair amount of time in the
state _ and in a week in which Giuliani traveled to Little Rock,
Ark., where Mrs. Clinton used to live, to draw attention to the
issue _ suggest the task that Mrs. Clinton faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you become senator from New York state,'' asked David
Caton, a factory worker at the Hillard Corp. plant here, ``would
you work at getting a bill through that you have to be a resident
for `X' amount of time before you can run for office?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, that would be a state decision,'' Mrs. Clinton responded
instantly. ``That's in the state constitution and it's state law.
So the people of New York would have to make whatever changes they
would make through their state Legislature.''
</P>
<P>
   And as Mrs. Clinton and Caton exchanged smiles and hand shakes,
she then called out with a grin: ``But I like it the way it is.''
</P>
<P>
   The question came up again at the end of the forum, when Jim
Davis, a registered Republican who is an executive with a natural
gas company here, told Mrs. Clinton that he admired her work in
Washington. ``But why did you choose New York, and how are you
going to overcome the carpetbagger question?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very fair question,'' Mrs. Clinton said. She said that
she and her husband had decided to live in New York before anyone
raised the idea of her running for Senate.

THIRTEEN MORE UMPS OUT; ONE-THIRD ARE NOW GONE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ From one of the two newest umpires to two of the
three most senior, the National League slashed 13 umpires from its
staff Thursday, accepting their resignations as the latest
development in the umpires' mass resignation strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Phillips, the umpires' labor leader, immediately
promised more action, vowing to ``fight to the death'' for the
umpires' jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The league did not announce the names of the umpires who will
lose their jobs Sept. 2, the effective date stated in the letters
of resignation they submitted July 15, then rescinded last Tuesday.
But various officials disclosed the names, and Phillips confirmed
10, declining to name the other three because he had not been able
to reach them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're angry,'' Phillips said after speaking with most of the
umpires. ``They feel that baseball's conduct is reprehensible and
oppressive. They feel this action of executing surrendered
prisoners is indicative of the mind-set of baseball today that has
led us to the position we're in.''
</P>
<P>
   Coupled with the American League's acceptance of nine
resignations on Monday, the Major League Umpires Association has
seen one-third of its 66 members lose their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips, emerging from a two-day telephone silence, said he
vowed to each umpire who lost his job that ``I will fight
absolutely to the death,'' he said, adding: ``I will never rest
till I right this wrong. I have plenty of information. They know I
have the files. I have their internal memos, and I will expose the
fraud that exists in baseball today.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips provided a copy of one of those memos to The New York
Times. The memo figures to be a core piece of evidence in the case
the union plans to take to the National Labor Relations Board next
Monday. Phillips has contended that major-league baseball has
violated its labor agreement with the umpires by taking authority
away from the league offices and putting it in the commissioner's
office.
</P>
<P>
   Last January the commissioner's office denied that it had
intended to implement its centralization plan for the umpires for
this season, which is the last covered by the umpires' labor
contract. But in a Dec. 14 memo from the executive vice president
for administration, Robert DuPuy, to the league presidents, Leonard
Coleman and Gene Budig, DuPuy said otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Bud Selig, the commissioner, and Sandy Alderson,
the executive vice president for baseball operations, DuPuy wrote,
``Bud has determined that the umpires should be supervised
essentially by Sandy for the upcoming season, to be effective as
rapidly as can be accomplished.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips cited the memo as evidence that lopping 13 umpires from
the NL staff because the league had hired 13 minor-league umpires
was not a decision made by Coleman. ``These were decisions dictated
to him,'' the lawyer said by telephone from Philadelphia. Coleman
declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   In paring the staff, one baseball official said, the league
considered age, experience, ability and race.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Pulli, No. 2 in seniority, and Terry Tata, No. 3, both
crew chiefs, were the most experienced among the 13. Pulli is in
his 28th year, Tata his 27th. Paul Nauert was one of two umpires
added this season.
</P>
<P>
   Others among the 13, in order of years of service, were Eric
Gregg (23rd year), Joe West (22nd), Bob Davidson (18th), Tom
Hallion (14th), Gary Darling (13th), Bill Hohn (11th), Larry
Poncino (8th), Larry Vanover (seventh), Bruce Dreckman (third) and
Sam Holbrook (second).
</P>
<P>
   Hallion recently incurred a rare penalty for an umpire, a
three-game suspension for making contact with a player, Jeff Reed
of Colorado. Gregg, 48, was noted for his excessive weight and the
time he has missed, including this season, for health reasons. He
is listed as weighing 305 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Under their labor contract, some of the umpires receive
termination pay. For the 13 NL umpires, eight are scheduled to
receive a total of $2.6 million. The four umpires with more than 20
years receive $400,000 each; the five with fewer than 10 years get
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   While Phillips blamed baseball officials for the loss of the
umpires' jobs, officials said it was his bargaining strategy that
forced them into that position. After the umpires initially wanted
to engage in what would have been an illegal strike, they adopted
the resignation strategy at Phillips' suggestion at a meeting July
14.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 umpires signed letters of resignation, and they
were faxed to the league the next day.

CAMERA FAILS IN SPACECRAFT'S BRUSH WITH ASTEROID 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By WARREN E. LEARY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It could have been a great picture, but the camera
was pointing at the wrong place, researchers said Thursday of a
disappointing encounter between an asteroid and a NASA spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
   After spending much of the day examining data from an early
morning encounter between the Deep Space 1 craft and the asteroid
Braille, scientists said it appeared that the spacecraft aimed its
camera at the wrong spot and missed capturing close-up images of
the asteroid.
</P>
<P>
   The spacecraft, which was guiding itself with an automatic
navigation system, encountered targeting problems shortly before
passing within 10 miles of the asteroid, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph R. Basilio, the mission's operations manager at NASA's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., said engineers were
still assessing data from the spacecraft, but were not optimistic
about finding any of the black-and-white images anticipated from
the encounter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to give up,'' Basilio said in a telephone
interview. ``We are going to comb through every bit of data and may
just find some image information, but we are tempering our
expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said there appeared to be good data on the small
asteroid from other instruments, including information on charged
particle activity around the object and infrared data on heat
characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   Deep Space 1 is a barrel-shaped, 1,000-pound craft that was
launched on Oct. 24, 1998. The robot vessel, packed with miniature
instruments and other devices, was designed to troubleshoot 12
innovative technologies that could be used by future spacecraft.
Dr. Marc D. Rayman, chief mission engineer, said the spacecraft had
completed more than 95 percent of its mission and had validated
most of the technologies before the encounter.
</P>
<P>
   Technologies aboard include an autonomous navigation system, an
unusual solar-powered ion engine, an integrated camera and
spectrometer for determining the composition of distant objects, a
combination ion and electron spectrometer for studying charged
particles, and advanced artificial intelligence software that lets
the spacecraft manage its own mission as situations change.

PANEL AWARDS LAW FIRMS $775M FOR TOBACCO SUIT WORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS AND BRIAN MACQUARRIE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Five law firms, including three from Boston, have been
awarded $775 million in legal fees for representing Massachusetts
in its successful $8.3 billion lawsuit against the tobacco
industry, an arbitration panel announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   While providing a huge financial windfall to the lawyers, the
decision by the Tobacco Fee Arbitration Panel gives the firms less
than half of the $2 billion they sought and were originally
promised under a contract with the state.
</P>
<P>
   The fee is believed to the largest ever awarded in Massachusetts
in a civil litigiation case.
</P>
<P>
   Brown Rudnick Freed and Gesmer of Boston, the lead local
attorneys, will get a 23 percent cut of the fee, or about $178
million, according to the agreement among the attorneys. It has not
been disclosed how the balance of the fees will be divided.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Brown Rudnick, which in the past has said it would
consider donating some of the funds to charity, defended its fee.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas M. Sobol, the lead attorney in the case, said the firm's
work was ``the most labor-intensive effort in the history of the
Commonwealth.''.
</P>
<P>
   David D. Sullivan, a partner, agreed: ``Our firm took an
enormous risk accepting this case to take on big tobacco in the
interest of public health and the people of Massachusetts.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Governor Paul Cellucci termed the payment
``excessive.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear whether the firms will try to enforce the $2
billion contract with the attorney general's office, and Brown
Rudnick did not address the issue. Any additional legal fees
awarded to the firms would be taken out of the state's $8.3 billion
share of the 1998 national tobacco settlement.
</P>
<P>
   But the panel's decision may have discouraged any further
attempts by the firms to collect fees from the state. It stipulates
that the $775 million be reduced dollar for dollar, by any fees the
attorneys gained from the state.
</P>
<P>
   The fee will be paid by the tobacco industry over as many as 25
years or more. As part of $206 billion national tobacco settlement
that was negotiated in late 1998 between 46 state attorneys general
and the cigarette makers, the industry will contribute $500 million
a year to pay all states' legal bills.
</P>
<P>
   The panel's chairman, John Calhoun Wells, said he and his two
colleagues, who held hearings on Brown Rudnick's legal fees last
month, said the decision ``represents a considered judgement of the
facts.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells said the arbitration board, which voted 2-1 in favor of
the fee, had fulfilled its charge to determine ``full, reasonable
compensation for these attorneys.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, even the arbiter who concurred with Wells, industry
appointee Charles B. Renfrew, said the fee was more than he would
have awarded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Failure to reach resolution would have created uncertainty and
may have had a serious and potentially adverse impact'' on the
arbitration process, said Renfrew, a former federal judge.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Huge, the dissenting member of the panel, supported a
higher award. The decision, said Huge, who was the Massachusetts
counsel's appointee, is ``arbitrary and capricious'' and not
supported by ``rational and reasonable reasons'' or ``compelling
evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells was chosen by consensus of both sides.
</P>
<P>
   The panel's decision will receive close scrutiny around the
country because Massachusetts was the first state among those
included in the 1998 multi-state settlement to go to arbitration to
set legal fees.
</P>
<P>
   It will likely influence the size of fee awards in several
remaining states, though in many states, the lawsuits did not
involve as much legal work.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci and Attorney General Thomas Reilly both said they would
fight any attempts by the firms to collect additional fees from the
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hope they will be happy with the subtantial fee they are
receiving which I still think is excessive,'' Cellucci said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor, who has been highly critical of the firms' legal
bills, recently filed legislation that would bar the state from
paying the lawyers from the state's settlement money. Many
advocates want the settlement money to be spent mainly on health
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly, who said the firms had provided an ``invaluable
service,'' said he does not expect any claims against the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``This should be the end of it,'' he said. ``Enough is enough.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Brown Rudnick, the state also retained the firms
Schneider Reilly Costello &AMP; Zabin and Thornton Early &AMP; Naumes, both
of Boston; Ness Motley Loadholt Richardson &AMP; Poole, of Charleston,
S.C.; and Leiff Cabraser Heimann &AMP; Bernstein of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   While Cellucci and Reilly have been critical of the lawyers' $2
billion legal bill, the firms received strong support Thursday from
one of the nation's leading anti-smoking lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This seems to be a pretty reasonable compromise,'' said
Richard Daynard, chairman of the Tobacco Products Liability Project
at Northeastern University's School of Law. But he also said he
thought the $2 billion fee the firms had requested was appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't find it absurd to say that if someone has a contract
and somebody performs under the contract and it was negotiated in
good faith they are entitled to the benefits of the contract,''
Daynard said.
</P>
<P>
   Daynard said the firms, particularly the lawyers at Brown
Rudnick, had agreed to take on the litigation when most in the
legal field were convinced the case had no chance of succeeding.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a downtown corporate law firm that took on the case
when most people thought it was all crazy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics, however, noted that the legal team had drawn heavily on
documents and witness testimony from four other states who first
sued the industry.se case had already been litigated.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco industry argued the firms should receive $26.4
million.
</P>
<P>
   But the panel said its award reflects the ``substantial
contributions'' the Massachusetts legal team made to the national
tobacco settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The arbitration panel noted that the team, led by Brown Rudnick,
invested thousands of hours of preparation for a trial scheduled to
begin early this year, and the prospect of a tough battle in the
Massachusetts courts helped prompt the tobacco industry to reach
its national agreement last year.
</P>
<P>
   The panel also cited the legal team's development of a
``sophisticated damage model'' used to determine the size of the
monetary claims against the industry. Arbiters also noted the
lawyers' work in the Liggett I settlement, which the arbiters
described as a ``landmark event in the litigation against the
tobacco industry.''

 &HT;    Gunman ends Atlanta killing spree by turning gun on himself
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _Mark Orrin Barton, authorities say, found the answer to
his problems in killing .
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, when his wife apparently discovered he was having
an affair, they believe he hacked her and her mother to death at an
Alabama campground.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday afternoon, firing pistols in both hands, he slaughtered
nine people and injured 12 more in two Buckhead office buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta police were still getting terrified office workers to
safety when a maintenance man entered an apartment in an
Stockbridge, Ga., and found the battered bodies of a woman and two
children _ apparently Barton's second wife and his children. Police
said they may have been beaten to death two to three days ago.
</P>
<P>
   Five hours later, pursued by police, Barton solved all his
problems by killing himself.
</P>
<P>
   He may not have been able to finish his final rampage; Henry
County police said they found a list in the carnage of his
apartment that indicated he intended to kill at least three more
people.
</P>
<P>
   The only motive authorities could offer for his final murderous
outburst was that he had lost heavily in day stock trading, and the
two offices he attacked on Piedmont Road were places where he
apparently had done some of his trading.
</P>
<P>
   The massive manhunt for the 44-year-old Barton's green Ford
Aerostar van ended shortly after 8 p.m. Thursday when police
spotted the van. They gave chase, and Barton pulled into a BP
station and killed himself with a single shot.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Mark Camp of the Acworth police department said that a
police officer pulled over the van at 7:53 p.m. ``I'm just glad one
of our officers didn't have to shoot him,'' Camp said.
</P>
<P>
   Henry County Police Lt. Roger Stubbs said Thursday night that
officers were trying to determine whether the three or more
additional victims whose names werte found in the apartment were
safe.
</P>
<P>
   Nell Jones, 53, a day trader at All-Tech Investment Group, said
she was working at her computer when five shots rang out in a
meeting room and Barton, described in a company statement as ``a
customer who had not traded in some time, `` emerged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked into his eyes,'' she said, and saw a man who was
``very calm, very determined. No feeling.'' He fired at her from no
further than 10 feet, Jones said. She felt the wind of the bullet
passing her forehead. It struck her terminal and he trurned to
shoot at someone else. She fled.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Bill Campbell, serving as a press spokesman at the scene,
said Barton was quickly identified by workers in the trading
offices who knew him. He was firing with a pistol in each hand, the
mayor said, and from cartridge cases found in the buildings police
said they were 9mm and .45 caliber semiautomatics.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no provocation that prompted this shooting,''
Campbell said grimacing. ``Apparently this man had suffered some
financial losses.'' Day trading, a phenomenon of the personal
computer age, involves individuals linked to the stock market
through the Internet, buying and selling stocks many times in a
day, seeking instant profits with no regard to the long-term
prospects of companies. Experts say it is a quick way to make _ and
lose _ large sums of money.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said Barton walked into the third-floor office of
Momentum Securities at 2:50 and began casually talking to employees
about the drop in the stock market Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   They said Barton seemed calm, but suddenly drew his guns and
started shooting. Four people were killed in that building,
Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta police said Barton then calmly crossed the road and
entered the No. 7 and number 8 buildings of the office complex and
shot and killed 5 more poeple.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Bill Campbell said at least 12 other poeple were injured,
seven from gunfire and the rest with ``bumps and scrapes''
suffering while fleeing from their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had too many tragedies in this city over the last few
days,'' Campbell said, referring to an incident in southwest
Atlanta on July 12 where a man killed 6 people, then shot and
killed himself. Until Thursday's slaughter, that was the worst mass
murder in the city's history.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell asked citizens to pray for the families of the victims
and for the city. ``It is clear that we need something,'' Capbell
said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Barton's wife of 15 years, Debra Spivey Barton, and her
mother were found hacked to death in a camper parked by Lake Weiss
in northeastern Alabama. Authorities said at the time that Barton
was their best suspect but were never able to place him at the
scene.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Spivey of Lithia Springs, Ga., husband and father of those
victims, said Thursday night that ``The man who it appears killed
my wife and daughter, also killed my two grandchildren. It's almost
too much for me to deal with, that my grandchildren too are dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry County police said the found the body of a woman,
presumably Barton's wife, wrapped in a blanket and stuffed in a
bedroom closet of the apartment at the Bristol Green Apartments.
They believe she was killed Tuesday. The two children, were found
under blankets in the bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   There were notes on all three bodies, authorities said, but they
would not divulge what was written. All apparently died of blunt
trauma, they said.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ACCEPTS RESIGNATIONS OF 13 UMPIRES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the latest development in the ongoing labor dispute with
Major League Baseball, the National League Thursday confirmed that
it had accepted the resignations of 13 umpires, bringing to 22 the
number of arbiters who will be replaced Sept. 2.
</P>
<P>
   The NL umps join a list of nine umpires released by the American
League Monday. That means 32 percent (22 of 68) of the umpires
under contract have lost their jobs and will likely be replaced by
25 Triple A umpires.
</P>
<P>
   According to Associated Press, NL veterans Eric Gregg and Joe
West were among those let go.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg, criticized for a wide body and matching strike zone, had
been an NL umpire for 21 years. The same is true of West, famous
for slamming pitcher Dennis Cook to the ground in 1990. Also
departing, according to management sources are Tom Hallion, Terry
Tata, Bob Davidson, and Bill Hohn. Tata is a crew chief. It was not
immediately know how many of those rejected had asked for their
resignations to be rescinded. Forty-two umpires resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Several of those umpires remaining have formed groups, urging
their colleagues to break with union head Richie Phillips and
renounced the strategy advocated by union president Jerry Crawford.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost 22 umpires because of a flawed strategy,'' said AL
umpire Dale Scott.
</P>
<P>
   He was not alone in his opinion.
</P>
<P>
   In a prepared statement, 14 umpires stated that ``Major league
umpires have been seriously harmed because of union leadership that
was doomed to fail from the beginning.'' The group of umpires
included Joe Brinkman, Scott, John Hirschbeck, Dave Phillips, and
Rocky Roe. The statement was also signed by NL umpires Wally Bell,
Mark Hirschbeck and Jeff Nelson, and AL umpires Gary Cederstrom,
Tim Craft, Jim Joyce, Tim McClelland, Durwood Merrill, and Tim
Welke.
</P>
<P>
   Other umpires, however, were angered by the statement.
</P>
<P>
   (That group) started this ball rolling against us _ to pursue
and save their own jobs instead of staying strong in our union,''
said NL umpire Dana DeMuth. ``They are the ones who did not stand
with the majority. We're standing here with our heads in a
guillotine, and the blade is right here.''
</P>
<P>
   On the day the umpires announced their resignations, spirits
among the group were high. Many felt this was a good bargaining
tool to induce Major League Baseball into early labor discussions.
The current contract expires Dec. 31 but by resigning Sept. 2,
those who would be eligible for severance pay, reportedly as much
as $400,00 for some umpires. A no-strike clause made any other
option unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   But Major League Baseball saw an opening and took it. Those
umpires who finish the season can still negotiate, although there
might be someone other than Richie Phillips at the bargaining
table. But with the union broken by resignations and the threat of
replacements, it is likely Major League Baseball will seek a
complete overhaul of the system of hiring and firing umpires.
(Phillips recently signed a five year contract extension.)
</P>
<P>
   It was suggested that umpires would have to agreed to
accountability, like the players. New people mean lower salaries,
possibly two-tier. With baseball growing more international every
year, umpires might find themselves with new partners.
</P>
<P>
   It is no secret that Major League Baseball would like to remove
the hiring, firing, and discliplining of umpires away from the
league presidents and give that power to commissioner Bud Selig or
the vice president of baseball operations, Sandy Alderson.
</P>
<P>
   ``The final say is coming from Alderson,'' DeMuth said. ``And
who is Alderson _ who's never had any umpire capabilities and
doesn't know a thing about my job? How can he say that I must go?
It doesn't make sense. But everything that he's done to this point
doesn't make sense, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips and Crawford retained Cohen, Weiss, and Simon ``to take
appropriate aggressive legal action against major league
baseball.'' Cohen, Weiss and Simon has worked for the Airline
Pilots Association and the Teamsters Union.
</P>
<P>
   The umpires face an uphill battle, no matter what they do. They
sued in federal court in Philadelphia. But their attempt to gain a
restraining order was denied by US District Judge Edmund V. Ludwig.
A hearing on the case will be scheduled after Aug. 12. But the
damage is done.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really very sad,'' said Brinkman, another Phillips foe.
``It's just a damn shame.''

2 AIRLINES' BID FOR ANTITRUST IMMUNITY REPORTEDLY REJECTED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Great Britain)  (mk) 
 By EDWIN McDOWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The three-year effort by American Airlines and British Airways
to win approval to share revenue and coordinated schedules and
fares is expected to be rejected Friday by the U.S. Department of
Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   But both airlines said Thursday that they intend to broaden
their ties and cooperation in ways that do not require government
approval. Nevertheless, their costly, prolonged effort to obtain
immunity from antitrust violations is likely to put them at a
disadvantage with rival aviation alliances.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, American and British Airways will continue to dominate
traffic over the lucrative North Atlantic route, because of their
overwhelming combined presence at London's Heathrow Airport. At
Heathrow, an important connecting point for much of the rest of
Europe as well as the Middle East, Africa and elsewhere, British
Airways controls almost 38 percent of takeoff and landing slots,
while American and United Airlines each have only about 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trade-off for immunity for BA and American has always been
opening Heathrow to other airlines, and that's a big price to pay
for an incremental benefit,'' said Samuel Buttrick, an analyst at
Paine Webber. ``But now they don't have to worry about that
happening any time soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares of AMR fell $1.25 Thursday to $66.1875, while American
depository receipts of British Airways fell $1, to $64.50.
</P>
<P>
   In saying that the airlines' petition for antitrust immunity
would be dismissed Friday, a Department of Transportation source,
who spoke on condition of anonymity, suggested that the reason for
the dismissal was the lack of progress in negotiations between
Washington and London, but that ``the airlines could come back and
refile the petition'' if progress were made in those talks.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's opposition to antitrust immunity for the American
Airlines-British Airways alliance has long been aimed at pressuring
the British government to renegotiate a so-called open skies
agreement. Such agreements, which Washington has negotiated with
many other countries, liberalizes restrictions on routes, fares and
frequencies between both nations, and allows airlines from both
nations to fly anywhere in either country.
</P>
<P>
   As part of open skies, Washington wants greater access at
Heathrow for U.S. carriers, including Continental, Delta and US
Airways, which also want to fly there. The European Commission and
Britain's Office of Fair Trading have both said they will not
approve the alliance until British Airways and American Airlines
surrender 267 slots. While not addressing that issue directly, John
Lampl, the British Airways spokesman in New York, said that the
airline's percentage of slots at Heathrow ``is less than that of
any major carrier at its biggest hub, including American at Dallas,
Delta at Atlanta and Northwest at Detroit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Financial Times of London reported Thursday that American
and British Airways abandoned their plan to set up the alliance
after they were informed that the Department of Transportation was
set to dismiss their application for immunity from antitrust
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, American and British Airways vowed Thursday to
continue their relationship. ``It would be better to develop
activities that don't require antitrust immunity rather than to
accept conditions which would be a dereliction of our duty to
shareholders' interests,'' said Bob Ayling, the chairman of British
Airlines. Those activities could include joint purchases,
reciprocity at airport lounges and enhancing their frequent flier
programs.
</P>
<P>
   While lack of approval would be regrettable, Ayling and Don
Carty, the chairman of American, said in a statement, ``It will not
stop continuing cooperation between the two airlines wherever that
is permitted by regulators, nor will it lessen either company's
commitment to Oneworld.''
</P>
<P>
   Oneworld is the global marketing alliance consisting of American
and British Airways, as well as Canadian Airlines, Cathay Pacific
(Hong Kong), Finnair, Iberia (Spain) and Qantas (Australia).
</P>
<P>
   But without antitrust immunity, American and British Airways
will not be able to share revenue on transatlantic flights, nor
coordinate fares and schedules. By contrast, Oneworld's main rival,
the Star Alliance, acquired antitrust immunity from the Justice
Department as part of the open skies agreement between the United
States and Germany. Star Alliance members are United Airlines,
Lufthansa (Germany), Air Canada, Air New Zealand, Ansett of
Australia, Scandinavian Airlines Systems, Thai Airways and Varig of
Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Other airline alliances also have antitrust immunity. Northwest
Airlines and KLM of the Netherlands, members of the Wings alliance,
have had it since 1992, while the Atlantic Excellence alliance
among Delta, Austrian Airlines, Swissair and Sabena received it in
1996.

MORGAN STANLEY AND U.S. PANEL GIVEN DEADLINE ON CASE DISPUTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission have been given two weeks to resolve a dispute about
whether the Wall Street firm must produce all the information the
federal government agency has subpoenaed in a gender-discrimination
case, people briefed on court proceedings said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The commission took Morgan Stanley to court Wednesday to force
the firm to turn over documents subpoenaed as part of an
investigation of Morgan Stanley's compensation and promotion of
female employees.
</P>
<P>
   The case stems from a complaint filed with the commission last
year by Allison K. Schieffelin, 38, a saleswoman in the firm's
convertible bond division. Ms. Schieffelin contends that she was
denied promotion to managing director because she is a woman.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley declined to turn over some documents and other
information demanded by the commission on the grounds that its
subpoena was too broad. The commission said in court documents that
it seeks information about male and female employees whose tenure
and job duties resemble those of Ms. Schieffelin, and documents
involved in any other cases of sexual harassment or discrimination
at Morgan Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Denise Cote in Manhattan allowed lawyers
working for the agency and Morgan Stanley legal representatives
from the Manhattan law firm Epstein, Becker &AMP; Green to try to
resolve their differences within two weeks. If they fail to do so,
she said, she would decide whether to force Morgan Stanley to turn
over the subpoenaed material, people briefed on the proceedings
said.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Morgan Stanley issued a statement Thursday
reiterating its position that Ms. Schieffelin's charges of
discrimination were without merit. ``We do not tolerate
discrimination of any kind,'' a spokeswoman said.

SISTER OF SUSPECTED SERIAL KILLER RECEIVES $86,000 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Ill., Ky., N.M.) 
 
By ERIC BERGER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The sister of suspected serial killer Angel Maturino
Resendiz has received $86,000 in reward money for her role in
getting him to surrender, the FBI announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Manuela Karkiewicz of Albuquerque, N.M., could receive $40,000
more if Maturino Resendiz is convicted of murder in Texas and
Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in early June, when Texas Ranger Drew Carter began
cultivating a relationship with her, Karkiewicz played a central
role in brokering Maturino Resendiz's July 13 surrender at the
U.S.-Mexico border near El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   Karkiewicz's pastor declined to say Thursday night how she would
use the money, but he suggested that she did not help the
authorities because of the reward.
</P>
<P>
   ``She didn't want the money, that's all I can tell you,'' said
Troy Robinson of Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   Since the suspect's surrender, authorities have also insisted
that Maturino Resendiz had not conditioned his surrender on his
family members receiving the reward money.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, several agencies that worked on the task force
assigned to the case said they had no qualms about family members
receiving the reward.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law enforcement authorities are very comfortable with the
decision here and where the money went to,'' said Don K. Clark,
special agent in charge of the Houston FBI office.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no disagreements or even arguments in terms of who
should get this money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Kloesel, president of M-G Inc., a Weimar, Texas, feed store
and implement dealership that raised $5,000 of the reward money,
said, ``It's not an ideal situation, but I guess if she did help
get him to turn himself in, then she deserves the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Maturino Resendiz is being held in Harris County jail, charged
with the capital murder of Houston-area physician Claudia Benton
last December. The trial in that case, which could result in a
death penalty, is expected to begin early next year.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Maturino Resendiz is suspected of six slayings in Texas,
two in Illinois and one in Kentucky. He has been formally charged
in five of them.
</P>
<P>
   Of the $40,000 yet to be disbursed, $15,000 is from private
sources in Weimar, where Maturino Resendiz is suspected of killing
the Rev. Norman ``Skip'' Sirnic and his wife, Karen, last May, and
$25,000 is from Lexington, Ky., where Christopher Maier was beaten
to death in August, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in both areas said Thursday that the reward is
conditioned on a conviction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel probably that our wording is specific to the
Christopher Maier homicide,'' said Assistant Lexington Police Chief
Fran D. Root.
</P>
<P>
   The reward money Karkiewicz received this week includes $50,000
from the FBI for helping to apprehend a Top 10 Fugitive, $20,000
from Weimar, $11,000 from the U.S. Marshals Service, and $5,000
from the West University Place Police Department. West University
is an affluent enclave of Houston.

WHITE SOX SEND YANKEES TO BOSTON ON A LOSING NOTE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The visiting dugout in Comiskey Park is floored with
wood, and underneath it water has collected and rot has set in,
creating a stench that prompted New York Yankees manager Joe Torre
to recall the day he uncovered a dead cat.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees will not have to suffer any more games in the
powerful dugout this year, and that is about the only good thing
they could say as they left this town after losing the final two
games in a three-game series with the White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Konerko slammed two home runs and the White Sox whipped the
Yankees Thursday, 5-1, to beat David Cone (10-5) in the Yankees'
100th game of the 162-game season.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Knoblauch, the Yankees' leadoff hitter and second baseman,
missed his second consecutive game with a viral infection, and
Torre said Knoblauch might miss another game or two in the coming
series against the Red Sox at Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Ledee, the Yankees' left fielder, is still bothered by a
strained groin muscle and may not be available this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando Hernandez, who said the triceps in his throwing arm was
spent during his last start, threw in the bullpen without any
trouble Thursday, and the expectation is that he will be able to
make his next scheduled start Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Cone allowed four runs in seven innings Thursday, and in his own
estimation he failed to do what he usually does so effectively:
pitch out of jams. Opposing batters were only 18-for-111 (.162)
with runners in scoring position against Cone before the game. On
Thursday, the White Sox were 3-for-9.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees and the White Sox, playing in temperatures nearing
100 degrees, were tied at 1-1 in the sixth inning when Cone fell
behind Konerko with two balls and no strikes. Cone challenged
Konerko with a fastball, but as catcher Joe Girardi remembered, the
pitch drifted over the middle of the plate, and Konerko crushed it
for a home run as Cone gestured in disgust with his right hand.
</P>
<P>
   There would be more in the inning. Cone walked left fielder
Brian Simmons, and Simmons stole second. Cone thought he threw Greg
Norton, the next batter, a good pitch _ a splitter low and away _
but Norton slapped the ball through the middle.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox who led 3-1, added a run in the seventh and
another in the eighth, and the Yankees ate quickly, dressed and
boarded the bus to the airport. The Yankees, 61-39 and in first
place in the American League East, were thoroughly outplayed in the
final two games of the series, in the outfield in particular.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox, Torre noted, are ranked last in the league in
defense, but all week their outfielders were running down one ball
after another.
</P>
<P>
   Center fielder Chris Singleton once leaped high and extended his
glove over the wall to take a home run away from Paul O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
   ``They played a very solid series,'' Torre said. ``They deserved
to win.''

GLAXO SAYS IT WILL NOT MEET ITS SALES AND PROFIT TARGETS FOR THE
YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DAVID J. MORROW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wounded by dismal sales growth in the United States, Glaxo
Wellcome PLC, the world's third-largest pharmaceutical company,
announced Thursday that it would not meet its sales and earnings
projections for this year.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure pushed Glaxo's shares lower on two continents. On
the London Stock Exchange, its shares dropped 199 pence, or 11.4
percent, to 1,553 pence. The company's American depository receipts
tumbled $4.125, or 7.5 percent, to $51.1875.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Thursday that Glaxo's latest woes raised troubling
questions about its future. Many questioned whether the giant drug
maker would be forced to merge to improve its market position,
especially in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Glaxo Wellcome said Thursday that there was no
reason for the company to merge because of its current performance.
</P>
<P>
   Others wondered about the tenure of Glaxo's chairman, Richard
Sykes, who had reassured analysts earlier this year that Glaxo
would attain a 10 percent gain in sales and earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Throughout this year, Glaxo has said they were committed to
double-digit growth,'' said Jonas Morner, a pharmaceuticals analyst
with Deutsche Bank Securities in London. ``Certainly, this is going
to cause some lost credibility with the company's management.
Investors will no longer feel the stock is a safe bet.''
</P>
<P>
   Glaxo, which does not release quarterly results, said its
earnings for the first half of the year rose 9.6 percent, to 932
million pounds, or 25.7 pence a share, compared with 850 million
pounds, or 23.7 pence a share, in the period a year earlier. The
company said it had sales of 4.1 billion pounds, an increase of 4
percent at a constant exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
   The results exceeded many analysts' expectations but still
lagged behind the industry average of a 15 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts were concerned Thursday about the cause of Glaxo's
setback. Glaxo's drug sales in the United States only rose 2
percent at a constant exchange rate during the first half of this
year, a paltry tally given that Johnson &AMP; Johnson's sales increased
37.3 percent in the second quarter alone.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the problem, the U.S. market accounted for 41
percent of Glaxo's worldwide sales in the first half. Any decline
in the U.S. market is bound to take a huge toll.
</P>
<P>
   Glaxo attributed its poor performance in the United States to
lagging sales of Imitrex, its migraine treatment, and Zyban, its
pill for smoking cessation. Imitrex sales in the United States
dropped 13 percent, to 217 million pounds, while Zyban's sales
plunged 44 percent, to 29 million pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The migraine and smoking-cessation drugs are two important
products,'' said Neil Sweig, an analyst with Southeast Research
Partners. ``When you start to go negative on your important
products, the new products that come on line can't make up that
difference so fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Glaxo said Thursday that it was facing a challenge replacing
consumers who had recently completed treatment with Zyban. The
company attributed Imitrex's woes to heavy competition from other
migraine drugs, including Maxalt from Merck &AMP; Co. and
Astra-Zeneca's Zomig.
</P>
<P>
   Yet analysts pointed out other problems with Imitrex and Zyban.
Most of the smoking-cessation drugs are used by smokers to passify
their habits in places where they cannot smoke, notably airplanes
and meetings. Since Zyban did not contain nicotine, it did not get
any of these sales.
</P>
<P>
   Imitrex and the other migraine drugs have become textbook
lessons in marketing mistakes. Analysts insist that Glaxo and other
manufacturers released too many drug samples, especially for an
illness that is largely episodic. Patients who only suffer a few
migraines a year sometimes left their doctor's office with what
amounted to a year's supply of drugs, which resulted in a year's
worth of lost sales.
</P>
<P>
   Glaxo remained confident that its five new drugs could lift
sales. The company has Seretide, an asthma drug marketed in nine
European countries; Zeffix, for hepatitis B; Ziagen and Agenerase
for AIDS, and Relenza, a nasal spray that was recently approved by
the Food and Drug Administration for flu.
</P>
<P>
   ``Glaxo's flu drug will have competition from Roche,'' Deutsche
Bank's Morner said. ``Glaxo doesn't have to merge, but it's likely
they will. If SmithKline Beecham is interested, the roles will be
reversed this time around. SmithKline is the stronger partner
now.''

   The Edison Project, the ambitious nationwide network of
for-profit public schools, announced Thursday that it was raising
both enrollment and cash.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which has expanded steadily since opening its first
schools in 1995 but has yet to make a profit, said it had received
a fresh infusion of $71 million from private investors. It is
expected to begin offering stock to the public next year.
</P>
<P>
   And it announced plans to open 26 new schools in the fall, for a
total of 77, and to increase its total enrollment to 37,000, up
from 24,000 in the 1998-99 school year.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest new investor, at $30 million, is Paul G. Allen, a
co-founder of Microsoft Corp. who has a reputation for backing
audacious ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Edison's deal with Allen includes an alliance with one of his
privately financed ventures, Apex Online Learning Inc., which last
spring began offering online advanced-placement courses to high
schools and online refresher instruction to individual students.

 &HT;    Shooter didn't have the look of a killer
 &HT;    By Alan Judd
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Mark Orrin Barton walked into a stock brokerage
Thursday afternoon, he wore the same genial countenance that he
displayed even in his driver's license photos: a warm smile across
a round face, topped by a shock of dark curly hair _ hardly the
look of a killer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He greeted people on the way in,'' Harvey Hautkin, a spokesman
for All -Tech Investment Services, said later. And as he began
blasting away with two handguns, Hautkin said, Barton told his
victims, ``I hope I'm not upsetting your trading day.''
</P>
<P>
   Such incongruity clouded the portrait that emerged late Thursday
of the 44-year-old Barton, one of Georgia's worst mass murderers, a
man who drove a green minivan.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said Barton, whose last known address was an
apartment in Stockbridge, Ga., killed nine people and wounded 12
others during an afternoon rampage at three normally quiet office
buildings on Atlanta's north side. Police were also at the scene of
Barton's Henry County home, where the bodies of a woman and two
children were found after the Atlanta shootings _ apparently those
of his wife and his son and daughter from a previous marriage.
</P>
<P>
   It all ended about when Barton shot himself to death outside a
suburban gas station.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no information at all'' on what set off the killing
spree, Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell said late Thursday, ``except
we're certain Mr. Barton came to (the office complex) and killed
nine people.''
</P>
<P>
   Interviews, public records and police accounts indicated that
until Thursday's rampage, Barton lived a mostly unremarkable life
with one glaring exception - Labor Day Weekend 1993, when his first
wife and her mother were hacked to death at a campground on an
Alabama lake.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately, Barton's former father-in-law accused him of the
crime. That same accuser said Thursday the killings in Henry County
and Atlanta completed what Barton had started almost six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``If what I've heard is true, the man has destroyed nearly my
whole family,'' said Bill Spivey of Lithia Springs, Ga., whose
wife, Eloise, then 59, and his 36-year-old daughter Debra were
killed at northeast Alabama's Lake Weiss. ``The man who it appears
killed my wife and daughter also killed my two grandchildren.''
</P>
<P>
   No charges were ever filed in the 1993 killings, but Alabama
authorities said Thursday he had been under suspicion for almost
six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the No. 1 suspect all the way through and still was,''
said Richard Igou, district attorney in Cedar Bluff, Ala., at the
time of the killings.
</P>
<P>
   The current district attorney, Mike O'Dell, said investigators
had monitored Barton's whereabouts for almost six years. ``There
was no precursors to think this might happen,'' O'Dell said. ``It
was a shock.''
</P>
<P>
   After the 1993 killings, a judge in Douglas County, Ga., where
Barton lived at the time, ordered him to undergo a psychological
evaluation in a custody case involving his two young children.
</P>
<P>
   The results ``to this day make me shudder,'' said David McDade,
the Douglas County district attorney, who has reviewed the case.
``They indicated to us that he was certainly capable'' of
committing the murders.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief interview with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in
1994, Barton _ who won custody of the children, Matthew and Shelly
_ declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, Michael Hauptman, told a local Atlanta TV news
reporter on Thursday that Barton recently won a $600,000 settlement
from an insurance company that had refused to pay his wife's
life-insurance policy.
</P>
<P>
   Hauptman described Barton as ``very, very quiet'' and ``very
gentle,'' a man who ``cared about his children, cared, quite
frankly, about his wife's murder and his mother-in-law.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from his first wife's death, though, nothing in Barton's
background seems to point toward the extreme violence that
characterized his final hours.
</P>
<P>
   Barton was born in Sumter, S.C., in 1955. Answering the
telephone Thursday night in the house where Barton grew up, his
79-year-old mother, Gladys Barton, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not talking to reporters _ none,'' she said. ``I'm not
giving any information.''

COLUMN: A STEREOTYPE HOLLYWOOD CAN'T REFUSE 
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK _ What do you think would happen if a white director
went to Harlem and shot a film portraying blacks almost exclusively
as gangsters, dopers and sex-obsessed stupes? How long would it
take before Al Sharpton or Kweisi Mfume put protesters outside
movie theaters? One minute or two?
</P>
<P>
   Yet show Italian-Americans in that kind of harsh and unfair
light _ as the black director Spike Lee does relentlessly in his
new film, ``Summer of Sam'' _ and all you hear is some low-level
grumbling.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that is how it should be. More finger-pointing from the
sensitivity police is the last thing the world needs. Still, Lee
felt obliged earlier this month to deny any racist intent, and he
trotted out his Italian-American co-writers as supporting evidence.
One authority on Italian-American culture, Robert Viscusi, a writer
and an English professor at Brooklyn College, said that if
anything, there is ``the sense of Italian wannabe about Spike Lee's
work.''
</P>
<P>
   But the issue goes beyond one director and the gremlins that may
or may not stalk him. The fact is this:
</P>
<P>
   Among major ethnic groups that have formed the country's social
bedrock for at least a century, Americans of Italian origin may be
the last to see themselves reflected in mass culture, time and
again, as nothing but a collection of losers and thugs. You would
be hard-pressed to tell from films and television shows that they
have also been corporate leaders, governors and mayors, not to
mention shopkeepers and working stiffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The antisocial male is too often played by Italian-Americans
even if they are not depicted as gangsters,'' Gay Talese said.
</P>
<P>
   In this age of correctness, other groups have managed to banish
the worst stereotypes about them. How often these days do you see
shuffling blacks, grasping Jews or drunken Irishmen on the screen?
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't,'' said Michael Meyers, executive director of the
New York Civil Rights Coalition. ``Not without a picket line going
up, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   But with rare exceptions _ the 1987 film ``Moonstruck'' comes to
mind _ Italian-Americans continue to be shown only as Mafiosi and
foul-talking louts obsessed with cheating on their wives and
shoving controlled substances up their noses. You would think they
were all Gottis and Buttafuocos, judging from films like ``Donnie
Brasco'' and ``Married to the Mob,'' to name but two, or from
popular television series like ``The Sopranos.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that you can't find Italians like the ones you see in
these movies,'' former Gov. Mario Cuomo said. ``It's the
disproportionality.'' A result of the one-sided portrayals, Cuomo
said, is that ``if you have a large assembly of vowels in your
name, the first thing some people wonder is if there's a criminal
connection.''
</P>
<P>
   For consistent portraits of Italian-Americans as inarticulate
lowlifes and punks, Woody Allen is hard to beat. ``The mothers in
his movies make Olivia Soprano look like Joan of Arc,'' said one
Italian-American screenwriter. But some of the most successful
purveyors of old stereotypes are Italian-Americans themselves.
Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese, Robert De Niro, Al Pacino _
all built careers on the mob.
</P>
<P>
   And the phenomenon continues. ``The mystique of the Mafia exists
even when the Mafia doesn't,'' said Anthony Mancini, a novelist and
journalist. ``It's just too good a myth to abandon.''
</P>
<P>
   Viscusi is convinced that the negative images have flourished in
part because Italian-Americans tend to shy from collective action.
They do not have the many advocacy groups that, say, Jews and
blacks have at their call. Also, Italians are generally seen as not
having suffered nearly as much as other immigrants to America.
``We've had suffering,'' Viscusi said. ``But nobody buys it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Talese said, there is no way to force Hollywood to
ditch the stereotypes. ``You can't do it without taking away
freedom,'' he said. ``That includes the freedom of choice to play
gangsters.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, is a fuller representation of Italian-American life
unthinkable? ``There would be fewer objections if there were a
higher percentage of stories that depicted the Italian-American in
a more positive way, which is a more honest way, a more realistic
way,'' Cuomo said.
</P>
<P>
   They don't have to come across as civil-rights training films.
All it takes are characters who do more than walk around going
``badda-bing, badda-bang'' the whole day.

LARSSON SIDELINED BY TENDINITIS

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Anthony Dupuis toiled for seven years without
reaching the quarterfinals of an ATP Tour tournament. His moment
finally arrived Thursday, but it didn't even require him to step
onto the court.
</P>
<P>
   Dupuis was awarded a walkover victory when Magnus Larsson
withdrew from the Mercedes-Benz Cup before their scheduled
second-round match. Larsson, a 29-year-old qualifier from Sweden
who played three matches in two days to reach the second round, was
diagnosed with tendinitis in both forearms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate since I was hitting the ball well,'' said
Larsson, who lost only three games in a first-round victory Monday
over Paradorn Srichaphan of Thailand. ``I've had this problem since
Monday and it was getting more and more painful.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Thursday morning) when I practiced I had no energy in my arms
and no power in my muscles.''
</P>
<P>
   Tournament physicians examined Larsson and determined he could
not play. He will undergo an MRI today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bad for him, but I'm lucky,'' Dupuis said. ``It's the
first time something like this has happened to me. I'll do my best
and try to reach the semifinals.''
</P>
<P>
   Dupuis has played sparingly on the ATP Tour, although he reached
the second round of the Mercedes-Benz Cup in 1996. The 26-year-old
Frenchman has reached the finals twice in Challenger events this
year.
</P>
<P>
   __ Aussiefest: Dupuis will face Andrew Ilie, whose victory over
Goran Ivanisevic made him the third Australian to reach the
Mercedes quarterfinals, joining Lleyton Hewitt and qualifier James
Sekulov.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a bit of team spirit at the moment, especially after
the Davis Cup,'' Ilie said. ``Lleyton is doing some great things
and James is on a real hot streak, so we are all playing some
high-quality tennis.''
</P>
<P>
   Ranked No. 473 in the world at the start of 1998, Ilie overcame
a back injury and rose to No. 61, and has impressed opponents with
his sharp backhand and strong baseline play. Earlier in the week,
Ivanisevic said he would ``pay to see'' Ilie play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very flattering for Goran to say that,'' Ilie said. ``But
a lot of people are starting to ask, `Why don't you play better?'
I've been reaching the second round of tournaments, but then I
usually get excited and get a rush, and then I burn out too early.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played well in the French Open, but by the fifth set of the
third round, I was already out of gas. Right now I'm just trying to
get out of the first couple rounds.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Danger ahead? Second-seeded Pete Sampras looked strong in his
first two matches at the Mercedes, beating Phillip King and
Sebastien Lareau in two-setters, but in today's quarterfinals he
faces a familiar and tough opponent in Wayne Ferreira.
</P>
<P>
   Ferreira has beaten Sampras in their past four meetings, most
recently in a 1998 hardcourt tournament in Basel, Switzerland.
Ferreira has won five of their nine meetings, including three of
five on the hardcourt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know all that until somebody told me,'' Sampras said.
``Wayne is always a tough player, especially when he gets some
confidence going.''

   ATLANTA _ A securities day trader killed nine people Thursday
afternoon in two office buildings in the city's glitzy Buckhead
district, eluded an extensive police manhunt for five hours, then
killed himself in his van after the police pulled him over in
nearby Cobb County. Another 12 people were injured in the incident,
seven of them from gunshot wounds.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, Mark O. Barton, 44, also is suspected in the recent
killings of his wife and two children in an apartment in suburban
Stockbridge, about 15 miles southeast of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Two weapons were found near the suspect's body and a
computer-generated letter and three notes were found near the
bodies of his family, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The Stockbridge killings took place before the Buckhead
shootings, but it was unclear exactly when, said Atlanta Mayor Bill
Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   Barton, a chemist who traded in his lab coat for the high-risk
life of an independent stock trader, also was a suspect in the 1993
bludgeoning deaths of his former wife and her mother in Cedar
Bluff, Ala., the authorities said. He was never charged in those
killings.
</P>
<P>
   No motive was known for the killings, the deadliest shooting
rampage in the city's history, but investigators speculated that
recent trading losses contributed to Barton's ire.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened today is a tragedy of massive proportions,''
Campbell said Thursday afternoon, his face locked in a
sweat-dampened grimace. ``We are praying for the families and
praying for our city.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's incident was the third shooting rampage in the
Atlanta area in less than three months. On May 20, a 15-year-old
student at Heritage High School in nearby Conyers took a gun to
school and shot six other students, none of them fatally, before
being captured by school administrators. On July 12, an Atlanta man
killed six members of a family and himself in an apparent domestic
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The shootings in the Buckhead business and entertainment
district Thursday began around 2:50 p.m., when Barton, dressed in
shorts and a shirt, walked into the All-Tech Investment Group
office at Two Securities Center and, without warning or
provocation, began to fire with two weapons, Campbell said. Barton
had traded at the office in the past but not recently, the company
said in a statement released from its headquarters in Montvale,
N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Barton ``came into our office and after speaking to the branch
manager, suddenly stood up and for no apparent reason opened fire
on the branch manager and his secretary,'' said the statement from
All-Tech. ``This man then went into our main trading room and began
indiscriminately shooting at our customers. The man then ran out of
our office and continued shooting in another part of the office
building.'' Four people were killed in that building.
</P>
<P>
   Barton then crossed bustling Piedmont Road and walked into
another brokerage firm, Momentum Securities, in Building 8 of
Piedmont Center, a sprawling office campus. He opened fire there as
well, killing five people.
</P>
<P>
   For confused hours after the shootings, the police seemed to
have few clues to Barton's whereabouts or his method of escape.
Aided by SWAT teams, dogs and helicopters, they conducted a
suite-by-suite search of the buildings where the shootings had
occurred and the leafy grounds surrounding the office parks, to no
avail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no idea where Barton is,'' Campbell told reporters
late Thursday afternoon. ``We do not know whether he has fled the
scene on foot or by car.''
</P>
<P>
   About 8:20 p.m., Campbell returned to a bank of microphones near
the scene of the shootings and announced that Barton's green
Aerostar van had been pulled over by the police at a service
station in Cobb County, northwest of here, and had committed
suicide in the van.
</P>
<P>
   ``This brings a very tragic day to an end,'' Campbell said. ``I
don't know if any of us can understand why something like this
occurs. All we can do is comfort the families and pray for our
city.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Because the killings of Barton's family members, including a
12-year-old son and an 7-year-old daughter, took place before the
Buckhead shootings, Campbell warned that it was dangerous to assume
that Thursday's market fluctuations had triggered the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly this is a deranged individual and has nothing to do
with what occurred today,'' he said. But the mayor did say that the
police had learned that Barton's investments had ``substantial
swings, losses and gains'' and that Barton ``seemed to indicate
some concern about losses.''
</P>
<P>
   Workers in the office buildings described blood-splattered
walls, lifeless bodies and nervous police officers shortly after
the shootings. Many were locked in their offices for hours as
heavily armed officers swept through the buildings, their weapons
drawn as they looked for Barton.
</P>
<P>
   Dari A. Payrow, 23, a worker at Allegiance Telecom, which has
offices on the third floor of 2 Securities Center, said he was
returning to his office from a bathroom when he found a trickle of
blood in the hall. He glanced through the glass windows of the
building's leasing office, which is adjacent to his own, and saw
puddles of blood on the floor next to the receptionist's desk.
``There was a guy on the floor and nobody was helping him so I
assume he was dead,'' Payrow said. The man, he said, was face down
with a bullet wound in his side.
</P>
<P>
   Payrow and other terrified workers huddled in their offices
waiting to be evacuated by the police. ``They all had their guns
drawn, bullet-proof vests, guarding corners, near the elevators,
running around our office,'' he said. ``They told all the males in
our office to come out with our hands up and out of our pockets.''
</P>
<P>
   Periodically, the police escorted officer workers out of the
building and led them down Piedmont Road. Many jogged to safety,
then bided their time in a nearby Mexican restaurant, calming their
nerves with margaritas and bottled beer while using cellular
telephones to notify family members and friends of their safety.
</P>
<P>
   Melinda L. Truan, a 49-year-old psychotherapist, sat outside the
restaurant sipping a soft drink while speaking on her cell phone to
her boyfriend, Bill J. Post, an interior designer who was locked
inside one of the Piedmont Center buildings. ``We've seen a lot of
police activity,'' Post said as Ms. Truan handed the phone to a
reporter. ``We just saw 15 or 20 police and some SWAT members go
into Building 8.''
</P>
<P>
   In the apartment in Stockbridge, meanwhile, police said they
found the bodies of a 7-year-old girl and a 12-year-old boy in
their beds, covered except for a small part of their faces. Notes
had been placed atop each body. Henry County Police Chief Jimmy
Mercer said that Barton's wife was found in a bedroom closet, also
covered, with a note on top of the cover. Another letter,
apparently written by Barton on a computer, was found in the living
room.
</P>
<P>
   Mercer said that the police believed that Barton's wife was
killed on Tuesday and his children on Wednesday. He said the notes
suggested that the victims died as a result of ``blunt force
trauma.'' He also said the notes mentioned the 1993 killings in
Alabama, but not in the form of a confession.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost written in a denial phase,'' he said. He did not
say whether the notes specifically warned of Thursday's shootings,
but said, ``There may be reason to believe that this mayhem would
not stop at this particular point.''

SUSPECT IN ATLANTA KILLINGS WAS LINKED TO PREVIOUS VIOLENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (With GA-SHOOT and related stories.)

<P>
   Before he burst into the national news as a frustrated day stock
trader turned suspected killer Thursday, Mark O. Barton had already
been at the center of an extraordinarily violent story.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, his wife and mother-in-law were found beaten to death
inside a camper at a campground in northeast Alabama. On Thursday,
the authorities said that although Barton, 44, was never charged,
he was a suspect in the killings.
</P>
<P>
   Barton, a Scout master and chemist, seemed to have led an
ordinary life for the past few years in the Atlanta suburb of
Morrow. But neighbors did notice that he seemed intent on keeping
to himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was preoccupied,'' said Cindy Northcutt, a neighbor on
Sinclair Place in Morrow, a solidly middle-class suburb about a
20-minute drive from downtown Atlanta. ``He was always short and
brief.''
</P>
<P>
   He seemed stand-offish, said neighbors along the street where
Barton and his two children by his first marriage lived with a
woman who the authorities said was his second wife, Leanne. But
until the shooting Thursday, several neighbors said they thought he
was simply busy with some sort of computer work.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always on the computer. Always on the phone,'' said
Mrs. Northcutt, a neighbor two houses down.
</P>
<P>
   But Martha Jean DeFreese, whose grandson was a friend of one of
Barton's children, said she had recently noticed something when
Barton came to drive the boys to a Scout meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked a little odd to me,'' she said. ``I said to myself,
`There is something wrong with this man.'''
</P>
<P>
   Barton ran a chemical consulting business out of his home and
had moved out on the Fourth of July weekend, apparently to join his
wife after a separation, in an apartment in nearby Stockbridge,
where the bodies believed to be those of his wife and children were
found Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The new residents of the house at 6475 Sinclair Place said that,
aside from a lot of computers and three or four phone lines, the
scene the Barton family left behind was as ordinary as could be.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was your average middle-income business person,'' said Gail
Walker, the woman whose family took over the $850-a-month rental
after the Bartons left.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors said that Barton usually wore slacks and dress shirts
and that there was little that distinguished him except for his
being well over 6 feet tall and thin.
</P>
<P>
   A few neighbors said they were not even sure if he and the woman
he lived with were married.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been told she left because he couldn't decide what they
were going to do, whether he was going to settle down and get
married,'' said Lucius Johnson, who lived two doors away.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Earls, who runs a day care center in her home three
doors down from Barton, said the Barton children, Michelle, 8, and
Matthew, 12, seemed typical.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the 1993 killings, Barton's first wife, Deborah
Spivey Barton, 36, and her mother, Eloise Powell Spivey, 59, had
been spending Labor Day weekend without Barton. They were found
inside the camper, which showed no signs of forced entry. While
some jewelry was missing, other jewelry and cash had been left
untouched.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview that appeared several months later in The
Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Bill Spivey, Barton's former
father-in-law, said that Barton had been the perfect son-in-law
until the murders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since then,'' Spivey added, ``we have cooled tremendously
toward each other.''

SUDAN, ANGRY AT U.S. ATTACK, FREED BOMB SUSPECTS, OFFICIALS SAY 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Immediately after the bombings of two American
embassies in East Africa last Aug. 7, Sudan detained two men
suspected of being involved in the plot, but angrily released them
two weeks later, after an American cruise missile strike on Sudan,
American officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Sudanese officials have said the United States had been notified
that the two suspects were in custody, and American law enforcement
officials have confirmed the account.
</P>
<P>
   American officials confirmed Thursday that key White House and
State Department officials dealing with counterterrorism and
African issues have over the past year been adamantly opposed to
reopening relations with Sudan, and that this reticence prompted
them last August to discount the Sudanese offer of assistance in
the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Sudanese officials complain that Washington
disregarded their message that possible suspects had been detained.
</P>
<P>
   American officials have been reluctant over the last few months
to discuss the incident, but several have now confirmed that the
Sudanese did notify the United States that they were holding the
men immediately after the embassy bombings.
</P>
<P>
   Sudanese officials said the two men were arrested after they
arrived in Khartoum from Nairobi, Kenya, soon after the bombing of
the American Embassy there. They were detained after they were
discovered to be carrying false Pakistani passports, a senior
Sudanese official said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, saying it had obtained evidence that Osama
bin Laden was behind the bombings, responded on Aug. 20, 1998, by
attacking a terrorist training camp in Afghanistan where he was
believed to be attending a meeting, as well as the al-Shifa
pharmaceutical plant in Khartoum that the United States suspected
was involved in Bin Laden's efforts to produce the deadly nerve gas
VX.
</P>
<P>
   After the cruise missile strike against al-Shifa, angry Sudanese
officials released the two men, and sent them to Pakistan,
officials said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Nearly a year later, the decision to launch a strike against a
pharmaceutical plant in Sudan remains the most controversial aspect
of the Clinton administration's response to the embassy bombings.
Some of the administration's initial statements about the nature of
the links between the al-Shifa plant and Bin Laden's terrorist
network proved incomplete or false.
</P>
<P>
   American intelligence officials eventually acknowledged that
their strongest link between the plant and VX production was a soil
sample taken near the plant that contained evidence of a chemical
``precursor'' used in producing VX.
</P>
<P>
   But officials admitted that they could not say whether VX was
produced at the al-Shifa plant or was merely stored or transported
through the facility.
</P>
<P>
   They also conceded that they had outdated information on the
ownership of the plant, and at the time of the strike did not know
that it had been sold to a Saudi businessman. Some CIA and State
Department officials had privately questioned the decision to
strike, arguing that the evidence was insufficient to prove a link
either to nerve gas or to Bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   As questions about the evidence mounted, the United States was
forced in May to unfreeze assets of al-Shifa's owner, Salih Idris.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration continues to defend its decision to
strike al-Shifa, arguing that the evidence of links to Bin Laden
and nerve gas were compelling.

PHAIDON GIZIKIS, OFFICER IN '73 GREEK JUNTA, DIES AT 82  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC PACE  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Phaidon Gizikis, a Greek general who as president of Greece
played a key role in paving the way for the return of democracy
after seven years of dictatorial rule, died on Monday at the Nimits
military hospital in Athens. He was 82 and a longtime resident of
Athens, Greece.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was not immediately disclosed, but Greek news media
said his hospital stay was brief.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gen. Gizikis was appointed president in late 1973, after an
army coup, in which he had been a conspirator, overthrew President
George Papadopoulos, a former army colonel. Gizikis promoted
himself to full general. The plan was for him to be only a
figurehead. The real ruler of Greece was Brig. Gen. Dimitrios
Ionnidis. But key military leaders turned against the brigadier,
and Gizikis came to play his important part in the dictatorship's
end.
</P>
<P>
   Papadopoulos had presided over a military dictatorship that had
ruled Greece since 1967. In that year he had led an earlier
military coup that ousted an unsteady parliamentary government.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1974, Greek officials said pressure built up
within the military to go back to its barracks when it became
obvious that the government of Prime Minister Adamandios
Androutsopoulos, a political nonentity who was appointed after the
1973 coup, could not respond effectively to growing economic
problems and to a crisis that had arisen over Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
   Cabinet ministers in the civilian government that supplanted the
military in July 1974 said the prospect of war with Turkey over
Cyprus had convinced members of the junta that it was futile to
carry on any longer. It was said that Gizikis had realized that
without a strong government, Greece would not be able to negotiate
effectively about Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke by telephone with former Prime Minister Constantine
Caramanlis, a civilian conservative who was in self-imposed exile
in Paris, and asked him to return to Greece. Caramanlis hesitated.
The president pledged to him that the civilians would acquire full
control. Other junta members joined the president in the promise.
</P>
<P>
   Caramanlis returned, was sworn in as prime minister on July 24,
1974, and formed a new, center-right government. Several of its
members had been deported or jailed by the military rulers.
</P>
<P>
   By early August 1974, the relaxation of political life in Greece
was already apparent. Political prisoners had been released, other
exiles had returned. The far left, including adherents of Communist
Party factions, was making its voice heard. The music of Mikis
Theodorakis, the left-wing composer whom the military had expelled,
was heard again in nightclubs and on the radio.
</P>
<P>
   After a new democratic coalition was put in place, Gizikis
stepped down as president in December 1974 and was succeeded by
Michael Stassinopoulos. Later he retired from the army. In 1976 a
military judicial council dropped proceedings against him and 88
other former officers charged with treason and mutiny for
collaborating with the former junta.
</P>
<P>
   Gizikis was born in western Greece, north of Athens, but reports
differ as to his birthplace. He graduated from the Greek military
academy in Athens in 1939.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, two daughters and a son.

MORE BAD NEWS FROM WASTE MANAGEMENT LEAVES INVESTORS PEEVED 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the second time this month, Waste Management Inc. has warned
investors that its second-quarter earnings will be tepid at best.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston-based trash hauler said on July 6 that its earnings,
which analysts had estimated at 78 cents a share, would not top 70
cents. Thursday it indicated that the earnings, which it is
scheduled to release on Tuesday, would be between 58 cents and 60
cents.
</P>
<P>
   Though the company announced several steps _ including the
resignation of Gregory T. Sangalis, its general counsel, and the
stepping-down of Earl E. DeFrates as its chief financial officer _
to improve its forecasting ability and shore up its bottom line,
Wall Street was not appeased. Investors sent the shares down $5.50
Thursday, to $25.9375, less than half of the $60 the stock peaked
at May 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``A month ago, everyone loved this stock, and now we have no
strong buys on it at all,'' said Charles L. Hill, director of
research at the First Call Corp., which tracks analysts' estimates
and stock recommendations. ``Analysts have clearly lost confidence
in this company.''
</P>
<P>
   Waste Management attributed at least 6 cents of the latest
reduction in its earnings forecast to higher-than-expected interest
expenses and a decision not to switch to more favorable accounting
methods. But analysts also blame management for not riding herd on
field operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Management must find out why assumptions are too generous,''
said James N. Kelleher, an analyst with Argus Research, who
suggested that field executives ``are probably terrified that
they'll be sacked if they give out poor numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Waste Management is going through internal tumult. Its chairman,
John E. Drury, is being treated for brain cancer. Analysts say that
Rodney R. Proto, the president, has been trying to handle both top
jobs _ and doing neither very well.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, shareholders slapped Waste Management with a suit for
securities fraud, contending that the company had given out falsely
optimistic information even as several executives, including Proto
and Sangalis, were selling large blocks of their personal holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Waste Management's employees, meanwhile, have been up in arms
since July 14, when management said that, despite earlier promises,
it would not terminate its defined benefit pension plan and
distribute lump-sum payments. Thursday, acknowledging a need to
improve employee morale and to let management concentrate on other
problems, the company said it would terminate the plan after all,
at a cost of $215 million, substantially more than the $125 million
it first estimated.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Waste Management is trying to persuade shareholders that
its executives are on top of the company's problems. Earlier this
month, the company tacitly acknowledged Drury's continued
disability and named Ralph V. Whitworth, an executive with
Relational Investors LLC, which controls 1.1 million Waste
Management shares, as acting chairman.
</P>
<P>
   It said Thursday that Proto would coordinate with field
executives to get more accurate sales and earnings forecasts. And
it has asked Roderick Hills, the head of Waste Management's audit
committee, to investigate the allegations of insider trading.
</P>
<P>
   The company has hired Chase Securities and Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette to assist Whitworth in evaluating share-buyback programs,
asset divestitures and other ways to increase shareholder value.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are unlikely to be an easy sell, though. Waste
Management was formed a year ago when USA Waste Services, a company
that held tight reins on its field operations, bought Waste
Management Inc., a much larger but floundering rival that let its
field managers run their own shows.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say investors harbor a good deal of ill will for the
old Waste Management, which had a history of mismanagement,
accounting discrepancies and earnings disappointments, and which
had to revise earnings from 1992 through 1997 downward by $3.5
billion. And they say the merged company still suffers from culture
clashes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old Waste Management had a failure of discipline, but the
new one has a failure of communications,'' Kelleher said.

EDITORIAL: THE SHOOTINGS IN ATLANTA 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, July 30: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, the fatal shooting of nine people in Atlanta
Thursday can be seen in isolation, as the mad handiwork of a lone
individual venting uniquely twisted grievances through the barrel
of a gun. Yet the incident is also part of a larger and dismally
familiar story of shootings that seem increasingly to pop up out of
nowhere and in the most unlikely places _ in orderly small towns,
in offices, in suburban schools, in genteel neighborhoods and, in
this case, in the commercial district of the well-to-do Buckhead
section of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   There is one other thread that connects these shootings to the
others. It is of course hard if not impossible to protect society
from a determined killer camouflaged, as this one was, by his own
ordinariness. But it is also true that there are too many weapons
floating around this country _ 200 million at last count _ and,
because of the continuing failure of our national legislators, too
many ways for people to get their hands on those weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta killer has been identified by police as Mark Barton,
a 44-year-old suburbanite and day trader in stocks who walked into
a brokerage office in the Piedmont Center, made an apparently
casual comment about the drop in stock prices and suddenly opened
fire.
</P>
<P>
   He then walked across the street and started shooting in another
office in the same complex. Nine people died altogether, and a
dozen others were wounded. Later in the day, when the police
spotted his van and pulled him over, he shot himself. He apparently
was suspected but never charged in two murders in 1993. Police
suspect he may also have killed his wife and two daughters, who
were found dead Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the toll rises, in the workplace and in the schools. Just
last month a psychiatrist in Michigan was shot by a former patient,
who then gunned down a 45-year-old woman and wounded others. In
April, a 71-year-old man raked the first floor of a Mormon library
in Salt Lake City with gunfire from a .22 caliber handgun, killing
two people and wounding four others. In March, a Johnson City,
Tenn., man shot his lawyer and another client in an apparent
dispute over his former wife's will.
</P>
<P>
   Before that were the killings that gave grotesque definition to
the 1997-98 school year _ students dead and wounded in Pearl,
Miss.; West Paducah, Ky.; Edinboro, Pa.; Jonesboro, Ark., and
Springfield, Ore. All of that seemed but a preamble to this year's
carnage at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo. This is an
appalling list, and while there are no easy answers, the failure of
Congress to limit access to weapons among dangerous or unbalanced
individuals in appalling, too.

 &HT;    Shooter didn't have the look of a killer
 &HT;    By Alan Judd
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Mark Orrin Barton walked into a stock brokerage
Thursday afternoon, he wore the same genial countenance that he
displayed even in his driver's license photos: a warm smile across
a round face, topped by a shock of dark curly hair _ hardly the
look of a killer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He greeted people on the way in,'' Harvey Houtkin, head of All
-Tech Investment Services, said later. And as he began blasting
away with two handguns, Hautkin said, Barton told his victims, ``I
hope I'm not upsetting your trading day.''
</P>
<P>
   Such incongruity clouded the portrait that emerged late Thursday
of the 44-year-old Barton, one of Georgia's worst mass murderers, a
man who drove a green minivan.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said Barton, whose last known address was an
apartment in Stockbridge, Ga., killed nine people and wounded 12
others during an afternoon rampage at three normally quiet office
buildings on Atlanta's north side. Police were also at the scene of
Barton's Henry County home, where the bodies of a woman and two
children were found after the Atlanta shootings _ apparently those
of his wife and his son and daughter from a previous marriage.
</P>
<P>
   It all ended about when Barton shot himself to death outside a
suburban gas station.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no information at all'' on what set off the killing
spree, Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell said late Thursday, ``except
we're certain Mr. Barton came to (the office complex) and killed
nine people.''
</P>
<P>
   Interviews, public records and police accounts indicated that
until Thursday's rampage, Barton lived a mostly unremarkable life
with one glaring exception - Labor Day Weekend 1993, when his first
wife and her mother were hacked to death at a campground on an
Alabama lake.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately, Barton's former father-in-law accused him of the
crime. That same accuser said Thursday the killings in Henry County
and Atlanta completed what Barton had started almost six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``If what I've heard is true, the man has destroyed nearly my
whole family,'' said Bill Spivey of Lithia Springs, Ga., whose
wife, Eloise, then 59, and his 36-year-old daughter Debra were
killed at northeast Alabama's Lake Weiss. ``The man who it appears
killed my wife and daughter also killed my two grandchildren.''
</P>
<P>
   No charges were ever filed in the 1993 killings, but Alabama
authorities said Thursday he had been under suspicion for almost
six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the No. 1 suspect all the way through and still was,''
said Richard Igou, district attorney in Cedar Bluff, Ala., at the
time of the killings.
</P>
<P>
   The current district attorney, Mike O'Dell, said investigators
had monitored Barton's whereabouts for almost six years. ``There
was no precursors to think this might happen,'' O'Dell said. ``It
was a shock.''
</P>
<P>
   After the 1993 killings, a judge in Douglas County, Ga., where
Barton lived at the time, ordered him to undergo a psychological
evaluation in a custody case involving his two young children.
</P>
<P>
   The results ``to this day make me shudder,'' said David McDade,
the Douglas County district attorney, who has reviewed the case.
``They indicated to us that he was certainly capable'' of
committing the murders.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief interview with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in
1994, Barton _ who won custody of the children, Matthew and Shelly
_ declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, Michael Hauptman, told a local Atlanta TV news
reporter on Thursday that Barton recently won a $600,000 settlement
from an insurance company that had refused to pay his wife's
life-insurance policy.
</P>
<P>
   Hauptman described Barton as ``very, very quiet'' and ``very
gentle,'' a man who ``cared about his children, cared, quite
frankly, about his wife's murder and his mother-in-law.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from his first wife's death, though, nothing in Barton's
background seems to point toward the extreme violence that
characterized his final hours.
</P>
<P>
   Barton was born in Sumter, S.C., in 1955. Answering the
telephone Thursday night in the house where Barton grew up, his
79-year-old mother, Gladys Barton, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not talking to reporters _ none,'' she said. ``I'm not
giving any information.

IHOP PLANS NYSE MOVE

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- IHOP Corp., on track to top $1.1 billion in sales
this year, hopes to stack up with the big boys on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles-based chain of International House of Pancakes
restaurants announced Thursday that it has filed an application to
be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, forsaking Nasdaq and
exchanging its ``IHOP'' ticker symbol for ``IHP.'' The company --
with 640 franchise outlets, 148 licensed and 76 company-operated
sites as of June 30 -- expects its 20 million publicly held shares
to be listed in mid-September.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Weisberger, vice president and general counsel, said the
NYSE has given the application preliminary approval. ``Final
approval is not just a formality but we have a good deal of comfort
that it will be approved,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   IHOP said a NYSE listing will provide greater liquidity, reduced
volatility, tighter quotation spreads and a larger worldwide
market.
</P>
<P>
   The company's first restaurant opened in 1958 and the company
went public in 1991. IHOP specializes in moderate prices at casual
locales with its major challenge being to attract customers for
lunch and dinner.

38 ARRESTED IN ILLEGAL GAMBLING RING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Fla.) (yn) 
 By JAYSON BLAIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Federal and municipal law enforcement officials
fanned out in the New York area Thursday to arrest 38 people in
connection with a gambling operation that the police said brought
in $50 million a year from more than 500 illegal-gambling spots. A
39th person, the suspected ringleader, was arrested in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   FBI agents arrested seven people described as the principal
managers of the organization on federal gambling and conspiracy
charges, including the man the authorities said was the ringleader,
Raul Rodriguez, 63. Rodriguez, who was on parole on federal
drug-trafficking charges, ran the operation from his home in Miami,
the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The New York City police arrested 32 people on state gambling
charges during the searches Thursday, which came after a 27-month
investigation by the Brooklyn North vice squad, police officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that these arrests have dismantled the hierarchy of
this gambling operation,'' Police Commissioner Howard Safir said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The six other people arrested on federal charges were Manuel
Alvarez Sr., 57, of North Bergen, N.J.; his son Manuel Alvarez Jr.,
33, of Franklin Lakes, N.J.; Elena Novo, 39, of White Plains, N.Y.;
Mazimo Tavares, 38, of Lynbrook, N.Y., and Luis Moreno-Garcia, 39,
and Orlando Ferrer, 61, both of Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also seized nearly $500,000 they believe was
related to the gambling operation and to other criminal enterprises
during searches of homes and businesses in Brooklyn, Queens, the
Bronx, and Nassau and Rockland Counties in New York, and in Hudson
County in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS joined the investigation to help trace the
organization's money trail, said Rick Schmidt, chief of the IRS
criminal division in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Donovan, associate special agent in charge of the FBI's
criminal division in New York, said law enforcement officials
believed that some of the profits from the illegal gambling
operation had been reinvested in other criminal enterprises.
Officials would not comment on what type of criminal activities the
money was being funneled into; however, narcotics agents were
involved in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said the gambling enterprise was built like a
pyramid system. In the New York area, managers were given
franchises that operated 40 to 50 gambling locations each. The
police said the more than 500 illegal gambling locations in the
region were often run out of newsstands, bodegas, beauty stores and
other small shops.
</P>
<P>
   Safir added that the police planned to close many of them using
the city's nuisance abatement laws.

HMO REOPENS BIDDING

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Managed care specialist WellPoint Health Networks
Inc. submitted a $266 million bid Thursday for one of Colorado's
largest health plans, the Rocky Mountain Hospital and Medical
Service.
</P>
<P>
   Rocky Mountain, a nonprofit with 500,000 members, runs Blue
Cross-Blue Shield of Colorado and Nevada. WellPoint lost a previous
bid for the service to Anthem Inc. in March but protested because
it said it did not have time to process its bid.
</P>
<P>
   After Colorado Attorney General Ken Salazar pressured Rocky
Mountain to reopen the process, the company announced that
negotiations had always been open to other groups -- despite a
definitive agreement it signed with Anthem -- and told WellPoint
and other that they could submit new bids.
</P>
<P>
   WellPoint, parent company of Blue Cross of California, is the
only company that has submitted a new bid, according to Rocky
Mountain. That new offer came just before Rocky Mountain was to
file with the state for conversion from a nonprofit to a for-profit
corporation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had planned to file that tomorrow, but we have that process
on hold until we figure out what's in this material from
Wellpoint,'' said Rocky Mountain spokesman Neil Westergaard.
</P>
<P>
   WellPoint spokesman Peter O'Neill said his company is pleased
the bidding was reopened.
</P>
<P>
   But he said there are still concerns that Anthem, which has
operated the plan since winning the initial bid in March, has a
stronger position now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do feel that provides them somewhat of an unfair
advantage,'' O'Neill said.
</P>
<P>
   Under its proposal, WellPoint would pay $100 million directly to
the health plan, pay a $6 million break-up fee to Anthem and give
Anthem up to $10 million for the last few months of administrative
services.
</P>
<P>
   The offer also includes a guaranteed $150 million payment to
create a charitable foundation, a requirement when a nonprofit
health plan converts to a for-profit concern. Anthem's endowment
offer is ``at least $140 million,'' according to Westergaard.

 &HT;    Day trading a gambling proposition
 &HT;    By Tom Walker and
 &HT;    Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Think of day trading in the stock market as playing a
video game all day with your computer and risking tons of money at
the same time.
</P>
<P>
   That's an exaggeration, to be sure, but not much.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called day trader wouldn't exist without the computer and
the software needed to make it work.
</P>
<P>
   And, very likely, the phenomenon of day trading probably
wouldn't have emerged as it has except for the lure of the greatest
bull market in Wall Street history _ a stunning and long-running
rise in stock prices that created the image of quick wealth at
minimal risk.
</P>
<P>
   A trade association estimates that up to 5,000 people are
full-time day traders.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, the motive for day trading is a quick profit,
within minutes or hours. In a day.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Barton, a 44-year-old day trader apparently shot and killed
himself in his van at an Atlanta gas station after police say he
killed at least 12 people during a bloody rampage Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The day trader, working alone or with partners in a business
setting, scans the market looking for signs that a stock will move
higher _ and then takes advantage of market volatility to jump on a
price gain.
</P>
<P>
   This is not anything like the usual procedure, where investors
pore over volumes of research on individual companies or industry
groups before making a buy or sell decision.
</P>
<P>
   Fact is, the day trader probably doesn't care what a company
does or even if it is profitable. The day trader wants to buy the
stock, wait for it to go up in price and sell it to someone else
before the price slips again.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Streeters see online and day trading as a form of gambling
and an easy way to lose money, said Fred Allvine, head of the Stock
Market Project at Georgia Tech in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just rolling the dice,'' Allvine said. ``With the market
going down the last two weeks, it's really bad on day traders. They
are gamblers. Now the gamble has gone against them, and it was
bound to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Alexander, 53, managing principal of IJL Wachovia, said,
``When you buy a mutual fund, you're told to hold for five to 10
years, but when you day trade, you're told to hold 'til lunch.''
</P>
<P>
   Some critics call day trading the ``greater fool theory of
investing.''
</P>
<P>
   Day traders are often willing to pay more for stocks than would
a conventional trader _ more than the stocks are worth based on
traditional measures. The idea is that they will find a ``greater
fool'' willing to pay an even higher price.
</P>
<P>
   This criticism is probably unfair to most day traders, who may
simply be savvy investors who found an opportunity in new
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantan John Berner put it this way in a published interview:
``What we do is analogous to playing a financial video game.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing is for sure, day trading _ also referred to as online,
electronic or Internet trading _ has had a big impact on the stock
market.
</P>
<P>
   Day trading developed after January 1997, when the National
Association of Securities Dealers changed the rules relating to the
display of buy and sell prices for stocks.
</P>
<P>
   This led to the formation of electronic communications networks,
or ECNs, which match buyers and sellers of stocks without using
traditional market makers. They execute the trades of day traders.
</P>
<P>
   The Electronic Traders Association, which represents many of the
day-trading shops, estimates that 4,000 to 5,000 people trade full
time through day-trading brokerages.
</P>
<P>
   International Data Corp., a research firm, says day traders
using the Internet are doing about 440,000 trades per day, or one
in seven U.S. stock transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Those are trades, mind you, not shares traded. Bloomberg News
reports that a single ECN may execute trades of as many as 95
million shares, or almost 10 percent of the Nasdaq market's
billion-share daily average.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, electronic trading is one of the biggest revolutions
on Wall Street since May 1, 1975, when the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission abolished fixed brokerage commissions _ a
change that dramatically pushed up trading volumes.
</P>
<P>
   Even the conservative New York Stock Exchange is looking at
extending trading to 19 hours per day, partly because of small
investors who otherwise have little access to after-hours trading,
as do the major brokerages.
</P>
<P>
   The downside of day trading is that it can be ``extremely
risky,'' according to the Web site of StreetAdvisor.com, a trading
organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customers should be prepared to lose all of the funds that
they use for day trading,'' the trading organization says in its
primer for day traders.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should not fund their day trading activities with
retirement savings, student loans, second mortgages, emergency
funds, funds set aside for purposes such as education or home
ownership, or funds required for current income.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander of IJL Wachovia, a 32-year veteran of the brokerage
industry, said day trading ``is like going to Las Vegas and getting
on a slot machine. All you care about is taking a dollar and making
it $1.05 by the end of the day. It's advertized on TV as the
greatest thing since sliced bread. But day trading is gambling. If
you do it to have fun, fine, but it's not investing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Terry, head of the securities division in the Georgia
Secretary of State's Office, said some states are investigating
day-trading firms, and that Georgia officials have their eye on
such companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some problems we have become aware of with the
industry in general that has attracted our attention in recent
months,'' Terry said. ``Claims have been made by firms as to the
likelihood of profitability, about how quote-unquote it is easy to
be a successful day trader. There has been evidence elsewhere of
firms lending the money to traders to cover losses. We and other
state regulators are looking at that.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are some other tidbits from StreetAdvisor.com for
prospective day traders: Day trading requires knowledge of
securities markets and knowledge of a securities firm's operations,
and day trading may result in large commissions.
</P>
<P>
   Another hazard, according to market watchers, is what will
happen if the bull market comes to an end?
</P>
<P>
   With shrinking stock market volume and less volatility, traders
would not have the same opportunity to make a quick profit.
</P>
<P>
   Author Robert Sobel, who has written extensively about the
market, told Bloomberg News that online investors have no track
records with market cycles.
</P>
<P>
   ``My own suspicions is that a lot of these pole are just playing
with fires, '' said Sobel.

STOCK FUNDS RETURN TO FAVOR WITH HEFTY JUNE INVESTMENTS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Investors poured $19.2 billion into stock mutual
funds last month, completing the strongest quarter for stock-fund
sales in a year and suggesting that many people have regained the
calm they lost last summer, when fund sales evaporated as the stock
market plunged almost 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, purchases of fund shares during April, May and June
exceeded redemptions by almost $60 billion. That is almost as much
money as what flowed into stock funds during the same period in
1998, and more than what the industry took in during the second
quarter in 1997, the strongest year in history for fund sales.
</P>
<P>
   Still, stock-fund flows for the first six months of this year
are down about 27 percent from the first six months in 1998, mostly
from poor sales earlier this year, according to the Investment
Company Institute, the mutual-fund industry's leading trade group.
Some industry observers predict July could be a slower month,
primarily because of the 5 percent slide in the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index during the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   And while the industry surpassed another milestone last month _
total assets in all mutual funds topped $6 trillion _ the rapid
growth in new cash flows into stock funds that propelled the
industry for much of this decade shows no sign of returning.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts attribute the slowdown to the rise in popularity
of online stock trading and lingering effects of the market's
turmoil last fall, but they disagree somewhat about the outlook.
Some view Internet trading as a permanent hindrance to fund sales,
while others believe the industry suffered through a rough patch
typical after a period of heavy market volatility.
</P>
<P>
   For July, fund sales were strong at the nation's big fund
families.
</P>
<P>
   The FMR Corp.'s Fidelity Investments arm said net sales of stock
funds through Wednesday totaled $3.2 billion, led by funds
including Aggressive Growth, Magellan, Growth Company, Dividend
Growth and its Spartan U.S. Equity index fund. Total stock-fund
sales at Fidelity of $19 billion so far this year are more than
twice the company's sales for all of last year.
</P>
<P>
   At Vanguard Group, the second-largest fund family, executives
estimate investors bought about $3.2 billion in stock fund shares
this month. John J. Brennan, chief executive at Vanguard,
attributed the slowdown in sales earlier in the year to industry
rhythms. ``Cyclicality is a normal part of the business, as
emotions swing up and down with the markets,'' he said, and changes
occur ``in people's ability to save.''
</P>
<P>
   Total stock fund net sales were about $15 billion in the first
four weeks of July, said Robert Adler, president of AMG Data
Services, a fund industry researcher.

TVG NETWORK AN EARLY JOKE FOR RACING FANS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For years, fans looked forward to the marriage of racing and
technology that would give us round-the-clock TV coverage and
interactive wagering, serving the couch-bound horseplayer while
enticing the channel-surfing novice.
</P>
<P>
   The wedding took place this month when the Television Games
Network became available to 1.1 million households nationwide via
satellite and to the curious on racetrack sets.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of guests throwing rice, we were surprised to see
the hosts of TVG's studio shows tossing cream pies at each other.
</P>
<P>
   Where we envisioned endless racing video and analysis, we've
seen a weird combination of intertrack TV, bad morning-drive radio
and Three Stooges slapstick. Male and female anchors have traded
clothes on camera (not as provocative as it sounds), swapped
drinking stories and joked about their own incompetence as
handicappers. Yes, there was even a food fight, though I'm not sure
if pies were thrown.
</P>
<P>
   When racing has wormed its way into the conversation, the topic
has been treated with irreverence that goes far beyond
``SportsCenter's'' fashionable irony. You feel sorry for Caton
Bredar, the veteran racing commentator, and Gary Mandella, the
former assistant trainer to his father Richard. The two most
knowledgeable members of the cast come off as teetotalers at a frat
party.
</P>
<P>
   All of which is disappointing because of the high hopes that
greeted TVG _ blessed by the National Thoroughbred Racing
Association, backed by TV Guide and co-produced in Los Angeles by
Fox, and widely held to represent the future of a sport badly in
need of a fresh start.
</P>
<P>
   Well, TVG executives have been pleading for patience, and we'll
go along with that. The future is a long time. Even Secretariat
lost his first race.
</P>
<P>
   What we're seeing now is the window dressing, without the
interactive components that will allow betting by phone in
Kentucky, Maryland and Oregon as early as next month and in
California as early as next year, and allow internet betting via
TVG this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the tomfoolery has taken place during dead periods in
the nation's racing day. Eventually, TVG will round out its 24-hour
coverage of all things equine with foreign racing, more extensive
interviews and news features, and even horse-themed movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've just barely stuck our toe in the water,'' said Rick
Baedeker, the former Hollywood Park executive who is TVG's vice
president for communications. ``Anybody who wants to look at the
first couple of weeks and form all sorts of conclusions is welcome
to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Baedeker said, TVG executives are determined to let the
shows and showmen develop their personalities at their own pace.
</P>
<P>
   The turf media's response has stung the TVG people _
particularly a blistering review by Daily Racing Form columnist
Stan Bergstein. Baedeker, though, said the criticism won't change
the network's direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a game plan and we're going to stick to it. And the
fact a couple of columnists have strong opinions is frankly better
news to us than not being talked about at all,'' Baedeker said.
</P>
<P>
   At least for now, traditional racing fans would get more use out
of Youbet.com, the L.A.-based Internet concern that provides odds
updates, past-performance information, choppy race video and online
wagering _ though for a shorter list of tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, feeding traditional fans is only half of TVG's
mission. To succeed, the network must pull in viewers who wouldn't
otherwise pay attention to racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have a chance to make a big difference (for the racing
industry), we've got to get the channel-surfers to stop and
watch,'' Baedeker said. ``That hasn't happened with straight racing
programming in the past and it won't happen in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   TVG is expected to be available on basic cable by the end of
1999. By then it might be worth watching.
</P>
<P>
   __ Gold watch: Owners John Toffan and Trudy McCaffery announced
that Free House, winner of the 1998 Pacific Classic and the '99
Santa Anita Handicap, has been retired because of the hind-end
injuries he sustained in the Pimlico Special loss to Real Quiet
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Free House gained popularity when he won the Santa Anita Derby
and waged game battles with Silver Charm in the '97 Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   But Blood-Horse magazine's online service went too far when it
said Free House might be California's most popular horse of the
decade. Best Pal had a larger following. So did Silver Charm.
</P>
<P>
   __ The weekend: The Eddie Read Handicap, Del Mar's biggest turf
race, matches 1998 Horse of the Meeting Ladies Din, Hawksley Hill,
Brave Act, Joe Who, Lazy Lode and as many as five others on Sunday.
Out of town the same day, Saratoga's Whitney Handicap has NTRA
series leader Behrens, Victory Gallop and Sir Bear.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, the United Nations Handicap on the Monmouth (N.J.)
Park turf should be dominated by leading turf runner Yagli.

JONES AND RIZZO ARE TIED, BUT INKSTER HAS INCENTIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRIDDIS, Alberta _ Rosie Jones has won nine tournaments and
close to $4 million in her Ladies Professional Golf Association
career.
</P>
<P>
   Winning a major championship is one of the few goals that Jones
has not achieved. But based on Thursday's performance, she may not
have to wait much longer.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting a five-under-par 67, including birdies on three of the
last four holes, Jones tied Patti Rizzo for the lead after the
opening round of the du Maurier Classic. Juli Inkster and Catriona
Matthew of Scotland were tied for second place, one stroke behind.
</P>
<P>
   Inkster is trying to become only the second woman to win three
of the four modern LPGA majors in one season, joining Pat Bradley,
who did it in 1986. Inkster also needs one victory to gain entrance
into the LPGA Hall of Fame, and with 54 holes to play, she was in
position for an historic weekend at Priddis Greens Golf and Country
Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's all over me about the majors and the Hall of
Fame,'' said Inkster, who has won this year's U.S. Women's Open and
the McDonald's LPGA Championship. ``But I'm just trying to do the
same things I've been doing. If I'm in contention on Sunday, I feel
I have just as good a chance as anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jones, who hopes to postpone Inkster's date with history,
closed with a flourish Thursday, making birdies on Nos. 15, 17 and
18. Jones, a native of California who makes her home in Atlanta,
will turn 40 years old in November, and she expects to remain on
tour perhaps only three or four more years. Time is running out in
her quest to win a major. But she remains a threat to win any week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a couple of more years out here, and I would love to
put a major on my bio,'' said Jones, who has earned more money
($3.97 million) in her career than any LPGA player who has not won
a major. ``I've had a great career. I've played a lot of great
golf. I don't think it's going to make or break my career. But when
I lay down my clubs, I could lay them down a lot easier if I had a
major.''
</P>
<P>
   Rizzo has not won on tour since 1989, but she played solidly
Thursday in a round that included seven birdies and two bogeys.
Meanwhile, Jones has been one of the game's most consistent
players, with one victory in each of the past four years. Although
Jones has yet to win in 1999, she has six top-10 finishes, and
entered this week in 12th place on the season's money list.
</P>
<P>
   Putting has always been one of Jones' strengths, and her stroke
was true Thursday. She made a 17-footer for birdie at No. 11, a
6-footer for birdie at No. 15, a 20-footer for birdie at No. 17,
and a 5-footer for birdie at No. 18.
</P>
<P>
   The greens at Priddis are large with numerous slopes, making
many putts difficult to read. But Jones only needed 29 putts in her
round, and she made life easier by hitting many approach shots
close to the green.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm seeing the breaks well and using my imagination,'' Jones
said. ``Even when you don't see the break, you feel it with your
other senses, using your feet or the lay of the land. You have to
do that playing greens like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones' only bogey came at the par-4 No. 13, when she hit a poor
6-iron approach shot that nearly sailed into the water near the
green. But Jones got a break when the ball hit a rock next to the
water and ricocheted onto dry land. Jones chipped onto the green
and scrambled for bogey.
</P>
<P>
   However, Jones was well aware that Inkster was lurking. ``It
doesn't surprise me at all that she is playing well,'' Jones said
of Inkster. ``She will be in the Hall of Fame before the end of the
year.''

<P>
   Thomas L. Kimball, former chief executive of the National
Wildlife Federation, died on July 20 at Manor Care Convalescent
Home in Citrus Heights, Calif. He was 81 and lived in Roseville,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a stroke, said his wife, Arvella Allen Kimball.
</P>

<P>
   Under Kimball, the foundation expanded its educational and
advocacy efforts and constructed two buildings, Mark Van Putten,
the group's president, said.
</P>
<P>
   Kimball served on various committees dealing with state and
national environmental policy and was a delegate to meetings of the
International Whaling Commission. The honors he received included
the Conservation Service Award from the Interior Department.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Los Angeles, grew up in Phoenix and received a
bachelor's degree from Brigham Young University. He was director of
the Colorado Game and Fish Department from 1952 to 1960.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife of 59 years, he is survived by two sons,
Thomas S., of Oakdale, Calif., and Allen K., of Seattle; four
daughters, Patricia Clark of Boise, Idaho, Pamela Hunt of
Escondido, Calif., Kay Lafleur of Herndon, Va., and Andrea
Zimmerman of Granite Bay, Calif.; two brothers, Horace, of Elkton,

GERE SHOWS LIGHTER SIDE IN SEEKING `RUNAWAY' HIT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: See optional ending) 
 
By BRUCE WESTBROOK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After making beautiful music together in 1990's
``Pretty Woman,'' Richard Gere and Julia Roberts were open to an
encore.
</P>
<P>
   They wanted to team for ``Pretty Woman II.'' They just couldn't
find a proper script.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty Woman'' may have grossed $463 million worldwide, but
where could Gere's lonely tycoon and Roberts' good-hearted
prostitute go after they fell in love?
</P>
<P>
   The artistic prospects looked as shaky as ``The Sting II,''
``The Odd Couple II'' or ``Beyond the Poseidon Adventure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A sequel would rely on picking up where `Pretty Woman'
ended,'' said Garry Marshall, the film's director. ``But too much
time had passed _ the actors were older _ and nobody had a script
that took them 10 years later, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, finding any well-written adult romantic comedy is
extremely difficult, Gere observed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lightning struck with `Pretty Woman,''' the actor said. ``You
can't expect it to strike there again.''
</P>
<P>
   But you can try to rekindle a special chemistry, which is why
Gere, 49, and Roberts, 31, reunited with Marshall for ``Runaway
Bride,'' opening this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Gere and Marshall met the press here to talk about the new film.
Roberts was off making ``Erin Brockovich,'' a drama for director
Steven Soderbergh. She and Gere are neighbors in Manhattan and have
kept in touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Runaway Bride'' is not a ``Pretty Woman'' sequel. But it is a
romantic comedy _ this time in a screwball vein _ and its zestful
fun should make it one of late-summer's biggest hits.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Runaway Bride,'' Gere plays an arrogant reporter for USA
Today who _ on hearsay _ writes a misogynist column about a woman
in rural Maryland (Roberts) known for leaving men at the altar.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts disputes the claim, leading Gere to investigate on her
home turf, just as she heads toward another wedding date.
</P>
<P>
   Feisty sparks fly between the reporter and his quarry _ and
perhaps sparks of another kind, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where does our chemistry come from?'' Gere echoes the
question. ``You tell me. Of course, it doesn't hurt that Julia's
beautiful, smart, talented and unexpected. And Garry brings out the
best in us.''
</P>
<P>
   Gere first read the ``Runaway Bride'' script by Josann McGibbon
and Sara Parriott. He then called Roberts, who was in London at the
time filming ``Notting Hill,'' her hit of this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd been trying to develop other things over the years, and
they just weren't right,'' he said. ``But this one was full-blown _
right there. It was smartly combative, in the way that intelligent
men and women go at each other. It was as juicy and fun as such
films were in the '40s.''
</P>
<P>
   So Gere told Roberts, ``Whether or not I make this movie, you
should, because the part is perfect for you.''
</P>
<P>
   She resisted doing it without him, so they got together at
Gere's office to discuss it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very professional,'' Gere said. ``We got out our
directors lists, and about halfway through we started laughing and
saying, `This is ridiculous. This is for Garry. Of course it's
Garry.'''
</P>
<P>
   So they called Marshall, and within days the film was in
pre-production.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very quick _ very easy,'' Gere said.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall said his stars ``grew'' as actors and as people over
the years, but their on-screen relationship hadn't changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the first day, that chemistry was there again,'' he said.
``With Richard and Julia, you don't need violins. With some couples
I've needed a full orchestra.''
</P>
<P>
   Gere especially relished playing a ``fun'' character this time.
``In `Pretty Woman,' I was very straight and depressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Audiences may be surprised how much he opens up, playing
self-effacing and even silly bits.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't think of Richard as Cary Grant _ maybe Ulysses S.
Grant,'' Marshall said. ``But he can do light comedy.''
</P>
<P>
   It helped having Marshall at the helm. His fun-loving spirit
imbues the film.
</P>
<P>
   Each day on the set brought new celebrations, from birthdays,
anniversaries and engagements to surprise visits by friends and
family (such as the director's sister, Penny Marshall), who would
walk into scenes while the cameras rolled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Runaway Bride'' also has the same composer as ``Pretty
Woman,'' James Newton Howard, and about 10 of the same supporting
actors.
</P>
<P>
   ``For old times' sake I thought that would be interesting,''
Marshall said. ``The supporting cast for me was a gathering of
eagles. Everybody hit a home run for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief among them is Hector Elizondo, who's been in all 11 of
Marshall's movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Garry likes the way I feed him the ball in the post,''
Elizondo said, using a basketball analogy.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Pretty Woman,'' Elizondo was the kind hotel manager who
took Roberts under his wing. In ``Runaway Bride,'' he plays the
husband of Gere's editor and ex-wife, played by Rita Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   During his work, Elizondo said, many lines and bits were
ad-libbed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Garry just keeps the cameras rolling,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he never heard of Roberts' own near-marriage to Kiefer
Sutherland coming up on the set, ``but I'm sure there were some
jokes flying around,'' considering the plot's parallel.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are always jokes on a Garry Marshall set, and a lot of
celebrations. There was a cake every day,'' Elizondo said.
</P>
<P>
   Gere said the director ``creates an atmosphere where it's
natural to be goofy and take a shot. It's very loose, full of life
and great fun.''
</P>
<P>
   That included a surprise that became a running joke.
</P>
<P>
   Since women were angry with Gere's character, Marshall quietly
asked an elderly woman passing him on a Manhattan street to hit him
with a newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time, I didn't know it was going to happen, and she
clobbered me with an umbrella,'' Gere said. ``Garry hurried over
and said, `Not with an umbrella _ with a newspaper.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The bit worked so well, we kept finding other places to do it.
Garry would grab some old lady and say, `Hit him with a newspaper.'
But the umbrella take was the one we used for that first scene.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As in ``Pretty Woman,'' Gere plays piano in ``Runaway Bride.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Music is a gift my parents gave me,'' he said. ``I probably
spend more time with music than anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   He also finds time to support Tibet and human-rights causes.
During the Kosovo crisis, Gere visited refugee camps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, I have the resources and inclination to find out what's
going on in the world, so I feel a responsibility to do something
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   As he approaches his 50th birthday Aug. 31 _ ``It doesn't seem
like a big deal,'' he says _ Gere also nears fatherhood. His
girlfriend, actress Carey Lowell (``Law &AMP; Order''), is expecting
their child early next year. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Before then, Gere will make ``Autumn in New York,'' a romantic
comedy with Winona Ryder. Then he'll be in Dallas to make
``Mornings With Dr. T.,'' a comedy for Robert Altman.
</P>
<P>
   A Pennsylvania native, Gere got his start in theater, including
the musical comedy ``Grease.'' But most of his movies have been
dramas, such as the recent ``Primal Fear,'' and he relishes a shift
to comedy.
</P>
<P>
   That includes a ``snake dance'' scene in ``Runaway Bride'' in
which his character runs gingerly across a field at night, fearful
of biting reptiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know how to do farce and crazy stuff,'' Gere said. ``I grew
up doing that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been doing that snake dance for 50 years,'' he said with
a laugh. ``That was my snake dance.''

MALACHI MARTIN, 78, AUTHOR OF BOOKS ON THE CHURCH 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Malachi Brendan Martin, an Irish-born former Jesuit
priest and Vatican scholar who went on to write thrillers about the
Roman Catholic Church, died Tuesday at Lenox Hill Hospital in
Manhattan. He was 78 and lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a head injury resulting from a fall, said his
companion, Kakia Livanos.
</P>
<P>
   A staunch traditionalist, Martin was a close associate of Pope
John XXIII and Cardinal Augustin Bea during the tumultuous era of
the Second Vatican Council, when the church of the early 1960s
adopted more liberal policies in hopes of broadening its appeal,
replacing Latin rites with Masses in local languages and expanding
the role of lay people.
</P>
<P>
   Disillusioned by the reforms taking place among the Jesuits, the
church's largest religious order, Martin requested a release from
his vows in 1964. He moved in 1965 to New York, where he wrote full
time after brief stints as a dishwasher and cabby, and he
eventually became an American citizen.
</P>
<P>
   Reviewing ``The Encounter,'' Martin's 1970 study of Judaism,
Christianity and Islam, in The New York Times, Christopher
Lehmann-Haupt characterized the author as ``a lapsed Irish cleric
half in love and half in hate with God.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Jesuits,'' published in 1987, Martin wrote about how
the once spiritually elite corps founded by St. Ignatius of Loyola
had become supporters of liberation theology, with its emphasis on
leftist political change. Paul Hoffmann, reviewing the work in The
Times, summed up Martin's view of the church as ``pluralistic,
permissive, ecumenical and evolutionary, with a rebellious,
decadent clergy, an ignorant and recalcitrant body of bishops and a
confused and divided assembly of believers.''
</P>
<P>
   A native of County Kerry, Martin received doctorates from the
universities of Louvain and Oxford and from Hebrew University in
Jerusalem, where he concentrated on knowledge of Jesus as
transmitted in Islamic and Jewish sources. He was ordained into the
priesthood in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   He was twice a Guggenheim Fellow. His writings ranged from a
seminal work on the Dead Sea Scrolls to the best-selling ``Hostage
to the Devil,'' published in 1976 shortly after the release of the
film ``The Exorcist'' and billed as a real-life account of the
possession and exorcism of five Americans, depicted in lurid
detail.
</P>
<P>
   Martin's writings were enlivened by an atmosphere reminiscent of
John le Carre and by his unwavering conviction that there was
corruption within the walls of St. Peter's. In ``The Pilgrim,''
written under the pseudonym Michael Serafian in 1964, he divulged
Vatican efforts to renounce Pope John's ``Jewish document,'' which
retracted the church's doctrine blaming Jews for Christ's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are `moles' in the Vatican informing Moscow,'' he said
in a 1978 interview in The Times on the release of ``The Final
Conclave,'' adding that he had written the book to alert the world
to Marxist influences in the church that could affect the choice of
the next pope.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see these two great institutions in danger _ the Roman
Catholic Church and the United States,'' Martin said. ``A pope
cannot be impeached....It was my duty as a Catholic and an American
to reveal the secret negotiations now going on. Silence would have
been the highest treason.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin summarized his view of Christianity in ``The Encounter'':
``History teaches that Christians are capable of behaving like
people without any religious principles precisely in order to
further Christianity. The words remain Christian; the actions are
un-Christian. The total result is catastrophic.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Ms. Livanos, he is survived by a brother, the
Rev. Francis Xavier Martin, and by four sisters, Netta Kelly, Maura
Feutren, Kay Doyle and Jossett O'Dowd, all of Ireland.

ON PRO FOOTBALL: A SLICK MOVE, OR IS SANDERS REALLY DONE?
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Earlier this month Detroit Lions wide receiver Herman Moore
bumped into Barry Sanders while they were running errands near
their homes in a Detroit suburb. It was one of the few times that
anyone had made contact with Sanders, the Detroit running back. A
few minutes into the conversation, Sanders dropped a bombshell.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders told Moore he was considering retiring. Moore was
shocked. Later that day Moore decided that Sanders must have been
joking, and he went about his business. He didn't give the
conversation another thought until he heard Sanders' retirement
announcement on Wednesday. That day Moore received 141 pages on his
beeper from reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders ran into another teammate in the parking lot of a
shopping mall around the same time. Sanders again said he might
retire. Stunned, the player asked why, and Sanders responded that
he was tired of losing and had never known what it was like to play
for a winning franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you're gone?'' the player asked. ``That's it? No more
Barry?''
</P>
<P>
   He said Sanders responded, ``I don't know, unless you can trade
me to the 49ers.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore and the other player were left confused. Sanders was
saying he was leaving football. At the same time, he was expressing
hesitation, even joking about playing for another team.
</P>
<P>
   Both Lions players doubt _ very strongly _ that Sanders will
stay out of football, but then again, both never thought that he
would retire now. Sanders remains as unpredictable as one of his
spin moves.
</P>
<P>
   But many in the NFL agree with Moore and his teammate that
Sanders is not done. A consensus of general managers, coaches and
players interviewed since Sanders made his announcement is that the
running back will be seen running for yardage on the field again.
</P>
<P>
   The only disagreement is where. Some think he will play with
Detroit this season. Others, including one executive with the
Lions, think Sanders will sit out this season and then demand a
trade in hopes of playing with a contender next year. That scenario
is plausible.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders has $18 million left on his deal over the next four
years. He has been paid almost one-third of his $11 million signing
bonus. If Sanders was traded now, the unpaid portion of the bonus,
more than $7 million, would count immediately against the salary
cap, which is $57.3 million. As of late this week, the Lions had
only $625,000 worth of cap room left. Thus, this year it is
impossible for Detroit to trade Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   But the Lions would be able to make a deal next year when the
salary cap is expected to increase to about $62 million. A team
like the Seattle Seahawks, for example, only a few players and a
few years away from contending for a championship, could use the
greater cap room, trade for Sanders, giving Detroit at least two
No. 1 picks in return, and Sanders could get his ring.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to the Lions' public stance, a team executive said the
club has considered such a scenario and is willing to trade Sanders
next season. It feels that it is too close to the beginning of the
1999 season to orchestrate a trade and that the salary cap
ramifications are too great.
</P>
<P>
   There are several precedents for a player missing a year and
then joining another team. Defensive lineman Sean Gilbert sat out
the 1997 season because of a contract dispute with the Washington
Redskins. At the start of that year the Carolina Panthers
considered trading for Gilbert but did not have the salary cap
space.
</P>
<P>
   Before the 1998 season the NFL announced an increase in the cap
from $41.45 million to $52.38 million. The extra cash allowed the
Panthers to sign Gilbert to a seven-year, $46.5 million contract
that included a $10 million bonus. They also had to give Washington
two No. 1 draft choices because Gilbert had been designated a
franchise player.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders could be serious about retiring. Or he could come back
this season. But what happened with Gilbert demonstrated that all
general managers need is a reasonable amount of salary cap room,
along with a calculator, and almost any deal can get done.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders retired for a variety of reasons. He was distraught from
losing five straight games at the end of last season. The volatile
personality of coach Bobby Ross, who at times has a temper, wore on
the running back. And Sanders disliked how the Lions addressed free
agency. He watched key veterans, and friends, such as offensive
linemen Kevin Glover and Lomas Brown, leave.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, when contract negotiations with the Lions moved
at a snail's pace, Sanders became infuriated. He almost retired out
of frustration, a teammate said.
</P>
<P>
   During Sanders' 10 seasons in Detroit, the Lions had a 78-82
regular-season record, and won only one playoff game. Sanders was
only 1,457 yards away from Walter Payton's career rushing record,
and teammates say Sanders wants to break it.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders is vacationing in Europe. So maybe everyone is wrong.
Maybe Sanders will not return to American football.
</P>
<P>
   Do the Barcelona Dragons have a salary cap?

DISTRACTED DODGERS LET ANOTHER SLIP AWAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The clock is ticking and it is all the Los Angeles
Dodgers can hear.
</P>
<P>
   They know Saturday's trading deadline could include any of them
and they are playing like they are not sure if that is a good thing
or not.
</P>
<P>
   You could make a case that they've played that way all season,
but when the distracted Dodgers lost 7-5 to the Cincinnati Reds on
Thursday afternoon, it marked the third time they blew leads in the
four-game series.
</P>
<P>
   Although most players think the team will not be broken up until
the end of the season, the deadline is playing with players' minds.
Tonight they open what should be a critical three-game series
against the National League West-leading Arizona Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Instead the talk is about a different kind of future, one that
does not include here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, you hear things,'' left fielder Gary Sheffield said.
``You try not to get wrapped up that, but it's hard for some guys.
You just have to wait until something happens and stay positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield has five years and $39.5 million left on his contract
and is not a candidate to leave. He is owed too much money to be
attractive to a contender.
</P>
<P>
   So is Raul Mondesi, who is owed $29 million for the next three
years. But teammates say he is worried about Saturday. Although he
had a single, a run and an RBI on Thursday, Mondesi is batting .243
and remains a missing man in the Dodgers offense.
</P>
<P>
   The guys who should really worry about packing enough socks for
the weekend are the starting pitchers. Eric Karros, who hit his
23rd homer to open the sixth inning, usually gets discussed this
time of year but appears safe for now. His name came up in Toronto
before the Blue Jays traded for Seattle first baseman David Segui.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there a distraction because of the deadline?'' Karros said.
``We've been playing this way all year.''
</P>
<P>
   Others aren't so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's on people's minds,'' pitching coach Claude Osteen said.
``Yesterday, (Ismael Valdes) came up to me in the bullpen and asked
me about it. I think there are a lot of people thinking about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so, said Darren Dreifort (8-10), who was breezing until he
fell apart in the sixth. He claims he made bad pitches on home runs
to Dmitri Young and Eddie Taubensee. He said he was trying to go
inside to Barry Larkin when he hit the Reds shortstop on an 1-2
pitch. It set up Taubensee's three-run shot that put the game away.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't take that stuff on the field,'' Dreifort said. ``If
you do, you shouldn't be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort appeared flustered after Young opened the inning by
hitting his fifth home run of the season. Young, who went 9 for 16
in the series, also doubled home a run and later scored in the
seventh off reliever Onan Masaoka.
</P>
<P>
   But Dodgers manager Davey Johnson, his team 11{ back with 60 to
play, was most upset with the pitch that struck Larkin with one
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me that was worse than the home run pitches,'' Johnson
said. ``You can't make those pitches and win consistently.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Dreifort, Reds starter Pete Harnisch (10-6), who allowed
six hits and two earned runs to win his fifth straight decision,
made the pitches when he had to. He trailed 1-0 in the first on a
sacrifice fly by Jose Vizcaino and was down 2-1 after four innings
when Mondesi scored Gary Sheffield on a fly ball to left.
</P>
<P>
   Harnisch, however, did some of his best work in the fourth. The
Dodgers had a chance for a big inning when Sheffield opened with a
single and Eric Karros followed with a double.
</P>
<P>
   But Harnisch got Todd Hollandsworth on a popup to short. Mondesi
scored Sheffield and Todd Hundley was intentionally walked. But
Adrian Beltre flied to center to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort, though, couldn't survive Cincinnati's four-run sixth.
Despite his struggles this year, he is one of the Dodgers who have
drawn the most trade interest during the past few weeks. The
Dodgers are reluctant to trade their young pitchers _ Dreifort,
Chan Ho Park or Ismael Valdes.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes, who was discussed Tuesday during meetings between Reds
general manager Jim Bowden and Dodgers GM Kevin Malone, is
scheduled to pitch Saturday. If he is scratched, you'll know
something is up.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort said none of it bothers him. Even when asked if he
thought his teammates are going through the motions, he said, ``You
can draw your own conclusions.''

EDITORIAL: A DESERVED FINE FOR CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, July 30:
</P>
<P>
   Federal Judge Susan Webber Wright has set an appropriate
sanction in directing President Clinton to pay nearly $90,000 to
Paula Jones' lawyers for making false statements about his
relationship with Monica Lewinsky in the Jones lawsuit. The
constitutional and political issues raised by the events that
ultimately led to Clinton's impeachment will long be analyzed by
historians. But Judge Wright steered clear of pronouncing judgment
on the full harm done to the Clinton presidency or to the office
itself by Clinton's behavior. Instead she focused on his actions
not as a political leader but as a litigant governed by the rule of
law.
</P>
<P>
   In April she found him in contempt of court for ``giving false,
misleading and evasive answers that were designed to obstruct the
judicial process.'' That stark assessment, unvarnished by political
spin, now stands as the appropriate legal conclusion about his
conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, as part of the contempt ruling, Judge Wright ordered
Clinton to pay the Jones lawyers for expenses and attorneys' fees
incurred as a result of his false answers to written
interrogatories and false testimony during a deposition on Jan. 17,
1998. He had denied ever being alone with Ms. Lewinsky and denied
having sexual relations with her. Judge Wright earlier ordered
Clinton to pay $1,202 for the costs the government incurred when
she traveled to Washington to preside over that tainted deposition.
</P>
<P>
   The Jones lawyers had sought nearly $500,000 in costs, but Judge
Wright ruled that the sanction must be based on actual losses in
light of the fact that the parties have already settled the case
for $850,000. Clinton's lawyers did not appeal the contempt ruling,
and many may have considered the ruling a symbolic gesture. But the
order to pay goes beyond symbolism. The $90,000 penalty sends a
clear message that even a president cannot get away with
intentional falsehoods under oath. It may also deter ordinary
citizens from emulating Clinton's abuse of the judicial system.

EDMUND KLEIN, 77, AN EXPERT ON SKIN CANCER
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., N.Y.)  (rk) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Edmund Klein, whose pioneering work on skin cancer was
honored with a Clinical Research Award from the Albert and Mary
Lasker Foundation in 1972, died on Saturday at Millard Fillmore
Hospital in Buffalo. He was 77 and lived in Williamsville, N.Y., a
Buffalo suburb.
</P>
<P>
   The causes were complications of diabetes and congestive heart
failure, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   One of Klein's early insights, that skin cancer could be treated
externally, led him to cancer research in dermatology. With the
advancing age of the population, he saw an increasing need for
nonsurgical therapies of skin cancer arising commonly from long
exposure to sunlight, and he became recognized for his work in
applying drugs directly to cancers and precancerous lesions.
</P>
<P>
   He also advanced the use of immunotherapy, in which the body's
own defenses are alerted to fend off tumors. This involved the
application of agents to stimulate the immune system and pointed
the way toward the use of interferon and interleukins in today's
cancer therapy.
</P>
<P>
   The Lasker Foundation honored him for developing the means of
treating superficial cancers with a topical ointment containing
potent anticancer chemicals. That type of treatment remains in use
today, especially for pre-malignant growths.
</P>
<P>
   Klein found himself amid controversy in 1977, when he was
interviewed by a Reader's Digest writer for an article about skin
cancer in general and stated ``authoritatively'' that President
Lyndon Johnson had been treated for it.
</P>
<P>
   Although Johnson had died four years earlier, the report was
considered significant, not so much because of the seriousness of
the illness as because of the implication of secrecy previously
surrounding the president's condition.
</P>
<P>
   But the Johnson family and White House doctors denied the report
of skin cancer, although the removal of less serious spots from the
president's skin was confirmed by his personal physician. Klein
said he had based his remark on a phone call he had received from
the Johnson White House, which, he said, had made a general inquiry
about a possible treatment for skin cancer. He also said he had
been authorized to disclose the condition by a Johnson family
representative, whom he declined to identify.
</P>
<P>
   Klein was long associated with the School of Medicine at the
State University of New York at Buffalo, where he was research
professor of medical dermatology and experimental pathology, and
with the Roswell Park Memorial Institute in Buffalo. He stepped
down as the institute's chief of dermatology in 1982 to enter
private practice but continued his association as a researcher.
</P>
<P>
   Edmund Klein was born in Vienna and, as a refugee from the
Nazis, graduated in 1941 from the University of Toronto, where he
received his M.D. in 1951. He became a Canadian citizen and
finished his training at the Harvard University Laboratory for
Physical Chemistry and at the Children's Cancer Research Foundation
at Children's Hospital in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   After a time at Tufts University, he joined the staff at Roswell
Park Memorial as chief of dermatology in 1961. SUNY Buffalo
appointed him an associate professor of experimental pathology the
next year.
</P>
<P>
   Klein is survived by his wife of 48 years, Martha Doble Klein;
two sons, Lawrence, of Columbia, S.C., and Peter, of Philadelphia;
three daughters, Judith Augustino, Rene Rubino and Amy Szymoniak,
all of Williamsville; a sister, Ruth Klein of London, and nine
grandchildren.

<P>
   The most shocking thing about the murders in Atlanta, the
``only'' thing shocking about the murders in Atlanta, is that the
murders in Atlanta aren't shocking.
</P>
<P>
   We pretend that they are.
</P>
<P>
   We say that they are, if only to make ourselves feel better, to
pretend we have a shred of old-fashioned innocence and sensitivity
left.
</P>
<P>
   But we don't.
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to say exactly when it happened, when horror and
bloodshed became nothing more than a way for CNN and CBS and NBC
and ABC to bolster viewership on a slow summer's day. But it's
true. There's nothing a crazy man with a gun can do that stuns us.
</P>
<P>
   The news Tuesday kept getting worse and worse.
</P>
<P>
   First reports said a gunman was loose in an office building the
Buckhead section of Atlanta, a place filled with fancy stores and
fancy offices and fancy apartments. Elton John once had a place
there.
</P>
<P>
   Then we learned that a man had walked into a brokerage office at
a place called Securities Center and opened fire. About a dozen
wounded were being taken to local hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   How terrible, we said. How horrible. How disgusting.
</P>
<P>
   But no one said, ``How surprising.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, we heard that the suspected gunman, Mark Barton, walked
across the street after his initial rampage and began shooting up
another brokerage firm.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters on the scene were told by emergency personnel and
witnesses that there are dead bodies in the buildings.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't throw us for a loop.
</P>
<P>
   Later, police said Barton's wife and two children are found dead
at an apartment 16 miles from Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   We're a nation with many lunatics and many more guns. We weren't
bowled over.
</P>
<P>
   Bulletins flashed about a previous wife and mother-in-law of
Barton who were killed in 1993. No one was ever charged with the
crime.
</P>
<P>
   Our minds weren't boggled.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor of Atlanta went to the scene and reported that four
people were dead in one building and five in the other, shot with
.9 mm and .45-caliber handguns, and that there were a dozen
wounded, some of them critical.
</P>
<P>
   He asked us to pray for Atlanta and for the families of the
victims, and we did. We've done the same thing before.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, we can no longer remember all the times we've prayed
for the families of victims in mass killings.
</P>
<P>
   Let's see, there was August 1986, when postal worker Pat
Sherrill, opened fire at a post office in Edmond, Okla., killing 14
people, then fatally shooting himself.
</P>
<P>
   A researcher found Sherrill's name for me. I couldn't remember
it.
</P>
<P>
   How about the 23 people fatally shot by George Hennard in 1991
after he drove his pickup truck through a plate-glass window of a
Luby's Cafeteria in Killeen, Texas?
</P>
<P>
   The Luby's part I remembered. But I couldn't recall the killer's
name or the town. Or the fact that he, too, killed himself.
</P>
<P>
   And there were the 21 people shot in a McDonald's restaurant in
San Ysidro, Calif., by James Oliver Huberty, an out-of-work
security guard. Huberty was killed by a police sharpshooter.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few months ago, we had Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, who
murdered 13 before killing themselves at Columbine High School in
Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, there was Aug. 1, 1966, when sniper Charles J.
Whitman took up a position on the University of Texas tower in
Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman was shot to death in the end, but not before killing 16,
injuring 31 and inflicting what turned out to be a fatal wound on
the American soul.
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday, before the last TV news of the day, Mark Barton
put a gun to his head and pulled the trigger. It gave Atlanta's
mayor one more chance to appear before the cameras and ask us to
pray. And we should.
</P>
<P>
   For the victims.
</P>
<P>
   For Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   For ourselves.

EX-ENVOY PLEAS FIFTH PRIVILEGE IN CHINA QUERY  
 HOUSE HEARS ABOUT U.S. VISAS IN EXCHANGE FOR `GRATUITIES' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF BARKER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A former U.S. Embassy official in Beijing asserted
his Fifth Amendment rights Thursday rather than respond to
allegations that he accepted favors from people seeking visas to
travel to Phoenix and other U.S. cities.
</P>
<P>
   The House Government Reform Committee presented evidence at a
hearing to show that Charles M. Parish Jr. received ``valuable
gratuities,'' including gifts and free lodging in Scottsdale, Las
Vegas and other locations. The committee, in a report by its staff,
also said Parish had ``inappropriate contacts'' with Chinese
citizens that included sexual relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Visa officers must abide by strict rules, including reporting
personal relationships with people seeking visas, in order to
assure they are not compromised. In many countries, citizens wait
for hours in long lines to apply for a visa to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   After entering the congressional hearing room with his attorney,
Parish, 52, an affable ex-Marine, said a cheerful ``Good morning''
to the committee and then declined, one by one, to answer any
substantive questions.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing produced new information about Parish and his
activities at the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   One of several previously undisclosed sections of Wednesday's
report said that Parish helped a Chinese student, Hong Zhao, get a
job with BNU Corp., a Phoenix real-estate company owned by a
Chinese government-owned conglomerate. BNU is operated by Elizabeth
Mann, Arizona's most important business connection to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   The committee said it learned that Zhao wrote a $7,000 check to
Parish in January 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``When (the) committee staff interviewed Ms. Zhao, she denied
buying a visa from Mr. Parish, and claimed that she was simply
repaying Parish for money he had loaned her over the past several
years,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The committee report said there is evidence that Parish
processed visas at BNU's request so that Chinese executives could
travel to the Valley and elsewhere. BNU is a subsidiary of China
National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Import and Export Corp.,
known as COFCO.
</P>
<P>
   COFCO ``denies any illegal action with respect to the processing
of visas,'' said Charles Conroy, attorney for COFCO and its U.S.
subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Parish, who was responding to a subpoena, had never publicly
testified before, although he been interviewed by ``The Arizona
Republic'' and the ``Los Angeles Times.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Chairman, on advice of my counsel, I must respectfully
invoke my constitutional right to decline to answer,'' Parish said,
eight times in all.
</P>
<P>
   The committee chairman, Dan Burton, R-Ind., wouldn't allow
Parish's attorney to read a statement explaining his client's
refusal to respond.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are not a witness and you are not allowed to make any kind
of statement. You are not to speak to the committee, OK?'' Burton
said.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney, Ralph Martin, said in an interview later that the
committee was ``unfair'' in declining to put a statement in the
record on his client's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``The statement says Mr. Parish cooperated fully with the State
Department and the FBI. This committee has put unsubstantiated
allegations before it, and he had no choice but to seek the
protection of the Constitution,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   During the hearing, the committee released an internal U.S.
embassy memorandum from 1996 saying Chinese officials and
businessmen believed it was ``very easy'' to get a visa in Beijing
through favors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese said that if you anticipated that you might have
difficulty obtaining a visa _ for instance, you were applying for a
visa allowing you to work in the United States, but you did not
speak English _ you simply t ook `the Black official' in the
embassy to dinner, gave him a `gift,' and you were guaranteed a
visa,'' said the memorandum from one embassy official to another.
</P>
<P>
   The committee staff member later said the memorandum referred to
Parish, who is African-American.
</P>
<P>
   Burton opened the hearing by declaring that three separate State
Department offices ``dropped the ball'' in their investigations of
the embassy, largely by not following promising leads or preserving
documents in Parish's office in Beijing. Parish, who was at the
embassy from 1994 until mid-1996, was transferred to Washington and
put to work reviewing visa applications from Iraq and Iran. He is
now retired.
</P>
<P>
   Jacquelyn Williams-Bridgers, the State Department inspector
general, said at the hearing that she could not discuss Parish's
case because of Justice Department concerns that her testimony
could violate grand jury secrecy laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is absolutely the most ridiculous thing I've ever
heard,'' Burton said in response. ``It's typical of the kind of
stonewalling Janet Reno's Justice Department has engaged in.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton said he had it ``on good authority'' that the Justice
Department was about to close the Parish investigation, but had
kept it open so there would be a reason not to cooperate with his
committee.
</P>
<P>
   John Russell, the Justice Department spokesman on criminal
matters, said he hadn't heard Burton's remarks and could not
respond.
</P>
<P>
   But Henry Waxman, D-Calif., the committee's top-ranking
Democrat, said Burton seemed out to attack the Justice Department,
no matter what the agency did.
</P>
<P>
   Burton's reasoning ``just seems to be contradictory,'' Waxman
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they closed their investigation, they'd be criticized
because it should be taken more seriously. If they kept it open,
they're criticized because they haven't closed it so that witnesses
can come before this committee to give evidence,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The committee hearing came 11 weeks after it heard testimony
from Johnny Chung, a Taiwanese-born Californian who was once a
Democratic Party fund-raiser. The committee has been trying to
determine, with Chung's help, whether China attempted to interfere
with the 1996 presidential election by funneling large
contributions to the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Chung and Parish saw each other occasionally in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Chung testified that Parish approved visas for 25 to 30 of his
business associates. Chung also testified that Parish requested
some favors, including asking him to hire a computer tutor for an
embassy secretary. Chung said he complied with the request. &QL;

ARIZONA TAKES BIG STEP, SETS UP GROWTH BOUNDARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CATHERINE REAGOR  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Phoenix has drawn its first line in the sand to slow growth.
</P>
<P>
   In the Valley's far northern desert, the city has set up a
version of an urban growth boundary in a &UR; housing hot spot along
Interstate 17.
</P>
<P>
   Masked under the name ``infrastructure limit line,'' the
boundary surrounds a fast-growing, 14-square-mile urban core along
the Black Canyon Freeway north of Central Arizona Project Canal
that could be home to 150,000 people by 2020.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The line limits how far the city will build streets and sewer
lines without special approval from the Phoenix Planning Commission
and City Council. Any development outside the line will have to pay
for its own streets and sewers or seek aid from the city through
public hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, developers pay for some infrastructure costs.
</P>
<P>
   The goals are to steer growth to the central core along I-17
instead of letting it sprout in all directions and to ensure that
residential growth is accompanied by commercial construction and
new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Club, which has been pushing for urban growth
boundaries, considers the line a step in the right direction to
curb the Valley's sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   Developers in the area also consider it an effective way to
provide a focus for population growth.
</P>
<P>
   It definitely doesn't go as far as Portland, Ore.'s well-known
growth boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the same as an urban growth boundary without the hard
lines,'' Phoenix planner Dave Richert said, meaning that the lines
can be broadened later if the core is heavily developed.
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenix City Council approved the line around the North
Black Canyon Corridor on July 7.
</P>
<P>
   The infrastructure boundary stretches north along I-17, the
western edge, past the Carefree Highway and east as far as Seventh
Avenue. It drops as far south as the CAP Canal.
</P>
<P>
   If after 10 years the city wants to extend the line, the plan
can be amended. But until then, any development outside the
perimeter that wants assistance from the city must go to the people
and then the City Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely a step in the right direction, and probably as
good as it can get for city planning,'' said Sierra Club activist
Chris Gehlker of northwest Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he questions why Phoenix didn't try to put up a growth
boundary in the Deer Valley &UR; area before growth spreads in all
directions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city should clean up one mess before they move on to play
with a new toy,'' Gehlker said.
</P>
<P>
   Deer Valley is several miles south of the core of the North
Black Canyon Corridor.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the North Black Canyon area's recent planning is due to
Anthem, a huge new Del Webb community near New River, which started
a stampede of home buyers in the Valley's far north.
</P>
<P>
   Anthem is in an unincorporated part of Maricopa County north of
Phoenix. As many as 50,000 people could live in the 5,800-acre
community when it's completed in the next five to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The growth-limiting line ends a few miles south of Anthem.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Nearby, developers are filling in the Phoenix corridor with
three big housing projects. Tramonto, Sonoran Foothills and
Dynamite Mountain Ranch, with a total of about 3,000 acres and at
least 6,000 houses, are all planned within the boundary.
</P>
<P>
   The developers of the three projects will pay almost $20 million
for their share of the area's infrastructure development and impact
fees, which covers part of the infrastructures cost. The city is
paying the rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are winners and losers with the line,'' said John
Graham, president of Sunbelt Holdings, which is developing Sonoran
Foothills. ``Our community falls within its boundaries, but we are
still putting up a lot of money to build there.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; He said the infrastructure line has a lot of merit because it
will help build a core for the area, but he wouldn't want to repeat
the three-year process that it took for it to be put in place.
</P>
<P>
   Valley Partnership, a lobbying group for builders, backs
Phoenix's first version of the growth boundary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Urban growth boundaries such as this one are a planning tool
that can be used as necessary to help focus growth,'' said Maeve
Johnson, executive director of the trade group.
</P>
<P>
   The urban growth boundary is the centerpiece of Portland's
strong regional and preservation-minded plans.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 years ago, hundreds of Oregon cities drew imaginary
lines inside of which urban development would be permitted to take
place and outside of which it wouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Club is proposing something similar for Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   To counter that measure, which they say would put a halt to
Phoenix's growth and stymie its economy, developers and other
business interests backed the Growing Smarter Plan. It passed in
November.
</P>
<P>
   The act requires communities to adopt general plans every 10
years with plans for efficient transportation and well-timed
expansion of sewers, streets and other infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   Developers must also pay their fair share of the cost of new
services for the their projects, but not the entire cost.
</P>
<P>
   The infrastructure limit line is part of a North Black Canyon
General Plan amendment quietly approved a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is for the 43,000-acre area, dubbed the North Black
Canyon Corridor that straddles I-17 and runs roughly from the CAP
Canal to the city's northern limits.
</P>
<P>
   The corridor is mostly raw desert that could be transformed into
several big communities with thousands of new houses. Another few
thousand acres to the east is also targeted by the city to become
preserve space.
</P>
<P>
   The North Black Canyon Corridor is one area in Phoenix that is
expected to experience huge growth, according to city planners.
</P>
<P>
   By 2020, at a 2 percent growth rate, almost 600,000 more people
will call Phoenix home. &QL;

DAVIS QUITS STATE FIGHT FOR PROP. 187
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY RICK ORLOV  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Gov. Gray Davis said Thursday the state will drop
its legal fight for Proposition 187, but supporters vowed to carry
on a court battle to enforce the initiative.
</P>
<P>
   The ballot measure, which won 60 percent of the vote in 1994,
was intended to limit public education, welfare and health services
to illegal immigrants. It became ensnared in legal battles and most
provisions never took effect.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who opposes the measure, contended that federal law
already covers most of the proposition's main provisions, such as
the denial of welfare and other benefits to illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not gutted 187,'' Davis said during a news conference
in Los Angeles. ``I would say to supporters of 187 that they should
declare victory and move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis' decision resulted from a mediation process to find a
solution to the legal fight. Under the agreement, the state will
withdraw its appeal of a federal court ruling that found much of
the measure unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have dissolved a divisive wedge issue in a way that is fair
to the voters, the Constitution and the law,'' the Democratic
governor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have avoided years of divisiveness and costly litigation.
It's estimated we spent over $5 million defending this to date and
would have spent a good deal more to move this case to the U.S.
Supreme Court.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is 187 struck down by this agreement? Yes. But it is
supplanted by federal laws that implement the same provisions as
187.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Proposition 187 said they expected Davis'
decision, since proponents of the measure were not included in the
mediation.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this case, only one side of the issue was represented --
the side of the opponents,'' said John Findley, principal attorney
for the Pacific Legal Foundation, a proponent of Proposition 187.
</P>
<P>
   The fight is not over, Findley said, adding: ``There are going
to be lawsuits.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, U.S. District Judge Mariana R. Pfaelzer ruled that
most of the initiative was unconstitutional, in part because it
entered the jurisdiction of the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Inheriting the push for Proposition 187 from his Republican
predecessor Pete Wilson, Davis asked the 9th District Court of
Appeals to appoint a mediator to help determine how to settle the
battle. Thursday's announcement came after Davis and
anti-Proposition 187 forces met for three months.
</P>
<P>
   Findley said the state's failure to press forward with the
appeal now clears the way for others to go to court to push for
enforcement of the measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will allow the issue to be re-litigated with genuine
parties willing to defend the initiative,'' Findley said.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Browne, another Pacific Legal Foundation attorney, also
questioned the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this does is leave Proposition 187 basically undefended
because the governor has made it clear he opposes the philosophy
behind Proposition 187,'' Browne said. ``I don't see how this was a
fair mediation.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis aides contended that the group was invited to participate
in mediation but walked out after the first meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said Proposition 187 supporters won on the major points on
which they had campaigned -- prohibiting public welfare, health and
higher education to illegal immigrants as well as a crackdown on
manufacture and possession of phony documents.
</P>
<P>
   What was changed is that the state will continue to provide
education from kindergarten through high school and will not be
required to report suspected illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   However, the state and local jurisdictions will continue to
report the immigration status of those convicted of crimes.
</P>
<P>
   If the settlement is accepted by the courts, Davis said he will
ask state agencies to begin implementing the procedures that have
been developed over the past five years to enact those portions of
the measure taking effect.
</P>
<P>
   Several months ago, Davis angered Latino leaders by his decision
to enter the mediation process, instead of dropping the state's
appeal of the federal court decision blocking Proposition 187's
implementation.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Davis said that ``What we have gained from this is
an agreement by the other side to accept the federal laws and allow
us to move on,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante, who had angrily denounced Davis, said
he saluted those involved in the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, an ugly chapter in the history of California politics
has come to an end,'' Bustamante said. ``Most of Proposition 187
was never constitutional. Now, it will never become the law of our
state.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Federal Judge Shirley Hufstedler, who represented Davis
in the discussions, defended Davis' decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to go through this long and difficult process,''
Hufstedler said. ``The governor deserves credit for this in
avoiding a lengthy and costly procedure. And, there is no guarantee
the Supreme Court would have accepted this.''
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa, D-Los Angeles, said the
main factor of the settlement is to end fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mothers and fathers will no longer have to worry about sending
their kids to school or getting emergency medical care,''
Villaraigosa said. ``This signals that the era of hate politics is
truly over and it's time to move into a new era of opportunity. We
must work together to improve our state and not allow ourselves to
be divided and distracted.''
</P>
<P>
   There also was an unintended benefit, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The measure so angered minority communities, particularly
Latinos, that it resulted in energizing political organizing.
</P>
<P>
   ``For that, we can thank Wilson,'' Villaraigosa said. Latino
voters are the largest group among new voters and they are playing
an increasingly significant role in state and local politics.

FOR EDMONDS, 1999 A SEASON TO FORGET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   RANCHO CUCAMONGA, Calif. _ If Jim Edmonds had his way, the
center fielder would be back in the Anaheim Angels' lineup tonight
when they start a three-game series against the Minnesota Twins at
Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   But the imminent return of Edmonds, likely to happen in a few
days, is too late to help the Angels make a run at the playoffs
even if it is sooner than many expected. He began a rehab
assignment at Single-A Lake Elsinore on Monday, the final step in
recovering from the April 22 surgery on his right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   He was expected to be out four months but should be back about
three weeks early because he will accept a limited role as the DH.
The Angels' medical staff is more concerned about Edmonds
reinjuring the shoulder playing defense, where he might run into a
wall or dive for a ball.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds, though, needs to be back in a major-league uniform,
even if the last two months have lost some meaning following a
season-destroying 11-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to play in as many games as I can,'' Edmonds said. ``.
. . to prove I can play, to prove my worth to this team. I want to
show I'm recovered and can play.''
</P>
<P>
   As much as he was planning to have a memorable year, it's turned
into one he'll never forget. Coming back strongly in the season's
final two months, he believes, also will show something to those
who doubted him, figuring he wouldn't make it back this season at
all. Edmonds hasn't forgotten what some of his teammates said
regarding his surgery.
</P>
<P>
   There were some players unhappy with Edmonds because they
believed he should have had surgery in the offseason instead of
waiting until the season began. They questioned his motives for the
timing of the surgery, suggesting maybe he didn't want to spend his
offseason rehabilitating the shoulder instead of enjoying his free
time on the Colorado River.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tremendous lack of knowledge to my situation, it was
an unprofessional reaction,'' Edmonds said. ``The guys on the team,
what they said . . . they had no idea what I was going through. If
I needed surgery in the winter, I wouldn't have hit .420 in spring
training.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Edmonds has had shoulder problems in the past, he says
the injury that required surgery occurred while lifting weights two
days before opening night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I was there. I could say, `I'm terrible,' or `I'm
having a bad year.' But I feel left out. Everybody has a bad year.
Every team, every player . . . just accept it and move ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite all that's happened, Edmonds wants to stay with the
Angels. The team is expected to pick up the $4.65 million option it
holds for next season. But that wouldn't prevent the Angels from
trading Edmonds sometime next year if they felt re-signing him
after the 2000 season would be difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely want to be here,'' Edmonds said. ``I have family
here, I have friends here. This is the organization I came up in. I
don't want to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's a business. They made me realize that in the last
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds, 29, figures he has his best years ahead of him. Just
where that will be is the big question.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't know and I don't care to worry about it right
now,'' he said. ``Whatever happens, happens. I'll be playing
somewhere. From this day on I'll do everything I can to better
myself every day.''

AIRTOUCH INTRODUCES ACCESS TO INTERNET VIA CELL PHONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RICHMAN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ AirTouch Cellular, a provider of digital phone
service, on Wednesday began offering direct Internet access from
computers through its cell phones at no extra charge in three
regions of the United States, including Western Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Claimed to be the first such service in this country, AirTouch's
Net Access also premiered in Detroit and in Salt Lake City, where
it underwent trials for two years before Wednesday's unveiling.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Seattle, one of the nation's most competitive cell phone
markets, none of the seven providers appears to offer a similar
service. Sprint PCS and US West said they plan to do so later this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Seybold, a telecommunications analyst in Boulder Creek,
Calif., said the service is ``an invaluable tool for many
professionals and business people who can't afford to wait to
access vital information.''
</P>
<P>
   Using Net Access requires a Qualcomm 860 cell phone, which
retails for about $149, and a $25 cable to connect the phone to a
computer's serial port. Most AirTouch customers don't already own
those phones, which came on the market only a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   Once physically connected, an AirTouch customer dials (pound
sign) 777 from the computer's dialer and is typically on the
Internet within five seconds, AirTouch said. That connection time
compares with the 35 or 40 seconds needed with dial-up modems.
There's no ring and no handshake, just a direct connection.
</P>
<P>
   The connection operates at a maximum rate of 14.4 kbps, about
one-third the speed of the 56-kbps modems found in most computers.
But one trial user found the speed difference wasn't pronounced or
annoying, especially with e-mail and other text.
</P>
<P>
   The direct Internet connection means customers can't check their
e-mail with a specific Internet service provider. To do that, they
can dial their ISP directly rather than using the (pound sign) 777
direct connection, though that entails a longer wait to connect.
</P>
<P>
   Net Access is an alternative to using older technology: A
specialized external modem connecting a computer to a cell phone.
Conventional PCMCIA cards and other internal modems can't be used
with cell phones, because they lack error-correction software, said
Bruce Cech, manager of AirTouch's wireless data applications.
</P>
<P>
   Special wireless modems usually sell for between $300 and $500,
and the top speed of the connections they make is generally 9.6
kbps, possibly hitting 11 kbps close to a cellular tower, Cech
said.
</P>
<P>
   Net Access took two years to engineer and test, the company
said. The most difficult task was integrating direct Internet
access into the cellular network. The technology underlying that
network _ called CDMA, for Code Division Multiple Access _ is
designed to work better with data than a competing technology
called TMDA (Time Division Multiple Access) used by AT&AMP;T Wireless
and other service providers.
</P>
<P>
   Though it won't cost customers extra, AirTouch anticipates Net
Access will increase its revenue stream, because customers
typically spend 12 minutes on a data call _ four times longer than
on a voice call, said spokeswoman Lisa Bowersock. AirTouch
typically charges customers between 10 cents and 25 cents per
minute, depending on volume.
</P>
<P>
   In a second phase of Net Access, scheduled to be in place by
year-end, the company plans to let customers use their handsets as
simplified Internet browsers, dispensing entirely with the
computer. A browser from Phone.com is already built into the
Qualcomm 860. A third phase will allow wireless transactions
online.
</P>
<P>
   Net Access will be rolled out to the entire AirTouch network,
which serves 9 million customers, by year-end.

SIMON MAHLATHINI NKABINDE, 62, ZULU SINGER
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ Simon Mahlathini Nkabinde, a singer
better known as the lead groaner of the Zulu music group Mahlathini
and the Mahotella Queens, died Thursday night, the national radio
network reported. He was 62.
</P>
<P>
   Few details were available, but Mahlathini had been sick for
some months and the group had not performed for about two years.
</P>
<P>
   The group, together from 1964 to 1997, was one of the most
enduring in South African music. Watching the Queens' combination
of jubilant harmonies and choreographed dances was, an American
critic said in 1996, like what he imagined a Zulu version of the
Supremes would have been two decades after they stopped fitting
into their silken gowns.
</P>
<P>
   Mahlathini, sometimes called the Lion of Soweto, wore a chief's
regalia on stage _ a leopard skin over his chest, fur armlets and
leggings, a skirt of animal tails and beads around his bald pate.
</P>
<P>
   Into his 50s, he could still leap and kick, and his ``goatlike
groaning'' was compared to the style of Howlin' Wolf. The Queens,
who provided a chirpy, cooing counterpoint, wore huge red circular
Zulu hats, skirts of leather and beadwork, leotards and sneakers.
</P>
<P>
   Mahlathini (pronounced mah-shla-TEEN-ey) and the Queens
popularized mbaqanga music, which was the post-jazz rage in black
townships in the 1960s. It faded, but was revived after Paul
Simon's 1986 ``Graceland'' album popularized South African music in
the West. Mbaqanga (pronounced mm-bah-KAHNG-guh, with the K formed
by popping the tongue off the roof of the mouth) is from a Zulu
word for steamed cornbread.
</P>
<P>
   It fused songs of several tribes and, by one description,
blended kwela, which began as jazz played on children's
pennywhistle flutes, with Zulu guitar, which was played on 5-gallon
oilcans with wires strung along wooden necks, and translated the
whole for brass and electric guitar. Like most South African dance
music, it is fast and almost relentlessly cheerful.
</P>
<P>
   The group, which toured 40 American cities in 1990 and played
with Stevie Wonder and Sting, had a hard beginning. West Nkosi, the
band's saxophonist and producer who died last year after a car
crash, said in 1990 that Mahlathini had gained attention in the
1950s as a young wedding singer. He worked with choruses up to 60
strong in a call-and-response style sometimes called
``isicathamiya'' or ``sneak attack'' for the way the gentle lead
vocal is answered by deep chords, often swooping up an octave or
breaking out in a birdlike ululation.
</P>
<P>
   When Mahlathini's teen-age voice deepened and Nkosi pulled the
group together, three women and electric instruments replaced the
chorus, but the style remained. It was so hard to get radio time
that they played outside record stores, asking listeners to buy
their albums.
</P>
<P>
   Their lyrics, mostly in Zulu, were serious, about bringing up
children or solving marital problems. They were not overtly
political like those of later defiant youngsters like Brenda
Fassie, but sometimes alluded to the miseries of apartheid,
recalled gospel melodies like ``We Shall Overcome'' and had some
lyrics that praised Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
   Nkosi expressed some disappointment that their audiences in
America were overwhelmingly white. Speaking of black Americans, he
said: ``We've given their music tremendous support in our country.
Never mind that they're American. It's about time they took a very
important step and started learning about their origins.''

EDITORIAL: SNEAKY SUMMER CHARTER CHANGES 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, July 30:
</P>
<P>
   August is not a good time to revamp New York City's government.
New Yorkers shut down in August. They go away. They focus on
sunblock and barbecue, like ordinary people. They are not available
to discuss whether Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and his successors need
more power or whether city elections should be nonpartisan or what
should happen if the mayor suddenly resigns to take another job,
like U.S. senator.
</P>
<P>
   A newly appointed Charter Revision Commission, dominated by the
mayor's admirers and staffed with the mayor's employees, is trying
to slip one under the city's summer radar. The commission issued a
report last week proposing 39 changes to the city charter. The
250-page document reads like Giuliani's political wish list. In it,
the City Council loses power on land use and budget issues. The
mayor gets a $50 million education fund. The Arts Commission
disappears. A commission for organized-crime control materializes.
The public advocate, a position now held by one of the mayor's
least favorite public officials, Mark Green, would lose a few
functions, including the power to preside over the City Council.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, such changes deserve the kind of vigorous
debate that New Yorkers do so well. But the schedule does not allow
for extended discourse. The commission will permit public comment
in August. By September, when New Yorkers are back at full speed,
the commission will already have picked the proposals it wants to
include on the November ballot. With no big-ticket, citywide races
on the menu, November's vote will barely make a news ripple, and a
small number of charter revision fans can make a huge difference.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials have suggested that the commission itself is a
political ploy. Last year the mayor set up a similar summertime
commission to create a minor change in the charter. The whole
charade was really a way of stopping another referendum on Yankee
stadium, since a charter referendum blocks any other referendum on
the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   But the charter package presented last week suggests that the
mayor's purpose is far grander this year. It is true that there are
some items among the 39 proposals that would actually help the
city, such as a requirement that city services be offered to all
residents regardless of citizenship. But the overall process looks
suspiciously like a surprise attack on the way the city is
governed.

EDITORIAL: REBUILDING THE BALKANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk)

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, July 30:
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's meeting with more than 30 other national
leaders in Sarajevo, Bosnia, on Friday offers a chance to get the
postwar reconstruction of southeastern Europe off to a sound start.
Billions of dollars have already been pledged to help rebuild
Kosovo and several neighboring countries. But a lot of this could
be wasted unless Washington, the European Union and the United
Nations show they have learned from their only partly successful
efforts in Bosnia. This time, more must be done to build new
locally based economic and political institutions so that
international relief can give way to long-term recovery.
</P>
<P>
   The Sarajevo meeting launches the Balkan Stability Pact, an
international relief and recovery plan intended to help the Balkan
region overcome its history of conflict and ethnic strife and speed
its integration into democratic Europe. The main beneficiaries will
be Kosovo, Albania, Macedonia and Montenegro, which like Kosovo is
formally part of Yugoslavia. Help will also be available for
Romania and Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
   So long as Slobodan Milosevic remains in power, most
international reconstruction aid will rightly bypass Yugoslavia.
The point is not to punish the Yugoslavs but to hasten Milosevic's
downfall. Once he is gone, building a more democratic and
prosperous Yugoslavia will help cement regional stability.
</P>
<P>
   Bosnia shows that it is best to avoid building big, overlapping
international bureaucracies that attract corruption and crowd out
local political and economic initiatives. Western intervention
brought desperately needed peace to Bosnia. But unemployment
remains devastatingly high, foreign investment minuscule and
politics dominated by ethnic nationalist parties.
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, international administrators need to make sure
moderates and independents get a fair chance to compete politically
with the activists of the Kosovo Liberation Army. The KLA has begun
forcibly taking over political institutions and businesses while
the U.N. administration is still getting organized. Once U.N.
officials take charge, they should set a reasonable target date for
local elections to begin the process of establishing
self-government. A degree of economic self-sufficiency can be
attained relatively quickly by assisting local farmers in getting
back on their feet. They need modern equipment and lower trade
barriers for their exports.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton helped to free Kosovo from brutal Serbian rule
and enable its refugees to return home. Now he must help
consolidate a wider Balkan peace.

COMMENTARY: THE NEW HUMAN RIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (CORRECTS Kathy to Kathie in 6th and 8th grafs)  (bl)  
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In this post-totalitarian world, the human rights debate needs
an update. While Americans are focusing on issues of free speech,
elections and the right to write an op-ed piece, people in the
developing world are increasingly focused on workers' rights, jobs,
the right to organize and the right to have decent working
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Quite simply, for many workers around the world, the oppression
of the unchecked commissars has been replaced by the oppression of
the unregulated capitalists, who move their manufacturing from
country to country, constantly in search of those who will work for
the lowest wages and lowest standards. To some, the Nike swoosh is
now as scary as the hammer and sickle.
</P>
<P>
   These workers need practical help from the West, not the usual
moral grandstanding. To address their needs, the human rights
community needs to retool in this post-Cold War world, every bit as
much as the old arms makers have had to learn how to make subway
cars and toasters instead of tanks.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Cold War,'' says Michael Posner, head of the Lawyers
Committee for Human Rights, ``the main issue was how do you hold
governments accountable when they violate laws and norms. Today the
emerging issue is how do you hold private companies accountable for
the treatment of their workers at a time when government control is
ebbing all over the world, or governments themselves are going into
business and can't be expected to play the watchdog or protection
role.''
</P>
<P>
   The impulse is to call for some global governing body to fix the
problem. But there is none and there will be none. The only answer
is for activists to learn how to use globalization to their
advantage _ to super-empower themselves _ so there can be global
governance, even without global government. They have to learn how
to compel companies to behave better by mobilizing consumers and
the Internet. I'm talking about a network solution for human
rights, and it's the future of social advocacy.
</P>
<P>
   Precisely such a solution is now being tested with the apparel
industry. For years, U.S. manufacturers have used their clout in
Congress to block any attempt to impose U.S. worker standards on
their factories abroad. Meanwhile, when these shirtmakers shift
production to Guatemala, there are no local standards that are
enforced there, and the International Labor Organization has no
clout. So you end up with no local or global enforcement, which was
highlighted in 1996 with the exposure of appalling working
conditions in a Honduran factory producing Kathie Lee Gifford
clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Out of that revelation a new coalition was born that will begin
operating shortly. Called the Fair Labor Association (FLA), it
brings together the Clinton administration, groups like the Lawyers
Committee, apparel makers and U.S. colleges. It will work like
this: The apparel companies and human rights groups have agreed on
a minimum standard for worker conditions in their factories,
including child labor and working hours. They also agreed on a
uniform system of monitoring that will involve independent external
monitors who are allowed to make surprise visits to factories. The
monitors will be accredited by the FLA and could range from church
groups to PriceWaterhouse. The FLA will issue an annual report on
each company's compliance, which will be broadcast on the Internet
and, it is hoped, published by Consumer Reports.
</P>
<P>
   If a company meets the standards, it will be allowed to attach a
special FLA label on its clothes, so, for the first time, consumers
will have credible information to differentiate between brands, to
buy those that support worker rights and shun those that don't.
(Nike, Reebok, Adidas, Kathie Lee, L.L. Bean, Levi Strauss, Liz
Claiborne, Phillips Van Heusen, Patagonia and Nicole Miller are
participating. The Gap, Tommy Hilfiger, Ralph Lauren, The Limited,
Champion and Russell are not.)
</P>
<P>
   The hope is that every college bookstore and major retailer that
sells sneakers, T-shirts and sweatshirts will insist on selling
only FLA-labeled products. No one says this program is going to
revolutionize worker conditions overnight. It will set a minimum
baseline, though. And if it works, it can be a model for how to
deploy the power of networks and the Internet to make every
consumer a potential human rights enforcer and to deprive global
corporations of anywhere to hide. If it works, it can also make a
real difference in the real lives of real workers.

COMMUNITY HAS LITTLE TO LOSE IN APPROVING RICHARDS-GEBAUR
PROPOSAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- The main weapon in the arsenal of those
opposing the plan to transform Richards-Gebaur Memorial Airport
into a truck-rail freight-transfer hub proves that right doesn't
necessarily make might.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents say the proposal involves undeserved corporate welfare
for Kansas City Southern Railway, which they say will be getting
the benefit of a valuable economic resource on the cheap. Because I
have never been a big fan of public-private development
initiatives, they'll get no argument from me. The view here is that
these ventures are driven by natural inclination of business
managers to socialize losses and privatize profits.
</P>
<P>
   However, after nearly a quarter of a century of attempting to be
the taxpayer's advocate in these matters, the view here is also
that the corporate-welfare rap is no longer relevant to the debate.
It hasn't been for a long time, because society has accepted
public-private ventures as a beneficial way for communities to
further their economic interests.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, the citizenry may have intuited what's in its
best interests better than the pundits and activists who have a
problem with conscripting taxpayers to bear burdens that rightfully
belong to those to whom the profits will flow. These deals have
become standard procedure, and very little gets done nowadays
without some form of public subsidy to enhance the potential
investment return of private interests.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, what has happened? The economy has been booming,
nationally and locally. That's what.
</P>
<P>
   Not too long ago the Kansas City area was known for its plodding
economy that never soared too high during booms, but never fell too
far during recessions. During what has been an almost nonstop
national economic expansion since the early '80s, however, Kansas
City has had a much more vibrant economy than it did a generation
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Is this happy development due to the proliferation of
public-private economic cooperation? Hard to say, but one thing is
certain. These partnerships certainly haven't hurt the area's
growth curve.
</P>
<P>
   While proponents hail the Richards-Gebaur project as a source of
future dynamism and opponents pooh-pooh such claims, nobody will
know for 10 to 20 years how this venture will turn out.
</P>
<P>
   What we do know in the here and now is that the airport appears
to be an underused resource. A local company says it can put this
resource to more productive use. Opponents decry the prospective
loss of its use as an airport, but if that were its optimum
economic role it would have been developed in that direction long
before now.
</P>
<P>
   What we have is a major company that sees long-term potential
and is willing to make a significant bet on its vision for the
property, if only it can get a little help from its friends in the
public sector.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of any other substantive offer to put this
resource to better use for such a long period, it makes sense for
Kansas Citians to take a flier on Kansas City Southern's
willingness to try to create a good deal more economic value than
currently exists at Richards-Gebaur.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, judging from what's now in place, the community has
little to lose and potentially much to gain from approving
Richards-Gebaur's transformation.

AS THE TEMPERATURE RISES SO DO TEMPERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALAN BAVLEY  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Feeling kind of grumpy? Slamming doors?
Using language that would make a sailor blush?
</P>
<P>
   Go on, blame it on the weather.
</P>
<P>
   The kind of heat that's been pounding the Kansas City area can
turn tempers nasty, psychologists say.
</P>
<P>
   Hot weather can boost the rate of violent crime, they say. But
the heat can also cause pitchers to throw more beanballs, spur
drivers to lean on their horns longer, and boost college students'
support for capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The simplest explanation is people get more irritable and that
leads them to behave more aggressively in many ways,'' said Craig
Anderson, an Iowa State University psychologist and heat
researcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``And there's reason to assume the stress accumulates over time.
Day after day of heat, you become more irritable.''
</P>
<P>
   The hot weather has been putting some Kansas City residents on
edge.
</P>
<P>
   Since last week, visits to Western Missouri Mental Health
Center's emergency room appear to be running at record levels, said
psychiatrist Cristina Payton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Always there is someone waiting to be seen,'' she said.
``People are more irritable. They get frustrated and they
immediately go off. I'm thinking it's the heat.''
</P>
<P>
   Although some patients are coming in just because the mental
health center is air conditioned, many others are being brought
involuntarily by police, Payton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have fights on the street, in the family,'' she said.
``They come with homicidal complaints, suicidal complaints.''
</P>
<P>
   The most serious social effect of the heat is an increase in
violent crime, Anderson said. Warmer regions of the United States
tend to have higher violent crime rates than cooler ones. And crime
rates in the United States tend to be higher in hotter years.
</P>
<P>
   So far, though, Kansas City appears to have been spared.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City police said Thursday that domestic violence, robbery
and homicide actually were all down during the last couple of
weeks, compared with an average week.
</P>
<P>
   But there are plenty of ways heat can stir aggression that fall
far short of criminal violence:
</P>
<P>
   - University of Michigan researchers found that the higher the
temperature, the more likely major league baseball pitchers were to
throw balls that hit batters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pitcher-batter duel is one of guarding territory,''
Anderson said. ``If you as a pitcher are defending your territory
more aggressively, you're going to hit the batter more often.''
</P>
<P>
   - While researchers haven't linked high temperatures to road
rage yet, there is evidence that heat can ignite drivers' tempers.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers in Phoenix conducted a fiendish experiment in which
they had a driver stop at a traffic light and stay there after the
light turned green. From the side of the road, they observed how
often and how long the driver in the vehicle immediately behind the
experimenters' car honked his horn.
</P>
<P>
   They found that the higher the temperature, the more often
drivers honked and the longer they leaned on their horns. This
vehicular aggression was only present among drivers unfortunate
enough to be in cars that weren't air-conditioned.
</P>
<P>
   - Even people who don't act aggressively in the heat may turn
punitive as the temperature rises.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson put matched groups of college students into rooms with
the thermostat set in the comfortable mid-70-degree range and in
the verging-on-miserable mid-80s range. He had both groups fill out
questionnaires.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the group left to boil were far more likely to answer
in favor of the use of violence, such as beating a disobedient
child, or executing a criminal.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something we didn't expect to show up. Attitudes are
thought of as something stable,'' Anderson said. ``But heat has an
effect on what you consider an appropriate reaction to
provocation.''
