<HEADLINE> S. Africa Beats Cameroon 3-0 In Nations Cup Opener </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Young South African
soccer players made a dream start to beat twice champions
Cameroon 3-0 in the opening match the African Nations Cup soccer
tournament held here today.
</P>
<P>
The crowd of 80,000 hailed "Bafana Bafana", local dialect
meaning "young boys, young boys", as they struck the biggest
winning margin for johannesburg in 34 internationals since their
return from sporting isolation in 1992.
</P>
<P>
It was also the first time the African continent's premier
soccer event has been staged in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The victory was another big gain for the South African sports
following its winning of the Rugby World Cup which it hosted in
May and June last year.
</P>
<P>
The South African boys were in high mood from the very start
of their fight with Cameroon's "unbeatable lions" with the
enthusiastic support of the audience.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, it was evident that Cameroon, with several
international stars, were just unprepared to take on the South
African powerhouse in their own backyard.
</P>
<P>
The goals were scored by Philemon Masinga (14th minute), Mark
Williams (37th minute) and John Mashoeu (54th minute).
</P>
<P>
President Nelson Mandela presented his strongest support to
his boys with attendance throughout the match.
</P>
<P>
"The countdown is over. For the next three weeks soccer
nations in Africa will bless our young democracy with the best
display of skills this continent can offer," said Mandela in
opening the games.
</P>
<P>
Mandela also said the decision of the Confederation of African
Football (CAF) to make South Africa hosts of the 20th African
Nations Cup, was "the best gift".
</P>
<P>
Among those dignities who attended the opening match were Joao
Havelange, President of the International Football Federation
(FIFA); Issa Hayatou, President of the CAF; and Solomon Morewa,
President of the South African Football Association.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia's Investment Code
would soon be amended after four years of implementation, a
spokesman of the Investment Office said here today.
</P>
<P>
Tadesse Haile said amendments would be applied to the tax
codes, banking procedures and other laws related to investment.
</P>
<P>
He said although a total of 2,084 projects worth two billion
U.S. dollars had been licensed during the last four years, the
code still found many licensed investors failing to launch their
projects due to the flaws of the investment law.
</P>
<P>
This called for an urgent amendment of the code, said the
official.

<P>
HONG KONG, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's world champion
Susi Susanti set up a show-down with China's world number one Ye
Zhaoying in the women's singles final after their semi-final
victories at the Chinese Taipei Open badminton tournament in
Taipei today.
</P>
<P>
And in the men's singles, it was China's Dong Jiong who stole
the show, beating hot-favored top seed Allan Budikusuma from
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Susanti, second-seeded for the Teipei event, put off a fierce
challenge by up-and-coming Chinese Wang Chen, who upset the
Indonesian ace 12-10 in the first set.
</P>
<P>
But an experienced Susanti came back strongly in the second,
beating Wang 11-4, and she continued the steady advance in the
third which she won over her less fit opponent 11-7.
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Ye won two straight sets over teammate Han Jingna,
11-3, 11-0.
</P>
<P>
in the men's semi-finals, Budikusuma won the opening set 15-12,
but his luck did not last long as an aggressive Dong ran over him
in the second, 15-13.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese seemed to climb into his top form in the final set,
when he beat his opponent 15-4.
</P>
<P>
This was Dong's first ever win over the 29-year-old Indonesian
veteran, who is seeking a career-ending triumph at this year's
Olympic Games in Atlanta. He has planned to retire after Atlanta
and marry his fiancee, world champion Susanti.
</P>
<P>
In the final tomorrow, Dong is to take on another Asian
veteran, Rasid Sidek of Malaysia, in the final tommorrow. Sidek
outplayed China's dare-devil Sun Jun 15-3, 3-15, 15-12 in the
semi-final today.
</P>
<P>
Sun won high worlds from the local media after he scored a
come-from-behind victory over Indonesia's Ardy Wiranata, ranked
fifth in the world, yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Other finalists were Liu Jianjun and Sun Man of China and Danes
R. Olsen and M. Sogaard for the mixed doubles, Ge Fei and Gu Jun
of China for the women's doubles, and Swedes P-G Jonsson and P.
Axelsson in the men's doubles.

<HEADLINE> Shuttle Astronauts Capture Japanese Satellite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Astronauts aboard U.S. space
shuttle Endeavour captured a four-ton Japanese science research
satellite early this morning.
</P>
<P>
The retrieval effort, on the third day of the year's first
shuttle mission that started on Thursday, was the first and the
key goal of the nine-day flight.
</P>
<P>
It was also the first time, as pronounced by the U.S. National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), a satellite launched
by one country was retrieved by another.
</P>
<P>
Performing the critical task of grabbing the craft, which was
launched into orbit in March 1995, was the six-man shuttle crew's
Japanese member Koichi Wakata.
</P>
<P>
While the first-time space flyer grabbed the octagonal
satellite with Endeavour's 15-meter robot arm, Commander Brian
Duffy steered the shuttle to coordinate.
</P>
<P>
The retrieval, nearly 480 kilometers above the ground, was an
hour and a half late because of the reusable science experiment
platform's solar panel was unable to retract.
</P>
<P>
Finally, ground controllers in Japan had to, as a contingency
measure, beam up remote commands to jettison the 10-meter arrays
that have been the satellite's power supply.
</P>
<P>
The satellite contains a variety of instruments including an
infrared telescope, furnaces for manufacturing ultra-pure
semiconductor crystals and a sensor for atomic particles.
</P>
<P>
The satellite, together with experiments, will be brought home
in the cargo bay of Endeavour, which will land at Kennedy Space
Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida, on January 20.
</P>
<P>
In the next few days, astronauts will release and retrieve an
American satellite, and conduct two spacewalks to test equipment
to be used in the assembly of an international space station.

<HEADLINE> Hamas Accuses PA of Involvement in Ayyash's Killing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The Islamic Resistance
Movement (Hamas) issued a statement today accusing the
Palestinian Authority (PA) senior police officers of assisting
Israeli intelligence in killing Yihye Ayyash, a leading Hamas
activist.
</P>
<P>
The statement claimed that they have information indicating
that in advance of the killing, PA officials had located Ayyash
and informed Israel.
</P>
<P>
It was unfortunate, the statement said, that the incident came
after a series of talks held by Hamas with PA.
</P>
<P>
Hamas called on people to boycott the Palestinian Council
elections next week and vowed to continue the path of armed
struggle against Israel.
</P>
<P>
In Ramallah today, a huge mass rally was held in memory of
Ayyash and to demand the release of all Palestinian security
prisoners Israel is still holding in its jails.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli military authorities declared Ramallah a "closed
military zone" until 5:00 p.m. but was again extended until
further notice.
</P>
<P>
Some 10,000 Hamas activists gathered in the Gaza Stadium
Friday to mark one-week of Ayyash's death. Speakers vowed to
avenge his killing by killing Israelis.
</P>
<P>
According to an Israel Radio report, Israeli security sources
today warned that Hamas and Islamic Jihad are attempting to carry
out suicide attacks ahead of the forthcoming Palestinian
elections.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that as a matter of fact the Islamic groups
had already done so. In the Gaza Strip Friday, they said, two
Israeli border policemen were wounded by an explosion of a
roadside charge while in another incident, a large explosive
device was detonated near the Jewish Nezarim Settlement.

<HEADLINE> US Testing Hi-Tech Planes in Bosnia: UK Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The United States is using the
NATO operation in Bosnia to continue testing a high-altitude
surveillance aircraft, the Independent newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Joint Surveillance Target and Attack Radar System (JSTARS),
which produced spectacular radar images of battlefields during the
Gulf War, will be used to monitor the withdrawal of troops from
areas to be handed over under the Dayton peace accord.
</P>
<P>
The Americans are planning to make an ultimate test of the
JSTARS planes over the much more difficult landscape of Bosnia,
with its steep valleys, mountains and forest.
</P>
<P>
The new system can look out to a range of 200 nautical miles,
so it can stay outside the range of surface-to-air missiles.
</P>
<P>
It even has a memory to keep track of strings of vehicles and
wait for them to reappear out of a valley or from behind a
mountain.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that two of the E-8 JSTARS aircraft has left the
testing grounds in Florida for Bosnia earlier last month.
</P>
<P>
The report pointed out that another motive behind the use of
the new planes in Bosnia was to achieve a commercial advantage, as
the U.S. has been trying to sell JSTARS to NATO over the past few
year.
</P>
<P>
The other alternatives are a British ASTOR (Airborne Stand-Off
Radar), the French Horizon and the Italian Creson, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
But the JSTARS and ASTOR are the only systems capable or
monitoring an entire theatre of operations, it added.

SHANGHAI, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Two men from a Shanghai
cosmetics company have been taken into custody on a charge of
illegally detaining the company's products quality inspector,
according to the Changning District Procuratorate of the city.
</P>
<P>
On the night of December 19, three men from the company, OLC,
including the two in custody, broke into the inspector Tang
Shangxian's house, took him to a neighboring room and beat him up,
accusing him of having damaged the interests and reputation of OLC
by reporting quality problems with its products.
</P>
<P>
Subsequently, Tang was seriously injured, with wounds in chest,
waist and back, according to doctor's records.
</P>
<P>
the district procuratorate is investigating the case.
</P>
<P>
After the incident, Tang received a lot of phone calls from
local residents, who expressed sympathy with him and voiced their
concern over the event.
</P>
<P>
According to a local source, the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of
Technology Supervision (SMBTS) conducted a regular quality
inspection of the cosmetics products on local markets last
October. In early December, the SMBTS sent a certificate to the
OLC, disqualifying OLC products.
</P>
<P>
The local source said that Tang has always been strict with his
work. Even before the incident happened, he had found out a lot of
quality problems with the company's cosmetics products. He has
repeatedly disputed with the leaders of OLC in trying to prevent
substandard cosmetics products from being put into markets.

<HEADLINE> Agreement on Resuming Syrian-Israeli Peace Talks a Step Forward </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Syria and Israel have agreed
to hold a new round of peace talks in the U.S. on January 24 is a
step forward on this track of peace talks in a bid to defuse the
tension in the Middle East which lasted for about half a century.
</P>
<P>
Syria also agreed that a military expert from each side would
join the talks to help discuss matters related to security
arrangements.
</P>
<P>
This was announced followed Friday's talks between Syrian
President Hafez Al-Assad and U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher here.
</P>
<P>
Voicing relief at the agreement of resuming the peace talks on
Friday evening here, Christopher told reporters that peace between
Syria and Israel would be comprehensive.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources here noted that the coming Washington talks
between Syria and Israel would be conducted according to a new
scenario and mechanism as they will discuss all the aspects of
peace at one time in order to reach an integrated agenda of peace.
</P>
<P>
This will lead to the signing of a memorandum of understanding
between the two countries including all the subjects of peace and
normalization of relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum will also involve the Israeli withdrawal from
the Golan Heights and its timetable and the security arrangements
as well as the economic relations between the two countries and
the water resources, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The resumption of the peace talks between Syria and Israel,
according to the sources, does not mean that the two countries are
close to signing a peace treaty as there are many differences over
the final border lines and the security arrangements.
</P>
<P>
However, the resumption of the talks and the U.S. active role
would help the two sides overstep many obstacles and might lead to
a final settlement before the Israeli general elections for both
sides are seeking to make use of the current promising atmosphere.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Open More Single-Teacher Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The government of Indonesia
plans to expand the program of the single-teacher school to remote
villages to ensure that every child receives basic primary
education in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey report by the Ministry of Education and
Culture, more than 1.88 million children between seven and 12
years old did not attend school because of shortage of facilities
in remote areas.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has carried out several programs to solve this
problem. One of them is what is known as the "multi-grade teacher
schools" which was introduced last year in remote areas in six
provinces.
</P>
<P>
Under this program, one teacher manages the entire school,
acting as principal as well as teaching all six grades.
</P>
<P>
The ministry this year plans to expand the program to other
provinces in the country.
</P>
<P>
The government launched the compulsory education program
covering children between seven and 12 years old in 1984. In
1994, the program was extended to nine years, for children up to
15 years old.

<HEADLINE> U.S. President Arrives in Tuzla to Boost Troop Morale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, January 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
flew into Tuzla, the headquarters base of the American IFOR troops
in Bosnia, at around 1:00 p.m. today to boost the morale of his
soldiers, local reports said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was to arrive at 8:30 this morning but heavy fog in
Tuzla airport turned his C-17 cargo plane to Taszar, a gateway
equipment base in Hungary for the U.S. contingent in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Tuzla was under heavy security with police posted along the
road between the airport and the base at Tuzla town.
</P>
<P>
Also for security reason, Clinton would not show up in the
capital Sarajevo. Instead, Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic
went to meet his U.S. counterpart in Tuzla, a Muslim enclave in
northeastern Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The main objective of Clinton's 19-hour whirlwind mission to
the Balkan region was to boost the morale of his ground troops
with the NATO-led multinational Implementation Force (IFOR) in
Bosnia, a political gamble he put for his re-election campaign
that began early this year.
</P>
<P>
Washington has contributed 20,000 soldiers, or one third of the
IFOR troops, to Bosnia. More than half of them have already
arrived in this war-ravaged country.
</P>
<P>
But local observers say that during his trip, the president
also hopes to help mend the U.S.-brokered Muslim-Croat federation,
which has gone loose because of the recent conflict between the
Muslims and the Croats in Mostar, a divided city in southern
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is accompanied by John Shallkashvili, Chairman of the
U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, Madeleine Albright, U.S. Ambassador
the U.N. and Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. chief negotiator of the
Dayton peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
After visiting Tuzla, Clinton will go to Zagreb, Croatia to
meet with Croatian President Franjo Tudjman before flying home
early Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Cooperative Tap on China's Offshore Oil, Gas Fruitful (by Chang Kefei) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Cooperation with foreign oil
explorers has enabled China to tap its vast offshore petroleum and
gas resources over the past decade and more, a senior Chinese oil
industry official said here today.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang Yan, president of China National Offshore Oil
Corporation (CNOOC), China has discovered, in geological reserves,
1.2 billion tons of oil and 200 billion cubic meters of natural
gas over the past 13 years. Half of the reserves were found
through cooperation with foreign companies, and half were on
China's own strength, he added.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation in this field reached a climax when China's largest
offshore gas field, Yacheng 13-1 in South China Sea started to
supply natural gas to Hong Kong from January 1, which is a joint
work by CNOOC, Atlantic Richfield Company (ARCO) of the United
States and a Kuwait petroleum exploration company.
</P>
<P>
The gas field, 100 km south of Hainan Island, is expected to
pump 2.9 billion cubic meters of natural gas a year to the
territory through a 775-km long pipeline under the sea, and the
rest 0.5 billion to Hainan. Stable supply, predicted to exceed 20
years, will go to two power plants in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony to mark the start-up of the gas field here today,
Wang said that the clean energy will bring both economic and
environmental benefits to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Yacheng 13-1 field, which is able to produce 3.4 billion cubic
meters of natural gas a year, will boost China's offshore gas
output to a conservative estimate at 3.5 billion cubic meters in
1996, while the national total in 1995 stood at 400 million cubic
meters, according to Wang.
</P>
<P>
Currently, onshore gas output still constitutes the major part
of China's gas industry, making up 95.8 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
CNOOC, an exclusive explorer of offshore oil and gas in China,
has signed 109 contracts with 40 foreign companies from 14
countries since its founding in 1982, and 40 contracts are still
in effect. At present, the corporation owns 19 oil or gas fields,
either in production or under construction.
</P>
<P>
Apart from Yacheng 13-1 gas field, Wang cited a string of
cooperative projects with other world oil exploration companies,
which are proved to be very successful.
</P>
<P>
Also in South China Sea, China has joined hands with Japanese
cooperators in building the Lufeng 13-1 oil field, which has been
in production for two years with an annual output of 1.2 million
tons.
</P>
<P>
In cooperation with the ACT group made up of one Italian
company and two American ones, China explored four oil fields in
the Pearl River Mouth, near Guangdong, which generate four million
tons of oil a year.
</P>
<P>
Along China's long coastal line from north to south,
cooperative exploration is still in progress, added Wang.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the blueprint of offshore oil and gas industry in
the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000), Wang said that more
attention will be paid on cooperation on downstream projects. The
largest one is with Shell on oil refining plant, which is expected
to cost 5.4 billion US dollars.

<P>
BEIJING, January 13 (Xinhua) -- This, China's capital enjoyed a
remarkable economic growth in 1995 with its gross domestic product

increase of 15.6 percent over 1994.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of England has
announced a set of preventive measures to forestall a bank
collapse like that of the Barings Group in 1995, it is reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The bank said that it has tightened its supervisory practices
in line with the recommendations made by the Board of Banking
Supervision in its report on the collapse of Barings.
</P>
<P>
The bank revised its definition of "significant risks" which
helps identify potential problems within a bank.
</P>
<P>
Under the new definition, any business involving more than 5
percent of a bank's regulatory capital or generates more than 5
percent of gross revenues or profits is deemed to pose a
significant risk.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, alarm bells will ring at the Bank of England if it
is notified that any division within an authorized institution has
an exposure exceeding 10 percent of its capital to another
division.
</P>
<P>
The bank requires to be regularly informed by any businesses
which could become "significant". It also asks banks to designate
a senior director to take responsibility for statistical returns.
</P>
<P>
These new proposals will initially be introduced into around 30
major financial institutions. But the Bank of England intends to
incorporate the arrangements into the regular supervisory
framework as soon as possible.

LONDON, January 13 (Xinhua) -- A big proportion of people found
missing in the last three years have been professionally
frustrated middle-aged males, according to a study of the National
Missing Persons Helpline (NMPH).
</P>
<P>
Some 38 percent of the missing were aged between 31 and 50 and
25 percent between 19 and 30. The bulk of both groups were male,
the NMPH said after examining 3,500 cases reported between 1993
and 1995.
</P>
<P>
Middle-aged men went missing after they failed to cope with
financial or work pressures, the research said.
</P>
<P>
Unlike women, many men find it difficult to discuss
problems. When the strain becomes too much, they choose to leave
their homes. It is like an alternative to committing suicide, it
said.
</P>

As the British leading charity, NMPH advises men to share their
work problems and communicate their anxieties with their families

KUALA LUMPUR, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia said today that

Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad told reporters today

When asked if the relations he referred to meant diplomatic

not resolve its problems with the Palestinian Liberation
Organization (PLO) and Syria."
</P>

Currently, Malaysia has no formal relations with Israel. But

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Rushing Irrigation Projects to Boost Food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Philippine Department of Budget and Management (DBM) has
released some 200 million pesos (8 million US dollars)
congressional development fund for the government's small scale
irrigation projects in a bid to boost food security.
</P>
<P>
According to Agriculture Assistant Secretary Manuel Lantin, the
amount released by DBM during the first week of January
represented the net of the five percent mandatory reserves.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the development fund, the tobacco excise tax
amounting to 100 million pesos (4 million US dollars) also has
been released by the DBM directly to four import agricultural
provinces in the country -- Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur, Abra and La
Union.
</P>
<P>
Of the amount, 43 million pesos will go to various irrigation
projects as well as the repair of communal irrigation systems and
construction of small water impounding projects.
</P>
<P>
The remaining 57 million pesos was allocated to different
projects such as multi-purpose drying pavements, construction or
repair of public markets and farm-market roads.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Renato de villa, who is also chairman of the
National Disaster Coordinating Council, said that 7.5 million
pesos from 1996 calamity fund will be released to Maguindanao, the
major agricultural province in Mindanao for the repair of the
damaged communal irrigation system there.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the early rehabilitation of the communal
irrigation system will irrigate some 3,500 hectares of farmlands
for this coming planting season to boost crop production in the
area.
</P>
<P>
The expeditious release of the funds further boosted the
implementation of the food security plan, of which irrigation was
identified as one of the major components.
</P>
<P>
Experienced serious rice crisis in 1995, President Ramos has
decided to put food security on the top of his administration's
agenda for 1996 in a bid to prevent rice crisis coming again.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean government has
decided to hire 10,000 more foreign workers this year to ease the
manpower shortage facing small manufacturing companies.
</P>
<P>
The additional foreign workers will be allocated primarily to
firms with fewer than 50 employees, the Ministry of International
Trade and Industry said here today.
</P>
<P>
The request that the government allows more workers from other
Asian nations to enter the country in 1996 was raised by the Korea
Federation of Small Business (KFSB) recently.
</P>
<P>
KFSB was authorized by the government in 1993 to introduce,
distribute and manage alien workers under the "industrial trainee"
system, which allows them to work legally in small- and
medium-sized enterprises.
</P>
<P>
About 37,500 foreign workers, including 11,200 Chinese, 6,708
Vietnamese, 6,000 Filipinos and 4,116 Indonesians, had entered
South Korea by the end of last year.

LONDON, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Britain is to make a determined
effort to ensure that British businesses win a share of the
multi-billion-dollar reconstruction work in the former Yugoslavia,
local press reports said today.
</P>
<P>
As part of the effort, two high-ranking officials from the
Foreign Office and the Department of Trade and Industry will make
separate visits to former Yugoslav states in the next couple of
weeks.
</P>
<P>
The officials, to be accompanied by company executives, will
try to establish contacts with the authorities in those countries
responsible for awarding contracts.
</P>
<P>
They will also try to identify contract opportunities,
estimated by the World Bank to be worth five billion U.S. dollars
in Bosnia alone.
</P>
<P>
British companies believe that the United States and France are
already mounting strong campaigns to win work for their own
companies.
</P>
<P>
They are afraid that they could miss out in the same way as
they did in rebuilding Kuwait following the Gulf War, when
American companies took the lion's share of the work.
</P>
<P>
An international donors' conference last month agreed to
provide an interim aid of 500 million dollars to Bosnia to restore
basic services.
</P>
<P>
A second international conference, scheduled for March, will
seek commitments for the overall Bosnian reconstruction program.

BEIRUT, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Syria and Lebanon are currently
negotiating the possibility of holding Supreme Syrian-Lebanese
Council meeting to probe the Israeli-Arab peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The current negotiations also deal with issues related to the
council action and the implementation of the Syrian-Lebanese
fraternity, cooperation and coordination agreement, signed in 1991.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by a prominent Lebanese source, according
to the local daily Al-Diar today.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Al-Hariri will fly to Damascus
today to discuss with Syrian leaders the results of Friday's talks
between Syrian President Hafez Al-Assad and U.S. Secretary of
State Warren Christopher.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Israel have reportedly agreed on the resumption of
their peace talks on January 24 in Maryland near Washington.
</P>
<P>
Prominent military officers from both sides will be attending.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. administration intensified its efforts to push forward
the Middle East peace process with a view to reaching a
declaration of principles between Syria and Israel in March.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that unless such a declaration is reached in
spring, it will be difficult to reach it before the coming Israeli
general election slated for October.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese source said Lebanon has not changed its stand on
U.N. Resolution 425 which calls for Israeli withdrawal from south
Lebanon. The resolution must be unconditionally implemented, the
source said.
</P>
<P>
The reported Israeli proposals on the security arrangements in
south Lebanon every now and then are mere maneuvers to separate
the Syrian-Israeli track of peace talks from the Lebanese-Israeli
one, the source pointed out.

NEW DELHI, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Canadian Prime
Minister Jean Chretien today predicted that the two-day trade
between Canada and India should double over the next two years and
could quadruple in the next five years also.
</P>
<P>
Chretien, who arrived in India Tuesday for a five-day official
visit, made the remarks in his special address at a meeting of the
India-Canada Joint Business Council here.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the confidence that the signing of agreements to
the tune of 3.5 billion US dollars with India during his current
visit would translate into large scale employment opportunities in
India.
</P>
<P>
He said that bilateral business activities will be supported by
high-level visits both to and from India, as well as seminars,
workshops and other initiatives and called for enhancing bilateral
trade.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian prime minister, who led a galaxy of over 300
Canadian businessmen, said initially his country had focused its
attention on relations with Europe and the united states.
</P>
<P>
However, over the years, Canada has recognized the significance
of looking towards the Asia-pacific region, he said, adding that
the Canadian industrial houses were excited by the opportunities
in the region.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the Asia-pacific region has become Canada's
largest source of immigration and second largest trading partner
after the United States, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chretien will leave here today for Islamabad to continue his
Asian tour.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report On Kuala Lumpur Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The Kuala Lumpur stock
market ended the week on a firm note after foreign funds made
their return to the market.
</P>
<P>
The Composite Index rose 19.71 points to 1,061.77, the all
share Emas Index gained 9.13 points to 304.26 while the Industrial
Index surged 38.53 points to 1,925.77.
</P>
<P>
The Composite Index reached its highest of 1,062.90 Friday.
</P>
<P>
The most interesting feature in the market was its volume.
Except for Thursday, it traded more than half a billion shares for
the rest trading days with the heavies at 601.590 million shares
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The market was retail-driven and powered by second and lower
liners' buying after bluechips made their surge earlier," one
dealer said.
</P>
<P>
The retail players were attracted by the strong participation
of foreign funds from especially the United States and Japan which
found the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange to be an attractive
alternative in view of uncertainties in their own economies.
</P>
<P>
The main board turnover for the week was 2.644 billion shares
valued at 13.216 billion Malaysian Ringgit (about 5.2864 billion
US dollars) from last week's 964.239 million shares valued at
4.576 billion Ringgit (about 1.83 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The second board turnover stood at 629.432 million shares
valued at 4.710 billion Ringgit (about 1.884 billion dollars)
against 367.068 million shares valued at 2.830 billion Ringgit
(about 1.132 billion dollars) previously.
</P>
<P>
Off market deals amounted 128.204 million shares valued at
564.847 million Ringgit (about 225.93 million dollars) compared
with 71.285 million shares valued at 372.765 million Ringgit
(about 149.1 million dollars) last week.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report On Malaysia's Tin, Rubber Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The Kuala Lumpur Tin
Market (KLTM) ended the week higher, and the week's end saw prices
on the KLTM up by 19 sen to 15.92 Malaysian Ringgit (about 6.36 US
dollars) per kg from 15.73 Ringgit (about 6.29 dollars) last week.
</P>
<P>
Trading was rather active during the week, and trade volume
improved to 478 tons compared to 233 tons previously.
</P>
<P>
Strong interest throughout the week came mostly from locals and
European buyers, as well as the renewed interest from the Japanese
buyers.
</P>
<P>
The KLTM's price differential to London Metal Exchange recorded
a premium of 30 US dollars per ton from last week's 45 dollars.
</P>
<P>
But the Malaysian rubber prices ended the week lower despite a
higher close in the regional market.
</P>
<P>
February RSS1 fell 18.5 sen to 395.50 sen (about 1.58 dollars)
per kg from 414.00 sen (about 1.65 dollars) last week.
</P>
<P>
Dealers here said players were sidelined on lack of fresh
leads, adding that volatile overseas markets had dampened market
sentiment as players were reluctant to enter the market.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, prices went down below the 400-sen level on lower
sentiment from Tokyo and lack of support from local buyers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Malaysia's crude palm oil physicals kept losing
strength this week when they ended the week sharply lower.
</P>
<P>
The market opened lower Monday but technical factors helped the
palm oil market to rebound to 1,240 Malaysian Rinngit (about 496
dollars) per ton Tuesday and continued to increase to 1,265
Ringgit (about 506 dollars) on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But prices weakened on Thursday and Friday following weaker
sentiment in palm oil futures.
</P>
<P>
The price for January South dropped to 1,215 Ringgit (about 486
dollars) per ton from last week's 1,317 Ringgit (about 526
dollars).

<P>
HONG KONG, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Airport
Authority has signed an agreement with Asia Airfreight Terminal
Company Limited (AAT) to operate one of the two air cargo
terminals at Hong Kong's new airport at Check Lap Kok, a spokesman
for the Authority said here toaday.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, AAT will construct and develop an 800
million HK dollar (102.6 million US dollar) air freight terminal
which will be operational by April 1998.
</P>
<P>
The terminal will have a built-up area of 28,000 square meters
and an annual design capacity of over 400,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the initial term of the franchise will
be 20 years from April 1998 when the new airport opens.
</P>
<P>
He said prospects for the air cargo industry in Hong Kong are
bright. In 1995, cargo throughput at Kai Tak Airport is expected
to reach 1.35 million tons and the projected annual growth rate
for air cargo in Hong Kong for the next few years is expected to
be more than seven percent.
</P>
<P>
At the end of last year, the Authority signed the other of the
two franchise agreements for air cargo terminal services at Check
Lap Kok with Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals Limited.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Satellite Useful For Defense Purpose:  Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The Malaysia East Asia
Satellite (MEASAT-1) launched today would be invaluable for the
nation's defense and strategy planning, Defense Minister Syed
Hamid Albar told reporters here today.
</P>
<P>
MEASAT-1, the first Malaysian satellite, was multi-dimensional
and its usage would be in the interests of all, Syed Hamid said
after opening the 17th annual general meeting of the ministry's
civilian staff club.
</P>
<P>
The MEASAT-1 satellite, successfully launched this morning by
an Ariana rocket at 7:10 a.m. (Malaysian time) today, will enable
Malaysia to have up-to-date and accurate information on any
possible threat, the defense minister explained.
</P>
<P>
He said, from the defense viewpoint, information obtained from
the satellite would give the most accurate pictures which would
enable the country to plan its defense.
</P>
<P>
Syed Hamid said there was no need for Malaysia to launch a spy
satellite since MEASAT-1 could be used for civil as well as
defense and security purposes.
</P>
<P>
"This is not for hostile intentions against other countries but
to prepare for any possibility of outside threat," he added.

<HEADLINE> Traffic Fatalities in South Korea Increase in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The number of deaths resulting
from traffic accidents in South Korea increased last year for the
first time in three years, the National Police Administration
(NPA) said here today.
</P>
<P>
The traffic-related deaths in the country in 1995 amounted to
10,350, up 2.6 percent from the figure of 10,087 in 1994,
according to the NPA.
</P>
<P>
South Korea ranked number three country in the world in 1991 in
terms of deaths due to traffic accidents with 13,429, but as a
result of a massive traffic safety campaign, the number of traffic
fatalities was on a steady decline, putting down the country's
rank to ninth in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The nation's 1992 and 1993 figures of traffic fatalities were
11,640 and 10,402 respectively.
</P>
<P>
"We have been successful in reducing the number of traffic
accidents for three consecutive years starting 1992, but traffic
hell is liable to continue due to a rapid increase in the number
of automobiles and inadequate investment in reconstruction of
roads," a NPA official said.

<HEADLINE> Number of Israeli Fatalities Decreases Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The last quarter of 1995 saw
a dramatic drop in the number of Israelis killed in terror
attacks, according to a latest report issued by Peace Watch, a
non-partisan organization monitoring the peace agreement between
Israel and the PLO.
</P>
<P>
One Israeli -- policeman Muhmad Chuvari, who was fatally shot
in Kalkilya -- was killed in the last three months of 1995,
compared to 13 in the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
According to Peace Watch, 49 Israelis were killed in 1995,
with most of these recorded in the first three months of the
year. By comparison, 73 Israelis were killed in 1994, 65 in 1993,
40 in 1992 and 22 in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Fourteen Israelis were killed in the last six months of 1995,
the lowest number for any six-month period since the end of 1991.
</P>
<P>
However, the report pointed out that although only one fatality
was reported in the last quarter of 1995, "there were a number of
shooting attacks in the West Bank which resulted in non-fatal
casualties, as well as a pair of suicide-bombing attacks which
were thwarted in Gaza on December 2."
</P>
<P>
Peace Watch attributed the decline in fatalities to the
negotiations on expanding Palestinian autonomy in the West Bank,
which took place during this period, as well as the beginning of
the implementation of the Oslo 2 accord.
</P>
<P>
"It is reasonable to assume that the Palestinian organizations
involved in terror had an interest in acting in such a manner that
it would not be possible to blame their attacks for preventing the
expansion of autonomy," said the report.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, the report noted, the Palestinian Authority had a
strong motivation to prevent attacks to avoid delaying expansion
of its jurisdiction to cities and towns in the West Bank. It is
also possible that the Israeli policy of periodically closing off
the Palestinian territories, as well as allocating substantial
resources to preventing attacks, played a role in reducing
fatalities.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to Police Inspector-General Assaf Hefez,
crime in communities along the Green Line is down, due apparently
in part to the efforts of the Palestinian police.
</P>
<P>
Hefez specifically mentioned a drop in car thefts since
Palestinian police entered Kalkilya, near Kfar Sava, and other
Palestinian towns in the West Bank.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is holding talks with the
Myanmar government on the return of Myanmar refugees staying in
Thailand to their country.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR, required by Thailand recently, is trying to persuade
the Myanmar government to accept over 80,000 refugees when things
return to normal, local newspapers reported today.
</P>
<P>
The ceasefire in northern Myanmar and the surrender of opium
warlord Khun Sa indicated that the situation has improved,
Kachgadpai Burusphat, deputy secretary-general of the National
Security Council of Thailand, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has called for the Myanmar authorities to ensure the
safety of Karen refugees, as the Karens have not concluded a
ceasefire agreement with the Myanmar authorities, Kachgadpai said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that 74,984 Myanmar refugees had been living in 18
camps along the Thai-Myanmar border since 1984, with another
10,000 living outside the camps, building shelters in forests and
Thai villages.

<HEADLINE> Garment Export Growth Slows in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The growth in ready-made garment (RMG) exports, including
knit-wear exports, was 16 percent from January to September last
year, but the poor performance during October and November would
finally settle it at around 11 to 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
Redwan Ahmed, the BGMEA president, said that the port
congestion and the country's political unrest were mainly
responsible for the poor export performance.
</P>
<P>
He said the RMG exporters were currently working on measures to
dispose of the undelivered stocks to their buyers, mainly in the
United States and the EU countries.
</P>
<P>
"The industry paid a price for prolonged agitational activities
and poor port management," Redwan said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the shortfall, the overall export earnings of the
apparel sector in 1995 would exceed two billion US dollars
compared with 1.89 billion dollars in 1994, he added.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thailand Reaps a Lot From Rising Gem Exports (By Xiong Ping) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Thailand reaped a lot from its
booming diamond exports in 1995 with polished diamonds
overshadowing fine jewelry, while forecasting fierce competition
this year.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics from the Thai Commerce Ministry, the
country's diamond exports hit 15.14 billion baht (600 million US
dollars) in value during January-October of 1995, up 24.16 percent
from the same period of 1994.
</P>
<P>
The diamond export value for the whole year of 1995 would reach
18 billion baht (720 million dollars), up 28 percent from 1994, if
the momentum of the first ten months was maintained in November
and December.
</P>
<P>
Analysts with the ministry said the expansion was extremely
encouraging. They had predicted a growth rate at 20.97 percent
for 1995.
</P>
<P>
The export value of polished diamonds during January-October of
1995 amounted to 14.10 billion baht (564 million dollars), an
increase of 22.68 percent from the 12.19 billion baht (490 million
dollars) recorded during the same period in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The figure was even higher than the 14.03 billion baht (561
million dollars) for the whole of 1994.
</P>
<P>
The country's exports of polished diamonds grew faster than
those of fine jewelry during the January-October period, running
16.12 percent ahead in term of value. Fine jewelry exports were
worth 12.15 billion baht (490 million dollars) during the period.
</P>
<P>
However, the total market value of diamond exports to Belgium,
Thailand's traditional top market, dropped by 4.3 percent during
the first ten months of 1995, despite a 9.19 percent rise in
polished diamond exports compared with the same period of 1994.
</P>
<P>
Belgium's share of the Thailand's exports also dropped during
the period to 34.5 percent from 38.8 percent a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong, Thailand's second-largest market, increased its
market share during January-October period to 29.9 percent from
28.94 percent a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Thai polished diamond exports to Hong Kong were
valued at 4.22 billion baht (170 million dollars) during the first
ten months of 1995, up 26.72 percent from the same period of 1994.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Thai diamond traders said Thailand's market share
in the East Asia region, including Hong Kong, is facing increased
pressure from Israel. They predicted that competition between
Thailand and Israel would become fiercer this year.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Bangladesh's Elections May not Begin on Schedule (By Jiang Xianming) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Whether Bangladesh's general
elections slated for mid-February can start on schedule remains in
question, as the opposition and government are still far apart
over the issue of setting up a neutral caretaker government to
supervise the polls, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
Ever since march 1994 when the ruling Bangladesh Nationalist
Party (BNP) government was accused of "subtle rigging" in a
by-election, the opposition parties have launched one agitation
program after another to press their demand for Prime Minister
Begum Khaleda Zia's resignation to pave the way for holding the
polls under a neutral caretaker government.
</P>
<P>
As their demand has been rejected by the BNP and its
government, the mainstream opposition parties -- the Awami
(People's) League, the Jatiya (National) Party and the
Jamaat-E-Islami -- have boycotted the polling process and forced
the Election Commission (EC) to change the polls schedule for
several times.
</P>
<P>
Last December 3, the EC first announced a polling schedule for
January 18 after the dissolution of the duty-finished 5th
parliament. But the schedule was changed to February 7 to give
scope for the resolution of the political crisis.
</P>
<P>
With the opposition continuing to boycott the polling process,
the EC had to partially revise the schedule on January 3 by
shifting the last date for filling nomination papers from January
3 to 8. On January 8, it once again postponed the date of the
polls to February 15.
</P>
<P>
In response, the opposition dismissed the change of polling
schedules for a third time as a "farce", saying that the political
crisis could not be resolved by merely changing the election
schedule without addressing the main problem.
</P>
<P>
The opposition insists a change to the schedule is not enough
and that the government must adopt measures to ensure
participation of all political parties in the elections through
the resignation of the present cabinet and the establishment of a
neutral caretaker government.
</P>
<P>
The ruling party argues that the elections must be held by
February 21 in accordance with the constitution. But the
opposition wants them postponed until late March, saying that
normally no election is held during the holy month of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
The point at issue now is the nature of the proposed caretaker
government. The BNP has refused to accept the opposition proposal
that a chief adviser be set up under the country's president in an
interim government and enjoy executive power like the prime
minister. The ruling party favors instead an advisory council to
be headed by the president who enjoys executive power of the
government.
</P>
<P>
Observers here note that the chance is slim for the two sides
to change their stands, since the opposition has said time and
again they would not take part in the elections unless they are
held under a neutral caretaker administration. Under such a
circumstance, the ruling party will have no other way but to
postpone the polling date once again or begin the elections with
the participation of the political parties which exist in name
only, which would make the elections meaningless.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the opposition has clearly stated that it will not
be able to participate in the elections before late March even if
their demand was met, because political parties need more time to
prepare for the polls as there is only one month to go according
to the present polls schedule of February 15.
</P>
<P>
Sources from both the ruling party and the opposition have
indicated the two sides are likely to agree on a fresh
postponement of the elections to March if they can reach an
understanding on the issue of the interim government.
</P>
<P>
It is obvious that whatever stands the two sides might take
over their differences, the general elections are unlikely to be
held in a short period of time, the observers said.

<HEADLINE> Child-Murderer to Be "Executed Twice" in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 13 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian man will soon be
"executed twice" on charges of kidnapping, raping and killing a
five-year-old girl, a press report said here today.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court approved a lower court decision to execute
Mohammad Ali Bolboli Nogorabi for raping and killing a
five-year-old girl identified as Leila in an orchard near Karaj,
45 kilometers west of Tehran, on November 11, 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Persian daily Abrar reported that "because of the severity
of the crime and hurting the public morality and because of the
request by the victim's family he will face execution twice."
</P>
<P>
However, the daily did not elaborate on how the sentence would
be carried out.
</P>
<P>
Because of the severity of the crime, the Supreme Court dealt
with Nogorabi's appeal in a speed manner and issued its decree in
"less than a few days," it added.
</P>
<P>
A contractual employee of the Education Ministry, Nogorabi had
said during the preliminary investigation that he was drunk when
he committed the rape and murder.
</P>
<P>
According to a lower court decision, Nogorabi is fined 15,000
U.S. dollars as well.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court stated in its final ruling that "even if the
victim's family gave up their right of retribution, the defendant
would still have to face execution because of forceful rape."
</P>
<P>
The daily praised the Supreme Court for handling the case in a
speed manner and for being "uncompromising in confronting those
who violate the public morality."

<HEADLINE> Anti-Government Protest Wave Brews In Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 13 (Xinhua) -- After a lull in the
anti-government storm as a result of the assassination of late
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin last early November, Israel's
right-wing parties and groups are closing ranks and prepared to
launch a fresh round of anti-government campaign.
</P>
<P>
A huge mass rally with a decidedly anti-government tone is
scheduled to take place in Jerusalem. The new drive is being
planned against the backdrop of scheduled Palestinian Council
elections on January 20 and new rounds of Israeli-Syrian peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
banners with anti-government slogans, which disappeared from
high buildings and road junctions after Rabin's assassination, are
being put in place again at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Fliers were distributed, which read, "On January 20, on Shabbat
of all days, elections will take place for the Palestinian
Authority, Eastern Jerusalem residents will elect and be elected
to the Palestinian government.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign representatives and Palestinian representatives will
roam around Jerusalem to make sure that residents of sovereign
Jerusalem will be able to 'vote freely.' The city will be covered
in green, black and red flags, and pictures of Arafat will fly
high. This is how the Peres government preserves a united
Jerusalem."
</P>
<P>
The fliers then call on people to join a mass demonstration in
Jerusalem on the night of the elections. Jerusalem police
spokesman Shmuel Ben-Ruby said a permit would be given to the
right-wing groups to hold the demonstration. He added, however,
that "police will not allow any interference with the election
process."
</P>
<P>
Many pro-opposition Israelis have shied away from political
demonstrations in the past two months.
</P>
<P>
A rally that attracted 1,000 people was held near the exit
from Gilo on last December 25 to protest the withdrawal from
Bethlehem, but that was organized at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the month, a rally supporting the national religious
movement -- not specifically an anti-government protest -- was
held in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties apparently feel that they have to regain
momentum to win back the dwindling public support before the
Knesset elections on October 29.

<HEADLINE> Disabled Ugandans Reported With Poor Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Over 98 percent of disabled
Ugandans do not have formal education qualifications.
</P>
<P>
The Uganda National Association for the Deaf (UNAD) said today
Uganda is home to some two million disabled persons, who amount
to 10 percent of the country's population.
</P>
<P>
As many as 55 percent of the people with physical, mental or
sensory impairment have never attained any formal education,
according to the UNAD.
</P>
<P>
Only 33 percent of the disabled have been registered a level
of primary education, of which the majority are males, the UNAD
information added.
</P>
<P>
The UNAD indicated that disabled Ugandan women may suffer
double disadvantages judging from the fact that they constitute
only 10 percent of the disabled with formal education
qualifications.
</P>
<P>
Females are prone to disadvantages because of the nature of
the African culture which gives preference to males vis-a-vis
females, the UNAD said.

<HEADLINE> China's Sturgeon-breeding Technic Reaches Leading World Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, January 13 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese sturgeon-breeding
technic was considered to have reached advanced world level. So
far, large quantities of young Shi's sturgeons bred with the
technic have been released into northeast China's Heilongjiang
River.
</P>
<P>
The Shi's sturgeon or huso sturgeon is a rare species special
to the Heilongjiang River and has been in existence for 150
million years. It is delicious and its bones are edible. It can
reach several hundred kg in weight. Its seeds are dubbed "black
gold" on the international market.
</P>
<P>
Because of the long maturing circle of the sturgeon and
over-hauling, the sturgeon sources have been increasingly
drained. To change the situation, the Heilongjiang Farm
Administration spent 1.8 million yuan in 1988 in building China's
first Shi's sturgeon breeding and releasing station for the
research of the artificial breeding of sturgeons.
</P>
<P>
In 1989, the station started to actively involve itself in the
releasing of the sturgeons into the river. Some million sturgeons
have been released so far.

<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Oil income of the United

WASHINGTON -- U.S. President Bill Clinton Friday urged former
warring factions in Bosnia to join peace efforts of the
international community and bury their mutual hatred.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the people of Bosnia in a videotaped message for
broadcast within hours of his arrival in the country, Clinton said
that the United States will firmly support those who open their
arms for the peace and rebuilding in the region by deploying some
20,000 American ground troops there. Clinton said that the
U.S. troops' mission "is to supervise the withdrawal of your
armies behind the agreed separation line; to help assure that war
does not break out again; to create a more secure climate
throughout Bosnia so that you can rebuild your towns and roads,
your factories and shops, your parks and playgrounds."
</P>
<P>
Clinton, accompanied by his top national security advisers and
a small group of U.S. Congressmen, left for Bosnia after speaking
at a truck assembly plant in Nashville, Tenn, this afternoon. The
White House and the Pentagon have said that Clinton is mainly
going to see the U.S. peace implementation troops in Bosnia.
</P>

Bosnian Serb leadership to persuade Serbs to stay on in their
settlements in the suburbs around Sarajevo.

No one can change Bosnia's peace accord, said he, the
administration of the Serb-held areas around Sarajevo must be
handed over to the Moslem-led government in compliance with the
Dayton agreement, the NATO Secretary-General said. Solana made
the remarks on his first visit to the Bosnian capital in his
capacity as a NATO secretary general after holding talks with
Bosnia's President Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnian Croat leaders and
Bosnian Serb assembly president Momcilo Krajisnik.

building of trade unions in fast-growing rural and private firms,
which are drawing increasing rural labourers.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent call of ACFTU, all newly-established
overseas-funded enterprises should set up a trade union while all
the townships where rural enterprises are well-developed should
have their own trade union organizations.

<P>
WASHINGTON, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Heavy snow caused the
collapse of the roof of a supermarket in New York today, injuring
about 10 people.
</P>
<P>
Shoppers and employees at the Waldbaum's store in Long Island,
New York, tried to flee as the snow-covered roof popped and
buckled, filling the aisles with snow and debris.
</P>
<P>
"There was a big loud squeak, a squeal, and I just ran down as
the tiles popped," the Associated Press quoted Dan O'Neil, who was
waiting to go on duty as a cashier, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Nassau County police officers said few people were inside the
store at the time and the victims were taken to six hospitals.
But only one of the victims appeared to have been seriously
injured.
</P>
<P>
There had been several roof and ceiling collapses along the
East Coast since the Blizzard of 1996 dumped two to three feet of
snow on the region.
</P>
<P>
Also on Long Island, the roof of a Linens 'n Things store
crumbled under deep snow, causing one minor injury.
</P>
<P>
In New York City, the ceiling of Harlem's landmark St. Philips
Episcopal Church collapsed today, causing 1.5 million dollars in
damage inside the church, but no injuries.

VIENNA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The two ruling Austrian parties

<P>
Austrian Federal Chancellor and leader of the Social Democratic

The other partner, the People's Party, sent a seven-member team

</P>
<P>
Schuessel said before the meeting that he expected substantive
suggestions from the other side and a favorable outcome from the
talks.
</P>
<P>
According to local press reports, the talks would not be easy,
because the two parties differ over the 1996 budget and the
difference led to the breakup of the ruling coalition last
October, thus making it necessary to advance the general
election.

</P>
<P>
Since China started the drive of opening up and reform in the
late 1970s, some 78,000 people in Shanghai have gone to study
abroad, and 15,000 of them have returned to the city after
finishing their study.
</P>
<P>
Policies mapped out by the Shanghai government and related
units favor returned overseas students in different ways.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 higher education institutions and research
institutes, including Shanghai Jiaotong University, Fudan
University and Changzheng Hospital, have set up special research
funds for returned students.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, special apartments have been assigned to
students who have returned from abroad to work in the city.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has also laid down preferential policies for overseas
students to open businesses in Shanghai. The returned students
have so far set up a total of 140 businesses in Shanghai, ranging
from information to legal and other services.

<HEADLINE> No One Can Change Bosnia's Peace Accord, NATO Chief Warns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, January 12 (Xinhua) -- NATO chief Javier Solana
called on the Bosnian Serb leadership to persuade Serbs to stay on
in their settlements in the suburbs around Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
No one can change Bosnia's peace accord, said he, the
administration of the Serb-held areas around Sarajevo must be
handed over to the Moslem-led government in compliance with the
Dayton agreement, the NATO Secretary-General said.
</P>
<P>
Solana made the remarks on his first visit to the Bosnian
capital in his capacity as a NATO secretary general after holding
talks with Bosnia's President Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnian Croat
leaders and Bosnian Serb assembly president Momcilo Krajisnik.
</P>
<P>
The NATO chief told Krajisnik that deadlines for the handover
cannot be changed and that the Serbs should be told to stay.
</P>
<P>
According to the peace accord signed last month in Paris,
several deadlines have been set in the process of transferring the
administration of Serb-held areas of Sarajevo to the Moslem
government.
</P>
<P>
The first of the crucial deadlines is January 19, when all
Bosnian Serb armed forces must pull out of the areas concerned.
Later, on March 19 all these areas will be handed over to the
Moslem-led government.
</P>
<P>
With one week to go to the first deadline, U.N. and
international aid officials have reported that several hundred
Serbs had burned their houses and moved out of the Serb held areas
of Sarajevo over the past few weeks. More Serbs are preparing to
leave for fear of revenge by the Moslems, they said.
</P>
<P>
Solana urged the Moslem-led government to grant amnesty to all
Serbs, except those charged with war crimes, in order to encourage
the Serbs to stay in their homes.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian government has come under international pressure
to reassure Serbs they will not be victimized for wartime acts
and will have their rights respected.
</P>
<P>
Some NATO officials have privately cast doubts about the
government's commitment to persuading the Serbs to stay, arguing
the government wants them to leave so it can give homes to the
thousands of refugees on its territory.
</P>
<P>
Javier Solana later flew on to Belgrade, the last leg of his
tour of the former Yugoslavia.

<P>
BUCHAREST, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Thirteen people have died of
pneumonia caused by influenza that has attacked more than 90,000
people across Romania this year.
</P>
<P>
The number of people afflicted with flu across the country has
increased rapidly and on Friday alone more than 10,000 were
affected.
</P>
<P>
An average of 1,200 people were rushed to hospitals by
ambulances every day, half of whom were knocked down by flu.
</P>
<P>
Romanian medical departments said the current influenza is
mainly caused by type-B virus. The highly infectious type-A virus
that brought a cold to many people in Russia and other countries
has been found in only one patient in Romania.
</P>
<P>
The spreading flu was partly attributed to the abnormal weather
conditions since winter set in. It was hard for many Romanians to
get used to the big differences in temperature.

<P>
Romania's Ministry of Health has taken some measures trying to

<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Albanian President Sali Berisha
said Friday that he hopes his coming visit to China will greatly
enhance relations between the two countries in all fields.
</P>
<P>
Berisha, who is to visit China between January 16 and 19, said
in an interview with Xinhua that he hopes his visit will be
conducive to bilateral dialogues between Albania and China on
international issues of mutual concern and help promote China's
investment in Albania.
</P>
<P>
The 51-year-old Albanian president said he believes that his
country is an attractive place for Chinese investors given
Albania's geographical position and its traditional relationship
with China.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the situation in Albania, Berisha said the
economic and political situation in his country has changed
dramatically as compared with four years ago.
</P>
<P>
Albania has embarked on the path of strengthening market
economy and legal system, he said, adding that his country's
economy is growing at a double-digit speed and inflation is
controlled under 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the situation of the Balkan Peninsula, Berisha
said that the Bosnia Peace Accord signed in December has provided
a chance for peace and stability in the region, but many problems
remain, including the issue of Kosovo, a region bordering Albania
with 90 percent of its population being ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
He stated that Albania does not seek to change its border with
Yugoslavia, but demands that the rights of ethnic Albanians in
Yugoslavia be respected.

BELGRADE, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb parliament
speaker Momcilo Krajisnik appealed today to NATO Secretary-General
Javier Solana to extend the deadline for implementing the Dayton
peace accord.
</P>
<P>
NATO Commander-in-Chief George Joulwan was also present at the
meeting between Krajisnik and Solana in Sarajevo, according to the
Tanjug news agency.
</P>
<P>
Krajisnik said that to extend the deadline aims to find a way

the multi-ethnic city.
</P>
<P>
But Solana, on his first visit to Bosnia as the head of the
North Atlantic alliance, was opposed to a Serbian flight from
Sarajevo prior to the transfer of Serb-held areas to the
Moslem-Croat Federation.
</P>
<P>
The transfer is scheduled for January 19.
</P>
<P>
Tanjug quoted Krajisnik as telling High Representative to
Bosnia, Carl Bildt, Thursday that the Serbian exodus is to prove
that the peace accord was not successful.

<HEADLINE> Removal of Thai Deputy Finance Minister Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 13 (Xinhua) -- An adviser to the Thai Prime
Minister has urged that Deputy Finance Minister Newin Chidchob be
removed from his post to boost the government's image.
</P>
<P>
The adviser, Metha Ua-apinyakul, said, "The removal of some
ministers, such as Mr Newin, would improve the Government's image
and win back the public's faith."
</P>
<P>
Metha's recent remarks to reporters are surprising because both
he and Newin belong to the same faction, the Therd Thai faction,
of Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-archa's Chart Thai (Thai Nation)
party.
</P>
<P>
Newin's name has been linked to an 11.4 million baht (456,000
U.S. dollar) vote-buying scandal during the campaigning for the
July 2 general election of 1995.
</P>
<P>
It has been speculated that in a future government reshuffle,
which may take place before Parliament reconvenes in March, a
deputy foreign minister and a deputy labor and social welfare
minister will be added to the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
However, Metha said there should also be changes to the Finance
Ministry, because its minister, Surakiat Sathirathai, and its
deputy ministers, in particular Newin, were not acceptable to the
public.
</P>
<P>
Newin, who has been accused of buying votes in the last general
election but not been charged, was ranked the most unpopular
cabinet minister in recent opinion surveys.
</P>
<P>
Surakiat, who was a law adviser to Banharn before the general
election, has been criticized for being inexperienced and
unqualified for his post and blamed for nearly all the economic
blunders during the five months since the six-party coalition
government took office last July.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Warn of Waning Antarctic Ecosystem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Australian scientists warn
that a deteriorating marine ecosystem in the Antarctic and
sub-Antarctic regions foreshadows further natural disasters caused
by global warming.
</P>
<P>
Scientists at Macquarie Island near the Antarctic note that
elephant seals and penguins were starving off because of feed
shortage caused by shifting ocean currents and climate changes in
the region, today's Age newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
Meteorological records show that the average annual ocean
temperature near the island has increased to 5.4 degrees from 4.5
degrees in 1912.
</P>
<P>
Jeremy Smith, leader of Australian scientific teams on the
island, said that the annual temperature on Macquarie Island was
rising at twice the rate of the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
"Macquarie Island is a barometer, it's a measuring device for
large-scale global changes," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Global change is now a certainty," he said.
</P>
<P>
Higher ocean surface temperatures caused by the greenhouse
effect of the global atmosphere will alter the direction of ocean
currents. As a result, the number of plankton and fish will change
as the marine ecosystem is disrupted. Elephant seals and penguins
population are collapsing as their prey stocks are moving away
from the Antarctic waters.
</P>
<P>
Scientists on Macquarie Island found that the number of
elephant seals and rock hopper penguins has dropped by half in the
past few years. Similar things have happened on Heard Island,
5,400 km west of Macquarie Island. Worst still, the rock hopper
penguin population on Campbell Island near New Zealand has crashed
by 94 percent.
</P>
<P>
Cindy Hull, a zoologist at the University of Tasmania in
Australia, also found the unprecedented fact this week that 16
percent of eggs of rock hopper penguins on Macquarie Island were
infertile.
</P>
<P>
She said that this was an indication that female penguins were
not getting enough food during their foraging in the ocean. If
food continued to disappear from the ocean, bigger penguins might
also be affected, she said.

Scientists believe that the slightest hint of change at

</P>
<P>
A bulletin of the bureau said the two countries will cooperate
in manufacturing and launching satellites SPOT-5A and SPOT-5B
which the French government decided to develop in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was one of a series between France and Belgium on

signed an agreement in 1979 on the joint development and launch of
satellite SPOT-1, which was sent into space in 1986.
</P>

Since then the two countries and Sweden have manufactured
SPOT-2, SPOT-3 and SPOT-4, with the former two having been
launched and the last scheduled to be launched in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement signed Friday, Belgium will provide fund
for the parts it will manufacture, which is estimated at one
fourth of the total costs.
</P>
<P>
In return, Belgium will have the privilege in using the data of
the satellites.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Thai Banks to Cut Deposit Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Commercial banks in Thailand
plan to lower deposit interest rates, even though the move does
not comply with the Bank of Thailand's direction, according to
banking sources.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of 1996, the inflow of foreign funds has
created higher liquidity in the local money market, resulting in a
decrease in the inter-bank rate to 6-7 percent, from 14-15 percent
at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
This has forced commercial banks to consider lowering their
deposit interest rates, which will help them avoid shouldering a
high cost burden.
</P>
<P>
Foreign capital inflows have come faster than the Bank of
Thailand had expected. The central bank wants to maintain a high
interest rate to fight inflationary pressure, according to Dr
Olarn Chaipravat, chairman of the Thai Bankers' Association.
</P>
<P>
Although the Bank of Thailand has recently asked commercial
banks not to reduce their interest rates before the end of the
first quarter, the Thai Military Bank was the first bank to lower
its deposit interest rate by 0.25 percentage points on Wednesday,
while many other banks have been considering a reduction.
</P>
<P>
A reduction would encourage high liquidity in the stock market
as investors would shift their portfolios to Thailand, Dr Olarn
said.

SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Col. Norberto Pelaez,
National Penitentiary and Jail System Director, resigned today
after Jose Santacruz Londono, the no. 3 man in the Cali cartel,
escaped from the "La Picota" jail in this capital city.

<HEADLINE> Pork Reserves Help Stablize Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 13 (Xinhua) -- A two-tier pork reserve system
at both the central and local government levels is increasingly
contributing to containing price hikes and meeting daily needs of
the most-consumed meat in China.
</P>
<P>
According to China Business Daily, an organ of the Ministry of
Internal Trade, when the purchase price of pig fell in the first
half of the last year, making farmers difficult in selling their
pigs, the State reserve came to intervene by buying over 70,000
tons of pork from Sichuan, a major pork producer.
</P>
<P>
This effectively raised the price of pigs to the normal, thus
revitalizing farmers' enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
When the price of pork soared too quickly in the latter half of
the year, both the central and local reserves came to rescue again
by selling large amount of stocks, the daily newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
China's pork reserve system was initiated in 1980s but in the
beginning there was only reserves at central government level and
the stock was limited.
</P>
<P>
In order to help stablize the pork price, the State Council
urged in 1994 all provinces and major cities to set up reserves of
their own while expanding the reserves at the central level.
</P>
<P>
"With strong supports from the financial and banking sectors,
the two-tier reserve system is now operating well", the daily
quoted a ministry official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Now the State reserve mainly functions to meet the market needs
of Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai and other major cities.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the State reserve will focus the efforts on stocking
fresh pork while reducing the frozen meat, the daily
disclosed.

<HEADLINE> China's Car Demand to be Strong This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 13 (Xinhua) -- China's car demand is projected
at 400,000 units this year, a 27 percent rise over 1995, the
Economic Information Daily has reported recently.
</P>
<P>
The ratio of cars to the total demand for motor vehicles is
expected to rise to 26 percent this year, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
It attributed a rosy car market to busy economic activities and
strong demand for taxi cabs and private cars.
</P>
<P>
Car supply, on the other hand, will also experience a big
increase in 1996, it said, adding that the overall car price index
will stay stable or even go down slightly and competition on the
car market will become even more fierce.
</P>
<P>
Car supply will rise as leading car manufacturers in China such
as the Shanghai Volkswagen Automobile Corp. Ltd, the Tianjin
Automobile Industry Corp. and the No. 1 Motor Works and Volkswagen
Co. Ltd, have increased their production capacities considerably.

<HEADLINE> Experts in Yunnan Study Anti-Drug Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, January 13 (Xinhua) -- An institute to study how to
eradicate drug trafficking and abuse has been set up here and
local experts are studying the relation between drug eradication
and social development.
</P>
<P>
The institute, the Center for the Study of Drug Eradication and
Social Development, is attached to the Yunnan Provincial Society
for the Study of Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Professor Chen Lufan, director of the center said that his
center will sponsor an international symposium on drug eradication
and social development in Simao, Yunnan Province, in the first
half of this year.
</P>
<P>
During the symposium Chinese and foreign experts will discuss
measures to step up international cooperation in rooting out drug
supply sources.
</P>
<P>
He said that experts in Yunnan have already published a number
of papers on drug eradication and two books titled "Contemporary
Golden Triangle (a major opium producing area bordering Myanmar,
Thailand and Laos)" and "The Drug Source Outside Yunnan."
</P>
<P>
The books deal with drug production, trafficking and dealing in
the triangle, anti-drug campaigns launched by relevant countries
and the history and present situation of drugs in Southeast Asia,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The notorious Golden Triangle, one of the world's three leading
drug production areas, produces 70 percent of the world's heroin,
Chen said, adding that the area currently produces 2,400 to 2,600
tons of opium and processes 200 tons of heroin annually.
</P>
<P>
In a paper titled "China's Anti-Drug Situation and
Countermeasures," experts noted that within three to five years it
is impossible to prevent drugs from being smuggled into China.
</P>
<P>
They noted that China must spend more manpower and financial
resources on the anti-drug campaign and work in close cooperation
with the international community in fighting a "protracted war"
against drug trafficking and abuse.
</P>
<P>
They shared the view that rooting out the drug supply source is
essential to the success of drug eradication.
</P>
<P>
The paper said, "As drug production in the Golden Triangle area
is related closely to the livelihood of two million local people,
it is impossible to eradicate the drug supply source by taking
administrative measures only.
</P>
<P>
It added that only by substituting for opium poppy with other
cash crops and helping residents in the area eliminate poverty
will it be possible to eradicate the drug supply source.
</P>
<P>
Chen Lufan said that over the past few years the border areas
of Xishuangbanna, Dehong, Lincang and Baozhou prefectures in
Yunnan Province have succeeded in helping farmers in northern
Myanmar grow rice, rubber trees, tobacco and sugar canes to
substitute for opium poppy.
</P>
<P>
The move has helped to reduce greatly the number of opium
poppies planted in the area.

<HEADLINE> Combination of Diesel, Dust May Trigger Asthma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Australian scientists have
found that the combination of carbon particles in diesel exhaust
and pollen particles may provoke asthma.
</P>
<P>
The carbon particles in diesel exhaust were vividly described
as microscopic airborne "bullets" made up of sooty diesel fumes.
</P>
<P>
The "bullets" blot up asthma-provoking particles, or allergens,
packed inside grass pollen, said Professor Bruce Knox, a research
leader and a botanist specializing in pollen biology at the
University of Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
When people inhale the allergen-studded "bullets" they set off
a chain of events in their lungs which may worsen or cause an
asthma attack, The Sydney Morning Herald newspaper quoted Knox as
reporting today.
</P>
<P>
Dr Michael Pain, director of Thoracic Medicine at Royal
Melbourne Hospital, said that if the results of experiments are
right, experts will have to rethink the role particulate dust
plays in respiratory disease.
</P>
<P>
However, there are some experts who remain sceptical about the
findings.
</P>
<P>
"This may well be an important finding, but it still does not
prove there is a causal link between two hazards and asthma," Dr
Steve Corbett, Director of the Environmental Health, Food and
Nutrition Branch of the NSW (New South Wales) Department of
Health, said.
</P>
<P>
In Australia, there are five percent of adult people suffering
asthma and another five percent being potentially asthmatic.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Australia also has the highest rate of childhood
asthma in the world, between 15 and 25 percent, according to Dr
Pain.

<HEADLINE> New Technique of Pig-raising Invented in Guizhou </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Farmers can fatten pigs on crop
stalks through using a new technique invented in Guiyang, the
capital city of Southwest China's Guizhou Province.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that pigs can eat crushed stalks after it ferments
with a kind of additive in it.
</P>
<P>
Active germs in the additive can turn fibers and other
ingredients of stalks into protein, amino acid and other
nutritious ingredients, which pigs can digest and absorb easily.
</P>
<P>
The additive was invented jointly by the Pig-Raising Institute
of the Guiyang Science and Technology Commission and the Guiyang
National Hi-tech and Stalk Pilot Farm.
</P>
<P>
A two-month experiment on the farm shows that 260 pigs, fed on
fermented stalks, each put on weight of 0.5 kg a day.
</P>
<P>
Experts agreed that using the stalks to replace half of the
mixed feed will lower the pig-raising costs by at least 40
percent.

<HEADLINE> Tottenham and Wimbledon Banned by Uefa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 12 (Xinhua) -- English Premier League clubs
Tottenham and Wimbledon were Friday banned from European
competition for one year by European soccer's ruling body Uefa.
</P>
<P>
The punishment has been imposed due to their perceived poor
attitude to last summer's Intertoto Cup soccer tournament.
</P>
<P>
Massimo Gonella, a press spokesman of the Uefa said: "The ban
will be active for five years and if either club qualifies for any
European competition within that period, they will not be allowed
to compete.
</P>
<P>
"The ban was imposed because Tottenham and Wimbledon fielded
below-strength teams in last summer's Intertoto Cup."
</P>
<P>
Spokesman of the English Football Association Steve Double
said: "We have been told by Uefa this afternoon that the ban is to
take place and is effective for five years."
</P>
<P>
An European ban could have a considerable impact on Tottenham,
which is currently fourth in the Premier League.
</P>
<P>
It could well qualify for one of the three major European
competitions this season.
</P>
<P>
Wimbledon was denied its one chance of playing in the European
Cup Winners' Cup because English clubs were still banned from
Europe when it won the Fa Cup in 1988.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 13 (Xinhua) -- With the successful launch
of the Malaysian East Asian Satellite MEASAT-1 from the Kourou
Space Center in French Guiana early this morning (Malaysian time),
Malaysia has become one of the few countries who have their own
satellites in space.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian satellite, the nation's first satellite, was
launched by the European commercial space transport consortium
Arianespace.
</P>
<P>
MEASAT-1, to be placed in its orbital slot 91.5 degree East,
was made by the Huges Space and Communications Company of the
United States. It has five Ku-band transponders and 12 C-band
transponders, with a life span of 12 years.
</P>
<P>
With MEASAT-1, Malaysia now can greatly improve its television,
broadcasting and data services, and can link itself more
effectively with East Asian neighbors, even with China and
Australia.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has decided to take steps to develop its aerospace
industry. According to a plan, Malaysia's MEASAT-2 communication
satellite will be launched into space in October 1996. Further
more, the Malaysian government also plans to have its first micro
satellite to be launched by Arianespace in the middle of next year
and the second in the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Leftover Japanese Chemical Weapons Threaten Lives in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Chemical weapons left behind by
the retreating Japanese invaders in China during World War II are
still polluting the environment and threatening local people's
lives.
</P>
<P>
More than two million chemical bombs and some 100 tons of
toxicants have been found in 70 areas in more than ten provinces
and municipalities, according to national statistics. Most of them
have been seriously eaten away by rust with some being leaking out
poisonous materials.
</P>
<P>
The health of more than 3,000 Chinese has been impaired by
seepage of materials from chemical bombs in the years since the
People's Republic of China was founded in 1949, statistics show.
</P>
<P>
Destroying the remaining chemical weapons will require eight to
nine years at least and cost several billion yuan, experts predict.
</P>
<P>
Chemical weapons and poisonous gas were used by invading
Japanese troops during the Chinese people's Anti-Japanese War
(1937-1945), a part of the world's Anti-Fascist War, and many
weapons and facilities were left behind by the end of the war.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1950s, several hundred farmers in northeast
China's Heilongjiang Province were poisoned by the mustard gas
from containers they had dug up.
</P>
<P>
In one county in Jilin Province, more than one million chemical
bombs are still buried in a closed area, which were the cause of a
series of poisoning accidents in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
Similar types of gas drums, chemical bombs, and poisonous
agents, identified as those of Japanese troops, have been found in
Liaoning, Hebei, and Shanxi provinces since 1986.
</P>
<P>
During construction work in a city in Heilongjiang, four drums
of mustard gas were dug up causing one construction worker to lose
his eyesight and many others problems from which they are still
suffering today.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Retailer Sues Owners of US Barney's Inc. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Isetan of America, Inc. (IOA),
a major retailer in Japan, said today that it is filing a suit
against the owners of Barney's Inc., in an effort to recover loans
of millions of U.S. dollars, after the latter announced on
Wednesday to take refuge in bankruptcy court.
</P>
<P>
The suit being filed in the New York Supreme Court here today
was against Robert Pressman and his brother, Gene Pressman, owners
of Barney's, the retail legend in New York. Isetan, the sixth
largest japanese department store, was seeking recovery of about
168 million dollars of short-term loans it had provided to the
Preen affiliate of Barney's that were personally guaranteed by the
Pressman brothers.
</P>
<P>
IOA's law firm, Hughes Hubbard &AMP; Reed, said that Isetan
provided two separate emergency short-term loans in 1993 and 1994
to cover cost overruns and other capital needs related to the
construction of two retail stores in New York and Beverly Hills.
But Isetan agreed to the deal in exchange for individual
guarantees from the Pressman brothers and Barney's
representations.
</P>
<P>
The law firm said the Preen defaulted on the loans beginning in
March of 1995 and is also in default of rental payments due on the
retail properties owned by IOA entities.
</P>
<P>
But Barney's said that Isetan reneged on their partnership to
build more than 30 of the high-fashion stores around the world.
</P>
<P>
Barney's went to U.S. Bankruptcy Court on Wednesday to put all
contracts and obligations with Isetan on hold.
</P>
<P>
Chemical Bank said it would loan Barney's 100 million dollars
to tide over during the bankruptcy case.
</P>
<P>
Barney's, founded in 1923, said that it has assets of 382.5
million dollars and owes creditors, 361.4 million dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council on Friday decided unanimously to extend mandate of the
United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia for an additional
period terminating on 12 July, 1996.
</P>
<P>
Established in August 1993, the observer mission now has a
force of 136 military observers, who are supported by 55
international and 75 local civilian staff.
</P>
<P>
It was designed to verify compliance with a ceasefire agreement
of 27 July 1993 by the Georgian government and the Abkhazian
rebels.
</P>
<P>
In adopting the mandate-renewal resolution, the council
reaffirmed its commitment to the sovereignty and territorial
integrity of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the council expressed deep concern at the continued
deadlock in the efforts to achieve a comprehensive settlement of
the conflict.
</P>
<P>
It called upon the parties, the Abkhaz side in particular, to
achieve substantive progress without further delay towards such an
end.
</P>
<P>
On the rising violence and the killings being committed in the
areas under the control of the Abkhaz side, the council expressed
its condemnation and called upon the Abkhaz side to ensure the
safely of all persons in areas under its control.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Permanent Representative to the United Nations Qin
Huasun expressed full support of the council resolution, saying
that it will further promote stability in Georgia and facilitate
the process of a comprehensive political settlement.
</P>
<P>
He urged the two parties concerned to take into account the
fundamental interests of the Georgian people of all ethnic groups
and engage in peace talks in real earnest and in a constructive
manner so as to find a final proper solution.

Libya and China would be strengthened.

The Chinese foreign minister said his country is against any
form of "hegemonism policy."
</P>

Any country should not interfere other countries' internal

LAGOS, January 12 (Xinhua) -- President of the International
Football Federation (FIFA), Joao Havelange, made a last effort to
talk Nigeria into reversing its decision to pull out of the
Africa Nations Cup to be opened in South Africa on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to the News Agency of Nigeria, the FIFA president on

Havelange offered in the letter that FIFA is willing to pay

He said Ngeria's withdrawal would "take the shine off the

On December 30 last year, Nigeria announced it would pull out

secure climate throughout Bosnia so that you can rebuild your
towns and roads, your factories and shops, your parks and
playgrounds".

<HEADLINE> Bouchard Expected to Become Quebec Separatist Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Lucien Bouchard is expected to
become Parti Quebecois leader and Quebec premier at the end of
this month, reviving a crusade for Quebec independence from
Canada.
</P>
<P>
Bouchard secured his leadership in Quebec on the midnight
Thursday when be became the only candidate to seek the posts.
</P>
<P>
He will be proclaimed the leader of Party Quebecois at a
special party meeting in Montreal on January 27 and will probably
be sworn in as premier two days later. He will resign as leader of
Bloc Quebecois, the official opposition party in the Federal
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Bouchard decided to take over the job last November from Parti
Quebecois and Quebec Premier Jacquese Parizeau who announced his
resignation after the October-30 referendum on Quebec independence
was defeated. He took over the leadership from Parizeau in the
referendum campaign and he was credited with his role in the final
campaign which brought separatists to a near victory from the
hopeless mood.
</P>
<P>
Bouchard's moving into the Quebec politics will keep the
independence movement in the province alive.
</P>
<P>
Bouchard has promised to tackle the province's deficit crisis
and to create a climate for economic growth. Opinions show that
most quebeckers want the provincial government to focus its
attention to the economy rather than independence after the
referendum.
</P>
<P>
Quebec has serious financial problems with one of the biggest
debt and tax burdens in Canada. In an editorial, the Montreal
daily Gazette today urges Bouchard to devote his energy to
governing and tackling the "very serious social, economic and
fiscal problems" facing Quebeckers.
</P>
<P>
But Bouchard never hid his goal of Quebec independence. He told
quebeckers on the referendum night, last November that next
referendum could come sooner than they think.
</P>
<P>
News reports said earlier that Bouchard will consider a fall
election in Quebec. The election, assuming that he would win,
would position him to hold another referendum on independence next
year.

TRIPOLI, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen today voiced his hope that a peaceful
settlement of the Lockerbie issue would be reached through
dialogue.
</P>
<P>
He said China will continue its efforts to help solve this
issue.
</P>
<P>
Qian, who arrived here Thursday night on a three-day visit to
Libya, held talks today with his Libyan counterpart Omar Mustafa
al-Montassir on bilateral ties and international issues of mutual
concern.
</P>
<P>
Al-Montassir briefed Qian on the latest developments of the
Lockerbie issue and the sufferings by the Libyan people due to the
international embargo on Libya.
</P>
<P>
Al-Montassir said the embargo falls in the framework of "the
hegemony policy," pointing out that there was no reason for its
continuation.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations imposed air, arms and diplomatic embargo on
Libya in April 1992 after Libya refused to yield two Libyan
nationals suspected of bombing a Pan Am passenger aircraft over
Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988, in which 270 people were killed.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain insisted that the suspects be
tried in the U.S. or Britain while Libya insisted that they be
tried in a neutral country or in the International Court of
Justice.
</P>
<P>
Al-Montassir expressed his appreciation of China's achievements
in economic reform.
</P>

He also spoke highly of the role China plays on the

</P>
<P>
 Nationwide Strike
</P>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The Congress of South
African Trade Unions (COSATU) today decided to suspend its
nationwide one-day strike scheduled on January 16 pending
negotiations on restructuring state-owned assets with the
government, while the later promised not to implement its
privatization plans.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made by the COSATU National Executive
Committee at a meeting held in Johannesburg earlier today.
</P>
<P>
This followed yesterday's eight-hour meeting between the
government and labor on a draft national framework agreement on
the restructuring of state assets.
</P>
<P>
COSATU Assistant General-secretary Vavi Zwelinzima said that
the government had also promised not to make any further
statements on the sale of state assets.
</P>
<P>
The government's privatization plans, announced by Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki in December last year, were strongly
opposed by the country's organized labor, including the COSATU.
</P>
<P>
COSATU late last year announced that it would organize a
24-hour strike on January 16 to protest against the government's
plans to sell at least portions of large parastatals.

ANKARA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has asked for Turkey's help
in releasing its about 50 million U.S. dollars frozen by Arab
countries, Turkey's Anatolia News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The capital was frozen in Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and the United

for its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Anatolia quoted Iraqi embassy officials as saying that the
sanctions had led to a severe shortage of food and medicine in
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq is in urgent need of the assets frozen by Arab countries
to meet the expenses of food, medicines and pilgrimage to the
Islamic holy place of Mecca, they said.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad, which asked Ankara to persuade the Arab states to
release the capital, has also called upon the secretaries general
of the United Nations, the Arab League and the Organization of

He told the audience that although Britain is already the
largest European investor in China, there still is considerable
scope to expand both exports and investment.
</P>
<P>
Britain has a strategic aim of seeing China successfully
incorporated into the international mainstream, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that he was pleased that Britain's relations with China
are improving steadily. Former trade secretary Michael Heseltine's
China visit last may and Chinese Vice-premier Qian Qichen's talks
in London in October brought good progress on a range of Hong Kong
and bilateral issues, he said.
</P>
<P>
Turning to Hong Kong issue, Rifkind said that Britain and China
have shared interest in the successful transfer of sovereignty
over Hong Kong and that is the key element in the relationship
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
But he added that by a successful transfer of sovereignty, "I
do not simply mean a smooth transition. I mean one which
safeguards Hong Kong's prosperity, its free way of life and the
rule of law."
</P>
<P>
Britain has "a moral obligation to the Hong Kong people," he
alleged.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Urges Young Afrikaners For Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 13 (Xinhua)-- South African President
Nelson Mandela today urged Afrikaner youth to shun separatism
and embrace national unity.
</P>
<P>
Mandela warned a white Afrikaner youth group of the danger of
practising racism which he said belonged to the history.
</P>
<P>
"The new generation of Afrikaner young leaders will have to
show the genuine interests of Afrikaners cannot be promoted by
narrow and exclusive ways," said the President.
</P>
<P>
In a strong-worded statement, he urged young Afrikaners to
distance themselves from projects which seemed to portray
Afrikaners as only wanting to pursue past privileges.
</P>
<P>
"They create the impression that one has here to do with
attempts to retain the unjust advantages from which the
Afrikaners benefited in the past,'' said Mandela, whose African
National Congress (ANC) won South Africa's first all-race
elections in April 1994.
</P>
<P>
"You harm the Afrikaner case and do your people a great wrong
in misleading them over what the government's real reconciliatory
aims are with the Truth and Reconciliation Commission," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, an Afrikaner youth group held a gathering in
Pretoria where speakers including former police commissioner
General Johan van der Merwe accused Mandela's government of
discriminating against Afrikaners in violation of the new interim
constitution.
</P>
<P>
The group complained that the use of the Afrikaan language was
being cut back in schools and on radio and television.
</P>
<P>
It said the government policy to provide jobs for blacks
harmed Afrikaner interests, accusing the government of favoring
ANC members over members of the Apartheid-era security forces in
investigations into human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
Other speakers at the rally, attended by about 1,000 people,
said Afrikaners would have to launch mass protests to make the
government listen.
</P>
<P>
There are still some Afrikaners who back the unity of the
country under the leadership of President Mandela.
</P>
<P>
"There are many people who respect this flag and who are also
good Afrikaners, and I am one of them," said Theo de Jager,
chairman of the group who later held closed-door talks with
Mandela.
</P>
<P>
Afrikaners, descendants of the Dutch, German and French
settlers who began arriving in South Africa in the 17th
century. They dominated the National Party which came to power
in 1948 and introduced Apartheid.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Denies Information on Departure of Palestinian Fighters to Gaza </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January, 12 (Xinhua) -- Deputy Prime Minister Michel
al-Murr denied today that Lebanon has received any official
information on a reported departure of hundreds of Palestinian
fighters to the Gaza Strip to join the Palestinian police.
</P>
<P>
Murr, after meeting with Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri this
evening, noted that the Lebanese Embassy in Tunis had inquired
PLO Political Department chief Farouk Kaddoumy about this issue.
</P>
<P>
Kaddoumy answered by saying that the Palestine Liberation
Organization (PLO) had decided to postpone the consultations with
the Lebanese authorities on this matter until after the
Palestinian Council elections on January 20, the Lebanese Deputy
premier added.
</P>
<P>
A PLO official denied earlier the report that the Palestinian
Fatah faction was recruiting in Lebanon fresh blood for the
Palestinian police force in the Palestinian self-rule areas of
the Gaza Strip and West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Representative of the PLO in Lebanon Sultan Abu Al-Ainin was
quoted by the Lebanese Central News Agency as saying Friday that
he had not received from the Palestinian leadership in Gaza
orders to send Palestinian fighters to Gaza.
</P>
<P>
"The departure of the Palestinian fighters (from Lebanon)
needs a collection of administrative and legal proceedings and
talks between the the PLO leadership and the Lebanese authority,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the PLO leadership and the Lebanese government
have not held talks on this issue yet.
</P>
<P>
The PLO official clarified that a departure of any batch of the
Palestinian fighters to take jobs in the Palestinian self-rule
areas needs a "full agreement" between the PLO and the Lebanese
government.
</P>
<P>
On the report that the pro-Arafat Fatah faction is collecting
light weapons in Ain Al-Hilweh, the largest Palestinian refugee
camp in Lebanon, he said that the work is aimed to enhance the
security in the Palestinian refugee camps in this country.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the Palestinians have been undertaking this
work for three years.
</P>
<P>
The local newspapers reported this morning that some 450
members of the Palestinian Fatah faction have received orders
from their leader, Yasser Arafat, to get ready to leave Lebanon
and join the Palestinian police force in the Gaza Strip and West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
One report published by the daily An-Nahar put the total of
those ordered to prepare for departure at 1,200.
</P>
<P>
Another Beirut-based newspaper, As-Safir, said that the 450
Fatah fighters who are supposed to leave this time are scattered
in various refugee camps in Lebanon, including Ain Al-Hilweh near
the southern Lebanese port city of Saida.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said the Lebanese authorities had no objection
to the departure of Palestinians to their land as long as Israel
agreed.
