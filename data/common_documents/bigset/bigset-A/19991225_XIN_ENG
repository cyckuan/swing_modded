<HEADLINE> Legal Chechen Government to Be Formed in 8-10 Months: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 24 (Xinhua) -- A legal government could be set
up in Russia's breakaway republic of Chechnya within eight to ten
months, said Russian Deputy Prime Minister Nikolai Koshman Friday.
</P>
<P>
The federal administrations of Gudermes, Grozny rural and
Achkhoi-Martan districts will be established by the end of next
January and the authorities of all other districts -- before May,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chechen republic will vote in the Russian presidential
elections next June, said Koshman, who is also the Russian Cabinet
's envoy in the republic.
</P>
<P>
"Today Chechnya has two houses of parliament elected in 1996.
We will have more members elected, then the head of the government
will be elected and a government is to be formed. Following that,
local elections can be held," he said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 45,000 to 50,000 people are still staying in Grozny,
Koshman said. About 8,000 have left the city in recent days. Two
tent camps for a total of 6,000 have been prepared in Znamenka.
Some of those who fled Grozny are staying in the private sector,
Koshman said.
</P>
<P>
"Now it is better for people to stay in Grozny while the
operation is underway. It is days before the Grozny question is
finally struck from the agenda," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Interfax news agency, Russian federal troops
have cut off passages to the Argrun gorge, which links Chechnya
and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
Russia's Western and Eastern military groups have controlled
the natural gate through which the Argun River flows into the
valley. Paratroopers were deployed on the Georgian border and the
militants were isolated from all flat-land Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Artillery and aviation bombing has become much more intensive
in mountainous villages over the past days.
</P>
<P>
Russian forces have been preventing rebels from breaking out of
Chechnya's besieged capital, Grozny, to mountainous regions, the
Russian Defense Ministry said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Chechen rebels hope to spend the winter on bases they are
setting up in mountain regions difficult to access.
</P>
<P>
The rebel command was planning acts of sabotage against Russian
posts on strategic roads outside Grozny, but it is impossible for
the gangsters to break out of the tightly gripped city, said the
ministry.

<HEADLINE> Cote d'Ivoire Coup Leader Promises "Respect of Democracy" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The leader of the coup d'etat in
Cote d'Ivoire, General Robert Guei, said Friday evening that he
would respect "the rule of democracy" in his country.
</P>
<P>
In a television speech, the rebel leader said that he would
personally guarantee that the rule of democracy be respected,
security ensured for foreigners, and international accords
observed, according to reports from Abidjan.
</P>
<P>
"The international accords are now and will be scrupulously
respected. The security of Ivorians and non-Ivorians will also be
guaranteed," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the military police force and police force of
the country support the military coup.
</P>
<P>
"As for our brothers of arms, no matter they are gendarmerie or
police, we are happy to see that they are showing solidarity with
us," said the 58-year-old former chief of the general staff of the
Ivorian army.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the rebels would send missions to "brother
countries" and "friend countries" to explain the reason for the
coup d'etat.
</P>
<P>
On the lootings which have been taking place in some districts
of Abidjan since Thursday, Guei said that he would put "
uncontrollable elements" under control.
</P>
<P>
On the situation of economy of the country, the general said
that he would personally take care of the problems faced by the
peasants of the country, who are suffering from a lowering of
prices of primary goods and a liberalization of the market of
cacao, of which Cote d'Ivoire is the biggest producer in the world.
</P>
<P>
Military rebels announced Friday morning that the government of
President Henri Konan Bedie had been toppled.

<HEADLINE> Political Consensus, Economic Stability Achieved in Russia: Putin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Russia has reached political
consensus and economic stability in 1999, which are the main
results of the outgoing year, said Russian Prime Minister Vladimir
Putin here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an enlarged meeting of the collegium of the
Ministry of Railways, Putin noted "Positive changes have taken
place in Russia's economic and political areas. Particularly, a
political consensus has been reached in society, which was shown
by the elections to the State Duma (the lower chamber of the
Russian parliament)."
</P>
<P>
Stressing macroeconomic stabilization has been achieved in 1999,
the premier admitted that the potential of economic stabilization
has also been exhausted after the 1998 crisis and"it is a material
production model that can serve as a real and durable basis for
stabilization now."
</P>
<P>
He said the Railway Ministry and the Power Ministry "have
played the key roles in Russia's economic success in 1999."
</P>
<P>
"The railway transport, the Gazprom (the biggest natural gas
company in Russia), the Unified Energy Systems of Russia as well
as other well-known monopolies do much to preserve uniform Russian
statehood. They constitute the core of Russia's uniform economic
expanse," Putin said.

<HEADLINE> Violence Resumes in South Lebanon After Two-day Break </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 24 (Xinhua) -- An exchange of fire between
Lebanese guerrillas and Israeli occupation forces on Friday broke a
two-day informal cease-fire in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Security sources said fighters of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah,
or Party of God, launched heavy machine gun attacks on the outposts
of the pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army (SLA) on the verge of the
Israeli occupied border zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
SLA militiamen responded with mortar rounds, but caused no
casualties, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
In the past days, Hezbollah reached an informal cease-fire with
Israeli troops to permit the recovery of the bodies of its six
fighters killed inside the border zone.
</P>
<P>
The remains of five Hezbollah guerrillas have been retrieved
since Wednesday morning by workers of the International Committee
of the Red Cross during what was described as the quietest period
in 22 years.
</P>
<P>
Israel has occupied parts of south Lebanon since 1978 and set up
a self-styled security zone there in 1985 with the claimed aim of
protecting its north from cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah is spearheading a resistance movement in a bid to
drive the Israelis and its ally out of the country.

<HEADLINE> Strike Paralyses Zambia's Biggest Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The strike by about 150 junior
doctors in Zambia's biggest hospital entered fourth day Friday,
making the work in the hospital almost to a standstill.
</P>
<P>
Don Mwape, Public Relations Manager of the hospital, said that
only a few senior doctors are now attending emergency cases, and
described the situation in the hospital as serious.
</P>
<P>
The junior doctors of University Teaching Hospital in Lusaka
began strike on Tuesday demanding improved working conditions
including higher salaries and allowances.
</P>
<P>
Nurses, radiographer, physiotherapists and general workers
joined the striking doctors one day later.
</P>
<P>
They went on strike also in protest against lack of essential
drugs, medical and surgical supplies and limited laboratory
facilities in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
Health Minister David Mpamba on Thursday dismissed the strike
as illegal when he met the striking doctors, adding under the
country's labor law doctors are not allowed to strike.
</P>
<P>
He urged the striking workers to go back to work and save
people's lives.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia reported Friday that resident doctors in all
government hospitals have joined their Lusaka colleagues in the
strike.

ISLAMABAD, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The hijacked Indian plane
left Pakistan's Lahore airport at 22:02 local time (1702 GMT)
Friday night after completing refueling, said army spokesman
Rashid Qureshi.
</P>
<P>
However, the destination of the plane could not be immediately
known.
</P>
<P>
There are rumors that the plane is heading for the Afghan
capital of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The Indian Airlines Airbus-300 had stayed at the Lahore
International Airport for over three hours, when it was refuelled
and provided with food as demanded by the hijackers.
</P>
<P>
Not long after takeoff from Kathmandu, Nepal in the afternoon,
the New Delhi-bound plane, with 185 people on board, was hijacked
by five heavily armed men and ordered to land in Lahore.
</P>
<P>
Condemning all acts of terrorism including hijacking, Pakistan
Foreign Office spokesman Tariq Altaf said the plane was finally
allowed landing at Lahore airport "to save lives of the passengers
on board" as the pilot of the airliner informed the airport that
the plane was running short of fuel.
</P>
<P>
"After the hijacking of the Indian plane, the Indian
authorities sought permission from the Pakistan authorities for
landing of the plane in Lahore," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This permission was denied in view of the past experience of
the stage-managed hijacking of the Indian aircraft by Indian
intelligence agencies in 1971," he added.
</P>
<P>
Since the plane was running short of fuel, he said, the
situation made it obligatory upon Pakistan under the international
norms and conventions that the plane be allowed landing for saving
lives of the passengers on board.
</P>
<P>
"The circumstances compelled us to allow the landing," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, on being refused landing in Lahore, the plane had
diverted and landed at Amritsar airport, where the hijackers
claimed to have killed four hostages.

<HEADLINE> Chretien Denies Canada Being Terrorist's Haven </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien has denied his country being terrorist's haven.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister was reacting to the suggestion that his
country has lax rules following last week's arrest in the United
States of a suspected terrorist living in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
He told Radio-Canada Thursday that some people taking advantage
of Canada "is causing us some embarrassment," but "is not
surprising."
</P>
<P>
"We would have preferred that this incident didn't take place,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Chretien insisted that terrorism is an international problem
and will likely become the biggest threat to world peace in the
next two decades.
</P>
<P>
He urged for joint efforts by all countries to fight terrorism,
saying "we must always be on our guard."
</P>
<P>
Canada has tightened security in the past few days at airports
and at the Canadian-U.S. border, with more than a hundred extra
customs officers examining documents and baggage, according to
local media.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Hijackers of an Airbus-300
of the Indian Airlines which landed at the Lahore Airport Friday
evening, are pressing for refueling the plane, sources from
Lahore told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's army commander in Lahore has reached at the Lahore
Airport. So far, there is no formal contact with the hijackers.
And it is still not known what is the motivation behind their
action.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani authorities, meanwhile, have alerted all airports
across the country.
</P>
<P>
The plane, with 189 people including 11 crew members, landed at
Pakistan's Lahore airport Friday evening after refueling at the
Indian border city of Amritsar, 50 kilometers from Lahore.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the plane was not allowed permission to
land at the Lahore airport, but its pilots made a forced-landing.
</P>
<P>
All the lights had been switched off at the Lahore Airport as a
precautionary measure but the passenger plane, which is said to
have been left with no fuel, landed on the dark airstrip,
perilously averting a crash.
</P>
<P>
The plane, which the Pakistani Civil Aviation Authorities had
diverted towards Amritsar, entered Pakistan airspace without
negotiating with the control tower, and made a straight landing on
the runway with no lights on.
</P>
<P>
Unconfirmed reports said earlier that four passengers were
killed by the five heavily-armed Hindi-speaking hijackers.
</P>
<P>
Ambulances and fire brigades were rushed to the Lahore Airport,
and all the roads leading to the airport had been closed.
</P>
<P>
The plane was hijacked during a flight from Kathmandu, Nepal to
the Indian capital of New Delhi soon after its take-off Friday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The plane took off from Tribhuvan International Airport in
Kathmandu at 16:25 hours local time, over two hours behind
schedule, and was hijacked shortly after 17:00 hours (12:30 GMT)
on its way to New Delhi.

<HEADLINE> France Condemns Coup d'etat in Cote d'Ivoire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 24 (Xinhua) -- France condemned the coup d'etat
in Cote d'Ivoire staged by the mutinous soldiers of the western
African state and called for an immediate return of order and
security in its economic capital Abidjan.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret said
that that France is `particularly vigilant'' about the security of
some 20,000 French nationals living in the country, 90 percent of
them in Abidjan.
</P>
<P>
She refused to comment on speculation that President Henri
Konan Bedie of Cote d'Ivoire is taking refuge in the French
embassy.
</P>
<P>
France, which has very close relations with Cote d'Ivoire, has
600 soldiers permanently deployed in the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President Bedie said on Radio France Internationale
that he remains in his post despite the announcement by the rebels
that he has been toppled.
</P>
<P>
``By blocking the road of all troublemakers, I remain in my
post to defend public order and freedom,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that he has just received a delegation of the mutinous
soldiers who have agreed to help restore public order.
</P>
<P>
``I ask all the people, all the soldiers, to return to their
barracks. The dialogue will continue around the presented
requirement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Soldiers invaded Abidjan on Thursday asking for better
conditions of life.
</P>
<P>
Posing as the ``spokesman'' of the mutinous soldiers, former
chief of general staff of the Cote d'Ivoire army, General Robert
Guei, said Friday that Bedie is no longer president of the
republic.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan issued an official
statement on the hijacking of an Indian plane, saying it initially
refused the plane to land in Lahore due to fear of Indian
malignance.
</P>
<P>
The Airbus-300 plane of the Indian Airlines was ordered by
armed hijackers to fly to Pakistan's eastern city of Lahore, but
the Pakistan authorities had refused to let it land.
</P>
<P>
"The Indian authorities sought permission from the Pakistan
authorities for landing of the plane in Lahore. The permission was
denied in view of the past experience of the stage-managed
hijacking of the Indian aircraft by Indian Intelligence agencies
in 1971," said the statement issued by the Pakistan Foreign Office.
</P>
<P>
However, at the request of the Indian side, the plane, after
grounded in India's border city of Amritsar for some time, was
allowed to land at the Lahore International Airport.
</P>
<P>
"We allowed the plane to land to save human lives," said
Pakistan Foreign Office spokesman Tariq Altaf.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan condemns all acts of terrorism including hijacking,"
said the statement, adding "Pakistan cannot allow anybody to
embroil it in such dastardly acts."

<HEADLINE> President of Cote d'Ivoire Calls for Resistance Against Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 24 (Xinhua) -- President Henri Konan Bedie of
Cote d'Ivoire Friday called on his countrymen to resist the
military rebels who have staged a coup d'etat against the
government.
</P>
<P>
In a statement broadcast on Radio France Internationale, Bedie
described the coup as ``grotesque'' and ``retrograde,'' and
appealed to ``national and international opinion'' to condemn it.
</P>
<P>
It is not known from where the president made this appeal. Some
reports said that he was hiding in the French embassy in Abidjan.
</P>
<P>
``As the president of the republic democratically elected and
in liaison with the loyal and majority military forces, I condemn
strongly this coup attempt and call on the national and
international opinion to condemn this coup de force,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged all the ``living forces'' of Cote d'Ivoire, military,
civilian and traditional, to resist and do everything necessary to
foil the coup attempt.
</P>
<P>
``I appeal to all the living forces, all the police chiefs of
the republic, prefects, under-prefects, all the elected, mayors,
deputies, civil associations and all the people in the depth of
the country to organize, for once in Africa, the resistance,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
Rebel soldiers invaded the economic capital of Cote d'Ivoire
Abidjan on Thursday and announced Friday that President Bedie has
been toppled.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says no Information on Assad's Visit to Washington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Palestinian newspaper al-Ayyam has said that it got
information from Washington-based Arab diplomats that Assad would
make his first visit to Washington after Syrian-Israel peace talks,
scheduled on January 3, and that he would hold talks with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. officials said there were no such plan.
</P>
<P>
"We have no information on that. There are no plans to our
knowledge," said a U.S. official, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
A new round of Syrian-Israeli talks will be held at a small
town of Shepherdstown, West Virginia, 120 miles northwest of
Washington. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Syrian Foreign
Minister Farouq al-Shara will continue their negotiations, which
would be focused on the Israel's return of the Golan Heights to
Syria.
</P>
<P>
A senior White House official said Assad could come in the
event of a historic peace deal between Syria and Israel.
</P>
<P>
"When Assad shows up, you know they're close to a deal," said
the official. "I wouldn't expect him to come until there's a deal.
"
</P>
<P>
Clinton was expected to travel to Shepherdstown for the
opening of the new round of talks and return there as needed as he
did during Palestinian-Israeli talks at the Wye Plantation in
Maryland last year.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, Sudan to Promote Ties: Egyptian FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Egypt and Sudan have agreed to
revive and promote cooperation in political and economic fields,
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian ambassador will return to the Sudanese capital of
Khartoum within the coming few weeks to resume duties as agreed on
between Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and his Sudanese
counterpart Omar Hassan al-Bashir, Moussa was quoted as saying by
Egypt's Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
He said a joint committee under the foreign ministers, which
Mubarak and al-Bashir have also agreed to set up, will soon meet in
Khartoum to follow up steps aimed at boosting bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Moussa did not disclose the specific dates of both events.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian-Sudanese ties soured early this decade after Cairo
accused Khartoum of harboring Islamic militants who attempted to
assassinate Mubarak and topple the government. Egypt recalled its
ambassador in Khartoum in 1995.
</P>
<P>
A thaw has set in since 1997 due to joint efforts by the two
sides. Al-Bashir's imposing a three-month state of emergency and
dissolving the parliament on December 12, and Egypt's immediate
support for him appeared to have paved the way for the
rapprochement.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese president visited Egypt on Wednesday and Thursday
and held talks with Mubarak on the latest situation in Sudan and
the bilateral ties. Both leaders agreed to fully normalize the
bilateral relations.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Decrees Mourning for Former President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian President
Fernando Henrique Cardoso decreed Friday a three-day mourning
period for the passing away of former military president Gen. Joao
Baptista de Oliveira Figueiredo.
</P>
<P>
Gen. Joao Baptista Figueiredo, the blunt spoken president who
oversaw the transition from military dictatorship to civilian rule,
died Friday morning from heart and respiratory failure, his doctor
said. He was 81.
</P>
<P>
Cardoso appointed army commander Gen. Gleuber Vieira as his
representative in the funeral this Saturday in Rio de Janeiro of
the military ruler, who governed Brazil from 1979 to 1985.
</P>
<P>
Figueiredo, who continued the slow transition to democracy
started by his predecessor Gen. Ernesto Geisel Beckman, was the
last representatives of the military regimes that governed the
country from 1964 to March of 1985
</P>
<P>
Cardoso deplored in an official communique the passing away of
the former president, saying that "his government, with the
approval of the amnesty project, made possible the return of the
exiled Brazilians."
</P>
<P>
From Cardoso's point of view, "there was a reconciliation and a
space for society to start the democratic reconstruction."
</P>
<P>
During his 1978-1985 presidency, Figueiredo sped up the
transition to democracy begun by his predecessor Ernesto Geisel
and granted amnesty to those accused or convicted for political
crimes allowing hundreds of exiles to return.
</P>
<P>
Under his watch, the Brazilian economy began to unravel with
record unemployment and inflation skyrocketing from 43 percent a
year when he took office to 230 percent a year when he left. The
country also accumulated a massive foreign debt of about 100
billion dollars by 1984.
</P>
<P>
Figueiredo is survived by his wife Dulce and two children. The
time and place of the funeral and burial have not yet been
determined.

<HEADLINE> 103 Interns Flee Brazilian Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, December 24 (Xinhua) -- A total of 103 prisoners fled
early Friday morning the preventive prison of the industrial city
of Curitiba, in the south of Brazil.
</P>
<P>
A police source said that only four of the escapees had been
recaptured.
</P>
<P>
The prison was almost deserted because only 23 of the 126
interns it had before the mass escape remained, although the
prison was built for 40 prisoners, said Civil Police director Joao
Ricardo Kepes de Noronha.
</P>
<P>
The prisoners escaped cutting the bars of their cells with
hacksaws their relatives or friends introduced. After leaving
their cells, they ran along an inner corridor and left through a
door in the back of the building.
</P>
<P>
The personnel that was doing their watch at that time, only
three wardens, could not prevent the escape and the only thing
they did was to close the door to stop the flight of the last
interns.
</P>
<P>
Noronha said that although there is no evidence of complicity
of somebody with the escape, it is not possible to admit that more
than 100 prisoners fled this morning without the wardens noticing
it.
</P>
<P>
This mass escape has been the third in the last two months, so
the three members of the guard and the district Civil Police
delegate, Moises Americo de Souza Neto, were relieved of their
duties.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Opposition Movement Gains Momentum: Its Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Chairperson of the Bangladesh
Nationalist Party Khaleda Zia, who is the leader of the opposition
in the parliament, Saturday said that the opposition's movement
was gaining momentum and this would force the government to
concede to the demand of earlier general elections.
</P>
<P>
The opposition leader told members of the Overseas
Correspondents Association of Bangladesh here that the interests
of the country and the people are their main concern and the
current anti-government agitation is aimed at that direction.
</P>
<P>
In her remarks, Khaleda Zia portrayed the political, economic
and social conditions existing in the country and expressed the
view that the government has miserably failed in all areas of
national life.
</P>
<P>
Answering questions, the opposition leader said that she is not
averse to dialogue with Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on political
situation in the country, but insisted that no formal proposal was
made by the ruling party for talks.
</P>
<P>
Confrontation between Bangladeshi ruling Awami League and the
opposition is escalating in the country as BNP-led opposition
alliance has intensifying it's "oust government" movement since
the beginning of December.
</P>
<P>
The opposition alliance Friday called a two-day hartal (
destructive strike) in Chittagong port city from January 2 to
resist the Chittagong City Corporation Election, scheduled on
January 3.
</P>
<P>
The opposition termed the election as "farcical election",
asking all commissioner candidates to withdraw their candidature
through advertisement in the newspapers. Otherwise, it warned that
people would treat them as enemy and they might fall victims to
mass beating.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, expelled Awami League leader Kader Siddiquie Friday
floated his new party - the Farmers Workers People's League,
claiming it would uphold the rights of people and spirit of the
Liberation War.
</P>
<P>
At least 50 people including four journalists and four
policemen were injured when gunmen allegedly belonging to the
ruling party's student wing, attacked the convention called by
Siddique to launch his new party.
</P>
<P>
Siddique later announced that his party would launch an anti-
government movement but rejected the idea of joining the BNP-led
opposition alliance.

<HEADLINE> Minister: Rural China Hungry for Talent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 25 (Xinhua) -- China's personnel minister
said today that rural China is hungry for talent for further
development as there are less than seven agricultural technicians
among every 10,000 farming population.
</P>
<P>
The minister, Song Defu, said that "the principal work for
personnel departments at all levels next year is to foster or
introduce more talented people for rural China."
</P>
<P>
He made the remark at the closing ceremony of a three-day
conference, attended by heads of the country's provincial-level
personnel departments.
</P>
<P>
China now has 380,000 personnel at the grass-root level who are
engaged in popularizing farming techniques, compared with the
roughly 800 million rural population.
</P>
<P>
The minister urged personnel departments at the county level to
send more talented people to help farmers, encourage technical
school graduates to go to the countryside, and create a favorable
environment to attract more talent from urban China.
</P>
<P>
According to Song, there are 170 million young farmers who have
received junior middle school education or higher, five million
junior and senior middle school graduates returning home in the
rural areas on a yearly basis, and millions of "self-educated
farming experts." This means rich resources of talent to be tapped,
the minister said.
</P>
<P>
For the further development of township enterprises which have
mushroomed after China's reform and opening-up drive in late 1970s,
Song suggested that they streamline the training of technological
and managerial personnel, improve the comprehensive capabilities
of their staff, and lure more urban talent to work for them.

KUWAIT CITY, December 25 (Xinhua) -- The Arab Gulf Program for

JOHANNESBURG -- Police here confirmed Saturday that seven
policemen were injured, two of them seriously,when a bomb was
hurled at them in a well-planned ambush Friday night in Cape Town,
a tourist resort in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Policemen sped to the Absolut Vodka club and restaurant after
being informed by telephone of a bomb threat. Arriving at the club,
they spotted a car speeding off. Shortly afterwards, there was a
tremendous blast, audible from seven kilometers away.
</P>
<P>
It is believed the assailants threw an explosive device in the
midst of the police officers as they stepped onto the pavement.
Since the restaurant was nearly empty at the time, the attack
might aim specifically at the police. (SAfrica-Blast)

MOSCOW -- Russian federal forces launched a key stage of an
operation to storm Grozny, capital of the breakaway republic of
Chechnya, Friday midnight, the Itar-Tass news agency reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The goal of this stage is to take full control of Grozny and to
clear the city of rebels, Itar-Tass quoted credible sources at the
staff of the federal army grouping as saying.
</P>
<P>
A 500-member force of Chechen volunteers headed by Grozny's
former mayor Beslan Gantamirov, is fighting a way into central
Grozny from three directions, said the sources.

operation. (Russia-Chechnya)

ISLAMABAD, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister

WUHAN, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Construction of a light railway
started today in Wuhan, making the capital of Hubei Province in
central China the fifth city of the country that will have a light
railway system after Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai and Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the light railway line, 27.43 km long, will
cost 1.7 billion yuan and is scheduled to be completed in four
years.
</P>
<P>
The railway is expected to carry 380,000 passengers per day at
the initial stage and the number will climb to 915,000 with the
completion of the second phase. The new line will play an
important role in easing the city's already burdened
transportation system as an estimated one billion people use the
city's road systems every year.
</P>
<P>
Situated in the eastern part of Hubei Province and at the
confluence of the Yangtze River and Hanjiang River, Wuhan, known
as "Thoroughfare of Nine Provinces" in history, is divided by the
two rivers into three parts -- Wuchang, Hankou and Hanyang.

<HEADLINE> Russia Starts Operation to Storm Grozny </HEADLINE>

<P>
MOSCOW, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Russian federal forces
launched a key stage of an operation to storm Grozny, capital of
the breakaway republic of Chechnya, Friday midnight, the Itar-Tass
news agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The goal of this stage is to take full control of Grozny and
to clear the city of rebels, Itar-Tass quoted credible sources at

</P>

A 500-member force of Chechen volunteers headed by Grozny's

While explosions are heard "almost every minute" and large-
caliber weapons are firing from all directions, the Russian troops
are using smoke as a screen to keep the rebels from being able to
fire accurately at their armored vehicles, said the report.
</P>
<P>
According to Russian military sources, a tactic proven
effective during previous operations is being used in the ongoing
operation.
</P>
<P>
Grozny has been mapped into 15 sectors in which the federal
airpower and army reconnaissance units have scouted rebel
positions.
</P>
<P>
The airpower and artillery units shelled strongholds, military
hardware and fortified positions of the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Sapper teams supported by mortar fire and snipers will clear
paths of land-mines for Gantamirov's units.
</P>
<P>
The plan of the ongoing operation envisions a "web-like"
pattern of the presence and action of federal troops in Grozny.
</P>
<P>
After Grozny is under the "web," the third stage of the
operation will start, which is designed to destroy the rebel
manpower.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the "web" is to deprive rebels, who fight in
small groups, of their best asset of mobility.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that it could take the federal units a few
days to fly the Russian flag on Chechen President Aslan
Maskhadov's residence on Street Revolyutsiy in downtown Grozny.
</P>
<P>
Russia began its military offensive against the Chechen
separatists in late September after Chechen rebels' armed
incursions into neighboring federal republic of Daghestan and a
spate of apartment building blasts that claimed over 300 people in
Moscow and two other Russian cities. Russian authorities blamed
Chechen extremists for planning and carrying out the terrorist
acts.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Russian groupings successively liberated the second
biggest Chechen city of Gudermes and other key towns of Argun,
Urus-Martan and Shali, from rebel control, and closed the
surrounding of Grozny. So far, Russian units have reportedly
controlled all flat lands of Chechnya, or over two thirds of the
republic's territory, where 90 percent of Chechen population live.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Finance Minister of Bangladesh
Shah AMS Kibria Saturday assured that the millennium bug problem,
popularly known as Y2K hazard, will not hit the economy of the
country.
</P>
<P>
"Life in Bangladesh does not depend on computers. Our farmers
and much of our economic activities are yet to depend on computer
networks," the minister said while addressing a seminar on Y2K
held here by a local organization.
</P>
<P>
The minister, however, admitted that Y2K compliance of the
country's health sector is not satisfactory. Most of the modern
medical equipment in the country is computerized, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kibria expressed the hope that doctors and professionals would

<HEADLINE> South Africa, Nigeria Call for Restoration of Democratic Government in Cote d'Ivoire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 25 (Xinhua) -- South Africa and Nigeria
urged on Saturday the military leaders in Cote d'Ivoire to hand
over the government back to the democratically-elected President
Henri Konan Bedie as soon as possible, who was deposed in a
military coup on Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement jointly issued by South Africa and Nigeria, the
two countries strongly condemned the Christmas Eve coup,
emphasizing that the military takeover ran counter to "the
universal trend towards greater democratization of governance and
the advancement of the rule of law," and would certainly undermine
peace and security within the African continent.
</P>
<P>
The two African economies described the military takeover in
Cote d'Ivoire as a negation of the Declaration adopted at the 35th
Organization of African Unity (OAU) Summit in Algiers in July,
1999, which denounced and rejected any undemocratic change of
government on the continent.
</P>
<P>
The statement also urged the international community to condemn
the "illegal and unacceptable takeover" of government in Cote
d'Ivoire and take steps for an immediate restoration of
constitutional rule in the West African country.

<HEADLINE> Security Beefed Up At All Airports In India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Airports across India have
been put on high alert and surveillance intensified at all vantage
points following the hijacking of an Indian Airlines plane Friday.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said here Saturday that policemen attached to
the anti-hijack wing had stepped up surveillance and checking had
been beefed up throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
The Press Trust of India (PTI) quoted a top officer in Srinagar,
capital of the India-controlled Kashmir, that security personnel
at the Srinagar airport had been put on maximum alert and all
passengers were being subjected to thorough frisking and other
security checks.
</P>
<P>
Indian Minister of State for Civil Aviation Chaman Lal Gupta
told the media here Saturday that a group calling itself "Islamic
Salvation Front" had rang up Delhi Airport Control room at 1030
hours local time (1600 GMT) claiming responsibility for the
hijacking.
</P>
<P>
The anonymous caller demanded release of one of its activists
named Mushtaq Ahmed Zargar, who was arrested by Indian security
forces in 1997 and is now lodged in a jail in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Reports from the east city of Calcutta said all airports in the
eastern region have been put on red alert since Friday.
</P>
<P>
Entry of visitors to both the international and domestic
terminal building of the airport in the city was banned till
further notice.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, commandos of the National Security Guard have been
ordered on high alert and all the major airports in northern
region have been directed to be ready to handle any emergency
situation in case of the hijacked aircraft lands in India,
official sources here said.
</P>
<P>
The commandos could now be flown to any such place at short
notice, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The hijack of the IC-814 flight from Kathmandu to New Delhi was
the most brutal in a series of 13 since 1971 involving Indian
civilian aircraft and it is the first to result in the death of
any passenger.
</P>
<P>
On January 30, 1971, an Indian aircraft was hijacked to Lahore,
Pakistan, by two armed men and blown up two days later after
release of all 30 passengers and a crew of four.
</P>
<P>
India expressed deep disappointment Saturday over the "serious"
security lapse in Kathmandu that resulted in the hijacking of its
plane.
</P>
<P>
External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh told reporters
following a meeting of the Crisis Management Group that "we are
deeply disappointed over the serious security lapse that resulted
in the hijacking."
</P>
<P>
Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee today termed the
hijacking as "barbaric and cowardly" and said India would not be
cowed down by such acts.
</P>
<P>
"This is a very cowardly act. India will never be cowed down by
such barbaric acts," Vajpayee told the media at his residence.
</P>
<P>
The hijacked Indian Airlines plane with 161 passengers and crew
still on board landed in southern Afghan city of Kandahar, some
650 km from Kabul, Saturday morning.

<HEADLINE> China Amends Law to Crack Down on Securities-, Futures-Related Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 25 (Xinhua) -- China's national legislature
today passed an amendment of the Criminal Law, with focus placed
on cracking down on securities- and futures-related crimes.
</P>
<P>
According to the amendment, anyone who obtains inside
information about securities or futures dealings is prohibited to
leak the information or engage in related deals before it is
officially published. Otherwise the person shall face imprisonment
up to ten years and a fine two to five fold of the illegal income
thus gained.
</P>
<P>
Those who spread false information to "seriously disrupt
securities or futures markets" will also face fixed-term
imprisonment and fines, says the amendment adopted at the 13th
session of the 9th National People's Congress Standing Committee,
which closed here today.
</P>
<P>
The law forbids employees of securities and futures businesses
from releasing false information, making fake transaction records
or manipulating the market price for personal gains. Violators
will risk being jailed or fined.
</P>
<P>
Unauthorized establishment of commercial banks, stock and
futures exchanges and brokerages, insurance companies, and other
types of financial institutions has been outlawed.
</P>
<P>
The law also defines punishment for accountants' misbehaviors,
such as hiding or intentionally destroying vouchers, accounting
books and statements.
</P>
<P>
China's stock and futures markets have experienced rapid
expansion in recent years. "Despite the tightening up of
regulations and clearing up of anomalies, there still exist
problems," said Yang Jingyu, director of the Legislative Affairs
Office of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
"These and other negative activities have damaged the interests
of investors and severely disrupted the financial and economic
order," Yang said, warning that the markets "can't operate
healthily unless these crimes are punished."

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 25 (Xinhua) -- China's burgeoning high-tech
firms will find it easier to get listed on stock exchanges and
raise necessary funds with the amendment of the country's
Corporate Law to support their development.
</P>
<P>
The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC),
China's national legislature, today passed a decision on amending
the Corporate Law to soften the terms for the fund-thirsty high-
tech firms to go public.
</P>
<P>
The State Council, the country's top governing body, will
shortly publish detailed rules for the listing of them, according
to sources with the 13th session of the 9th NPC Standing Committee,
which closed here today.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers believe the move will help boost the development of
China's high-tech sector, a key player in a knowledge-based
economy, but warned that appropriate measures should be taken to
do a good job of it due the lack of experience.
</P>
<P>
The amendment also asks for the establishment of supervisory
boards to oversee solely state-owned enterprises. The board might
be composed of the State Council accredited personnel and
representatives of enterprise employees, who are entitled to
attend directorate meetings.
</P>
<P>
Directors, managers and financial managers of the enterprises
are not allowed to be members of the supervisory boards
concurrently, according to the amendment.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: S. Africa Seeks Greater Role in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 25 (Xinhua) -- The year 1999 has
witnessed an increasing role South Africa is playing in African
affairs as it is seeking to help rid the continent of conflict and
deprivation.
</P>
<P>
It is known to all that when Foreign Minister Nkosazana
Dlamini-Zuma outlined her government's foreign policy in the
post-Mandela era, the message that she passed the people is clear:
South Africa cannot hope to flourish if its neighbors suffer from
conflict and deprivation.
</P>
<P>
As an economic powerhouse in the region, South Africa commits
itself to promoting greater sub-regional integration through its
participation in Southern African Development Community (SADC) and
to pioneering an African renaissance for sustainable growth.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, South Africa also wants its voice heard politically.
</P>
<P>
To this end, the country has to focus its priorities on
democracy and peace as well as on the common development in
southern Africa and the African continent as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Ghanaian President Jerry John Rawlings emphasized South Africa
under apartheid was responsible for most of the wars in southern
African countries such as Mozambique, Namibia and Angola.
</P>
<P>
It is now morally right for the South African government to
contribute more to curbing the destabilization, Rawlings said.
</P>
<P>
Normalization of its relations with the world has boosted the
belief that South Africa could play an important role in regional
peace missions.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, South Africa has made a practical commitment to
participating in multinational peace missions and is actively
finding peaceful solutions to the conflicts on the continent
together with its African partners bilaterally or multilaterally.
</P>
<P>
To help bring an end to African conflicts has been high on the
South African government's agenda since Thabo Mbeki took over
power from former President Nelson Mandela in June this year.
</P>
<P>
The conflicts in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and
Angola constitute the biggest challenges facing South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Dlamini-Zuma's shuttle diplomacy to the Great Lakes region
resulted in the signing of the Lusaka Peace Agreement in July this
year by all warring parties directly involved in the DRC conflict.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations plans to send a 20,000-strong peace-keeping
mission to the central African country.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Pretoria is also quietly gearing up its
soldiers for involvement in the third largest African country as
part of the U.N. Observer Mission to the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Such a participation would be structured to augment efforts by
South Africa's leadership to influence the Congo peace process.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Mbeki government was coaxing Angola to revive
collapsed peace accords or negotiate fresh ones to end a widening
war.
</P>
<P>
The latest bid came in October this year when Mbeki met a
high-level Angolan delegation led by its second most powerful
leader, Joao Lorenco, to discuss peace options in the war-torn
country.
</P>
<P>
In the view of the South African Institute for Security
Studies, South Africa is at this stage "ideale bid."
</P>
<P>
South Africa's role has been once more acknowledged when
Mandela took over the job recently from the late Tanzanian
founding president Julius Nyerere as mediator in the stalled talks
among Burundi's conflicting parties to end the six-year
devastating civil war in the country.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the South African Department of Foreign Affairs is
compiling a national register of potential staff for peace-keeping
missions with a view to joining the U.N. standby peace system.
</P>
<P>
In doing so, South Africa was helping the U.N. look at its
capacity for preventive diplomacy and early warning signals -- an
approach preferable to waiting for a crisis to be full-blown and
then sending a peace mission.
</P>
<P>
The country has made it clear that it does not want to be a
mere "troop supplier" but rather a full participant in peace
missions.
</P>
<P>
To show its commitment, South Africa has sent foreign affairs
officials, defense and police officers to attend peace-keeping
training courses.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the country also wants to go beyond the role of a mere
 conflict mediator.
</P>
<P>
Deputy President Jacob Zuma has signalled his intention to take
a leading role in turning up the heat on fellow African leaders
who "tend to stray towards undemocratic methods of governance."
</P>
<P>
Democratically elected leaders who have tended to stray towards
 undemocratic means of government should perhaps be excluded from
such organizations as the Organization of African Unity (OAU),
Zuma said in his remarks seen as an indication of the South
African government to help push for good governance in Africa.
</P>
<P>
South Africa has set its objectives to promote democratization
and respect for human rights, to endeavor to prevent conflicts and
promote the peaceful solution to disputes, and to advance
sustainable development and poverty alleviation.

ABU DHABI, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Passengers released from the
hijacked Indian Airlines plane are now receiving medical check in
Dubai, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and they will soon be sent
back to India, informed sources here said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The 26 Indian passengers, mostly women, children and injured,
were released by the armed hijackers early Saturday morning when
the Airbus-300 stayed at the Al Minhad Airbase near Dubai city.
</P>

<P>
In a statement Haqqani said the hijacked plane was allowed to
land at Kandahar airport after the Indian government requested for
permission because the plane was running short of fuel.
</P>
<P>
The hijackers have not disclosed their nationality, he said,
adding that safety of the passengers and crew members is the main

</P>
<P>
The Taliban have taken several measures to ensure safety of the

However, the Taliban authorities did not grant landing
permission to the plane, he said.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday morning, the plane again came towards Afghanistan
after about five-hour-stay at Dubai and the pilot requested the

<HEADLINE> Pak Regrets Indian Allegations in Regard to Plane Hijacking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Saturday deeply
regretted that the Indian media is engaged in "a tirade of
baseless and malicious allegations" in regard to the hijacking of
the Indian aircraft.
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Office Spokesman said in a statement that "it is
deplorable that the Indian media is exploiting the fate of more
than 150 of its innocent nationals in a perverse attempt at
propaganda against Pakistan."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted that Pakistan on Friday had first denied
permission to the hijacked Indian aircraft to land at Lahore
airport.
</P>
<P>
"This refusal was reflective of the bitter experience of the
stage-managed drama of hijacking of the Indian aircraft `Ganga' in
1971 by the Indian intelligence agency, RAW. India had
subsequently used the pretext of the hijacking to stop over
flights between former West and East Pakistan," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the hijacked plane was allowed to land at
Lahore airport Friday night on humanitarian grounds and in
response to the appeals made by the Indian authorities at several
levels.
</P>
<P>
Indian Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh has publicly acknowledged
the help and assistance provided by Pakistan, the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan condemns terrorism in all its forms and
manifestations. Pakistan considers hijacking as a particularly
heinous crime as it puts innocent lives at risk. In this case also
the Pakistan government had immediately last evening condemned the
hijacking," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan cannot allow anybody to embroil in such dastardly
acts," he added.

<HEADLINE> Russia Starts Operation to Storm Grozny: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Russian federal forces
launched a key stage of an operation to storm Grozny, capital of
the breakaway republic of Chechnya, Friday midnight, the Itar-Tass
news agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The goal of this stage is to take full control of Grozny and
to clear the city of rebels, Itar-Tass quoted credible sources at
the staff of the federal army grouping as saying.
</P>
<P>
A 500-member force of Chechen volunteers headed by Grozny's
former mayor Beslan Gantamirov, is fighting a way into central
Grozny from three directions, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
An Interfax report citing Chechen sources said that intensive
fighting has been underway in Grozny since Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
Federal soldiers of the Western and Eastern groups are
advancing from the city outskirts and tightening their
encirclement of the Chechen rebels with heavy artillery pounding
the city throughout the night and morning, said the report.
</P>
<P>
While explosions are heard "almost every minute" and large-
caliber weapons are firing from all directions, the Russian troops
are using smoke as a screen to keep the rebels from being able to
fire accurately at their armored vehicles, said the report.

strong French community in the country, the French Foreign
Ministry said on Saturday.

<P>
The spokeswoman of the foreign ministry Anne Gazeau-Secret also

deployment of France in Cote d'Ivoire," said the foreign ministry
in a statement.

<HEADLINE> India in Direct Contact with Afghanistan on Hijacking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 25 (Xinhua) -- India is now in direct
contact with the Afghan authorities, who promised to provide all
possible assistance to the passengers and the crew members of the
hijacked Indian plane, External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh
said here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"We are in direct contact with the Civil Aviation Minister of
Afghanistan who is now at Kandahar," the minister told the media
after a core-group meeting of ministers.
</P>
<P>
The identity of the hijackers "has not yet been established,
nor have they indicated about their demands," Singh said.
</P>
<P>
However, Minister of State for Civil Aviation Chaman Lal Gupta
said that a group calling itself "Islamic Salvation Front" had
claimed responsibility for the hijacking of the plane of the
Indian Airlines.
</P>
<P>
Gupta told reporters that the front rang up Delhi Airport
Control room at 1030 hours local time (1600 GMT) and claimed the
responsibility for the hijacking.
</P>
<P>
The group also revealed the names of two activists as Mushtaq
Ahmed Zargar and Jilani but did not disclose the name of the third
one.
</P>
<P>
The Press Trust of India (PTI) said Zargar, one of the
militants whose release had been demanded by an anonymous caller
claiming to be from the "Islamic Salvation Front," belongs to the
Jammu and Kashmir Islamic Front.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said Zargar was arrested by Indian security
forces in 1997 and is now lodged in a jail in Jammu.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the front is a shadow group of some of the
militant organizations active in the disputed Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Saturday morning, Civil Aviation Minister Sharad Yadav
left for Dubai with a special plane to bring back the 27 released
passengers of the hijacked aircraft, official sources here said.
</P>
<P>
The news of the release of the passengers brought little cheer
to their relatives who have been anxiously waiting at the Indira
Gandhi International Airport here as some of their family members
are still aboard the hijacked plane.
</P>
<P>
Three bodies and 26 passengers were reportedly offloaded from
the hijacked airbus-300 at Minhat airforce base near Dubai this
morning.
</P>
<P>
However, reports from Islamabad said the hijackers released 27
passengers and offloaded the body of another who was killed at
Minhat airbase near Dubai before landing at Kandahar in southern
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The announcement of the name of Ripon Katyal, who has been
identified as one of the passengers shot dead, left mothers
sobbing,fathers speechless and relatives of the passengers
smouldering with anger at the airport here.
</P>
<P>
The relatives of Katyal, who had gone to Kathmandu with his
wife Rachna on a honeymoon trip, were shell-shocked and wondered
what would be the fate of Rachna who is still among the passengers
at the mercy of hijackers.
</P>
<P>
Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee today termed the
hijacking as "barbaric and cowardly" and said India would not be
cowed down by such acts.
</P>
<P>
"This is a very cowardly act. India will never be cowed down by
such barbaric acts," Vajpayee told the media at his residence.
</P>
<P>
The hijacked Indian Airlines plane with 161 passengers and the
crew on board landed in southern Afghan city of Kandahar, some 650
km from Kabul Saturday morning, 16 hours after the aircraft was
seized during a flight from Kathmandu to New Delhi Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
Indian Airlines authorities said that all efforts were being
made to resolve the issue as early as possible but the problem is
that India did not have diplomatic relations with Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> Feature: First Christmas in Macao After Handover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 25 (Xinhua) -- When kids in the Macao Special
Administrative Region (SAR) woke up Saturday morning, to their
great delight, they again got their favorite gifts from the long
stockings hung on Christmas trees, just as the previous years.
</P>
<P>
Barely concluding their gala for Macao's long-anticipated
return to the motherland, Macanese embraced one of their most
important traditional festivals, Christmas, with just the same
enthusiasm as before.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few days, tapes of Christmas carols have been
played in department stores, small shops and hotels, prompting
people to buy more than they could image in advance.
</P>
<P>
City lights in the tourist Mecca became even more dazzling with
Christmas decorations.
</P>
<P>
The Christmas eve carnival lasted till the small hours of
Christmas morning. Starting from dust, merry-makers and religious
adherents had been plying the streets from the square in front of
the downtown municipal council to the S. Domingo Church, from the
ruins of the St. Paul Church to the Cathedral Hill, making almost
every nearby street bustling with people and activity.
</P>
<P>
While adoring colorful lights, many churchgoers wore Santa
Claus hats they had just bought from street vendors. Shop owners
slashed their price down to record lows to lure customers for last-
minute deals.
</P>
<P>
At the square in front of the municipal council, hundreds were
standing to enjoy the Christmas concert. Most of the time the gate
to the St. Domingo Church was closed to allow a certain number of
churchgoers for service in rotation.
</P>
<P>
In front of the ruins of the St. Paul Church, more than one
hundred people in white were singing Christmas carols, while
thousands were sitting on the escalating steps leading to the
remaining front gate of the old church, a landmark of Macao.
</P>
<P>
Listeners all seemed quiet and intent, gazing into the distance.
</P>
<P>
A young man sat by quietly, watching his girl friend in the
singing group. He said Catholicism has an influential presence in
Macao. In addition, many people used to study in Catholic schools.
</P>
<P>
Toward midnight, the Great Catholic Church was brightly lit and
packed with some 1,000 people, many having to stand at the door.
The believers included Chinese, Macao-born Portuguese and
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
Following the mid-night sound of the church bell, the bishop
began to deliver prayers in both Portuguese and Cantonese amid a
majestic atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
Nearby, the Casino Lisboa, the largest gambling house in Macao,
remained busting on the Christmas eve. Arrays of slot machines
gave clangourous sounds, and people gathered around gambling
tables in fine order.
</P>
<P>
Deep into the night, more than 20 people dressed in choir
costume had photos taken outside the barracks of the Chinese
People's Liberation Army (PLA) troops stationed in the Macao SAR.
</P>
<P>
Braving chilly wind, two soldiers stood still inside the
barracks. About 500 PLA officers and men marched into Macao on
December 20. "I just want to say merry Christmas to the soldiers,
"a choir girl said excitedly.
</P>
<P>
A young man studying in the University of Macao also expressed
a similar feeling of excitement. "Although it is colder tonight
than the Christmas eve last year, we all feel much happier, for we
are reunited with the motherland."
</P>
<P>
Immersed in the festive environment brought about by Santa
Claus on the Christmas day, many Macao residents went to visit the
PLA barracks, the site for Macao's power handover ceremony, and
the large bronze lotus sent to the Macao SAR government by the
central government.

<HEADLINE> Nepal to Tighten Security at Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, December 25 (Xinhua) -- The National Civil Aviation
Security Committee has decided to suggest to the Emergency Cabinet
Meeting that a commission should be formed to make extensive
investigations over the hijacking of an Indian Airlines plane by
unidentified people and submit a report within 15 days.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at an emergency meeting held here
Saturday by the committee, according to a press communique
released Saturday by the Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also decided to contact units concerned to take
initiative for the safe release of the passengers and crew of the
hijacked plane.
</P>
<P>
The communique said the security committee has directed that
employees of all units at Tribhuvan International Airport who were
on duty for Indian Airlines flight before the plane took off
should not be placed on duty again pending another order.
</P>
<P>
The Royal Nepal Airlines has been directed to arrange for some
additional flights in view of the inconvenience caused to
travelers by the cancellation of some Indian Airlines flights on
the India-Nepal sector following the hijack, the communique said.
</P>
<P>
Indian Airlines flight number 814 with 178 passengers and 11
crew members on board was hijacked Friday on its way from

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 25 (Xinhua) -- The new strongman of Cote
d'Ivoire, General Robert Guei, said on Saturday that he was
negotiating with France on the evacuation of the toppled president
of the country Henri Konan Bedie to France.
</P>
<P>
Agence France-Presse quoted Guei as saying that he hoped that
Bedie could leave Cote d'Ivoire as early as Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
He said that Bedie had been brought to the airport by a
helicopter at dawn and a plane would pick him up.
</P>
<P>
However, the French embassy in Abidjan denied that France would
arrange an immediate departure of President Bedie, although France
would negotiate with the rebels to ensure his safe evacuation.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Abidjan said that a battalion of the French navy
has taken control of the airport of the city and driven the rebel
soldiers from the airport.
</P>
<P>
But the reports were denied by French diplomats in Abidjan, who
said that a military intervention by French troops is "
impracticable."
</P>
<P>
France has 550 soldiers permanently deployed in Cote d'Ivoire.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: UAE Promotes Arab Unity Through Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, December 25 (Xinhua) -- In 1999, the United Arab
Emirates conspicuously contributed to cementing the unity and
solidarity of the Arab world by providing support to fellow Arab
countries and soliciting support from them as well.
</P>
<P>
In September, the UAE led an Arab protest campaign against the
United States' entertainment giant, Disney Co., because the company
was to allow Israel to depict Jerusalem as its capital in a
cultural exhibition celebrating the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
In response to the call of the UAE, many Arab and Islamic
countries threatened to boycott Disney's products should the
Israeli exhibit at Disney's Epcot center in Florida, the U.S., be
allowed to go ahead on October 1 without any changes.
</P>
<P>
Israel regards all of Jerusalem as its "eternal and indivisible
capital" while Arabs insist that Arab East Jerusalem, captured by
Israel in the 1967 war, should be the capital of a future
Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Bowing to Arab pressure, Disney promised at last that the
Israeli exhibit would not carry any reference to Jerusalem as the
capital of Israel, assuring Arabs that the entertainment firm would
not take a position on the question of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
While providing backing to fellow Arab countries, the UAE also
tried to seek support from them, particularly in solving its long-
standing dispute with Islamic neighbor Iran over the three Gulf
islands of Abu Musa, Greater and Lesser Tunbs.
</P>
<P>
The islands, which are located near strategic shipping lanes in
the Hormuz Strait through which about one-fifth of the world's oil
supply passes, are claimed by both the UAE and Iran, but have been
controlled by Tehran since early 1970s when British forces
retreated from the region.
</P>
<P>
The UAE called for either direct talks with Iran or
international arbitration of the dispute and has pressed to take
the matter to the International Court of Justice. Iran has said it
favors direct negotiations but has not addressed UAE insistence on
a set agenda and timetable.
</P>
<P>
The UAE has also charged that Iran only wants to discuss
sovereignty of the larger Abu Musa island, not the Greater and
Lesser Tunbs.
</P>
<P>
Aware of its weakness in facing a powerful Iran, the UAE has
been calling for help from the Arab world, particularly Arab
organizations such as the Arab League and the GCC.
</P>
<P>
A GCC panel grouping the Omani, Qatari and Saudi foreign
ministers was set up last July after the UAE accused its Gulf
allies of pressing ahead with a rapprochement with Tehran at the
expense of its claims over the islands. Iran has rejected the
panel.
</P>
<P>
The UAE has always advocated the defusing of differences among
Arabs and maintained that they take common positions and
coordinated actions on important international and regional issues,
noting that solidarity and unity will make the Arab nation strong.
</P>
<P>
The small Gulf Arab state sees itself as the outcome of the Arab
unity thinking.
</P>
<P>
On December 2, 1971, six tiny emirates, Abu Dhabi, Dubai,
Sharjah, Fujairah, Umm Al Qaiwain and Ajman, formed the larger UAE
federation. A seventh emirate, Ras Al Khaimah, joined the
federation on February 11, 1972.
</P>
<P>
The UAE has also played a significant role in the establishment
of the Gulf Arab political and economic alliance, the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC), which was set up on May 25, 1981. The
GCC comprises the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and
Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
The UAE also vowed to give full support to the work of the Arab
League, the largest and most influential Arab organization.
</P>
<P>
A major way the oil-rich state uses to influence other Arab
countries and sell the Arab unity idea is through material and
financial aid.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that by the end of 1998, the non-repayable
grants and long-term easy loans offered by the UAE government to
other countries totaled 5.9 billion dirhams (about 1.6 billion U.S.
dollars), of which 5.1 billion dirhams (about 1.4 billion dollars),
or 87 percent, were directed to financing 57 projects in Arab
countries.

</P>
<P>
A young man sat by quietly, watching his girl friend in the
singing group. He said Catholicism has an influential presence in
Macao. In addition, many people used to study in Catholic schools.
</P>
<P>
Toward midnight, the Great Catholic Church was brightly lit and
packed with some 1,000 people, many having to stand at the door.
The believers included Chinese, Macao-born Portuguese and
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
Following the mid-night sound of the church bell, the bishop
began to deliver prayers in both Portuguese and Cantonese amid a
majestic atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
Nearby, the Casino Lisboa, the largest gambling house in Macao,
remained busting on the Christmas eve. Arrays of slot machines
gave clangourous sounds, and people gathered around gambling
tables in fine order.
</P>
<P>
Deep into the night, more than 20 people dressed in choir
costume had photos taken outside the barracks of the Chinese
People's Liberation Army (PLA) troops stationed in the Macao SAR.
</P>
<P>
Braving chilly wind, two soldiers stood still inside the
barracks. About 500 PLA officers and men marched into Macao on
December 20. "I just want to say marry Christmas to the soldiers,"
a choir girl said excitedly.
</P>
<P>
A young man studying in the University of Macao also expressed
a similar feeling of excitement. "Although it is colder tonight
than the Christmas eve last year, we all feel much happier, for we
are reunited with the motherland."
</P>
<P>
Immersed in the festive environment brought about by Santa
Claus on the Christmas day, many Macao residents went to visit the
PLA barracks, the site for Macao's power handover ceremony, and
the large bronze lotus sent to the Macao SAR government by the
central government.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Blast Wounds 7 Policemen in Cape Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Police here confirmed
Saturday that seven policemen were injured, two of them seriously,
when a bomb was hurled at them in a well-planned ambush Friday
night in Cape Town, a tourist resort in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Policemen sped to the Absolut Vodka club and restaurant after
being informed by telephone of a bomb threat. Arriving at the club,
they spotted a car speeding off. Shortly afterwards, there was a
tremendous blast, audible from seven kilometers away.
</P>
<P>
It is believed the assailants threw an explosive device in the
midst of the police officers as they stepped onto the pavement.
Since the restaurant was nearly empty at the time, the attack
might aim specifically at the police.
</P>
<P>
Newly appointed Western Cape police commissioner Lennit Max
said it was unknown at this stage what type of device had exploded.
There was no visible damage to the restaurant.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the timing of the blast -- on Christmas Eve --,
the police explained that this kind of people always tries to get
the biggest publicity and warned that similar incident might
happen in the coming New Year's day.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Blasts Beer Distribution Point in Zanzibar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 25 (Xinhua) -- A large bomb blasted a
major beer distribution point in Zanzibar town on Thursday
midnight, but no one was injured, the media here reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A large explosion followed by heavy smoke emanated from the
building where the distributor stores the beer, the independent
paper "Guardian" reported.
</P>
<P>
So far, no one has claimed responsibility for the bomb attack
which has sent shock waves throughout the spice islands, police
sources were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Although no official statement has been made by the police,
military bomb experts said the blast was likely to have been
caused by a land mine.
</P>
<P>
Moslem fundamentalists who are against heavy drinking of beer
associated with Saturday's Christmas festivals in the isles, could
be behind the explosion, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
More than 90 percent of Zanzibar's population are moslems who
are currently fasting during the Holy month of Ramadan where
drinking is strictly prohibited among Islam followers.
</P>
<P>
The beer agent, Utapoa, located at Mikunguni area in Zanzibar
town, is one of the largest beer distributors in the island.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: UAE Promotes Arab Unity Through Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, November 25 (Xinhua) -- In 1999, the United Arab
Emirates conspicuously contributed to cementing the unity and
solidarity of the Arab world by providing support to fellow Arab
countries and soliciting support from them as well.
</P>
<P>
In September, the UAE led an Arab protest campaign against the
United States' entertainment giant, Disney Co., because the company
was to allow Israel to depict Jerusalem as its capital in a
cultural exhibition celebrating the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
In response to the call of the UAE, many Arab and Islamic
countries threatened to boycott Disney's products should the
Israeli exhibit at Disney's Epcot center in Florida, the U.S., be
allowed to go ahead on October 1 without any changes.
</P>
<P>
Israel regards all of Jerusalem as its "eternal and indivisible
capital" while Arabs insist that Arab East Jerusalem, captured by
Israel in the 1967 war, should be the capital of a future
Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Bowing to Arab pressure, Disney promised at last that the
Israeli exhibit would not carry any reference to Jerusalem as the
capital of Israel, assuring Arabs that the entertainment firm would
not take a position on the question of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
While providing backing to fellow Arab countries, the UAE also
tried to seek support from them, particularly in solving its long-
standing dispute with Islamic neighbor Iran over the three Gulf
islands of Abu Musa, Greater and Lesser Tunbs.
</P>
<P>
The islands, which are located near strategic shipping lanes in
the Hormuz Strait through which about one-fifth of the world's oil
supply passes, are claimed by both the UAE and Iran, but have been
controlled by Tehran since early 1970s when British forces
retreated from the region.
</P>
<P>
The UAE called for either direct talks with Iran or
international arbitration of the dispute and has pressed to take
the matter to the International Court of Justice. Iran has said it
favors direct negotiations but has not addressed UAE insistence on
a set agenda and timetable.
</P>
<P>
The UAE has also charged that Iran only wants to discuss
sovereignty of the larger Abu Musa island, not the Greater and
Lesser Tunbs.
</P>
<P>
Aware of its weakness in facing a powerful Iran, the UAE has
been calling for help from the Arab world, particularly Arab
organizations such as the Arab League and the GCC.
</P>
<P>
A GCC panel grouping the Omani, Qatari and Saudi foreign
ministers was set up last July after the UAE accused its Gulf
allies of pressing ahead with a rapprochement with Tehran at the
expense of its claims over the islands. Iran has rejected the
panel.
</P>
<P>
The UAE has always advocated the defusing of differences among
Arabs and maintained that they take common positions and
coordinated actions on important international and regional issues,
noting that solidarity and unity will make the Arab nation strong.
</P>
<P>
The small Gulf Arab state sees itself as the outcome of the Arab
unity thinking.
</P>
<P>
On December 2, 1971, six tiny emirates, Abu Dhabi, Dubai,
Sharjah, Fujairah, Umm Al Qaiwain and Ajman, formed the larger UAE
federation. A seventh emirate, Ras Al Khaimah, joined the
federation on February 11, 1972.
</P>
<P>
The UAE has also played a significant role in the establishment
of the Gulf Arab political and economic alliance, the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC), which was set up on May 25, 1981. The
GCC comprises the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and
Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
The UAE also vowed to give full support to the work of the Arab
League, the largest and most influential Arab organization.
</P>
<P>
A major way the oil-rich state uses to influence other Arab
countries and sell the Arab unity idea is through material and
financial aid.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that by the end of 1998, the non-repayable
grants and long-term easy loans offered by the UAE government to
other countries totaled 5.9 billion dirhams (about 1.6 billion U.S.
dollars), of which 5.1 billion dirhams (about 1.4 billion dollars),
or 87 percent, were directed to financing 57 projects in Arab
countries.

<HEADLINE> Burundi Opposition Party Urges Arrest of MP Killers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 25 (Xinhua) -- The Front for Democracy
in Burundi (FRODEBU), a major opposition party in the country, has
called on the Burundi military government to immediately arrest
killers of a member of parliament from FRODEBU, media here
reported.
</P>
<P>
The Bujumbura government should arrest all killers of Gabriel
Gisabwamana, and they should be charged for assassinating an
innocent MP, FRODEBU National Chairman Jeen Minani was quoted as
saying Thursday in Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
Minani said any failure by the Burundi military government to
arrest the killers would be tantamount to a deliberate provocation
to FRODEBU members and sympathizers within and without Burundi,
the independent paper "Guardian" reported.
</P>
<P>
If no single arrest of the assailants would be made, such a
failure should prompt FRODEBU to quit the Arusha peace process and
give room to the Burundi government to delay the whole peace
initiatives under the Mwanlimu Nyerere Foundation, the chairman
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Gisabwamana was shot dead by unidentified gunmen on Monday
night on the way to his residence in Bujumbura, capital of Burundi,
making the toll of MPs killed since the 1993 coup attempt to date
reach 24.
</P>
<P>
No single arrest of the assailants has been made so far.

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar's Opposition Party Warns Against Constitution Amendment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 25 (Xinhua) -- The main opposition
party in Zanzibar, Civic United Front (CUF), warned Friday that
the Isles can be plunged into political turmoil if the proposed
amendment to the Zanzibar Constitution is not blocked, media here
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Chama Cha Mapinduci (CCM) party proposed to rewrite
the constitution in order to pave the way for President Salmin
Amour's third term, which contradicted the reconciliation reached
this year between the two rival parties, CUF Secretary General
Seif Sharif Hamad was quoted as saying by the independent Guardian
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Hamad said that time is not ripe for the constitutional
amendments and even if amendments were needed, provisions in the
reconciliation pact about fundamental mechanism must be followed
</P>
<P>
His remarks came days after reports surfaced that the Zanzibar
Revolutionary Government is planning to have the constitution
changed so as to lift the term limit of the presidency, said the
paper.
</P>
<P>
The current Zanzibar constitution provides two five-year terms
for the elected head of the state.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar remains a semi-autonomous state with its own
government and parliament although it joined Tanganyika in forming
the nation of Tanzania in 1964.

DAR ES SALAAM, December 25 (Xinhua) -- A total of 1,016
firearms and 5,650 rounds of ammunition were seized by Tanzanian
police in several refugee regions of the country from January 1998

<HEADLINE> Taliban Refuse Indian Demands for Hijack Rescue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 25 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban Saturday
refused India's demands for a rescue attempt on a hijacked Indian
Airlines plane which landed in the southern Afghan city of
Kandahar in the morning, Taliban sources said.
</P>
<P>
Taliban soldiers surrounded the aircraft and but resisted
Indian demands for a rescue attempt.
</P>
<P>
"We are in contact with the Indian government. They insist that
we should save the passengers. But we think it is too risky," the
Taliban's Foreign Minister Wakil Ahmad Mutawakil was quoted by a
report from Kabul as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We have given food and water for the plane. And we want to
give fuel to it and dismiss it. We believe that the plane should
be dismissed, but the Indians insist we save the passengers in
some way," said Mutawakil.
</P>
<P>
"It is not easy to save the passengers. Nobody has been allowed
inside the plane and we do not know the identity of the hijackers,
" he added.
</P>
<P>
"We are in contact only with the pilots through their radio. We
have not talked with the hijackers," he said, adding that "nobody
has been let in or out of the plane."
</P>
<P>
He also said the Taliban militia were not involved in the
hijacking.
</P>
<P>
The Indian Airlines Airbus-300, which was hijacked during a
flight Friday afternoon from Kathmandu to New Delhi, landed at 08:
03 a.m. (0303 GMT) in Kandahar, the stronghold of the ruling
Afghan Taliban militia.
</P>
<P>
Kandahar was the fourth stop in this terrifying journey in
which at least one passenger was killed by the heavily-armed
hijackers.
</P>
<P>
The plane, with still 150 people on board, took off from a
military base near Dubai, the United Arab Emirates, after
refueling and a stay on the ground for nearly five hours. About 30
to 35 passengers, all of them women and children, are reported to
have been released by the hijackers at Dubai.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Indian Airlines plane landed in Pakistan's eastern
city of Lahore bordering India and was provided with fuel and food
at the demand of the hijackers.
</P>
<P>
The hijackers' demands and identity are still not known. They
are only identified as Hindi-speaking people.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Urges Filipinos to Support Economic Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada Saturday urged Filipinos to support the government's
economic reforms through charter changes, saying that reforms will
bring down the costs of delivering services to the people.
</P>
<P>
On his weekly radio-TV program, Estrada said that with economic
reforms in place, his administration can attract more foreign
investors to pour more capital to modernize the country's
telecommunications, power and electricity distribution,
transportation and waterworks.
</P>
<P>
"We have studied why we were being left behind by other
countries in terms of economic progress. We found out that one of
the reasons is that we limit foreign investors from investing here,
especially in our public utilities sector," he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the present constitution, foreign investments in most
Philippine industries cannot exceed 40 percent of their total
shares.
</P>
<P>
A study done by the Preparatory Commission on Constitutional
Reforms (PCCR) showed that amending the economic provisions of the
constitution to attract foreign investors is necessary to save the
Philippines' under-performing economy.
</P>
<P>
But the commission also made it clear that ownership of
agricultural and residential lands should remain with Filipinos.
</P>
<P>
Estrada called on the Filipinos to support the government's
efforts to push for economic reforms through the charter changes.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Cites Buoyant Economy in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said Saturday that 1999 was a better year for the
Philippine economy, with a more prosperous future for the
Filipinos in the coming millennium.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said in a radio-TV program that 1999 also marked the
year when he was able to get a better grip of the nation's
problems and implement his administration's priority programs for
the poor.
</P>
<P>
Despite rising oil prices, he said, the government this year
was able to stabilize prices of basic commodities, due mainly to
the country's strong economic fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
"Our economy is now more buoyant, this claim is supported by
statistics. This is shown in our inflation rate, and the fact that
despite the oil price increase, prices of basic goods remain
stable. This shows our economy is better," he said.
</P>
<P>
The economy's positive performance in 1999 was due primarily to
the 6.3 percent growth of the agricultural sector and sustained
export growth, he said.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate for November this year stood at only 3.9
percent, the lowest in 12 years, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, the country's unemployment rate
also dropped to 9.7 percent from last year's 10.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The government estimated that the country's GDP could grow 3
percent this year, compared to a negative 0.5 percent last year.

<HEADLINE> Writethru: Hijacked Indian Plane Lands in Kandahar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 25 (Xinhua) -- A hijacked Indian Airlines
plane landed Saturday morning in the southern Afghan city of
Kandahar after refueling and releasing all women and children
aboard at Dubai, the United Arab Emirates, Taliban sources said.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the Airbus-300, with still about 150 people on
board, landed at Kandahar, the Taliban headquarters at 8:33 a.m.
local time (0303 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Taliban's Foreign Minister Mulvi Mutawakil told reporters: "
They asked us to give permission, telling us the plane was low on
fuel and the pilots have had no rest or sleep for 20 hours," the
Afghan Islamic Press quoted Mutawakil as saying.
</P>
<P>
"That is why we gave the permission to land," Mutawakil said,
adding the Taliban have provided the demanded fuel, food and
medical supplies, and wanted the plane to leave Afghanistan as
early as possible.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban had nothing to do with the hijacking, the Taliban
official said. "We will not allow anybody to come out of the plane.
"
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Taliban soldiers surrounded the hijacked plane after
its landing at Kandahar early Saturday.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the Taliban refused permission for the plane to land
in Kabul, the Afghan capital.
</P>
<P>
The plane was hijacked Friday afternoon soon after take-off
from the Nepalese capital of Kathmandu. The plane was destined for
New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
The plane, with 185 people including 11 crew members on board
when it was hijacked, landed in the Indian border city of Amritsar
and Pakistan's Lahore before trying to land in Kabul.
</P>
<P>
"We did not want to allow the plane to land in Afghanistan so
that our relations do not worsen with India," a report from Kabul
quoted a Taliban spokesman as saying.
</P>
<P>
The plane then landed at an airbase near Dubai in the United
Arab Emirates and stayed there for five hours before it headed
back to Afghanistan early Saturday.
</P>
<P>
One report said about 30 to 35 passengers -- all women,
children and the injured -- were released by the hijackers.
</P>
<P>
The identity of the hijackers and their motives behind the
hijacking were not immediately known. It is reported that there
are altogether five hijackers who speak Hindi, a majority language
of India.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban authorities are now negotiating with the hijackers
through the pilots.
</P>
<P>
Unconfirmed reports had earlier said that four passengers were
short dead by the heavily-armed hijackers. Other reports said at
least one dead body was removed from the aircraft at Dubai.

NEW DELHI, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Indian Civil Aviation
Minister Sharad Yadav left here Saturday morning for Dubai on a

hijacked aircraft belonging to the Indian Airlines, official
sources here said.
</P>
<P>
Three bodies were reportedly offloaded the hijacked airbus-300
and 26 passengers were released at Minhat airforce base near Dubai
Saturday morning.

Sikh militants, released 27 passengers and offloaded the body of
one more passenger who was killed at Minhat airbase before landing
in Kandahar in southern Afghanistan.

resolve the issue as early as possible but added that the
difficulty is that India did not have diplomatic relations with
the Taliban authorities.

<P>
KATHMANDU, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Prime Minister
Krishna Prasad Bhattarai has offered to step down to avert a party
twist after half of the parliamentarians in the ruling Nepali
Congress (NC) rebelled against him last week and singed a petition
seeking his ouster, the Kathmandu Post reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"During the party's central working committee (CWC) today, NC
President Girija Prasad Koirala told the members that an agreement
has been reached that the prime minister would voluntarily step
down at the right time," NC spokesman Narhari Acharya was quoted
as saying Friday after the CWC meeting.
</P>
<P>
Acharya refused to say what the "right time" was or when
Bhattarai would resign. However, party sources said Bhattarai has
agreed to quit after the winter session of parliament on health
grounds.
</P>
<P>
The winter session of parliament usually convenes around March
or April.
</P>
<P>
Koirala told the meeting that the leadership would be
transferred to leaders of the younger generation, and instead of
filing a no-confidence motion against the prime minister at the NC
's parliamentary party, Bhattarai would voluntarily step down.
</P>
<P>
The agreement between Bhattarai and Koirala has averted an
immediate disturbance in the ruling party. The NC was rocked last
week after party President Koirala asked Prime Minister Bhattarai
to step down in keeping with the demand made by over 60 lawmakers
from the ruling party who maintained that Bhattarai had failed as
the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Koirala loyalists outnumber Bhattarai supporters both in the
party's CWC and parliamentary party.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which followed a series of private consultations
between the party's warring leaders in the past few days, is
likely to effectively pre-empt the NC parliamentary party's
proposed move to elect a new parliamentary leader.
</P>
<P>
The party rebels have alleged that Bhattarai has been unable to
curb the ultra-leftist violent activities and put a lid on
corruption and spiraling market prices, thus having failed to
deliver on the party's prime election pledges.

<P>
PHNOM PENH, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Cold winds have hit
Cambodia in the past few days, raising fears that many more poor
people will be falling ill with no adequate clothing and shelter.
</P>
<P>
The temperatures in the capital, according to local
meteorologists, plunged to less than 18 degrees centigrade this
week, much colder than previous years. In other provinces and in
the highlands, the temperatures are much lower, dropping to 12 to
15 degrees centigrade.
</P>
<P>
The unusually cold weather and gusts of wind forced many people
to buy second-hand clothes and blankets in Phnom Penh.
</P>
<P>
What the government worries most is that many elderly people
and children living in the capital's squatter areas are falling
sick with colds, flu and headaches, as they have no enough
blankets and coats to warm themselves up.
</P>
<P>
The cold snap will stay for another two or three days,
according to the Ministry of Water Resource.

CARACAS, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The Venezuelan gross domestic
product fell by 7.2 percent in 1999, the biggest reduction in the
past 10 years, the Central Bank said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The drop was mainly caused by the strong recession of the oil
sector, which generates 30 percent of the country's income.
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelan oil products contracted 6.8 percent this year,
while non-oil products were down 6.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelan economy has been affected by oil price drop and
capital withdrawal from emerging markets. The oil price drop that

<HEADLINE> Hijacked Indian Airlines Plane Takes Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Abu Dhabi, December 25 (Xinhua) -- The hijacked Indian passenger
plane has taken off from a military base near Dubai, the United
Arab Emirates, after refueling and a stay on the ground for nearly
five hours.
</P>
<P>
Thirty to 35 passengers have been freed by the air pirates. They
were women, children and the injured.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the plane has taken on 30 tons of fuel and
was headed eastward, where it had come from. Their next destination
is unknown.
</P>
<P>
The plane was provided with food, water and medical supplies at
the hijackers' request. The UAE authorities were negotiating with
the hijackers before the plane took off.
</P>
<P>
The plane, with 189 people aboard, was hijecked more than 14
hours ago and landed at Minhad military air base, less than 40
kilometers west of Dubai, at around 2000 GMT Friday night.
</P>
<P>
The nationalities of the hijackers, reported to number five, and
their motives, remained unknown. Local TV reports said they spoke
English with accent. At least two passengers aboard were reportedly
killed and five more injured.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Muhammad Bin Rashid, Dubai's crown prince and defense
minister of the United Arab Emirates, rushed to the air base to
handle the situation.
</P>
<P>
The UAE Information Minister Abdullah bin Zayed was quoted as
saying that his government allowed the plane to land for
humanitarian reasons, he said.
</P>
<P>
The plane was previously reported to be trying to land at Dubai
international airport in the UAE, but was diverted to the air base
for it could pose threat to the heavy traffic at the international
airport.
</P>
<P>
The plane touched down at the air base more than nine hours
after being taken over by hijackers on a flight from Nepal to
India, with 178 passengers and 11 crew.
</P>
<P>
After the hijackers took over the plane, they ordered the pilot
to divert it to Pakistan. The plane landed first at the Indian
border town of Amritsar, and then at Lahore, in northeastern
Pakistan. After refueling it took off heading for Kabul, capital of
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The Afghan authorities told the pilot that it was unsafe to land
at their airport at night, and plane then tried to land in Muscut,
capital of Oman, where it was denied permission.
</P>
<P>
The plane was en route from Katmandu, capital of Nepal to Indian
capital New Delhi and was hijacked after it crossed into Indian
airspace, reports said.

QUITO, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The Ecuadorian government Friday
announced a decision to increase the country's salaries by an
average of 12 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
The National Salaries Council said the new salary policy will
take effect from January 1 of 2000.
</P>
<P>
The increased salary amounts to 86.8 dollars at the present
rate of exchange. However, it is about 28 percent less than July's
111 dollars due to the devaluation of Ecuadorian currency sucre.
</P>
<P>
The country's inflation rate was 56.5 percent during the first
half of this year, the highest in Latin America, according to
official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Labor leader Carlos Luzardo said the salary rise was a "
Christmas gift" from the president to the poor, whose purchasing
power has been reduced by the devaluation.
</P>
<P>
Labor unions also cautioned a possible 60 percent inflation in
the near future.

<HEADLINE> Brazilian Agriculture Grows 4 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian agriculture output
amounted this year to 82.4 million tons, a four percent increase
over 1998, said Brazilian Agriculture Minister Pratini de Moraes
</P>
<P>
The country's agriculture, that registered its eight year of
steady growth, has an extraordinary strength, dynamics and
potentiality, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
The results of the sector this year are "extremely positive,"
because soybeans, sugar and coffee international prices registered
a significant increase.
</P>
<P>
"The values are not as good as it would have been desired, but
there was a noticeable improvement in comparison to the prices of
the first semester, which were very low," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Pratini de Moraes said that the government will look for a
wider world market not only for the country's raw materials, but
also for products with a bigger added value, such as meats and
fruits.
