Tourist arrivals continue to fall in Singapore
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's tourist arrivals fell by nearly 17
percent in the first half of the year from the same period in 1997,
according to government statistics reported by media Wednesday.
	   The Singapore Tourism Board said that the culprit was ongoing
economic turmoil in Asia, which has cut the number of visitors from
the region by 38 percent, The Straits Times newspaper and TV news
said. The government released the statistics Tuesday.
	   The number of Japanese and Indonesian visitors, who once made up
the bulk of arrivals in Singapore, slumped sharply.
	   Singapore relies heavily on tourism and in the past has drawn
several times its population in annual visitors. But only 3 million
tourists arrived in Singapore in the first half of 1998.
	   Still, the number of visitors from Hong Kong, China and India
has risen due to competitive packages from airline companies.

	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ A Chinese gymnast was paralyzed as
she warmed up for the Goodwill Games.
	   The injuries to Sang Lan as she practiced Tuesday night for the
women's vault came on the busiest night of the three-day-old
multisport event, with some of track's biggest stars competing just
across the road and the United States reaching the semifinals in
basketball.
	   Doctors said Sang damaged her spine in the practice accident at
Nassau Coliseum.
	   ``At this time, she is paralyzed and cannot move her legs and
she has a minimal amount of motion in her arms,'' said Dr. Brock
Schnebel, chief physician of the Goodwill Games.
	   Sang, 17, the 1997 Chinese national champion in the event, was
attempting a forward vault when she lost control in mid-air.
Gymnastics officials said she landed head-first, damaging her
spine.
	   She was carried off the floor of Nassau Coliseum on a stretcher
and taken to Nassau County Medical Center.
	   Schnebel said X-rays and a CAT scan showed Sang with a
fractured-dislocation of the sixth and seventh cervical vertebrae.
	   ``This has resulted in an injury to her spinal cord,'' the
doctor said.
	   She was conscious and awake after the accident but had no motion
in her legs and was barely able to move her hands, Schnebel said.
	   He said it was too early to predict if Lan could recover from
her injuries and be able to walk again.
	   Lan is one of three Chinese women gymnasts competing in the
Goodwill Games. Officials were trying to contact her family in
China.
	   At the track, Michael Johnson showed he's still the boss,
Maurice Greene left Donovan Bailey almost speechless and one of
track's most enduring stars showed he might at last be finished.
	   Johnson, the 1996 Olympic 200 and 400 champion, erased any
thoughts that his career might be on a downslide, winning the 400
in a meet-record 43.76 seconds.
	   Greene, who has been bad-mouthed by Bailey since winning last
year's 100-meter world championship, quieted the Canadian by racing
to victory in 9.96.
	   Bailey appeared to shut down with 80 meters left and finished
seventh at 10.30, far off his world record of 9.84.
	   But amid those highlights, Sergei Bubka, the greatest
pole-vauler in history, gave more signs that the end of his career
is near.
	   The 34-year-old Ukrainian who has set the world record 35 times
and is the only one to clear 20 feet (6.10 meters), no-heighted for
the second time in three meets. On his final try at 18 feet, 8 1/4
inches (5.69.9 meters), the 90-second time limit ran out and Bubka
did not even make an attempt at the bar.
	   Jeff Hartwig won the pole vault at 19-8 1/2 (6.01 meters),
breaking his American record by one-quarter inch.
	   In the 100, Greene blasted out of the blocks, established the
lead and beat Ato Boldon by one yard (meter).
	   ``I knew I had to capitalize on the start to win,'' Greene said.
	   Bailey offered no excuses.
	   ``My preparation was exceptional,'' he said. ``I guess I lost my
concentration out of the blocks. Then, I was down so bad _ maybe 10
or 15 meters _ I thought I'd just run through.''
	   Greene summed up the outcome: ``I guess I'm the world's fastest
man. I'm just getting started.''
	   Johnson's time was the 12th-fastest in history _ he holds nine
of the best _ and the fastest in the world since he ran 43.75 at
Waco, Texas, on April 19, 1997.
	   He broke from the blocks quickly, took a slight lead until the
eight-man field reached the final stretch, then blazed to a 6-yard
(5.48-meter) record.
	   Johnson had two losses in his three previous races, but after
winning at Rome last week he said he felt healthy for the first
time in more than a year.
	   ``The two races in Europe did me a lot of good,'' Johnson said,
before receiving the gold medal from heavyweight champion Evander
Holyfield.
	   Jackie Joyner-Kersee, the 36-year-old world record-holder in the
heptathlon who has not completed a multi-event since the 1996
Olympic trials, looked woefully out of shape at the start of her
final heptathlon. The two-time Olympic gold medalist finished her
first four events in second place with 3,833 points, 34 behind
leader DeDee Nathan.
	   The final three heptathlon events are Wednesday.
	   Vanessa Atler, the U.S. national champion in the vault, added
the Goodwill Games gold medal. Atler, the national all-round
champion scored 9.662 to win.
	   In the men's floor exercise, Alexei Nemov of Russia won the gold
with a score of 9.725. American Jay Thornton of the United States
took the silver with 9.550.
	   Two other Americans won gymnastics medals _ Elise Ray, silver in
the women's uneven bars and Yewki Tomita, bronze in the pommel
horse.
	   The U.S. basketball team advanced to the semis with a 106-75
victory over Brazil. Elton Brand of Duke led six U.S. players in
double figures. The United States plays Lithuania in the medal
round Thursday.
	   Australia also advanced with an 82-64 victory over Lithuania.
Andrew Gaze scored 26 points for the Aussies. It was Lithuania's
its first loss.
	   In water polo, the United States lost twice by 10-5 scores.
World-champion Spain defeated the Americans with Salvador Gomez and
Ivan Perez each scoring twice. Americans Brad Schumacher, Wolf
Wigo, Chi Kredell, Chris Oeding and Todd Hosmer had one goal each.
Then Russia advanced to the gold-medal game by beating the United
States in the final round-robin match and will meet Spain for the
title.
	   Italy upset Spain 6-5 Tuesday night on a fourth-period goal by
Leonardo Sotanni. Russia earlier beat Italy 7-4. The United States
will play Italy for the bronze.

Optimistic U.N. envoy on East Timor leaves Indonesia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GEOFF SPENCER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A U.N. mediator ended a weeklong
fact-finding mission Wednesday, convinced that all sides in the
conflict over East Timor want to negotiate a peaceful solution.
	   U.N. special envoy for East Timor, Jamsheed Marker, also said a
proposed partial withdrawal of Indonesian troops would build
confidence in the troubled territory, but that some soldiers would
have to stay to maintain security.
	   Marker has been trying for years to broker a peace deal for East
Timor, ruled by Portugal for centuries before Indonesia invaded in
1975 and annexed it in 1976.
	   Since then, East Timor has endured years of guerrilla warfare
and human rights abuses.
	   Hopes of reaching a settlement have increased since Indonesia
changed presidents two months ago.
	   ``I am very satisfied with the attitude, not just of the
government, but also all the other leaders that I met,'' Marker
said at news conference at Jakarta's airport.
	   ``It seems to me that there is an earnest desire for a peaceful,
and I stress that, peaceful solution of the problems of East Timor
and there is also a desire to achieve this through dialogue,'' he
said.
	   Since he arrived in Indonesia last week, Marker has been upbeat
about the chances of reaching a deal on East Timor's future.
	   On Saturday, he met Indonesian President B.J. Habibie, who had
promised earlier to grant some autonomy to East Timor in return for
international recognition of Indonesian sovereignty there.
	   Habibie became president in May when Indonesia's former
authoritarian leader Suharto stepped down. Suharto ordered the 1975
invasion and later steadfastly refused to make compromises despite
the prolonged conflict.
	   Habibie has rejected demands by separatists for a referendum on
outright independence. Indonesia regards East Timor as its 27th
province _ something the United Nations does not recognize.
	   However, he has promised to scale down Indonesia's military
presence after separatists called for a complete troop withdrawal.
	   Marker said a reduced number of soldiers would be needed to
maintain ``peace and tranquility'' in the half-island territory,
2,000 kilometers (1,200 miles) east of Jakarta.
	   ``I think that obviously arrangements have to be made for the
maintenance of security and peace in East Timor. For that purpose,
a certain number of troops will be necessary. But that is something
that has to be worked out. Clearly all the troops can't be
withdrawn,'' he said.
	   ``The withdrawal of some troops will serve as very important
confidence builder,'' he added.
	   On Sunday, Marker made a brief and secretive visit to East
Timor, where he held talks with local officials, leaders of the
Roman Catholic Church, military commanders and former guerrillas.
	   He said all told him they wanted peace, although it was clear
problems remained.
	   ``I did get the impression that there is quiet a lot of tension
there and that it is important that be reduced,'' he said.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and the foreign ministers of
Indonesia and Portugal are to meet for talks in New York Aug. 4-5.
	   ``Hopefully at the end of that we will arrive at certain
decisions for taking constructive measures toward reaching a just
and amicable solution to the problem of East Timor,'' he said of
the scheduled talks.
	   Marker also repeated a call for closer contact between Portugal
and Indonesia by the establishment of minimal diplomatic posts
known as ``interests sections'' in each other's capitals.
	   The two countries severed diplomatic relations after the 1975
invasion.

Okinawa court gives Marines suspended prison terms
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARI YAMAGUCHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ An Okinawa court convicted two U.S. Marines of
assaulting a nightclub employee and gave them suspended prison
terms Wednesday in a case in which three American congressmen had
lodged protests to have the defendents released on bail.
	   The Okinawa District Court sentenced Pvt. Rocky Stubbs of
Coshocton, Ohio, to nine months in prison, suspended for three
years. That means he would not go to prison but remains under
surveillance for three years, court officials said.
	   Pfc. William Costello of Farmingdale, New Jersey, was sentenced
to 10 months, suspended for three years. Both Stubbs and Costello,
who pleaded innocent, had been freed on bail before the sentencing.
	   The two were charged with assaulting a nightclub employee in a
fight on March 7 at a bar near their military base on Japan's
southernmost island of Okinawa.
	   Stubbs acknowledged striking the man, and Costello said he
head-butted, kicked and hit him. Both Marines, however, said they
did so in self-defense.
	   The case drew attention in the United States when three American
congressmen lodged protests with Japan's ambassador in Washington
to win the Marines' release on bail.
	   Sens. Robert Torricelli of New Jersey and Mike DeWine of Ohio
and Rep. Christopher Smith of New Jersey met with Japanese
Ambassador Kunihiko Saito in June and said they were troubled by
reports the two Marines were interrogated for 10 to 12 hours.
	   The congressmen had also written a joint letter to Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto about the pair's treatment by Japanese
authorities.
	   A week later, Stubbs was handed over to U.S. military forces on
1.7 million yen (dlrs 126,000) in bail paid by his family and a
lawyer. Costello was released shortly after.
	   Stubbs' mother has accused the U.S. military of treating her son
unfairly to gain the favor of the Japanese amid growing opposition
against the heavy U.S. military presence on Okinawa.
	   Okinawan opposition to the heavy U.S. military presence on the
island grew after three U.S. servicemen abducted and raped a
12-year-old schoolgirl on Okinawa in September 1995. The three were
convicted in 1996 and given jail terms ranging from 6 1/2 years to
7 years.

U.N. says four of its workers slain in ambush in Tajikistan

 &UR; Eds: ADDS additional quote from Japanese foreign minister &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Four members of a U.N. observer mission
were ambushed, shot and killed while on patrol in Tajikistan, U.N.
officials said.
	   The U.N. report differed from that of Tajik officials, who said
the observers died in an accident when their car plunged off a
cliff in the Pamir Mountains about 100 miles (160 kilometers) east
of Dushanbe, capital of the Central Asian country.
	   The U.N. report came too late in the day for Tajik officials to
comment.
	   U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said information from U.N. officials
at the site confirmed the four men were shot and killed Monday
while on the road from Tavildara to Garm, about 90 miles (144
kilometers) east of the capital. The four failed to report back to
headquarters Monday and were found Tuesday.
	   The U.N. special representative for Tajikistan, Jan Kubis,
recalled all field teams to Dushanbe and was in contact with the
president and opposition groups to ensure those responsible were
brought to justice, Eckhard said.
	   ``The members of the Security Council condemn this murder,''
council President Sergey Lavrov of Russia said after the council
was briefed on the deaths.
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan was ``deeply depressed'' about the
deaths and condemned them, Eckhard said.
	   The dead were identified as military observers Maj. Ryszard
Szcwczyk of Poland and Maj. Adolfo Sharpegue of Uruguay; civil
affairs officer Yutaka Akino of Japan; and a Tajik translator,
Jourajon Mahramov.
	   ``With determination we denounce this act of murder and demand
that anyone involved be strictly punished,'' Japanese Foreign
Minister Keizo Obuchi said Wednesday.
	   ``Our country ... will demand from now on that in Tajikistan's
peace process the safety of those concerned be guaranteed, and also
demand that an effort toward realizing peace be decisively put
forward.''
	   About 70 U.N. observers are in Tajikistan to monitor a peace
deal reached last year that ended the former Soviet republic's
civil war.

Report: Parliament to probe reports of human rights violations
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Single name correct for Munir &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's Parliament has decided to
set up two fact finding missions to probe reports of missing people
and other human right violations in the troubled territories of
Aceh and Irian Jaya.
	   The mission will evaluate their status as ``military operation
regions,'' the daily Kompas reported Wednesday.
	   The news came one day after a human rights group said at least
137 people were reported missing in Aceh, an Indonesian province on
the northern tip of Sumatra.
	   Munir, a lawyer and chairman of Kontras _ Commission for the
Disappearance and Victims of Violence, said the figure was based on
reports local people made to the commission during a single week.
	   The commission, which is now dealing with the kidnapping of
pro-democracy activists nationwide, has set up three subcommittees
in Aceh, the national capital Jakarta, and Irian Jaya.
	   Munir told a news conference that the number would possibly
increase since the commission had only been in operation for a
week.
	   He did not elaborate on who the missing were, though they were
believed to likely be alleged rebels, activists or supporters of
the Free Aceh Movement gone missing due to military action.
	   Aceh is one of three Indonesian provinces where separatist bands
are fighting for independence. The other two are the former
Portuguese colony of East Timor and Irian Jaya, a former Dutch
colony on the western part of the island of New Guinea.
	   Citing the separatist movement, the Indonesian military still
classifies Aceh as a ``military operation region.''
	   A rebel band of the Free Aceh Movement has long been fighting
for an independent Islamic state in the predominantly Muslim
province, located 1,750 kilometers (1,093 miles) northwest of
Jakarta. Aceh is Indonesia's northernmost province.
	   Irian Jaya covers the western half of New Guinea, about 3,200
kilometers (2,000 miles) east of Jakarta.
	   Recently a policeman and two demonstrators were killed in
pro-independence protests in the remote province. Indonesia took
control of Irian Jaya from Dutch colonizers in 1963.

	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ Maurice Greene shut up and shot down
Donovan Bailey by winning the 100 meters. Michael Johnson proved he
has plenty left, winning the 400, and Sergei Bubka's pole-vaulting
future is in doubt after no-heighting in the Goodwill Games.
	   Greene, who has been bad-mouthed by Bailey since winning last
year's world championship, quieted the feisty Canadian by racing to
victory in 9.96 seconds Tuesday night.
	   ``It's great to beat Bailey,'' the jubilant Greene said. ``I
accelerated exceptionally well. That's why I won.''
	   Bailey, coming off a series of injuries and illnesses, appeared
to slow with 80 meters left and finished seventh at 10.30, far off
his world record of 9.84.
	   The redoubtable Johnson, the 1996 Olympic 200 and 400 champion,
erased any thoughts that his career might be on a downslide, racing
to a stunning victory with a sizzling time of 43.76, a Goodwill
Games record.
	   ``I'm healthy now,'' said Johnson, who has been besieged by
hamstring and Achilles injuries. ``I came here with the feeling I'd
win despite the injuries.''
	   Bubka, the 34-year-old Ukrainian who has set the world pole
vault record 35 times and is the only one to clear 20 feet (6.10
meters), no-heighted for the second time in three meets. With the
bar at 18 feet, 8 1/4 inches (5.69.9 meters), the 90-second time
limit ran out before Bubka could make his final attempt.
	   Jeff Hartwig won the pole vault at 19-8 3/4 (6.01 meters), an
American record by one-quarter inch and best in the world this
year.
	   ``I'm proud I've taken on the best in the world and bring
American pole vaulting back,'' Hartwig said. ``This was a
tremendous field.''
	   Greene and training partner Ato Boldon of Trinidad and Tobago,
who finished second in 10.00, both stared down Bailey before the
ballyhooed 100.
	   ``There were a whole lot of mind games going on,'' said Jon
Drummond, the fourth-place finisher.
	   Bailey took it lightly, smiling, then saying, ``Everyone's
taking this too seriously. It's time to relax.''
	   Once they got into the blocks, there was no relaxing.
	   Greene blasted out quickly, established the lead and maintained
it throughout, beating Boldon by one meter.
	   ``I knew I had to capitalize on the start to win,'' Greene said.
	   Bailey offered no excuses.
	   ``My preparation was exceptional,'' he said. ``I guess I lost my
concentration out of the blocks. Then, I was down so bad _ maybe 10
or 15 meters _ I thought I'd just run through.''
	   Greene summed up the outcome by saying, ``I guess I'm the
world's fastest man. I'm just getting started.''
	   Johnson's time was the 12th-fastest in history, of which he
holds nine of the best clockings, and the fastest in the world
since he ran 43.75 at Waco, Texas, on April 19, 1997.
	   He broke from the blocks quickly, took a slight lead until the
eight-man field reached the final stretch, then turned on the
after-burners and blazed to a convincing six-meter record.
	   Johnson's future had been clouded by two losses in his three
previous races, but after winning at Rome last week, he said he
felt healthy for the first time in more than a year and was ready
to run a fast time in the Goodwill Games.
	   ``The two races in Europe did me a lot of good,'' Johnson said
before being presented the gold medal by heavyweight champion
Evander Holyfield.
	   Tyree Washington, runnerup in 44.43, said, ``I tried to come up
at the end, but Michael was very strong. Michael ran a great
race.''
	   Butch Reynolds, the world record-holder in 43.29, finished a
distant fifth in 45.10.
	   Jackie Joyner-Kersee, the 36-year-old world record-holder in the
heptathlon who has not completed a multi-event since the 1996
Olympic trials, looked woefully out of condition in the final
heptathlon of her illustrious career. The two-time Olympic gold
medalist finished her first four events in second place with 3,833
points, 34 behind leader DeDee Nathan, but except for a 51-1 3/4
(15.59-meter) shot put, Joyner-Kersee's lack of fitness was
evident.
	   ``It's been difficult,'' Joyner-Kersee said. ``I'm trying to
stay positive and execute. I'm a fighter.''
	   The final three heptathlon events _ the long jump, javelin and
800 _ will be contested Wednesday, the final day of track and field
of the Games.
	   Noureddine Morceli, the world mile record-holder from Algeria,
swept into the lead just before the final lap and beat Kenya's
William Tanui by six meters in 3:53.39, exactly nine seconds slower
than his record. Morceli, ranked No. 1 in the world seven times,
bided his time in the pack behind the early leaders before moving
into second with 500 meters left.
	   Tanui was timed in 3:54.05, and another Kenyan, Daniel Komen,
the 1997 world 5,000-meter champion, finished third in 3:54.78
after getting tangled up with Steve Holman with 350 meters to go.
Komen appeared to cut off Holman, who fell and finished a distant
ninth.
	   Britain's Jonathan Edwards, the world record-holder in the men's
triple jump at 60-1/4 (18.29 meters), won at 57-11 (17.65 meters),
matching the second-best in the world this year. Olympic champion
Kenny Harrison, making a rare appearance because of injuries,
finished last in the eight-man field at 54-2 3/4 (16.53 meters).
	   Nigeria's Falilat Ogunkoya led all the way in winning the
women's 400 in 49.89, a Games record, and Romania's Mihaela Melinte
won the first Goodwill women's hammer throw at 238-4 (72.64
meters), the best ever in the United States and fourth-best ever in
the world.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The United States came up big when it mattered
and advanced to the semifinals of the Goodwill Games.
	   The U.S. team knew it had to beat Brazil on Tuesday night to
move on to the medal round, but it had to be by enough points to be
one of the top two teams in the three-team point-difference
tiebreaker in Pool B.
	   The 106-75 victory was more than enough, as the United States
finished as the four-team pool winner and will face Lithuania in
Thursday's semifinals at Madison Square Garden.
	   Elton Brand of Duke led six U.S. players in double figures with
17 points.
	   Puerto Rico (2-1), the third team in the three-way tie, advanced
on goal average _ points scored divided by points allowed _ and
will play Pool A champion Australia in the other semifinal.
	   The United States (2-1) hit its first seven shots in taking a
15-6 lead and it just kept pouring it on, shooting 71 percent
(22-for-31), including 6-for-10 from 3-point range, on the way to a
58-45 halftime lead.
	   The lead was as much as 19 points in the first half as the
United States' 2-3 zone defense took Brazil (2-1) out of its
usually potent offense.
	   The second half was more. The United States led by as many as 35
points, 101-66 with 3:29 left.
	   Wally Szczerbiak of Miami of Ohio had 16, Keith Carter of
Mississippi had 15, Andre Miller of Utah had 14, Dion Glover of
Georgia Tech 13 and Khalid El-Amin of Connecticut had 11.
	   Rogerio Klafke led Brazil with 17 points, 14 in the first half.
	   Things didn't start out well for the United States in the
tournament. It blew a 19-point second-half lead in a loss to Puerto
Rico on Sunday, then struggled until pulling away from China in the
final seven minutes on Monday night.
	   In Pool A, Australia beat Lithuania 82-64 Tuesday to give both
teams 2-1 record and the semifinal berths.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Coach Clem Haskins told his team a little white
lie and they turned it into a whopper of a win.
	   The United States knew it had to beat Brazil on Tuesday night to
move on to the medal round, but it had to be by enough points to be
one of the top two teams in the three-team point-difference
tiebreaker in Pool B.
	   The 106-75 victory was more than enough, as the United States
finished as the four-team pool winner and will face Lithuania in
Thursday's semifinals at Madison Square Garden.
	   Haskins did the math and the number to advance came up seven.
	   ``We realized going in it was seven but I fibbed a bit and told
the team it was eight,'' Haskins said. ``The guys were really
focused and took care of business early.''
	   Elton Brand of Duke led six U.S. players in double figures with
17 points.
	   ``It was a little nerve-wracking that we had to win by eight _
well, now we know it's seven,'' Brand said. ``I was really worried
we'd be up by eight or nine near the end and they would hit a shot
and then we'd win but we wouldn't go on.''
	   Puerto Rico (2-1), the third team in the three-way tie, advanced
on goal average _ points scored divided by points allowed _ and
will play Pool A champion Australia in the other semifinal.
	   The United States (2-1) hit its first seven shots in taking a
15-6 lead and it just kept pouring it on, shooting 71 percent
(22-for-31), including 6-for-10 from 3-point range, on the way to a
58-45 halftime lead.
	   The lead was as much as 19 points in the first half as the
United States' 2-3 zone defense took Brazil (2-1) out of its
usually potent offense.
	   The second half was more. The United States led by as many as 35
points, 101-66 with 3:29 left. The U.S. team finished 38-for-58 (66
percent) from the field and was 11-for-21 on 3s.
	   Wally Szczerbiak of Miami of Ohio had 16 points, Keith Carter of
Mississippi had 15, Andre Miller of Utah had 14 and Dion Glover of
Georgia Tech and Khalid El-Amin of Connecticut had 13.
	   ``That was a great team effort,'' Haskins said. ``When you shoot
65 percent you take care of a lot of mistakes.''
	   Rogerio Klafke led Brazil with 17 points, 14 in the first half.
	   Things didn't start out well for the United States in the
tournament. It blew a 19-point second-half lead in a loss to Puerto
Rico on Sunday, then struggled until pulling away from China in the
final seven minutes on Monday night.
	   ``We can't let up and we have had big leads in all our games,''
Szczerbiak said. ``It is just going to be a matter of us putting
the team away when we can.''
	   In Pool A, Australia beat Lithuania 82-64 Tuesday to give both
teams 2-1 record and the semifinal berths.

Report: Indonesian police chief orders officers to shoot looters
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's national police chief has
ordered his officers to shoot looters as crime rises because of a
grinding economic crisis, a newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   ``Police will take stern action against looters,'' Lt. Gen.
Roesmanhadi was quoted as saying by the newspaper Republika.
	   ``If it is necessary the police are permitted to use live
ammunition to stop unlawful acts.''
	   Other newspapers also quoted Roesmanhadi as giving the order.
	   Crime has soared in recent weeks following the resignation in
May of former autocratic President Suharto.
	   Suharto ruled Indonesia with an iron grip for 32 years, but was
forced to quit after protests and riots shook the world's fourth
most populous nation, now suffering its worst economic meltdown in
decades.
	   Inflation, unemployment and poverty rates have increased
dramatically, making life difficult for millions of Indonesians.
	   Last week Indonesia's military chief Gen. Wiranto ordered his
troops to crack down on looters after mobs raided farms and
plantations.
	   In some cases troops and police have fired warning shots over
the heads of looting crowds.
	   Disputes over land ownership have also flared recently,
including one between a group of disgruntled villagers and Suharto
over a cattle ranch.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The United States knew it had to beat Brazil on
Tuesday night to move on to the medal round, and by enough points
to win the three-team point differential tiebreaker.
	   The 106-75 victory was more than enough, as the United States
finished as the four-team pool winner and will face Lithuania in
Thursday's semifinals at Madison Square Garden.
	   Elton Brand of Duke led six U.S. players in double figures with
17 points.
	   The United States (2-1) hit its first seven shots in taking a
15-6 lead and shot 71 percent (22-for-31) on the way to a 58-45
halftime lead.
	   The lead was as much as 19 points in the first half and as many
as 35 in the second.
	   Andrew Gaze scored 26 points, including 18 on 6-of-7 shooting
from 3-point range, as Australia moved on with an 82-64 victory
over Lithuania. Paul Rogers added 13 points, and Shane Heal and
Anthony Ronaldson had 12 apiece. The loss was the first for
Lithuania, which also advanced.
	   Argentina won its first game, beating Russia 69-65. Hugo
Sconochini led the Argentines with 15 points, hitting 5-of-6 from
the floor.
	   Puerto Rico advanced with a 74-73 victory over winless China.
Puerto Rico led 64-53 with 5:36 remaining and held off a late
Chinese rally, which ended when guard Hu Weidong hit a 22-footer
(6.7 meters) with 2.9 seconds left. Javier Colon had 21 points for
Puerto Rico. Hu led all scorers with 30.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; Gymnastics &QC; 
	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ Sang Lan, 17, of China was paralyzed
as she practiced for the women's vault. Sang, the 1997 Chinese
vault champion, apparently lost control in midair and landed
head-first, damaging her spine.
	   Sang was carried off the Nassau Coliseum floor on a stretcher
and taken to Nassau Medical Center, where her injuries were
diagnosed by Dr. Brock Schnebel, an orthopedic surgeon who is chief
medical officer for the games.
	   Schnebel said he X-rays and a CAT scan showed Sang with a
fractured-dislocation of the sixth and seventh cervical vertebrae.
	   Vanessa Atler, the U.S. national champion, won the vault gold
medal. Atler, the national all-round champion scored 9.662.
	   In the men's floor exercise, Alexei Nemov of Russia won the gold
with a score of 9.725. American Jay Thornton took the silver with
9.550.
	   Two other Americans won medals _ Elise Ray won the silver in the
women's uneven bars and Yewki Tomita won the bronze in the pommel
horse.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; Track &QC; 
	   UNIONDALE, California (AP) _ Michael Johnson and Maurice Greene
were the big winners _ and Sergei Bubka the big loser _ on a big
night of track. Johnson won the 400 meters in 43.76 seconds.
Greene, the world champion in the 100, beat Olympic champion
Donovan Bailey in 9.96. But Bubka, who has set the pole vault world
record 35 times and is the only one to clear 20 feet (6.10 meters),
no-heighted for the second time in three meets. Jeff Hartwig won
the pole vault at 19-8 1/2 (6.01 meters), breaking his American
record by one-quarter inch.
	   Jackie Joyner-Kersee, the 36-year-old world record-holder in the
heptathlon who has not completed a multi-event since the 1996
Olympic trials, looked woefully out of shape at the start of her
final heptathlon. The two-time Olympic gold medalist finished her
first four events in second place with 3,833 points, 34 behind
leader DeDee Nathan.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; Water Polo &QC; 
	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ The United States lost twice by 10-5
scores. First Spain, the world water polo champion, beat the
Americans, with Salvador Gomez and Ivan Perez getting two goals

Schumacher, Wolf Wigo, Chi Kredell, Chris Oeding and Todd Hosmer

	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ Maurice Greene shut up and shot down
Donovan Bailey by winning the 100 meters. Michael Johnson proved he
has plenty left, winning the 400, and Sergei Bubka's pole-vaulting
future is in doubt after no-heighting in the Goodwill Games.
	   Greene, who has been bad-mouthed by Bailey since winning last
year's world championship, quieted the feisty Canadian by racing to
victory in 9.96 seconds Tuesday night.
	   ``It's great to beat Bailey,'' the jubilant Greene said. ``I
accelerated exceptionally well. That's why I won.''
	   Bailey, coming off a series of injuries and illnesses, appeared
to slow with 80 meters left and finished seventh at 10.30, far off
his world record of 9.84.
	   The redoubtable Johnson, the 1996 Olympic 200 and 400 champion,
erased any thoughts that his career might be on a downslide, racing
to a stunning victory with a sizzling time of 43.76, a Goodwill
Games record.
	   ``I'm healthy now,'' said Johnson, who has been besieged by
hamstring and Achilles injuries. ``I came here with the feeling I'd
win despite the injuries.''
	   Bubka, the 34-year-old Ukrainian who has set the world pole

World Bank calls China an anchor of stability
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China has weathered Asia's economic crisis well,
but faces the challenge of ensuring that short-term measures taken
to stimulate its economy do not hurt longer term economic reforms,
the World Bank's chief economist said Wednesday.
	   ``China today plays a very important role in the world economy,
an anchor of stability in an otherwise stormy sea,'' Joseph
Stiglitz told reporters on the fourth day of a visit to Beijing.
	   Stiglitz's meetings with Premier Zhu Rongji and other officials
came amid mounting signs of damage to China's economy from the
yearlong crisis that has shaken Asian currencies, markets and
economies.
	   Economic growth slowed to 7 percent in the first six months of
1998, lower than the government's 8 percent target. Lower growth is
expected to put pressure on Premier Zhu to slow down a painful
restructuring of state industries that is cutting millions of jobs.
	   Zhu's government is betting that spending on infrastructure
projects can stimulate the economy to meet the year's 8-percent
target _ without backing down on reforms.
	   Stiglitz said the government was ``very aware'' that it must
continue moving forward with its long-term economic reforms even
while it focuses on short-term goals of maintaining high growth and
stability.
	   ``China has the wisdom to see the challenges and the
capabilities and determination to address them effectively,'' he
said.
	   On a more general note, he said: ``One of the silver linings in
the East Asia crisis is that countries everywhere have now really
recognized how important it is to have sound financial systems.''
	   The World Bank has a big stake in ensuring that China, its
largest borrower, is not dragged down by the crisis. China has
borrowed dlrs 30 billion from the bank, including dlrs 2.6 billion
in the past year _ about nine percent of total World Bank lending.
	   Stiglitz refused to go into detail about his discussions with
Chinese officials. But a World Bank statement said he commended
them for stimulating the Chinese economy domestically to offset the
effects of the Asian slowdown.
	   ``It is important for China to maintain a very strong growth,''
Stiglitz said in his news conference. A significant slowdown would
have ``a whole variety of adverse effects,'' he said.
	   The government regards 8 percent growth as necessary to create
sufficient jobs for the army of workers being laid off from state
firms.
	   Many observers believe that failure to meet the target could
imperil Premier Zhu's plans to turn the state sector around within
three years and increase bureaucratic resistance toward other
reforms _ such as encouraging private home ownership.
	   Stiglitz said China's decision not to devalue its currency, the
yuan, has helped economic stability. China's currency is not fully
convertible, which has helped shield its economy from the worst of
Asia's currency meltdowns.

Media polls show Obuchi leading in Japanese prime minister race
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS timing of second ballot in 3rd graf, minor editing in
lede &QL; 
 &UR; By YURI KAGEYAMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi is leading the
three-way race for Japan's ruling party nomination for prime
minister, but is short of winning a majority on the first ballot,
surveys by Japanese media showed Wednesday.
	   The vote Friday by 366 Liberal Democratic Party lawmakers and 47
prefectural representatives will choose the party president. The
winner is virtually assured of becoming prime minister because the
party commands a majority in the lower house of Parliament.
	   If none of the three candidates wins a majority in the first
balloting, or at least 207 votes, a run-off between the two top
candidates will be immediately held to pick a successor to Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, who is quitting after party losses in
the July 12 upper house election.
	   The media companies _ two major papers and a TV network _
surveyed LDP delegates to see how they would vote.
	   The Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper reported that nearly 180 LDP
delegates support Obuchi. About 95 said they support Health
Minister Junichiro Koizumi, and 65 were for former Chief Cabinet
Secertary Seiroku Kajiyama.
	   Obuchi's camp is wooing support from the undecided voters to
clinch a majority, the newspaper said.
	   The Mainichi Shimbun showed Obuchi at between 170 and 180 votes,
Koizumi with 80 or 90, and Kajiyama with 55 or 65. Ninety were
still undecided. Fuji TV estimated Obuchi had 170 votes, Koizumi
100 and Kajiyama 50.
	   The ruling party has customarily decided the leader in deals
among the groups in the party called ``habatsu.'' Obuchi, 61, who
heads the biggest habatsu, was next in line for the job.
	   But some lawmakers are worried he lacks the flash and voter
appeal to reverse the party's flagging popularity. There is
widespread speculation that if Obuchi fails to win in the first
vote, the other two camps may unite to foil Obuchi's bid.
	   The July 12 election was widely viewed as a backlash from voters
angry about the government's failure to put the stagnating economy
back on track.
	   Kajiyama, 72, is being perceived as tough on economic reforms,
while Koizumi, 56, is more popular with his maverick image.

	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ Chinese gymnast Sang Lan was
paralyzed after damaging her spine while practicing for the women's
vault in the Goodwill Games.
	   ``At this time, she is paralyzed and cannot move her legs and
she has a minimal amount of motion in her arms,'' said Dr. Brock
Schnebel, chief physician of the Goodwill Games.
	   Sang, 17, injured her neck Tuesday during warm-ups for the
women's individual apparatus events. Officials said she was
attempting a forward vault and lost control in mid-air, striking
the ground head first. She was carried off the floor of Nassau
Coliseum on a stretcher and taken to Nassau County Medical Center
for a CAT scan.
	   Sang is one of three Chinese women gymnasts competing in the
Goodwill Games. Officials were trying to contact her family in
China.
	   Schnebel said Sang's spine was injured when her chin was forced
down and forward onto her chest.
	   ``I have been able to evaluate and speak with Sang Lan through
an interpreter and evaluate her X-rays and CAT scans,'' Schnebel
said.
	   He said she had a ``fractured-dislocation'' of the sixth and
seventh cervical vertebrae.

Japanese researchers analyze huge tidal waves on Papua New Guinea

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese researchers say the tidal waves that hit
Papua New Guinea last week followed a powerful earthquake that was
probably caused by a vertical crack in the Pacific plate, a
Japanese newspaper said Wednesday.
	   The Earthquake Research Institute at the University of Tokyo
came to the conclusion after analyzing earthquake waves monitored
at 11 locations in the world, the national Asahi newspaper said.
	   Researchers at the University of Tokyo were not available for
comments on the report.
	   Waves as high as 7-meters (23-feet) high crashed down on the
villages along 30 kilometers (18 miles) of Papua New Guinea's coast
last Friday. The official death toll was well over 1,200.
	   The magnitude-7.0 quake occurred at the sea bottom where the
Pacific plate sinks beneath the India-Australia plate.
	   The Japanese researchers found that giant waves were generated
when the Pacific plate broke in a section stretching as long as 40
kilometers (25 miles) off the Papua New Guinea coast, the report
said.
	   The part of the plate close to the coast sank about two meters
(6.56 feet), the report quoted researchers as saying.
	   It took about 20 seconds for the breakup of the plate to end,
suggesting that the earthquake was rather a fast one, the report
said.

	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ A 17-year-old Chinese gymnast was
paralyzed during practice for the women's vault at the Goodwill
Games.
	   Sang Lan, the 1997 Chinese national champion in the event, was

mid-air. Gymnastics officials said she landed head-first, damaging
her spine.
	   Sang was carried off the floor at the Nassau Coliseum on a
stretcher and taken to Nassau Medical Center, where her injuries
were diagnosed by Dr. Brock Schnebel, an orthopedic surgeon who is
chief medical officer for the games.
	   Schnebel said he X-rays and a CAT scan showed Sang with a
fractured-dislocation of the sixth and seventh cervical vertebrae.
	   ``This has resulted in an injury to her spinal cord,'' Schnebel
said. ``At this time, she cannot move her legs. She has minimal
motion of her arms. She cannot feel from her mid-chest down.''
	   The doctor said he had spoken with the athlete through an
interpreter. More examinations were under way ``and treatment plans
will be made based on the results.''
	   The other gymnasts were unaware of how seriously Sang had been
injured and the competition started on time.
	   American Vanessa Atler, the 16-year-old national champion in the
all-around and the vault won the event, even though she didn't
think she did all that well.
	   ``My performance on a 1-to-10 was maybe an 8,'' she said. ``It
was not spectacular. I thought I did well and I was proud of
myself, but I still felt there was room for improvement.''
	   It was good enough for the judges, though. Her two vaults
produced scores of 9.650 and 9.675, an average of 9.662, that
earned her the gold medal before a crowd of 5,483.
	   Three other Americans took home medals Tuesday night. Jay
Thornton won the silver in the floor exercises. Elise Ray won a
silver in the women's uneven bars and Yewki Tomita captured the
bronze in the pommel horse.
	   Atler was the second contestant on the vault, then had to watch
six others make their runs. All the time, she was convinced someone
would beat her. But no one ever did.
	   ``I didn't think it would stand up,'' Atler said. ``I thought
I'd be fifth.''
	   Her gold was the best-ever U.S. finish in the Goodwill Games
vault. Joyce Wilborn won a bronze in 1986 and Shannon Miller took
the silver in 1994.
	   Finishing behind Atler were Elena Dolgopolova of Russia, who
took the silver with 9.600. Simona Amanar of Romania, winner of the
bronze in the all-around competition on Sunday, took another bronze
in the vault with a 9.587.
	   In the men's floor exercise, Alexei Nemov of Russia won the gold
with a score of 9.725. Thornton took the silver with 9.550 and the
bronze went to Alexei Bondarenko of Russia with 9.525.
	   For Nemov, the world and European champion in floor exercise, it
was an impressive recovery after a disappointing seventh in the
men's all-around on Monday. He had scored well in the opening floor
routine with a 9.450 but struggled after that.
	   Bondarenko, who earlier won a silver in the all-around, captured
another silver in the pommel behind Russian Nikolay Krukov and in
front of Tomita, who is coached by his father, a former high school
national champion in Japan.
	   Svetlana Khorkina of Russia, world champion in the event, won
the uneven bars and became the first woman to successfully defend a
Goodwill Games title in gymnastics. She finished with a score of
9.825 to 9.700 for Ray and 9.600 for Amanar, who won her second
bronze of the night and third of the games.
	   Since 1994, in Olympic, Goodwill Games, world or European
Championships, Khorkina has missed gold only once on the bars,
finishing second in the world championships in 1994.
	   American Sean Townsend of Houston fell and tumbled out of bounds
in the floor routine and finished last among the eight gymnasts
with 8.450.

	   Day 3 at the Goodwill Games:
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; TRAGEDY IN GYMNASTICS: &LR;  A 17-year-old Chinese gymnast was
paralyzed in a practice accident. Officials said Sang Lan landed
head first as she warmed up for the vault, suffering dislocation
fractures of two cervical vertebrae. Doctors said it was too soon
to know if she would walk again.

Lithuania advanced to the basketball semifinals. The U.S. team beat
Brazil 106-75, with Elton Brand scoring 17 points.

was the first loss for Lithuania, which will face the United States
in the medal round.
	   Puerto Rico advanced to play Australia with a 74-73 victiory
over winless China.
	   Spain, water polo's world champion, beat the United States 10-5,
behind two goals each from Salvador Gomez and Ivan Perez. Russia
beat Italy 7-4.
	   American gymnasts took home four medals, including a gold for
Vanessa Atler in the vault. Jay Thornton took the silver in men's
floor exercise, Elise Ray won the silver in the women's uneven bars
and Yewki Tomita won the bronze in the pommel horse.

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Hundreds of foreign election
observers began fanning out into the countryside Wednesday to
monitor parliamentary elections, but the opposition said they
aren't nearly enough to stop intimidation and a fraudulent victory
by strongman Hun Sen.
	   Election watchdog and human-rights groups meanwhile held a
seminar for 60 officers in the Hun Sen-controlled security forces,
urging them to remain neutral in Sunday's vote and let Cambodians
cast their ballots without fear of retribution.
	   ``If a peaceful atmosphere can be maintained for the elections,
it will largely be due to the efforts of the security forces,''
Meng Ho Leang, president of the Coalition for Free and Fair
Elections, told them in encouragement.
	   Phnom Penh was calm, though pre-election jitters and a wave of
kidnappings have prompted gold and money traders to close shops.
Several parties paraded supporters through the capital in trucks,
and the small but respected Son Sann Party gathered about 500
people in a park.
	   About 650 foreign observers are being coordinated by the United
Nations. But apart from fleets of new vehicles, their activity is a
dim shadow of the huge election operation mounted by the temporary
U.N. administration in 1993. That brought a new era of peace and
democracy to a country devastated by decades of war and the Khmer
Rouge genocide.
	   ``In five years, we've gone from (the U.N.) spending dlrs 3
billion and deploying 20,000 peacekeepers to the election being
taken charge of by the Cambodians themselves and the international
community being invited to provide technical support,'' said
Marie-Ange Lescure, spokeswoman for the European Union observer
delegation.
	   There were some delays in getting the observers going. Not all
the radios had been programmed to work in distant provinces, nor
had all the identification cards been prepared.
	   The Cambodian drivers and interpreters accompanying the two-man
teams dusted and polished the new Land Rovers and ran the
air-conditioning as they waited under a broiling sun.
	   Hun Sen has invited the observers in an effort to win
international endorsement for the election, hoping to regain
legitimacy and foreign aid lost when he deposed his co-premier,
Prince Norodom Ranariddh, in fighting last year that devastated
parts of Phnom Penh.
	   Ranariddh finished atop the 1993 elections. Hun Sen, who came to
power in 1985 during the Vietnamese military occupation that
followed the overthrow of the Khmer Rouge, forced his way into a
coalition by threatening civil war.
	   The opposition, human-rights groups and election watchdogs
accuse Hun Sen of using violence, including murder, and widespread
intimidation to ensure victory. Many fear he will call out the army
if he loses, though he has promised to transfer power peacefully.
	   Foreign observers will be supplemented by Cambodians, but the
vast majority of the 60,000 who have been approved are believed to
belong to Hun Sen-controlled groups.
	   Im Soursdei, spokesman for the National Election Commission,
also packed with Hun Sen supporters, acknowledged that there were
``many, many problems'' and that they would try to weed out
individuals who appeared to have wrongfully obtained accreditation.
	   ``We are walking one step behind and are running to catch
them,'' Im Soursdei said. About 50,000 national observers should
participate.
	   Sam Rainsy, the main challenger along with Ranariddh, said
Tuesday that even with good intentions, the best the foreign
observers can hope for is to visit 10 percent of the polling
stations for half an hour each on election day.
	   ``The international community should accept and endorse the
result of a free and fair election and they should not endorse the
result of a fake election,'' Sam Rainsy said.
	   The standard of an acceptable election has divided the
international community. The United States, which has already
served notice that violence has hopelessly marred the process, has
said it will render a separate verdict from the final U.N.
statement. That is believed likely to be dominated by the E.U.,
which is setting less stringent conditions.
	   Sam Rainsy estimated that Hun Sen's formerly communist Cambodian
People's Party could legitimately expect 20 percent of the vote. He
said he expected a fraudulent result but would find a tally
``acceptable'' if it did not give the CPP an outright majority of
the 122 seats.

	   ST. PETERSBURG, Florida (AP) _ Ken Griffey Jr. hit his
AL-leading 40th home run and Russ Davis drove in four runs with a
double and homer as the Seattle Mariners beat the Tampa Bay Devil
Rays 8-3 Tuesday night.
	   Griffey, who began the night four behind Mark McGwire in their
quest to break Roger Maris' single-season record of 61, broke a
week-long homer drought with a 407-foot (124-meter) solo shot off
Wilson Alvarez (4-8) in the fourth inning.
	   Davis, who was 0-for-11 lifetime against Alvarez before Tuesday
night, had a two-run double in Seattle's four-run first inning. He
added his 15th homer, a two-run shot to left, in the fifth for a
7-1 Mariners lead.
	   Jamie Moyer (7-7) allowed seven hits, struck out six and walked
two in eight innings to get the victory, Seattle's seventh in the
past eight games.
 &UR; Rangers 15, Royals 5 &QC; 
	   In Kansas City, Missouri, Juan Gonzalez homered twice and drove
in five runs, increasing his major league-leading RBI total to 110,
and Texas hit a season-high six homers.
	   Gonzalez, who has nine RBIs in his last three games after going
nine games without one, hit a solo homer in the second inning and a
three-run shot in the sixth that gave Texas a 15-4 lead. He also
had an RBI single in the Rangers' nine-run first inning.
	   Roberto Kelly and Mike Simms each hit a three-run homer in the
Texas first, Simms off starter Jose Rosado (4-8) and Kelly against
reliever Jim Pittsley.
	   Rick Helling (13-5) pitched a seven-hitter. He struck out three
and didn't walk a batter.
 &UR; Orioles 7, Athletics 1
	   In Baltimore, Rafael Palmeiro hit his 30th homer and Scott
Erickson pitched a six-hitter for his AL-high seventh complete game
as Baltimore won for the 11th time in 12 games.
	   Although Baltimore faces a sizable deficit in the wild-card
race, Orioles' management decided hours before the game to keep the
team intact for a possible stretch drive. Palmeiro, one of the
players rumored to be on the trading block, responded with a
three-run homer in the first inning.
	   Eric Davis and Cal Ripken also homered for the Orioles, who
moved within two games of .500 for the first time since June 22.
Davis, another veteran whose tenure in Baltimore seemed in doubt,
went 3-for-4 and scored twice.
	   Erickson (11-7) struck out seven and walked one in his third
straight victory.
	   Oakland starter Tom Candiotti (5-12) fell to 1-8 in his last 10
starts.
 &UR; Yankees 5, Tigers 1 &QC; 
	   In New York, David Cone became the first 14-game winner in the
majors and remained unbeaten at home.
	   Cone (14-3), who lost his last start to the Tigers on July 16,
allowed eight hits and an unearned run in eight innings. He struck
out 10, walked one and has won five of his last six starts. The
right-hander is 9-0 at Yankee Stadium.
	   Chuck Knoblauch homered for the Yankees (70-25), who are one
game off the 1902 Pittsburgh Pirates pace for the best start after
95 games.
	   Detroit's Brian Hunter, who set a record by going 0-for-13 in
Monday's doubleheader, went 0-for-5. Rookie catcher Paul Bako had a
career-high four hits for the Tigers.
	   Brian Moehler (10-7) failed in his attempt to become the first
pitcher to defeat the Yankees three times this season.
 &UR; White Sox 6, Blue Jays 3 &QC; 
	   In Toronto, Albert Belle went 4-for-5 with his 30th homer of the
season and 13th in July, and Toronto's poor defense led to three
unearned runs for Chicago.
	   Belle, who appeared in court Monday to face charges of domestic
violence against a 25-year-old woman, is 5-for-8 with two home runs
since the alleged incident.
	   After Toronto second baseman Tony Fernandez dropped a pop fly
for an error in the first, Belle homered to put the White Sox up
2-0.
	   Belle, who also had three singles, has 12 homers in his last 14
games.
	   White Sox starter James Baldwin (5-4) struck out a season-high
eight in five innings. Bill Simas pitched the ninth for his eighth
save.
	   Pat Hentgen (9-7) gave up six runs (three earned) and 10 hits in
8 1-3 innings.
 &UR; Indians 4, Red Sox 2, 2nd game, 7 1/2 innings
 &UR; Red Sox 10, Indians, 7, 1st game
	   In Cleveland, Jeff Branson's tiebreaking homer off Tim
Wakefield, his first in nearly a year, helped give Cleveland a
split in the rain-shortened second game of a day-night
doubleheader.
	   The Indians snapped a seven-game losing streak to the Red Sox,
who are 8-2 against their possible first-round playoff opponent.
Pedro Martinez got his 13th victory in the day game for Boston.
	   The night game was finally called at 12:48 a.m. after a second
rain delay. The rain-soaked, lightning-filled marathon finally
ended more than 11 hours after the first pitch was thrown in the
opener.
 &UR; Twins 4, Angels 2 &QC; 
	   In Minneapolis, Paul Molitor moved into a tie for 10th place on
the career hit list with three hits, including the go-ahead two-run
double in the fifth inning.
	   Coming off a 1-for-18 road trip during which he was activated
from the disabled list, Molitor had a hit in each of his first
three at-bats to tie Eddie Murray with 3,255 hits.
	   Molitor had two doubles to help send the Angels to their 13th

	   ATLANTA (AP) _ Kerry Wood had 11 strikeouts in 7 2-3 shutout
innings, outdueling Greg Maddux as the Chicago Cubs defeated the
Atlanta Braves 3-0 Tuesday night.
	   With a sellout crowd watching one of the best pitching matchups
of the season, the 21-year-old Wood gave up five hits and twice
escaped trouble with strikeouts to defeat Maddux, a four-time Cy
Young Award winner.
	   Mickey Morandini had a two-out, run-scoring single in the third,
and the Cubs added two more runs in the fourth on Jose Hernandez's
RBI grounder and a squeeze bunt by former Atlanta shortstop Jeff
Blauser.
	   But the night belonged to Wood (9-5), who reached double-figure
strikeouts for the sixth time in 18 major-league starts.
	   Maddux (13-4) lost for the first time to his former team. He
entered the game with a 7-0 career record and 1.51 ERA against the
Cubs.
 &UR; Phillies 3, Expos 2 &QC; 
	   In Montreal, Mark Portugal pitched a four-hitter as the
Philadelphia Phillies won their third straight.
	   Portugal (6-2) took a two-hitter and a 3-1 lead into the ninth
before allowing consecutive singles to Orlando Cabrera and
pinch-hitter Scott Livingstone. On Terry Jones' attempted
sacrifice, catcher Mark Lieberthal threw the ball into right field,
allowing Cabrera to score.
	   Portugal struck out Ryan McGuire for the first out before
intentionally walking Vladimir Guerrero to load the bases. Portugal
then struck out pinch-hitter Robert Perez and got Mark Grudzielanek
on a comebacker.
	   Mark Lewis' two-run double in the eighth off Carl Pavano (3-4)
broke a 1-1 tie.
 &UR; Brewers 6, Marlins 4 &QC; 
	   In Miami, Mark Loretta snapped a tie with an RBI double in the
ninth, leading the Milwaukee Brewers over the Florida Marlins.
	   The Brewers, who came back from a 4-0 deficit, won all nine
games from Florida in the season series. It is the first time
Milwaukee has won every game against an opponent in a season.
	   Fernando Vina led off the ninth with a double off Antonio
Alfonseca (2-3). One out later, Loretta hit a drive off the top of
the wall in left field, scoring Vina. Jeff Cirillo's RBI groundout
then made it 6-4.
	   Al Reyes (5-0) pitched two scoreless innings for the win.
 &UR; Mets 4, Pirates 0 &QC; 
	   In New York, Rick Reed pitched eight shutout innings and drove
in a run as the New York Mets ended Pittsburgh's four-game winning
streak.
	   Reed (11-6) allowed six hits and struck out nine for the Mets,
whose last three wins have come by shutouts. New York pitchers have
12 shutouts this season, tying them with Atlanta for tops in the
league.
	   John Franco, pitching for the first time since serving a
three-game suspension for bumping an umpire, pitched the ninth. The
left-hander gave up two hits and struck out two.
	   Jason Schmidt (8-7) lost his sixth straight decision, giving up
four runs and six hits in seven innings.
 &UR; Rockies 5, Astros 0 &QC; 
	   In Houston, Mark Brownson pitched five no-hit innings in his
major league debut and finished with a four-hitter as Colorado
snapped a nine-game road losing streak.
	   Brownson, who has a 36-39 minor league record, stepped into the
starting rotation in place of injured John Thomson and dominated
the Astros, who lead the NL in runs scored with 543.
	   Brownson struck out seven and walked one.
	   Vinny Castilla got three hits and drove in two runs for the
Rockies, including a solo homer in the sixth inning.
 &UR; Padres 6, Cardinals 3 &QC; 
	   In San Diego, Kevin Brown held Mark McGwire hitless and won his
ninth straight decision as the San Diego Padres gained a split of
the two-game series.
	   It was the sixth time Brown has won following a Padres loss. St.
Louis dealt the Padres their worst defeat of the season Monday
night, 13-1, as McGwire hit his major league-leading 43rd homer.
	   Brown (12-3) issued McGwire his major league-leading 104th walk
with two out in the first inning. He then got him to hit into an
inning-ending double play in the third and caught him looking twice
on third-strike fastballs.
	   Brown allowed eight hits and three runs in eight innings, struck
out nine and walked two. Trevor Hoffman pitched the ninth for his
31st save in as many opportunities, and 39th straight dating from
last season.
 &UR; Dodgers 4, Reds 2 &QC; 
	   In Los Angeles, Ismael Valdes won consecutive starts for the
first time since last August and rookie Adrian Beltre hit a two-run
homer as Los Angeles beat Cincinnati.
	   Valdes (8-9) allowed two runs and five hits in 6 1-3 innings to
send the Reds to their fifth straight loss following a 10-game
winning streak.
	   Jeff Shaw got the last four outs for his 27th save and second in
the two-game series.
 &UR; Diamondbacks 5, Giants 3 &QC; 
	   In San Francisco, Devon White's bases-loaded single capped a
three-run rally in the seventh inning that lifted Arizona over San
Francisco.
	   Andy Benes (7-10) went six innings for the victory, giving up
three runs and eight hits. Gregg Olson pitched the ninth for his
15th save.
	   Trailing 3-1 in the seventh, the Diamondbacks rallied against
Orel Hershiser (8-8) and Rich Rodriguez to take the lead. Hershiser
allowed seven hits and four runs in 6 1-3 innings.

British pilot celebrates record-breaking circle of the globe in
</HEADLINE>
aviation first
 &UR; EDs: Deletes final graf to correct. NO PICKUP

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ After surviving a 120-day adventure, a British
pilot has completed his record-breaking journey around the world to
become the first to circumnavigate the globe by microlight aircraft
_ essentially a hang glider with a motorcycle slung underneath.
	   Although he failed to complete the odyssey in time to match
Phileas Fogg's fictional trip around the world in 80 days, he also
smashed the previous record for a round-the-world flight in an
open-cockpit single-engined aircraft. That was set in 1924 by four
U.S. Army pilots who completed the trip in 175 days in a Douglas
biplane.
	   Brian Milton celebrated the completion of his 23,000-mile
(3,7000-kilometer) trip with champagne Tuesday night at the Reform
Club, the London gentlemen's club where Fogg toasted his successful
circumnavigation in Jules Verne's novel ``Around the World in
Eighty Days.''
	   Milton, a 55-year-old former journalist for the BBC, set off
from England March 24 with copilot Keith Reynolds, who was forced
to drop out in Russia after authorities insisted the pair either
take on a native navigator or pay for a plane to accompany them.
	   But even though he survived Alaskan blizzards, being buzzed by a
Syrian MiG jet and an engine blowing up, Milton said his final
landing was among the worst of the whole trip.
	   ``I had about 14 really hairy landings and that was one of the
top five,'' he said. ``It could have ruined the story having got it
all the way round the world.''
	   Milton was in the last of a flotilla of eight microlights to
touch down in high winds after the five-hour final leg of his
journey from Derbyshire in Northern England.
	   The trip, inspired by the 125th anniversary of the Jules Verne
novel, was plagued by numerous delays and difficulties caused by
the weather and bureaucratic wrangling.
	   As he sipped champagne from a bottle, Milton said he would never
make the journey again, but his next challenge might be a
round-the-world race in a fixed wing microlight.
	   He said he plans to write a book about the adventure and hopes
to make a television documentary with some of the 200 hours of
video footage he recorded.
	   The GT Global Flyer, a single-engine Pegasus Quantum 912
aircraft, was powered by an engine equivalent to a small car's. It
had a wing span of 33 feet, 8 inches (10 meters) and an open
cockpit that was 9 feet, 2 inches (3 meters) long.
	   The trip included stops in France, Germany, Italy, Greece,
Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Laos,
Vietnam, China, South Korea and Japan.
	   From there, he flew to Russia, the United States, Canada,
Greenland, Denmark, Iceland and Scotland before he returned to
England.

Annan lauds Guatemala's progress in moving toward peace
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Annan arriving in Mexico City &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photo GUA108 &QL; 
 &UR; By KEN GUGGENHEIM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan lauded
Guatemala's progress since its civil war ended 1 1/2 years ago, but
said more work needs to be done.
	   ``When one signs a peace agreement, the pact in itself is not
the end of it,'' he said Tuesday, ending a 24-hour visit to the
Central American country.
	   ``To get the peace to take root, to get a society that has been
at war for so long to accept the culture of peace ... you have to
work at it. It takes time,'' he said.
	   Annan visited Guatemala to examine the progress made since a
December 1996 peace agreement ended at 36-year civil war that left
an estimated 200,000 people dead or missing. The United Nations
helped negotiate an end to the conflict and has played a major role
in overseeing the execution of the peace accords.
	   Annan's visit included meetings with President Alvaru Arzu and
government officials, leaders of the former guerrillas, church
officials, and members of the truth commission.
	   Those he met with ``believe that the Guatemala of today is not
the Guatemala of 1996'' and that social, political and economic
process has been made.
	   ``Despite the obstacles and the struggles, you have achieved a
lot from the reports I have read and from the discussions I have
had,'' he said. ``But the road is by no means going to be easy. ''
	   Many of the obstacles were apparent in the days leading up to
Annan's visit.
	   Hours before Annan arrived, an Italian priest, Pablo Sebastiano
Crestani, was wounded as he left a church in the capital. The
motive is unknown. The shooting follows the April killing of Bishop
Juan Gerardi, who was bludgeoned to death days after presenting a
report blaming the army for most of the wartime atrocities. That
crime has not been solved.
	   In northern Guatemala, a grenade apparently left over from the
war exploded Sunday in a soccer field, killing six children and an
adult.
	   And days before Annan's arrival, an army colonel was jailed
after telling a Radio Netherlands interviewer that the army should
recognize its ``excesses'' committed during the war. Rights
advocates fear the arrest may discourage soldiers from discussing
wartime abuses.
	   Annan denounced the shooting of the priest and the Gerardi
killing. ``I think this sort of brutal, senseless and cowardly
killing has no place in a nation that is searching for peace.''
	   Annan then flew on to Mexico, the last stop on his five-nation
Latin American tour. Arriving at Mexico City's international
airport, Annan said he had ``great expectations for the talks I
will hold with President (Ernesto) Zedillo and other persons'' in
Mexico, local media reported.
	   Prior to leaving Guatemala, Annan said he said he had no
intention of mediating the conflict in the southern Mexican state
of Chiapas, site of an uprising by Zapatista rebels.
	   ``The U.N. does not get involved in these kinds of situations
without a request from the government,'' he said. ``I have received
no such requests and I have accepted no such demand.''
	   He said he planned to discuss the recent U.N. drug conference
and the agreement signed in Rome on Saturday creating a permanent
war crimes tribunal.
	   Annan's last-minute trip to Rome to attend the signing ceremony
forced him to cut short what had been planned as a three-day trip
to Guatemala.

Salvadoran guardsman convicted in 1980 nuns' killing released on
</HEADLINE>
parole &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with release of National Guard squad
commander; quotes and background &QL; 
 &UR; By EDITH BELTRAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN VICENTE, El Salvador (AP) _ Two former national guardsmen
convicted in the rapes and murders of three American nuns and a
layworker walked out of prison, paroled after serving 17 years of
30-year prison sentences.
	   In a move that left the victims' relatives frustrated, former
Sgt. Luis Colindres and guardsman Jose Roberto Moreno Canjura _ two
of five guardsmen sentenced for the crimes in 1984 _ were released
Tuesday under a new law intended to ease prison overcrowding.
	   The guardsmen were convicted of kidnapping, raping and killing
Roman Catholic nuns Ita Ford, Dorothy Kazel and Maura Clark and
layworker Jean Donovan on Dec. 2, 1980.
	   Moreno Canjura quietly left the La Esperanza prison, 4 miles (6
kilometers) north of San Salvador, while Colindres _ who commanded
the guard squad _ broke a 14-year silence on his conviction when he
left a prison in San Vicente, about 40 miles (65 kilometers)
southeast of San Salvador.
	   ``I have always worked in accordance with the law,'' Colindres
told reporters at the prison gates, while refusing to back up
claims by other members of the squad that they received orders from
``higher ups'' to murder the four women.
	   ``Unfortunately, as a low-ranking officer, one must often keep
to the sidelines,'' Colindres said.
	   The New York-based Lawyers Committee for Human Rights reported
earlier this year that one of the convicted guardsmen quoted
Colindres as telling the squad ``Don't be worried. This is an order
that comes from higher levels, and nothing is going to happen to
us.''
	   The crime caused outrage in United States, which strongly
supported the Salvadoran government during the 1980-1992 civil war.
The women were apparently killed because military-backed death
squads suspected them of sympathizing with leftist guerrillas.
	   Ford's brother said in a telephone interview late Tuesday that
the families of the slain women opposed the release.
	   ``The government of El Salvador should certainly not have
released these men before closely questioning them on ... who
ordered this crime and who covered it up,'' said William Ford of
Upper Montclair, New Jersey.
	   ``The people in jail were not the intellectual authors of the
murders. They were triggermen sent to do a job by someone else,''
he said.
	   Salvador's government said Thursday it cannot reopen the probe
into the slayings despite evidence that those who orchestrated the
killings were never punished.
	   Chief Prosecutor Manuel Cordova said the 10-year statute of
limitations on murder has expired, so ``technically it is not
possible to reopen the case.''
	   One more guardsmen is also eligible for parole under the new law
and may be released soon. The other two did not qualify for release
because one previously had been convicted on weapons charges and
the other had participated in a prison disturbance.
	   The guardsmen were sentenced to 30 years in prison in May 1984
and have been jailed since 1981. They were to be given credit for
time served before their convictions.
	   The U.S. State Department criticized the decision to order the
release of three national guardsmen when it was first announced in
June. The releases have been held up by appeals by prosecutors.
	   ``We think that's a bad idea,'' spokesman James P. Rubin said at
the time, citing the ``heinous'' nature of the crimes.
	   The national guard was disbanded after a 1992 peace agreement
ended the civil war, which killed an estimated 75,000 people.

Japan's Sankei newspaper to reopen Beijing bureau after 31 years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Sankei Shimbun newspaper will reopen its
bureau in China's capital for the first time in 31 years, the
newspaper said Wednesday.
	   The basic agreement on the re-establishment of a permanent
presence in China was reached Tuesday in talks held in Beijing
between Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan and Sankei Shimbun President
Takehiko Kiyohara, the daily said.
	   Chinese authorities ousted the Sankei's bureau chief in
September 1967, during China's ``Cultural Revolution,'' over
alleged anti-China reporting.
	   The Sankei and China had intermittently discussed reopening the
Beijing bureau since late 1970s.
	   Over the years, the conservative paper was allowed from time to
time to send reporters into China on special assignments after
getting permission from the Chinese government.
	   Hisao Miyazaki, spokesman for Tokyo-based Sankei, said the exact
date of the bureau's reopening and the number of staff to be posted
there have yet to be decided.
	   The Sankei has a daily nationwide circulation of about 2
million.

Revenue shortfall yields cost-cutting measures
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ With budget revenues falling well short of
expectations, the Finance Ministry has issued a series of
regulations aimed at cutting costs, with more on the way, officials
said Wednesday.
	   The regulations, which affect all government departments and
state-owned enterprises, have been issued in the last three weeks
after figures showed revenue for the first half of 1998 was only 43
percent of the target for the year.
	   Finance Ministry official Do Van Ninh said the latest edict,
issued last week, said each department or enterprise should have no
more than two fax machines, and each office should have only one
fixed telephone.
	   No new cellular phones will be allowed, and personal calls will
be at the worker's expense, he added.
	   Ninh said Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung told a Finance
Ministry conference Monday that the government soon will issue
regulations on the use of cars by senior government officials, the
use of office space and finance transparency.
	   Disclosure of the new rules comes after the National Assembly
Standing Committee met last Friday and lowered all major economic
targets for the year and raised the inflation goal.
	   However, it did not revise the budget revenue and spending
targets.
	   Revenue is forecast at 68.77 trillion dong (dlrs 5.29 billion)
and expenditures at 80.77 trillion dong (dlrs 6.213 billion). The
budget deficit is not supposed to exceed 12 trillion dong (dlrs 930
million), or 4 percent of gross domestic product.

Andrew Golota wins unanimous decision over Corey Sanders
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN CURRAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTIC CITY, New Jersey (AP) _ Andrew Golota won another one.
And he didn't need bites, head-butts or below-the-belt blows to do
it.
	   Not that it was a clean fight: The street-fighting Polish
heavyweight beat newcomer Corey Sanders to a bloody pulp Tuesday
before winning a unanimous 10-round decision.
	   Golota, whose low blows cost him consecutive 1996 losses to
Riddick Bowe, dominated the bigger Sanders from the start. He
opened a deep gash in his eye in the second and keeping him at bay
with thundering three-punch combinations throughout.
	   Yet Sanders somehow stayed up and even won a couple rounds.
	   ``I could not believe how durable, how unbelievable Corey
Sanders' chin was,'' Golota said, his white shorts tinted scarlet
by Sanders' blood.
	   ``How can you hit a guy like that and have him not go down? I
give him credit,'' Golota said.
	   Judge Kason Cheeks scored it 97-93, Debra Barnes had it 100-90
and Paul Venti 99-90, all for Golota. The Associated Press favored
Golota 97-93.
	   The victory boosted Golota's record to 31-3 and earned him a
homecoming: He has already signed to fight former two-time champion
Tim Witherspoon on Sept. 4 in Wroclaw, Poland
	   Sanders, a 21-year-old from Washington, D.C., who has been
fighting for only three years, dropped to 16-6.
	   Early on, it looked like it would be all Golota.
	   He backed the 6-foot-6 (1.98-meter), 262-pounder (119 kilos)
into the ropes early in the second round and unloaded five
consecutive rights to his head, opening a gaping cut over Sanders'
left eyebrow.
	   The blood from his cut drenched Golota and rained down on the
USA Network television crew sitting ringside, prompting them to run
from their seats.
	   But referee Tony Orlando didn't halt the fight. It turned out to
be a wise choice. Sanders survived and even rallied briefly,
unleashing a couple of left-right combinations as if to serve
notice that he wasn't done yet.
	   After Sanders got out of trouble, Orlando called a timeout to
have ringside physician Dr. Richard Snepar check the cut. The
doctor let the fight continue.
	   In the third, Sanders connected with a huge right to the head
and then two left jabs to follow it, opening a cut over Golota's
left eye.
	   Slow afoot and lacking ring savvy, Sanders made up in heart what
he lacked in experience. He appeared to run out of gas in the
middle rounds, but just when Golota looked like he was taking over,
Sanders would rise up out of his crouch and deliver two or three
snapping punches.
	   ``I couldn't let my trainers down,'' he said. ``They worked so
hard for me. I needed to win the fight.''
	   Golota, who has earned a reputation as an unpredictable, dirty
fighter with bites and head butts, kept control of himself. He
managed to get away with punching Sanders while he had him in a
headlock twice, but he wasn't penalized for it.
	   Golota got dlrs 40,000 and Sanders dlrs 25,000 for the fight,
which drew a sellout crowd of 3,679 to Trump Taj Mahal Casino
Resort.
	   The victory, Golota's third straight since his Oct. 4
humiliation at the hands of WBC champion Lennox Lewis, may move him
a step closer to another title shot.
	   ``Assuming he beats Witherspoon, we feel we'll be right back in
the top of the heavyweight division and hopefully get another shot
at the title,'' said his promoter, Dino Duva.

Keeneland wraps up best July sale since 1985
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LEXINGTON, Kentucky (AP) _ A bay colt by Mr. Prospector out of
Angel Fever sold for dlrs 4 million to a Japanese horseman, the
highest price paid in Keeneland's July sale since Seattle Dancer
sold for a record dlrs 13.1 million in 1985.
	   To win the colt, Fusao Sekiguchi had to outbid a coalition of
racing newcomer Satish Sanan, who spent dlrs 13 million at the
sale, and the international thoroughbred operation Coolmore.
	   Sekiguchi, who owns the venture capital firm Venture Safe Net
and about 120 racing horses in Japan, said Tuesday through a
translator that he would have spent up to dlrs 5 million for the
colt.
	   ``His inspiration, his first impression (of the colt) was so
good,'' the translator said. ``Also, his trainer (John Ward),
recommended the horse.''
	   The colt was the next-to-last yearling auctioned, and bidding
went back and forth between Sekiguchi and the Sanan-Coolmore team
to dlrs 3.8 million. Sekiguchi then jumped the bid to dlrs 4
million and won the colt.
	   The dlrs 4 million sale highlighted Keeneland's biggest July
auction, by average price, since 1985. A total of 149 yearlings
were sold in three sessions for dlrs 71.9 million, or an average
price of dlrs 482,765. That was an increase in average price of 35
percent over last year, when 175 yearlings sold for an average
price of dlrs 357,514.
	   In 1985, the year Seattle Dancer sold, the average price was
dlrs 537,383.
	   The 15 yearlings sold for dlrs 1 million or more were the most
since 1989, when 18 matched or exceeded the million-dollar mark.
	   Before losing out to Sekiguchi, Sanan had spent dlrs 5.35
million on four yearlings during the sale's final session.
	   Sanan used the auction as a bulk buying opportunity, stocking
his new Padua Stables in Ocala, Florida, with 13 top fillies and
colts at a cost of dlrs 13 million.
	   Sanan spent dlrs 4.4 million in Monday's opening session, then
bought four fillies and a colt, all for less than dlrs 1 million,
in Thursday session afternoon session. He was quiet for most of the
night session.
	   Then, in a 20-minute burst, he bought four horses, all for over
dlrs 1 million: a Seeking the Gold filly for dlrs 1.2 million; a
Danzig colt for dlrs 1.4 million; a Storm Cat colt for dlrs 1.15
million; and a Mr. Prospector colt for dlrs 1.6 million.
	   After the final purchase, Sanan kissed the hand of his wife,
Anne, who had been doing the bidding.
	   Another highlight was the first-ever sale of a Japan-bred horse
in the United States. The brown filly by Sunday Silence out of
Maplejinsky sold for dlrs 1 million to Thomas Liang, the Hong
Kong-based owner of The Oak Horse Farm Corp., an international
thoroughbred operation.
	   ``She's a very athletic filly, and on top of that she's got a
great pedigree,'' said Patrick L. Biancone, the Hong Kong-based
trainer who advised Liang on the purchase.
	   She was one of two fillies consigned by owner Osamu Yasuda; the
other, by Brian's Time, failed to reach her reserve price in
bidding Monday and Yasuda said he would take her back to Japan and
race her there.

Sanan spends heavily for yearlings
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Sports-Horse Racing-Keeneland Sale &QL; 
 &UR; By TIM WHITMIRE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LEXINGTON, Kentucky (AP) _ With big buys and bold statements,
Satish Sanan made a splash in the Keeneland sale of selected
yearlings.
	   Minutes after spending dlrs 2.2 million on a Pleasant Colony
colt, Sanan was predicting the colt would win racing's most
prestigious prize in 2000.
	   ``You mark my word,'' Sanan said, ``this is a Triple Crown
winner.''
	   The 50-year-old native of India is president and chief executive
of Clearwater, Florida-based Information Management Resources, a
company that does software consulting and advises corporations on
how to deal with the Year 2000 problem.
	   He formed his Ocala, Florida-based Padua Stables last July after
buying Silverleaf Farms and almost immediately plunged into the
high-priced yearling market, buying a son of Mr. Prospector for a
September record dlrs 2.3 million in last fall's Keeneland yearling
sale.
	   Then, on Monday night, in the first session of this year's July
sale, Sanan spent dlrs 4.4 million on four horses. Half that sum
went for the Pleasant Colony colt; Sanan also spent dlrs 1.1
million on a Thunder Gulch colt and another dlrs 1.1 million on two
other colts.
	   The buying spree continued Tuesday, as Sanan spent another dlrs
8.6 million, including dlrs 5.35 million on a colt and three
fillies in a 20-minute stretch during the final evening session.
	   He then joined forces with the international thoroughbred
operation Coolmore in a bid to buy the sale's most coveted colt, a
son of Mr. Prospector out of Angel Fever, but dropped out at dlrs
3.8 million, allowing Japan's Fusao Sekiguchi to take the horse for
dlrs 4 million.
	   In addition to buying horses with big-name pedigrees, Sanan has
signed up a big-name trainer, D. Wayne Lukas, to get his horses
ready to race.
	   Under a limited partnership Sanan and Lukas formed in April, the
trainer who won six straight Triple Crown races earlier this decade
will handle Padua's operations in addition to his other training
responsibilities.
	   Lukas sat in front of Sanan throughout the two-day sale,
advising the newcomer on his frequent purchases.
	   ``We're just now in the process of trying to build a real
high-class, visible racing operation,'' Lukas said. ``Through the
sales, we're trying to jump-start it. ... These are calculated
decisions.''
	   Sanan said he is not spending impetuously or without
understanding of the risks of the horse business.
	   ``We know what the probability of success is,'' he said. ``This
is a long-term plan.''
	   And he denied sole responsibility for the rise in prices at this
year's sale.
	   ``There are a lot of strong people here, strong horses,'' Sanan
said. ``That's what drives the price, not me.''

Okinawa court gives Marines suspended prison terms
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS Marine Corps statement in 11th graf &QL; 
 &UR; By MARI YAMAGUCHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ An Okinawa court convicted two U.S. Marines of
assaulting a nightclub employee and gave them suspended prison
terms Wednesday in a case in which three American congressmen had
lodged protests to have the defendants released on bail.
	   The Okinawa District Court sentenced Pvt. Rocky Stubbs of
Coshocton, Ohio, to nine months in prison, suspended for three
years. That means he would not go to prison but remains under
surveillance for three years, court officials said.
	   Pfc. William Costello of Farmingdale, New Jersey, was sentenced
to 10 months, suspended for three years. Both Stubbs and Costello,
who pleaded innocent, had been freed on bail before the sentencing.
	   The two were charged with assaulting a nightclub employee in a
fight on March 7 at a bar near their military base on Japan's
southernmost island of Okinawa.
	   Stubbs acknowledged striking the man, and Costello said he
head-butted, kicked and hit him. Both Marines, however, said they
did so in self-defense.
	   The case drew attention in the United States when three American
congressmen lodged protests with Japan's ambassador in Washington
to win the Marines' release on bail.
	   Sens. Robert Torricelli of New Jersey and Mike DeWine of Ohio
and Rep. Christopher Smith of New Jersey met with Japanese
Ambassador Kunihiko Saito in June and said they were troubled by
reports the two Marines were interrogated for 10 to 12 hours.
	   The congressmen had also written a joint letter to Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto about the pair's treatment by Japanese
authorities.
	   A week later, Stubbs was handed over to U.S. military forces on
1.7 million yen (dlrs 126,000) in bail paid by his family and a
lawyer. Costello was released shortly after.
	   Stubbs' mother has accused the U.S. military of treating her son
unfairly to gain the favor of the Japanese amid growing opposition
against the heavy U.S. military presence on Okinawa.
	   The U.S. Marine Corps, in a statement released after Wednesday's
ruling, denied the accusations, saying: ``All records and accounts
from military and Japanese officials indicate that Costello and
Stubbs were treated fairly under the policies and guidelines
prescribed by the Japanese legal system.''
	   Okinawan opposition to the heavy U.S. military presence on the
island grew after three U.S. servicemen abducted and raped a
12-year-old schoolgirl on Okinawa in September 1995. The three were
convicted in 1996 and given jail terms ranging from 6 1/2 years to
7 years.

Iraqi dissidents urge Pope not to visit Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A group of Iraqi dissidents has urged Pope
John Paul II to not even consider going to Iraq, saying a visit
will be used by Saddam Hussein to gain international sympathy.
	   The pontiff has made no secret of his desire to visit biblical
sites such as Bethlehem, Nazareth, Mount Sinai and Ur, the
birthplace of Abraham, in Iraq _ ideally in the year 2000, when the
Roman Catholic Church marks the beginning of its third millennium.
	   Vatican officials, however, admit that the pope's visit to the
Middle East looks impossible given the troubled state of the peace
process in the region.
	   But if a visit to Ur ``were to take place, it will provide
(Saddam's) regime with moral ammunition to persist in its violation
of human rights and cover up the crimes and atrocities ... against
our Iraqi people,'' the Campaign for Democratic Iraq said.
	   The appeal was made in a letter that the London-based group sent
to the pope on July 21. A copy was sent to The Associated Press in
Cairo on Wednesday.
	   The pope opposes the U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq after it
invaded Kuwait in 1990 on grounds that sanctions hurt the poorest
members of society. In May, he met at the Vatican with Iraq's
deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz, a Chaldean Christian.
	   Last month, a top Vatican official, Cardinal Roger Etchegaray,
who was in Baghdad to attend a religious conference visited Ur to
see the place for himself before a papal visit can be contemplated.
	   Pope Paul VI visited the Holy Land in 1964. In 1967, Israel
seized the West Bank and Jerusalem. The Vatican does not recognize
Israel's claim to the entire city of Jerusalem, including mainly
Arab East Jerusalem.

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Cracked and corroded in more than 200 places,
the U.S. Capitol dome _ the most recognized symbol of democracy in
the nation, perhaps in the world _ needs fixing.
	   Paint peels off from the inside and outside, rust stains
cast-iron plates and the bolts holding them together.
	   A major restoration project scheduled to begin by January should
repair the damage. The price tag attached to the overhaul is dlrs
26 million but the estimate could jump higher if officials discover
further damage once more than a dozen layers of lead-based paint
are stripped away.
	   The dome is in ``terrific condition,'' assured project director
Jim Ellison, a special assistant to the Architect of the Capitol.
But years of ice and sweltering heat have taken their toll on the
dome and its 8.9 million pounds (4 million kilograms) of cast iron.
Ellison said the cracks and corrosion are more due to the nature of
the brittle metal rather than any structural faults.
	   ``I don't want people to get nervous. The dome is not about to
collapse or fall down,'' he said. ``We certainly don't have an
emergency situation.''
	   The repairs are expected to take four years, but many repairs
will be done at night to minimize disruption to offices in the main
building, Ellison said.
	   The dome is actually the capitol's second. The first, made of
copper laminated wood, was considered too small for the vastly
enlarged capitol during the 1850s. It also was a fire hazard in
constant need of repair. Congress commissioned the present dome in
1854 with an initial appropriation of dlrs 100,000. It ultimately
cost dlrs 1,047,291 by the time it was finished in 1866.
	   Only a select few, primarily members of Congress, are allowed to
make the strenuous trek into the upper reaches of the dome. A
steep, narrow stairwell leads visitors through the crevice between
the dome's inner and outer shells, which is connected by an
intricate network of bulky cast-iron bolts and turnbuckles.
	   Visitors can get a close-up view of the Constantino Brumidi
fresco, ``The Apotheosis of George Washington,'' at a landing that
encircles the rotunda from 180 feet (54 meters) above. The fresco,
painted on the interior dome, portrays the former president
ascending to heaven, guided by various mythological figures.
	   Brumidi liked to slip his political views into his work and the
``Apotheosis'' was no exception, said former Ohio Rep. Clarence
``Bud'' Brown, president of the U.S. Capitol Historical Society.
	   In one portion of the fresco, for example, the sea god Neptune
holds in his hand not a serpent but the Atlantic Cable, the
telegraphic line that linked America with Europe.
	   ``Brumidi thought that kind of technological advancement was a
wonderful thing. If he were doing this today, he'd have Bill Gates
in there with a computer,'' said Brown, an occasional dome tour
guide.
	   The final stretch of the stairway leads to a circular walkway
outside, just below the 19.5-foot (six-meter) Statue of Freedom,
which also has undergone renovations recently, including a
helicopter flight in 1993 down to the Capitol Plaza for cleaning
and waxing.
	   The walkway offers a panoramic view of the emerald lawns and
famous monuments of the nation's capital. It also provides a peek
at the ``secret'' tennis courts that sit atop a Senate office
building.
	   Ellison, who is overseeing the dome renovations, said tourists
shouldn't notice anything different about the Capitol in the next
two years. The outside of the dome won't be enclosed in scaffolding
and tourists inside the rotunda will still be able to look up and
see ``The Apotheosis,'' albeit one draped in canvas.
	   ``The project is very comprehensive,'' he said. ``We only want
to disrupt people once.''

Chinese kidnapped at his wedding reception in Philippines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) _ Ten masked men kidnapped a
mainland Chinese man at the reception following his marriage to a
Filipino woman in the southern Philippines, police said Wednesday.
	   Police said Xiao Liu, 24, was abducted Monday night on the
strife-torn island of Jolo in Sulu, the country's southernmost
province.
	   Xiao was talking with his new father-in-law at the reception at
his bride's home when the kidnappers, armed with rifles and
pistols, dragged him to a waiting vehicle, police said.
	   Xiao and his wife met earlier in Japan, they said.
	   Xiao, whose hometown was not available, arrived in the
Philippines with his mother on Saturday to marry Joselyn Ismael in
a Muslim ceremony. The two were scheduled to leave for Manila the
day after the wedding.
	   No ransom demand has been received, police said.
	   Tourists have been advised not to visit Jolo, where at least two
Muslim rebel groups are active.
	   Several foreigners, mostly Christian missionaries, have been
kidnapped in Sulu.
	   Kidnapping for ransom is a thriving criminal activity in Manila
and the southern Philippines.

U.S. vice president to tour Chernobyl on visit to Ukraine

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ U.S. Vice President Al Gore arrived in
Ukraine on Wednesday for a two-day visit that will take him to the
country's most infamous landmark _ the Chernobyl nuclear power
plant.
	   Gore will get an up-close look Thursday at the concrete and
steel sarcophagus covering Chernobyl's Reactor No. 4, which was
destroyed in the world's worst nuclear accident in 1986.
	   He will also hold discussions on a new international effort to
raise funds to rebuild the huge shelter, which has been steadily
deteriorating and raised concerns that radioactive materials could
leak out.
	   So far, Ukraine has secured less than half of the dlrs 758
million needed to repair the sarcophagus.
	   During his visit to Chernobyl, the U.S. vice president will stop
at Pripyat, a town next to the plant that has been evacuated due to
radioactive fallout from the accident.
	   Gore, who often speaks about environmental issues, chaired an
international conference in New York last year on the Chernobyl
clean-up.
	   ``Chernobyl was one of the key events of this century that made
us realize we are all neighbors... on an interlinked planet,'' the
vice president said at the time. ``We seek to avoid further
tragedy.''
	   Gore will also attend the second meeting of the U.S.-Ukrainian
bilateral cooperation, which he co-chairs with Ukrainian President
Leonid Kuchma.
	   Wednesday's sessions will focus on ways to enhance bilateral
cooperation and trade, according to U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine
Steven Pifer.
	   The United States is Ukraine's largest foreign investor,
accounting for more than dlrs 400 million of the dlrs 2.1 billion
invested in the former Soviet republic since independence in 1991.
	   But officials on both sides say the figure could be much higher.
Western businessmen frequently complain that the bureaucracy and
corruption in Ukraine make it difficult for foreign firms to
operate effectively.
	   The commission is also to discuss Ukraine's role in European
security, Kiev's pledges to speed up economic reforms, and the
development of small-scale businesses.
	   Washington has expressed displeasure with the pace of economic
reforms in Ukraine, and had threatened to withhold part of its dlrs
225 million in assistance to Ukraine in 1998.
	   Ukraine, which has a population of 50 million, is currently the
third-largest recipient of American financial aid.
	   From Ukraine, Gore will travel Friday to Moscow for meetings
with Russian officials, including Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko.

Dissidents: Bahraini activist dies of torture in detention
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Two Bahraini opposition groups Wednesday
accused Bahraini security forces of torturing to death a Shiite
activist in detention.
	   The body of Nouh Khalil Abdel Allah Nouh, 19, was handed over to
his family on Tuesday, and he was buried Wednesday in a funeral
attended by thousands of people chanting anti-government slogans,
the groups said.
	   ``The body showed signs of torture by burning, beating by sharp
instruments and electrical drills,'' the Islamic Liberal Movement
of Bahrain, said in a statement.
	   A similar statement was issued by the Islamic Front for the
Liberation of Bahrain, which is based in Lebanon. The two
statements were faxed to The Associated Press in Cairo.
	   Bahraini officials rarely comment on such reports by the
opposition. There was no way to independently confirm the claims.
	   The dissident groups said Nouh was arrested Sunday as part of a
crackdown on Shiite Muslims who have been leading a campaign for
political and social reforms in Bahrain since December 1994. More
than 40 people have been killed in the violence linked to the
campaign.
	   Human rights organizations such as Amnesty International and
Human Rights Watch have accused Bahraini security officials of
torturing detainees.
	   Shiites form a slight majority of Bahrain's 400,000 citizens.
The ruling Al-Khalifa family belongs to the mainstream Sunni Muslim
sect.
	   Bahrain, a key U.S. ally in the Gulf region, provides a base for
the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet, consisting of 15 warships and about
1,500 service members and their families.

Japanese stocks fall sharply, dollar surges in Tokyo

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stocks fell sharply Wednesday on worry the
front runner in a ruling party contest to choose the next prime
minister won't do enough to stimulate Japan's anemic economy if he
emerges the winner. The dollar surged against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average sank 263.63 points,
or 1.6 percent, to close at 16,293.06. On Tuesday, the average lost
14.09 points, or 0.09 percent.
	   Stocks were sold off on concern Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi
will win a three-way race to succeed outgoing Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto. The ruling party plans to elect a new president
Friday, who will then become the next prime minister.
	   ``What the market wants is drastic financial reforms, but Obuchi
seems to lack the ability to launch such reforms,'' said Sachio
Ishikawa, general manager of the stock division at Chuo Securities
Co.
	   Opinion polls show greater public support for Health Minister
Junichiro Koizumi and veteran politician Seiroku Kajiyama. But the
mathematics of ruling party factional politics suggest that Obuchi
is leading the race, Japanese newspapers reported Wednesday.
	   ``The market doesn't approve of Obuchi as the next prime
minister,'' said Kunihiro Hatae, general manager of stock trading
at Tokyo Securities Co.
	   Led lower by bank stocks, the broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of
all issues listed on the first section lost 19.32 points, or 1.5
percent, to 1,257.85. On Tuesday, the TOPIX closed down 0.78
points, or 0.06 percent, the day before.
	   On the Tokyo foreign exchange market, meanwhile, the dollar
rallied against the yen amid spreading sentiment that a win by
Foreign Minister Obuchi in the ruling party poll Friday would be a
minus for the Japanese economy, traders said.
	   The dollar bought 140.68 yen in mid-afternoon trading, up 1.20
yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo and also above its late New York
rate of 140.40 yen overnight.
	   ``Nobody's looking at an Obuchi win as a yen-positive factor,''
said Kazuo Takayama, chief foreign exchange manager at the Tokyo
office of Midland Bank. ``Therefore, yen selling is likely to
continue,'' he said.
	   In the fixed-income market, the yield on the benchmark No. 182
10-year Japanese government bond fell to 1.395 percent from
Tuesday's finish of 1.415 percent, driving its price up to 110.43
yen from 110.30 yen.

Hong Kong most open; Vietnam most `protected' Asian economy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Led by Hong Kong, Asia's most open economies
are among those doing the best job of weathering the region's
crisis, a report said Wednesday, noting that while protectionism is
falling, it remains a serious risk.
	   Asian economies face large challenges and temptations to impose
limitations on goods, services and investment as they try to work
out of their problems, the Hong Kong-based Political and Economic
Risk Consultancy said.
	   Among them are the desire to protect domestic companies during a
time of trouble, the weak state of major sectors like banking in
China that could threaten social stability if liberalized too
quickly, and U.S. policy, the report said.
	   One of the most serious external worries, it said, was that the
United States would ``push too hard for reform in some Asian
countries in ways that are not politically or socially
digestible.''
	   But it would be even more serious, the report said, if the
United States moved from promoting liberalization to protecting its
own market from Asia's problems.
	   A survey of more than 400 business executives in the region
found Hong Kong the most open economy, followed by Singapore and
Taiwan. Those economies have not escaped the Asian economic crisis,
but still are faring better than many of their neighbors.
	   On the bottom of the scale, Vietnam was judged to be most
protectionist, slightly worse than South Korea, China, Thailand and
Indonesia.
	   Despite Hong Kong's wide-open economic tradition, it could be
hurt by changes in trade policies, the report said.
	   If other Asian countries open up their economies, Hong Kong's
competitive advantage could disappear, and it also may lose its
edge as an exporter to the world as regional trading blocs are
formed and importers look for supplies closer to home.
	   It may also lose an edge as China looks to trade directly
through its own ports, the think tank said.
	   Despite their poor rankings, the report cited changes in South
Korea and Thailand that are making them more open. However, at the
same time, recession means Thais now simply cannot afford imports
they might otherwise buy.

Japanese midfielder Nakata to move to Italian club Perugia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's star soccer player Hidetoshi Nakata is
moving to Italian club Perugia, ending weeks of speculation over
his intentions for the upcoming season.
	   Yoshinori Shigematsu, president of Shonan Bellmare Hiratsuka FC
_ Nakata's Japanese team _ said Wednesday that the star midfielder
had reached a basic agreement with Perugia.
	   Shigematsu refused to disclose the size of the contract.
	   Nakata is scheduled to join the team on Thursday, and the final
signing will take place in Italy, Shigematsu said.
	   ``I feel bad not being able to properly say good-bye to my fans,
but I'll make up for it by doing my best over there,'' Nakata told
a hastily called news conference.
	   Nakata spoke to more than 100 reporters who gathered at Tokyo's
main international airport before his departure for Italy.
	   Nakata's transfer to a top European team had been a hot topic of
conversation in Japan since the national team's debut in the World
Cup, where several European clubs were reportedly eyeing him as a
possible new recruit.
	   Japan lost all three of its Group H matches in the first round
in France.
	   Earlier this month after returning from Europe, Nakata had
denied that he was nearing an agreement with Perugia. While in
Europe, he reportedly met with officials from several clubs that
had expressed an interest in acquiring him.
	   ``Perugia told us that Nakata is highly evaluated by the team.
So I believe he is seen as a key player,'' Shigematsu was quoted as
saying by Kyodo News service.
	   Perugia is set for promotion to Italy's Serie A. Nakata will be
only the second Japanese to play in that league, considered among
the world's best.
	   Kazuyoshi Miura, a striker for Japan's Verdy Kawasaki team,
played with another Italian team, Genoa, in the 1994-1995 season.
	   Perugia, founded in 1905, finished fourth in Serie B last season
and earned promotion to Serie A in the playoffs. The club is
scheduled to begin training July 21 and to play a friendly match
with fellow Serie A side Bologna on Aug. 8, Kyodo reported.

China detains another dissident in widening crackdown
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ In a widening crackdown on dissent following U.S.
President Bill Clinton's visit, Chinese police detained a labor
activist Wednesday and searched his home, a human rights group
said.
	   Seven police officers went to Zhang Shanguang's home in southern
Hunan province and took him away, the Information Center of Human
Rights and Democratic Movement in China said.
	   In a two-hour search, police even checked his son's school books
and wife's sanitary towels and confiscated books and a charter
Zhang was drafting for an association he was planning to set up to
protect laid-off workers' rights, the Information Center said.
	   Zhang already has served seven years in prison for pro-democracy
activities, the Hong Kong-based group said. It surmised his latest
detention was linked to his preparations for a workers'
association.
	   Zhang is at least the 15th dissident to have been detained since
Clinton ended his nine-day visit to China on July 3. While many
were later released, other activists remain in detention, including
three founders of an illegal opposition party.
	   Authorities have charged another veteran activist, Li Bifeng,
with fraud. On Tuesday, a court in southern China also sentenced
dissident Fan Yiping to three years imprisonment, a verdict his
wife and brother attacked Wednesday as political persecution.
	   Ai Hua and Fan Weiping said Fan's conviction for helping a
fellow activist escape China was punishment for his pro-democracy
activities.
	   ``This is another act of sabotage against members of the
democracy movement, another crime,'' they said in a statement
released by the New York-based Chinese Democratic Justice Party.
	   ``The authorities have used underhanded means to manufacture
another case of wrongful persecution,'' the statement said.
	   The detention of Zhang, himself a former factory worker, shows
that China is in the midst of a planned, nationwide suppression of
dissent, the Information Center argued.
	   It also indicates that Chinese promises to join international
human rights covenants were aimed at ``cheating world opinion,''
the Hong Kong-based group charged.
	   It said Zhang's plans to form an association for workers' rights
were in line with a U.N. covenant on economic, social and cultural
rights that China signed last year, but has yet to ratify.

Malaysia embarks on mass infrastructure spending to boost economy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's prime minister said the
country will plow ahead with massive infrastructure projects to
spend its way out of economic problems, news reports said
Wednesday.
	   ``The bigger the construction, the more economic activities,''
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad was quoted as saying by Wednesday's
Star newspaper.
	   Mahathir said the new policy had been worked out by the National
Economic Action Council, a committee of experts and officials,
which he chairs.
	   ``We will spend money on anything involved with infrastructure
so that there will be spinoffs to stimulate other industries,''
Mahathir said, adding that 140 industries would benefit from the
construction spree.
	   Malaysia has made a dramatic about-face in recent weeks, with
Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim announcing two fiscal stimulus
packages worth 12 billion ringgit (dlrs 3 billion).
	   The cash injection reverses a fiscal austerity package the
government announced last year, which included 18 percent spending
cuts in an effort to choke off excess demand and stabilize the
economy. The reforms were widely viewed to be as stringent as those
recommended by the International Monetary fund.
	   ``It's the right strategy because we followed the IMF and
tightened liquidity, and there's actually a contraction in the
first three months of this year,'' Mahathir said.
	   In the first quarter, the country's economy shrank by 1.8
percent, compared with 6.9 percent growth in the previous three
months _ one of the steepest slides seen in Asia so far since a
regional economic crisis began last year.
	   The government now concedes that the economy could contract by
up to 2 percent this year, although private economists say it could
shrink by up to 5 percent.

Cambodian election to go ahead in Khmer Rouge zone
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodian election officials said
Wednesday they have tightened security in the former Khmer Rouge
stronghold of Anlong Veng after a murderous attack on election
workers and expect voting to go forward there.
	   ``We are not going to withdraw from that place,'' Im Suorsdei,
spokesman for the National Election Committee, told a news
conference. Election materials destroyed in Friday's attack are
being redeployed and the committee ``will continue its work in that
area.''
	   About 5,000 former Khmer Rouge guerrillas who defected to the
government when Anlong Veng was captured in April are scheduled to
vote in Sunday's parliamentary elections, but a remaining hard-line
guerrilla faction has vowed to disrupt the polling.
	   Two people were killed when about five guerrillas opened fire on
a convoy of election officials Friday as they were traveling 16
kilometers (10 miles) east of Anlong Veng. Ballot papers and other
election materials were then burned.
	   The attack was attributed to Khmer Rouge under Ta Mok, the
one-legged general known as ``The Butcher'' for his revolutionary
brutality, who is believed to control a few hundred guerrillas
along the border with Thailand.
	   The Khmer Rouge, which caused the deaths of as many as 2 million
Cambodians between 1975 and 1979, continued to wage guerrilla
warfare against successive governments after they were ousted from
power by Vietnamese-backed troops.
	   Wracked by defections in the past two years, they appear to be
on the verge of extinction and pose little threat to balloting,
though they would be capable of carrying out hit-and-run attacks
and small raids.
	   The NEC said that there are 11 polling stations in the Anlong
Veng area to serve 5,000 registered voters, including four at the
site of the attack.
	   Im Suorsdei said that he hoped it would be possible for foreign
and national observers to be stationed in Anlong Veng, but the
``question is very difficult for me to answer now.''

Swiss president to appeal to Clinton over sanctions threats
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss President Flavio Cotti plans to
make a direct appeal to his U.S. counterpart Bill Clinton over
threats of sanctions by some U.S. cities and states, a Swiss
official said Wednesday.
	   In a letter, Cotti warns Clinton that the sanctions could
threaten good relations between Switzerland and the United States
and calls on him to move decisively against sanctions, according to
Swiss Foreign Ministry spokesman Franz Egle.
	   A number of U.S. cities and states have threatened to impose
sanctions on Switzerland's two major banks if they do not agree an
acceptable settlement of Holocaust survivors' claims.
	   Talks have been stalled since Jewish leaders reacted angrily to
the offer by the banks on June 19 of dlrs 600 million to settle the
claims.
	   Switzerland's ambassador in Washington, Alfred Defago, will
deliver the letter to the White House Wednesday evening, Egle said.
	   The Clinton administration, which has praised Switzerland for
the efforts it is making to assess its wartime past and make amends
for any wrongdoing, has repeatedly opposed the sanctions.
	   During a brief visit to Geneva in May, the U.S. president
assured Swiss officials of his opposition to the measures.

Honduran police officer who helped death squads deported by Canada
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ A former Honduran police officer who admitted to
helping an army death squad has been deported from Canada.
	   The deportation of Fausto Ramon Reyes-Caballero on Tuesday ended
his 10-year fight to stay in Canada with his wife and children.
	   Reyes-Caballero, 42, had admitted to helping members of
Battalion 3-16, a Honduran army unit responsible for the
disappearance and torture of hundreds of citizens during the 1980s.
	   He came to Canada in 1988 and was ordered deported in 1993. He
appealed, but lost in 1995.
	   Immigration officers finally arrested Reyes-Caballero, who was
working as a cab driver, last week in Prescott, Ontario, said Kevin
Sack, an immigration spokesman.
	   Canada attempted to have Reyes-Caballero deported once before,
but was unable to negotiate guarantees for his safety.
	   Honduras has since signed a treaty against torture, a move that
apparently has alleviated Canadian concerns.
	   Reyes-Caballero led a police motorcycle squad in Honduras.
	   In 1995, he told two reporters how he apprehended Hermino Deras,
the leader of the Honduran Communist Party, for three members of
Battalion 3-16, then went to eat an enchilada.
	   He said he heard a gunshot and looked out to the street. Deras
was dead.
	   Reyes-Caballero said he thought the people he was pulling over
were terrorists, but realized later that they were not.

Chechen troops free six Russian police hostages
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Chechen troops have freed six Russian policemen
held hostage in the breakaway Russian republic since their capture
in a nearby region seven months ago, a news report said Wednesday.
	   The policemen, who were released Tuesday, were kidnapped last
December by Chechens who raided a Russian military unit in the
neighboring region of Dagestan, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   The kidnappers had demanded that Dagestan trade jailed Chechens
for the police hostages, but officials in Dagestan refused,
ITAR-Tass said.
	   There was no word on whether ransom money was paid for the
release.
	   Scores of people, many of them ethnic Russians and foreigners,
have been kidnapped in or near Chechnya since the end of the 1996
independence war with Russia. Most of the kidnappings are carried
out by armed criminal groups seeking ransom.
	   Chechnya's government has set up an anti-kidnapping unit to deal
with the problem, but abductions are still common.
	   Chechnya has had de facto independence since Russian troops
pulled out at the end of 1996, but no country recognizes the claim.

2002 World Cup may be rescheduled to avoid rainy season
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ The 2002 World Cup may have to be
rescheduled to avoid the usual June-July rainy season in Japan and
South Korea, South Korea's top soccer official said Wednesday.
	   The World Cup finals have traditionally been held in June and
July, avoiding pro league schedules in Europe and South America.
But Japan and South Korea think that schedule should be changed in
2002 to avoid the rains.
	   Japan and South Korea are co-hosts of the 2002 World Cup,
soccer's first premier event to be held in Asia.
	   ``The rescheduling is an urgent matter that should be decided on
by the end of this year at the latest,'' Chung Moon-joon, head of
the (South) Korean Football Association, said at a luncheon meeting
with local journalists.
	   Chung, a vice president representing Asia in soccer's governing
body, FIFA, suggested that the 2002 World Cup finals be rescheduled
for September.
	   He noted that the 1998 Summer Olympics in Seoul were held in
September and that the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo were staged in
October.
	   When the issue was unofficially raised at a FIFA executive
meeting in Paris in June, Chung said he understood that most
members showed support for the suggested rescheduling.
	   ``This year, as usual, Japan and South Korea had much rain
during the World Cup in France,'' he said. This year's World Cup
was held from June 10 to July 12.
	   Chung said changing the schedule will not be easy, because it
will require agreement from all major national soccer committees
and clubs in Europe and South America, which virtually control
FIFA.
	   Chung also said he still wants North Korea to share two or three
of the 32 World Cup matches South Korea will stage in 2002. The
other 32 matches will be played in Japan.
	   North Korea so far has taken no official stand on the proposed
sharing, suggested by South Korea and endorsed by FIFA last year.
	   ``I think the important thing for now is that North Korea should
try to build trust by taking part in regional friendship
tournaments or inter-Korea goodwill matches,'' Chung said.

Concern grows over possible spread of Kosovo fighting

Macedonia. &QL;

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The heaviest fighting in weeks has
cast new doubt on peace efforts in Kosovo and has increased fears
that the violence could spill into neighboring Macedonia.
	   A fourth day of clashes near the strategic town of Orahovac in
central Kosovo left at least 36 ethnic Albanians dead Tuesday,
Albanian sources said.
	   The fighting cast doubt on the possibility of a negotiated
settlement between Serbia, the dominant republic of Yugoslavia, and
the independence-minded ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of
Kosovo's population.
	   The continued fighting also led the U.N. Security Council to
vote Tuesday to expand the peacekeeping force in Macedonia.
	   In an attempt to cobble together peace talks in Kosovo,
Christopher Hill, the U.S. ambassador to Macedonia, met Tuesday
with Ibrahim Rugova, the moderate ethnic Albanian leader. Hill had
conferred with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic in Belgrade on
Monday.
	   Before meeting with Rugova, Hill indicated no quick solution to
the Kosovo crisis was in sight.
	   Rugova's party, the Democratic League of Kosovo, on Tuesday
condemned what it called the ``violence and massacre by Serb forces
in Orahovac.'' The town appeared largely under Serb control after
the Kosovo Liberation Army launched a strong attack there Saturday.
	   The capture of Orahovac, located about 30 miles (50 kilometers)
southwest of the provincial capital, Pristina, would have expanded
the nearly 40 percent of Kosovo the KLA is said to control _ and
given the rebels command of a strategic road.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, which is close to ethnic Albanian
politicians, claimed Serb forces were still shelling KLA positions
in Orahovac on Tuesday and that fighting was also raging in
outlying villages.
	   It said at least 36 Albanians had been killed, including women
and children.
	   Meanwhile, the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday unanimously
agreed to add about 300 troops to its peacekeeping force in
Macedonia, mostly to strengthen security along Macedonia's borders
with Kosovo and Albania. U.S. troops will make up about half of the
1,000-plus force.

Ex-President asks Indonesian government to postpone house gift
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Former President Suharto has asked
Indonesia's cash-strapped government to postpone plans to build him
a dlrs 2 million mansion as a retirement gift, a senior Cabinet
minister said Wednesday.
	   State Secretary Akbar Tanjung said Suharto felt the money should
be spent elsewhere as Indonesia battles its worst economic crisis
in 30 years.
	   ``It would be better for the government to concentrate on fixing
the economic crisis rather than giving me a house at this time of
great difficulty,'' Akbar quoted Suharto as saying.
	   Suharto said that if the government had gone ahead with the
gift, he would have donated the money to the poor and struggling
farmers.
	   The minister met the former leader after a furor erupted among
legislators over the house plan.
	   Under a 1978 law enacted during Suharto's 32-year rule, the
government is obliged to provide houses for retired presidents and
vice presidents.
	   Some lawmakers said Suharto should not be rewarded extravagantly
while the rest of the country grapples with soaring inflation, mass
unemployment and growing poverty.
	   Opponents of Suharto blame him for the economic crisis and have
accused him of enriching his family during his time in office.
	   Akbar said Suharto's successor, President B.J. Habibie, ``highly
respected'' Suharto's decision.
	   ``It shows the former president is very concerned about the
country's economic situation,'' Akbar said.
	   Habibie became president after Suharto was forced to quit
following massive protests and riots.
	   Akbar quoted Suharto as saying that all Indonesians should
support Habibie in his efforts to overcome the crisis.
	   The proposed house for Suharto was to have been built near a
theme park established by the former president's late wife, Tien.

Thai central bank slashes overnight repurchase rate
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's central bank has cut a key
interest rate to 7.5 percent from 14.25 percent, a bank official
said Wednesday.
	   The cut was made Tuesday in the bank's overnight repurchase
rate, the rate it charges for short-term loans to financial
institutions that deposit government securities as collateral. It
is an indicator of interest rates charged by commercial banks for
loans to one another.
	   Local and foreign commercial banks immediately followed suit by
cutting their overnight interbank rates. Rates offered by Thai
banks dropped to 13 percent Wednesday from 15.5 percent Tuesday,
while those offered by local branches of foreign banks, more active
as lenders, slid to 4 to 5 percent from 6 to 8 percent.
	   The central bank rate fell because the Bank of Thailand did not
borrow from the repurchase market, said the official, who declined
to be named. She said the market also enjoyed high liquidity at the
moment.
	   The central bank has borrowed less from the repurchase market
since it issued one-year domestic bonds worth 20 billion baht (dlrs
487 million) to refinance the debts of the Financial Institutions
Development Fund, a rescue fund for ailing finance companies.
	   The central bank plans to issue 500 billion baht (dlrs 12.1
billion) in bonds over the next few years for this purpose. The
FIDF spent about 1 trillion baht (dlrs 23.8 billion) last year to
prop up troubled institutions, 56 of which have been shut down and
ordered into liquidation.

Toyota president cuts 1998 domestic output forecast by 7 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ With sales slumping, Toyota Motor Corp., Japan's
largest automaker, now expects its domestic production this year to
be 7 percent less than forecast earlier, a spokeswoman said
Wednesday.
	   The new forecast of 3.2 million vehicles was presented by
Hiroshi Okuda, the company's president, at a news conference in
Nagoya, where Toyota has its headquarters, the spokeswoman said.
	   Auto sales in Japan have slumped in line with shrinking overall
consumer demand as the economy suffers its worst recession since
World War II.
	   Last year, Toyota's produced 3.5 million vehicles at its
Japanese plants.

Netanyahu denies reports of secret negotiations with Syria
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday
denied claims he was engaged in secret peace talks with Syria.
	   Netanyahu responded to reports that Cabinet hawk Ariel Sharon
warned Golan Heights settlers that the prime minister was secretly
negotiating an Israeli pullback from the strategic plateau.
	   Netanyahu said Wednesday that such negotiations were impossible
as long as Syrian President Hafez Assad insisted that Israel first
commit in principle to a withdrawal from all of the Golan which
Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war.
	   ``We have sent many messages to Assad from all possible
directions that if he wants negotiations, and we are prepared for
them, Syria must back down from the preconditions it has set,''
Netanyahu told Israel radio.
	   ``There is a difference of opinion between us. They want us to
leave the Golan Heights and we don't want to,'' Netanyahu said.
	   Israeli-Syrian negotiations were suspended in February 1996.
	   Israeli media speculated Wednesday that Sharon, who is on a
visit to China, may have made the allegations in hopes of
pressuring one of Netanyahu's coalition partners, the centrist
Third Way which has close ties to the Golan settlers.
	   The Third Way ran in the 1996 elections on a platform of
preventing a Golan withdrawal, but at the same time advocated
territorial compromise with the Palestinians.
	   In recent days, the Third Way has threatened to bring down the
government unless Netanyahu reached agreement with the Palestinians
by next week on a troop withdrawal from 13 percent of the West
Bank. Sharon staunchly opposes such a pullback, saying it would
endanger Israel's security.
	   In a meeting with Golan settler leaders last week, Sharon
reportedly said that by pushing for a 13 percent withdrawal, the
Third Way was unwittingly paving the way for a Golan withdrawal.
	   Netanyahu is holding secret talks with the Syrians, and once a
West Bank pullback is out of the way, the Golan would be next,
Sharon reportedly told the Golan settlers.
	   Israel's parliament was to vote later Wednesday on a Third Way
bill stipulating that any withdrawal from the Golan would have to
be approved in a national referendum.
	   The legislation was expected to win parliamentary approval, with
some members of the opposition Labor Party also likely to support
it.

North Korea to return remains of U.S. soldiers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ North Korea will return several sets
of remains believed to be those of U.S. soldiers killed in the
1950-53 Korean War, the American-led U.N. Command said Wednesday.
	   The remains will be turned over Friday at the truce village of
Panmunjom inside the Demilitarized Zone separating the two Koreas,
the command said in a news release.
	   The remains were discovered by a joint U.S.-North Korea recovery
team, it said. The command did not say when or where the remains
were exhumed.
	   More than 50,000 American soldiers were killed in the Korean
conflict, and about 8,100 of them are unaccounted for.
	   It will be the second repatriation of U.S. remains by North
Korea in a little more than two months. In mid-May, two sets of
remains were returned.
	   Since 1990, 218 sets of remains have been returned but less than
a dozen have been positively identified.
	   The remains to be returned Friday will be sent to an Army
identification laboratory in Hawaii for forensic tests.
	   The two Koreas are technically still in a state of war, because
the Korean conflict ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty.
	   The U.N. Command consists of the United States and 15 other
Western countries that fought on South Korea's side in the Korean
War.

Floods threaten millions along China's longest river
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Dikes holding back surging floodwaters in the
Yangtze, China's longest river, could collapse in the next few
weeks, threatening millions of people, an official newspaper said
Wednesday.
	   The already waterlogged embankments are the only flood
protection for Yueyang city in southern Hunan province and the
Dongting Lake area, where 10 million people live, the China Daily
said.
	   In a sign of official concern, President Jiang Zemin personally
ordered the reinforcement of dikes along the Yangtze, which snakes
through some of China's most populated areas, the state-run Xinhua
News Agency said.
	   More than 1,000 people have already died this year in flooding
that began earlier and has been heavier than usual. The floods have
caused more than 84 billion yuan (U.S. dlrs 10 billion) in economic
losses.
	   Water levels in Dongting Lake have remained above alarm levels
for weeks and were still rising, the China Daily said. The waters
threatened Changsha, Hunan's provincial capital, the newspaper
added.
	   Waters in the channel where the lake flows into the Yangtze were
almost a meter (3.3 feet) above danger level, it said. Farmers in
the area have been manning dikes while their families hurried to
bring in the early rice crop, it reported.
	   High waters were worsening the condition of waterlogged dikes in
the lake area. In Yueyang city, which can mobilize 500,000 people
to cope with flood emergencies, officials were told to step up
patrols and stay at their posts.
	   Downstream, in the industrial city of Wuhan, nearly half a meter
(1.6 feet) of rain fell in 11 hours Tuesday, the highest level ever
registered, the Economic Daily reported.
	   Television showed cars and bicycles floating down Wuhan's
streets, and said one-fifth of the city was flooded to some degree.
	   Sandbags were piled along the banks of the Yangtze, which runs
through the city and already was 1.23 meters (4 feet) above danger
levels, the Economic Daily reported.

	   Mousavi-Lari, a vice president and key ally of Khatami, was
named to the post earlier this month after former interior minister
was impeached for his reformist views.
	   His approval was seen as a major test for Khatami even though
the Parliament, dominated by hard-liners, was expected to approve
the appointment in deference to Khatami's popularity.
	   Khatami, who attended the opening session accompanied by
moderate allies, Cultural Minister Ataollah Mohajerani and
vice-president Hassan Habibi, left before the vote.
	   In a speech to the house, he said ``real security'' could only
be achieved if the public is able to express itself and feel it is
participating in determining its future.
	   ``It is our responsibility to prepare the ground for people's
participation in all the economic, political and cultural affairs
of the society.''
	   ``This grave task'' must be accomplished by the interior
ministry, he said.
	   Mousavi-Lari, 44, was deputy minister of culture and Islamic
guidance from 1982 to 1992, when Khatami was the minister.

To pay jobless, Thai Cabinet may seize failed textile firm assets
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's Cabinet has authorized
seizing the assets of a troubled textile company if it fails to pay
severance to laid-off workers, the government spokesman said
Wednesday.
	   ``It would be a measure of last resort,'' said Akhapol
Sorasuchart, the spokesman. ``So far the company has not officially
closed yet.''
	   The company, Thai Melon Textiles, announced earlier this week it
was shutting down operations because it could no longer obtain
loans from banks to buy raw materials.
	   Thai Melon is one of the largest textile companies in Thailand.
Its closure would put as many as 5,000 people out of work.
	   The company has scheduled a meeting with the employees' union
next Tuesday to discuss the compensation issue, warning it may not
have enough funds to pay the legal rates because of the its debts.
	   Workers began demonstrating at the company and at Parliament
demanding full compensation.
	   At least 1,000 of the workers are 20-year veterans of the

closure might prove temporary.

	   Mousavi-Lari quit the ministry when Khatami was forced to resign
by hard-liners who objected to his giving the press more freedom,
liberalizing state-run television, and permitting filmmakers to
pursue non-Islamic themes.
	   Mousavi-Lari presented his program after Khatami's speech and
said that as interior minister he plans to expand public freedoms.
	   ``My main goals are urban, social and political development.
Political development means encouraging the participation of the
people in deciding their own fate and that of their government,''
he told the deputies.
	   He also called for more tolerance.
	   ``We believe in political development which means a government
that is based on the vote of the people. The government should
increase its tolerance to accept the ideas and opinions of its
opponents.''
	   The majority parliament faction, Hezbollah, had said Tuesday it
would not oppose Mousavi-Lari's nomination despite what it said
were his shortcomings.
	   Some Hezbollah members in parliament spoke out against the
appointment, saying he was inexperienced to ``handle the heavy
responsibility.''
	   Former Interior Minister Abdollah Nouri, also a moderate cleric,
was impeached by the hard-line parliament last month on grounds
that he allowed political demonstrations which rocked the country's
security.
	   The hard-liners had hoped to pressure Khatami into appointing
one of their own to the post, but apparently bowed away, fearing it
would provoke millions of Khatami supporters who voted him to power
last year.
	   The hard-liners already control the armed forces, the
Intelligence Ministry, and the state-run radio and television.
	   Khatami has won wide support for his moves to ease social
restrictions, encourage political freedom, and end nearly 20 years
of hostility with the United States.
	   Such moves have also stirred the hard-liners to attack the
Khatami camp. They have brought to trial on graft charges the mayor
of Tehran, who ran Khatami's election campaign, and closed several
liberal newspapers.

FIFA President Blatter steps down from Swiss Olympic bid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SION, Switzerland (AP) _ Sepp Blatter, the newly elected
president of soccer's world governing body FIFA, is to step down
next month as head of the committee bidding for the 2006 Winter
Olympics to come to Switzerland.
	   The organizing committee of the bid to host the games in Sion,
in Blatter's native canton (state) of Valais, said Wednesday he
would resign the chairmanship on August 28, when a replacement
would be named.
	   Blatter, 62, has said he doesn't think holding the double role
of head of FIFA and the Winter Olympics bid is possible any longer.
	   However, he is one of the most prominent campaigners for the
Sion bid and has said he will continue to support it.
	   Blatter was elected as FIFA president in June.

Assault on Indian journalist by army alleged
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ An Indian editor in the insurgency-torn
eastern state of Assam was assaulted by armed men believed to be
soldiers in plainclothes, an American organization for journalists
said Wednesday,
	   Ajit Kumar Bhuyan, editor of the Assamese-language weekly Natun
Samoy, and his family were threatened and his house was ransacked,
seemingly for writing articles critical of the Indian Army's
anti-insurgency operations, the New York-based Committee to Protect
Journalists alleged in a letter to Indian Prime Minister Atal
Bihari Vajpayee. A copy of the letter was faxed to news agencies.
	   The army has denied the attack and said it might have been
carried out by people pretending to be soldiers, according to the
letter.
	   The letter said Bhuyan's residence was surrounded on July 18 by
20 armed men in civilian clothes who forced him and his family
members to come out. The armed men later ransacked the three-story
building, although nothing was stolen.
	   ``I strongly feel that the army has become a constant threat to
the lives of honest Indian citizens who have been speaking out for
the oppressed masses,'' Bhuyan was quoted as saying.
	   Bhuyan said he believed the attackers were soldiers because they
spoke Hindi, which is not the local language. He also recognized
one of the men as an army captain, the letter quoted him as saying.
	   The Paris-based journalists' organization Reporters Sans
Frontiers alleged last week that two Indian journalists in Assam
and the neighboring Manipur state were injured in attacks by Indian
soldiers.
	   Assam is one of several states in India's northeast that are in
the grip of separatist violence unleashed by groups fighting
India's military.

Iraq blasts visit by U.S mediator to Kurdish area
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A government-run newspaper on Wednesday
criticized a visit by a senior U.S diplomat to the Kurdish
controlled area in the north, saying it was an attempt to undermine
Iraq's security and safety.
	   Deputy Assistant Secretary of State David Welsh met rival
Kurdish leaders in northern Iraq last week in a bid to broker an
end to their fighting for control over the area.
	   ``This is a clear violation of Iraq's independence ... and a
plot against Iraq's security,'' the Al-Thawra newspaper of the
ruling Baath party said in a front page editorial.
	   It also accused the United States of trying to torpedo the Iraqi
leadership's attempts to reconcile the two Kurdish groups among
themselves and with the government.
	   The Kurdish zone was set up by Western allies in 1991 at the end
of the Gulf War after Iraqi forces failed to crush a Kurdish
rebellion to free the province from President Saddam Hussein's
control.
	   But instead of consolidating Kurdish rule, the rival groups
bickered for power and have been fighting to gain full control of
the autonomous zone. Iraq considers the zone a violation of its
sovereignty.
	   The Americans ``are not concerned about the well-being of the
Kurds but want to prevent the Kurds from having normal relations
with the central government and prolong the absence of the legal
authority from the north,'' it said.
	   The paper, however did not criticize the Kurdish leaders for
talking to Welsh, who traveled to the area from Turkey accompanied
by Turkish diplomats.
	   The two groups have maintained an off-and-on cease-fire since
May 1997 and Welsh persuaded them to hold peace talks in the United
States.
	   Their talks so far have been held along a line that separates
their forces. Negotiations have been hampered by differences over
relations with the Iraqi government in Baghdad and over the sharing
of revenue from ``taxes'' levied on goods smuggled into northern
Iraq.

Senior official defends inquiry into airport mess
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A senior Hong Kong official on Wednesday
rejected criticism that the government's inquiry into the problems
of its new airport would be too general, too slow and too limited
in scope.
	   Financial Secretary Donald Tsang told Hong Kong radio that the
two-member commission appointed by Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa
would conduct a ``judicial inquiry'' to find out what went wrong at
the dlrs 20 billion Chek Lap Kok airport, which opened July 6.
	   Despite press reports Wednesday that a passenger had become
stuck in the airport's driverless people-mover and missed two
flights to London, most people agree that passenger services have
improved after a bad start.
	   However, cargo-handling problems are more serious. After
computer and mechanical breakdowns, the main cargo handler now says
it plans to be up to full speed at the new airport only at the end
of August.
	   Economists have warned that crimps in air cargo supplies could
lead to more layoffs. At 4.5 percent, Hong Kong's unemployment
already is at a 15-year high.
	   ``We have been disappointed, and we want to get to the bottom of
it,'' Tsang said.
	   The investigative commission, announced Tuesday, will include
respected Justice Woo Kwok-hing, who also headed the commission
overseeing May 24 legislative elections, and former stock exchange
chairman Edgar Cheng. Tung said they would issue a report in six
months.
	   Critics immediately questioned the lack of outside experts on
the commission, the amount of time it will take to issue a report,
and whether it would be able to scrutinize independent contractors
such as the air cargo handler.
	   But Tsang said the commission amounted to a ``full-scale
judicial commission of inquiry.''
	   He said it would have power to seek international expert
testimony, but that Hong Kong could not expect any overseas expert
to stay with it for the entire length of the study.
	   ``This is a judicial inquiry, and it has to do a very thorough
job, including taking evidence from a whole host of people: the
Airport Authority, the government officials, and there will be all
the franchisees involved,'' he said.
	   A government ombudsman and the legislature also have announced
inquiries into the airport's failures.

Vietnam short more than 100,000 teachers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Low pay and rising numbers of students
have contributed to a shortage of 100,000 teachers in Vietnam, the
newspaper Thanh Nien reported Wednesday.
	   The total includes 50,000 primary-school teachers, 38,000 in
middle schools and 15,000 in secondary schools, the paper said,
quoting a report of the Ministry of Education and Training at an
annual review meeting with provincial education departments.
	   Monthly teacher salaries average dlrs 30-40, not much above the
national per-capita income in a country where 80 percent of the
people are farmers. As a result, many teachers, particularly in the
south, have switched to better-paying professions.
	   With the population increasing by an estimated 1.3 million per
year, the number of students is rising, too. The paper said nearly
14,000 new classrooms were built last year, with 3,538 classrooms
having to handle three shifts of students a day.
	   Participants at the meeting, which ended Wednesday, suggested
that more private schools should be established and that teachers
should get better pay.

Chinese gymnast paralyzed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS throughout and UPDATES with new quotes. &QL; 
 &UR; By HAL BOCK &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ For every gymnast, the worst fear is
losing control during their gravity-defying routines as they spin
and somersault through the air.
	   That worst fear became reality for 17-year-old Sang Lan during
warmups for the women's vault competition at the Goodwill Games.
The Chinese gymnast remained paralyzed Wednesday after landing on
her head as she practiced for the competition.
	   Sang was attempting a forward vault Tuesday night when she
tumbled, landing on the floor of the Nassau Coliseum head-first.
She was removed on a stretcher to the Nassau County Medical Center
where Dr. Brock Schnebel, chief medical officer of the games,
evaluated her injury.
	   Schnebel said X-rays and a CAT scan showed Sang with a
fractured-dislocation of the sixth and seventh cervical vertebrae.
	   ``This has resulted in an injury to her spinal cord,'' the
doctor said.
	   Schnebel said Sang was unable to move her legs and had only
minimal motion of her arms.
	   ``She cannot feel from her mid-chest down,'' he said. ``This is
consistent with a spinal cord injury at the C-6, C-7 (sixth and
seventh vertebrae).''
	   Schnebel said it was too early to predict if Sang could recover
from her injuries and be able to walk again.
	   The other gymnasts were unaware of how seriously Sang had been
injured and the competition started on time, with American Vanessa
Atler winning the event.
	   At the track, Michael Johnson showed he's still the boss,
Maurice Greene left Donovan Bailey almost speechless and one of
track's most enduring stars showed he might at last be finished.
	   Johnson, the 1996 Olympic 200 and 400 champion, erased any
thoughts that his career might be on a downslide, winning the 400
in a meet-record 43.76 seconds.
	   Johnson's time was the 12th-fastest in history _ he holds nine
of the best _ and the fastest in the world since he ran 43.75 at
Waco, Texas, on April 19, 1997.
	   Greene, who has been bad-mouthed by Bailey since winning last
year's 100-meter world championship, quieted the Canadian by racing
to victory in 9.96. Bailey appeared to shut down with 80 meters
left and finished seventh at 10.30, far off his world record of
9.84.
	   ``I guess I'm the world's fastest man,'' Greene said, summing up
the outcome. ``I'm just getting started.''
	   But Sergei Bubka, the greatest pole-vaulter in history, gave
more signs that the end of his career is near.
	   The 34-year-old Ukrainian, who has set the world record 35 times
and is the only one to clear 20 feet (6.1 meters), no-heighted for
the second time in three meets. On his final try at 18 feet, 8 1/4
inches (5.70 meters), the 90-second time limit ran out and Bubka
did not even make an attempt at the bar.
	   Jeff Hartwig won the pole vault with an American record vault of
19-8 1/2 (6.01 meters), breaking his American record by one-quarter
inch (0.6 centimeters).
	   Jackie Joyner-Kersee, the 36-year-old world record-holder in the
heptathlon who has not completed a multi-event since the 1996
Olympic trials, looked woefully out of shape at the start of her
final heptathlon. The two-time Olympic gold medalist finished her
first four events in second place with 3,833 points, 34 behind
leader DeDee Nathan.
	   ``It's been difficult,'' Joyner-Kersee said. ``I'm trying to
stay positive and execute. I'm a fighter.''
	   The final three heptathlon events were scheduled for Wednesday.
	   Atler was convinced somebody would overtake her 9.662 score. But
nobody ever did, sending the 16-year-old home with a gold medal.
	   ``It was nerve wracking,'' she said of watching the other
gymnasts. ``I was very nervous each time someone would go up. I was
really nervous after the last vault. They were really good
competitors.''
	   Finishing behind Atler were Elena Dolgopolova of Russia, who
took the silver with 9.600. Simona Amanar of Romania, winner of the
bronze in the all-around competition on Sunday, took another bronze
in the vault with a 9.587.
	   Three other Americans took home medals Tuesday night. Jay
Thornton won the silver in the floor exercises; Elise Ray won a
silver in the women's uneven bars, and Yewki Tomita captured the
bronze in the pommel horse.
	   Thornton finished behind Alexei Nemov of Russia, who scored
9.725 to Thornton's 9.550. The bronze went to Alexei Bondarenko of
Russia with 9.525.
	   Bondarenko, who earlier won a silver in the all-around, captured
another silver in the pommel behind Russian Nikolay Krukov and in
front of Tomita.
	   Svetlana Khorkina of Russia, reigning world champion in the
event, won the uneven bars and became the first woman to
successfully defend a Goodwill Games title in gymnastics. She
finished with a score of 9.825 to 9.700 for Ray and 9.600 for
Amanar, who won her second bronze of the night and third of the
games.
	   Since 1994, in Olympic, Goodwill Games, World or European
Championships, Khorkina has missed gold only once on the bars,
finishing second in the world championships in 1994.
	   The U.S. basketball team advanced to the semis with a 106-75
victory over Brazil. The United States plays Lithuania in the medal
round Thursday. Australia also advanced with an 82-64 victory over
Lithuania. It was Lithuania's its first loss.
	   In water polo, world-champion Spain defeated the Americans with
Salvador Gomez and Ivan Perez each scoring twice. Then Russia
advanced to the gold-medal game by beating the United States in the
final round-robin match, and will meet Spain for the title.
	   The United States will play Italy for the bronze.

Police conclude missing U.S. divers were left behind at sea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Missing American scuba divers Thomas
and Eileen Lonergan probably died after being left at sea, despite
claims they had staged their disappearance, police told the coroner
Wednesday.
	   The police officer in charge of the investigation, Detective
Sgt. Paul Priest, submitted an 800-page report on the Lonergans'
disappearance on Jan. 25 while on a trip to St. Crispin Reef off
Port Douglas with the dive charter vessel Outer Edge.
	   Police media spokesman Brian Swift said the report had covered
all aspects of the investigation, including the disappearance, the
notification, the search, and local theories that the Lonergans had
faked their deaths or had been involved in a murder-suicide.
	   But Priest said the official police conclusion was that
Lonergan, 34, and Mrs. Lonergan, 28, both of Baton Rouge,
Louisiana, were left behind when the Outer Edge boat left the reef.
	   Police also submitted 63 exhibits, including photographs of the
reef, dive equipment collected on north Queensland beaches,
photographs of the vessel and statements from passengers and crew.
	   The inquest will resume Sept. 7 for full hearings, when
representatives for the Lonergans' families, the owners of the
Outer Edge and the Australian Maritime Safety Authority will be
present.

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's hard-line Parliament on Wednesday
approved the nomination of the new interior minister, handing
reformist President Mohammad Khatami a major victory.
	   Abdolvahed Mousavi-Lari, a moderate cleric, won the votes of 177
deputies in the Majlis while 67 voted against. There were 22
abstentions and four members did not attend the session in the
270-member Parliament.
	   Just before the vote, Mousavi-Lari, 44, called for tolerance by
the country's leaders.
	   ``We believe in political development which means a government
that is based on the vote of the people. The government should
increase its tolerance to accept the ideas and opinions of its
opponents,'' he said in a speech.
	   Mousavi-Lari's approval was seen as a major test for Khatami
even though the Majlis, dominated by hard-liners, was expected to
approve the appointment in deference to Khatami's popularity.
	   Mousavi-Lari, a vice president and key ally of Khatami, was
named to the post earlier this month after the Majlis impeached
former Interior Minister Abdollah Nouri for allowing political
demonstrations that rocked the country.
	   The hard-liners had hoped to pressure Khatami into replacing
Nouri with one of their own but apparently backed down, fearing it
would provoke the millions of Iranians who voted Khatami to power
last year.
	   The hard-liners already control the armed forces, the
Intelligence Ministry, and the state-run radio and television.
	   In a speech to the Majlis before the vote, Khatami, said ``real
security'' could only be achieved if the public is able to express
itself and feel it is participating in determining its future.
	   ``It is our responsibility to prepare the ground for people's
participation in all the economic, political and cultural affairs
of the society,'' he said.
	   ``This grave task'' must be accomplished by the interior
ministry, he said.
	   Mousavi-Lari said his main goals are urban, social and political
development.
	   He was deputy minister of culture and Islamic guidance from 1982
to 1992 when Khatami was the minister. He quit the ministry when
Khatami was forced to resign by hard-liners who objected to his
giving the press more freedom, liberalizing state-run television,
and permitting filmmakers to pursue non-Islamic themes.
	   Khatami has won wide support for his moves to ease social
restrictions, encourage political freedom, and end nearly 20 years
of hostility with the United States.
	   Such moves have also stirred the hard-liners to attack the
Khatami camp. They have brought to trial on graft charges the mayor
of Tehran, who ran Khatami's election campaign, and closed several
liberal newspapers.
	   The majority parliament faction, Hezbollah, had said Tuesday it
would not oppose Mousavi-Lari's nomination despite what it said
were his shortcomings.
	   Some Hezbollah members in parliament spoke out against the
appointment, saying he was inexperienced to ``handle the heavy
responsibility.''

 &UR; Tajik president says U.N. observers killed by `traitors' &QL; 
 &UR; EDs: New throughout with comments from Tajik president and U.N.
special representative in Tajikistan. &QL; 
 &UR; By UMED BABAKHANOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) _ Tajikistan's president said
Wednesday that four United Nations workers were killed by
``traitors'' intent on undermining the country's fragile peace
process.
	   President Emomali Rakhmonov stopped short of directly blaming
former guerrilla fighters for Tuesday's killings of the U.N.
military observers. But he claimed that militants had previously
threatened U.N. personnel in the mountainous Central Asian nation.
	   The president announced that a special government commission had
been set up to find and punish the attackers, and he offered his
condolences in a meeting with Jan Kubis, the U.N. special
representative to Tajikistan.
	   The four U.N. workers were ambushed Tuesday while on a regular
patrol trip about 90 miles (144 kilometers) east of the capital
Dushanbe. All were shot in the the head, Kubis said.
	   About 70 U.N. observers are stationed in Tajikistan to monitor
last year's peace deal that ended five years of civil war in the
former Soviet republic. Kubis said Wednesday he had recalled all
U.N. field teams to Dushanbe pending the outcome of the
investigation.
	   Kubis told a news conference that the U.N. workers were killed
near the village of Labidzhar while they were traveling a distance
of 10 kilometers (six miles) between a government checkpoint and an
opposition position.
	   The main opposition alliance issued a statement condemning the
shootings. It said the U.N. workers were killed after they met the
opposition commander in the Tavildara region, and were heading for
the government-controlled Garm region.
	   Despite last year's peace accord, Tajikistan remains restive.
There are periodic clashes between the hard-line government and the
mostly Islamic opposition. Also, there are numerous warlords who do
not recognize the peace deal and wage turf battles with one
another.
	   Tajik officials initially claimed that the U.N. observers had
died when their car plunged off a cliff in the Pamir Mountains. But
later they confirmed the U.N. report of an ambush.
	   The four U.N. workers were: Maj. Ryszard Szcwczyk of Poland;
Maj. Adolfo Sharpegue of Uruguay; civil affairs officer Yutaka
Akino of Japan and a Tajik translator, Jourajon Mahramov.
	   Tuesday's attack was not the first time U.N. workers have been
targeted in Tajikistan.
	   Bakhrom Sadirov, a rebel warlord, kidnapped 23 people in
December 1996 and 16 people in February 1997. In both cases, most
of the hostages were U.N. workers. All were released unharmed after
the government freed some of Sadirov's supporters.

Nuclear stockpiling a threat, new defense chief says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australia's new defense force chief
warned Wednesday of the prospect of nuclear war next century as
other nations follow India and Pakistan in acquiring nuclear
weapons.
	   Adm. Chris Barrie said that within 20 years, most countries
might keep a few nuclear weapons as commonly as they now keep jet
fighters.
	   ``If this happens, the risk of a nuclear conflict is much, much
greater than anything we have seen since World War II,'' he added.
	   Barrie said any country possessing nuclear weapons needed a
sophisticated command and control system, a strong intelligence
system and positive political leadership.
	   ``It's not the sort of thing you just have three of in your
backyard,'' he said.
	   ``But that's the problem I have got with unleashing the genie.
If we end up with a world where we have all got a few, that is just
a very frightening prospect.''

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with hostages exchanged for Islamic fundamentalists. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Six Russian policemen held hostage in the
breakaway republic of Chechnya have been released in exchange for
three detained members of a fundamentalist Islamic sect, a news
report said Wednesday.
	   The policemen were kidnapped last December when Chechen
guerrillas staged a raid on Russian security forces in the
neighboring region of Dagestan, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   The abductors exchanged the prisoners Tuesday for the three
detained colleagues who are Wahhabis, a fundamentalist Islamic
group that operates in Chechnya, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Scores of people, many of them ethnic Russians and foreigners,
have been kidnapped in or near Chechnya since the end of the 1996
independence war with Russia. Most of the kidnappings are carried
out by armed criminal groups seeking ransom.
	   Chechnya's government has set up an anti-kidnapping unit to deal
with the problem, but abductions are still common.
	   Chechnya has had de facto independence since Russian troops
pulled out at the end of 1996, but no country recognizes the claim.

China executes man for acid attack on judge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Authorities in eastern China have executed a man
for throwing acid on a judge who granted the man's wife a divorce,
an official newspaper said Wednesday.
	   Yu Jianzhang, 41, had stashed the acid in a thermos flask and
threw it over the presiding judge because he opposed the court's
decision to grant a divorce, the Liberation Daily said.
	   The judge was seriously disfigured in the Feb. 18 attack, and a
secretary was burned on the cheek and scalp, the newspaper said. It
said it was the first attack of its kind on a judge in China.
	   Yu was executed by gunshot on July 15 in Xiaoshan city, Zhejiang
province, the newspaper said.

Dubious Cambodian observers will be winnowed out, EU chief told
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodian election authorities have
pledged to winnow out tens of thousands of questionable observers
accredited for Sunday's parliamentary elections, the head of the
European Union's observer mission said Wednesday.
	   Meanwhile, three respected, independent organizations that had
problems receiving accreditation will get free access to polling
sites for some 16,000 of their members to monitor the vote, Glenys
Kinnock said.
	   Kinnock said it was vital for the organizations _ known by their
acronyms COMFREL, COFFEL and NIFDEC _ to perform the lion's share
of the observation work for her to consider the elections credible
and endorse them on behalf of the EU, the single biggest foreign
donor to the polls.
	   ``Clearly, there's been some kind of malpractice involved in the
accreditation being done this way,'' Kinnock said. ``It's
questionable whether you can sort out this number of people in
time.''
	   The opposition and human rights groups say the campaign has been
marred by intimidation, violence and rigging of the electoral
machinery by strongman Hun Sen.
	   Kinnock told The Associated Press that she had raised what she
considered the outstanding problem of the moment _ the
accreditation of 60,000 Cambodian observers, many from obscure,
allegedly Hun Sen-linked groups _ with the National Election
Committee in a meeting Tuesday.
	   The committee said orders were being sent to provincial
authorities to review accreditation and pull dubious credentials,
Kinnock was told.
	   The Cambodian observers are vital to a free and fair poll being
carried out. Only 600 foreign observers will be monitoring the
elections and will cover only a random sampling of polling sites.
	   Kinnock, a member of the European Parliament for Wales, said
that NEC officials had agreed to go on television to dispel what
apparently was a common belief among the observers _ that they
would receive cash-fat envelopes from the international community
after the polls.
	   Kinnock said some had apparently already been paid ``down
payments'' of dlrs 10 each. Many Cambodians earn less than dlrs 1 a
day. She said she had urged a government investigation into the
accreditation process.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The U.N. refugee organization on
Wednesday cast doubt on Serb claims to have cleansed a strategic
central Kosovo town of militant separatists, saying its staff heard
sounds of fighting during a recent visit.
	   Staff employed by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said
Orahovac resounded with the sounds of gunfire and occasional
explosions on Tuesday. Its streets were empty except for fortified
Serbian police positions, said Maki Shinohara of the UNHCR.
	   Albanian resistance appeared to be coming from hills to the
north of the town, where guerrillas had dug in late last week.
	   The report buttressed claims by Kosovo Albanians fighting for
independence from Serbia that the battle for Orahovac was
continuing. They said at least 36 ethnic Albanians died Tuesday, on
the fourth day of clashes near the town of 20,000, about 50
kilometers (30 miles) southwest of Pristina.

Prince downplays election security fears; 95,000 men to be
</HEADLINE>
deployed &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBIN McDOWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KOMPONG CHAM, Cambodia (AP) _ Seeking to reassure a jittery
public, Prince Norodom Ranariddh played down fears of election
violence Wednesday while the army's chief of staff said 95,000
security forces members would be deployed to safeguard the polls.
	   Ranariddh said the level of political violence was
``acceptable'' as he boarded a boat for Kratie province, where an
activist of his FUNCINPEC party was reportedly shot and killed last
week, bringing the number of politically motivated pre-election
killings to more than 20.
	   ``I hope that there will not be any increase of violence,'' said
Ranariddh, one of the main opposition candidates challenging
strongman Hun Sen. ``I think that at the moment we can say it's
quite acceptable.''
	   The Sam Rainsy Party, the other main opposition grouping,
reported that a deputy village chief in Pursat province who belongs
to Hun Sen's party killed a Sam Rainsy Party member while they were
hunting Saturday. The party has alleged that at least five members
have been murdered for political reasons in the past week.
	   Ranariddh won U.N.-sponsored elections in 1993 that were marked
by far more bloodshed, despite the presence of 20,000 peacekeepers.
But he was forced to share power when Hun Sen threatened civil war.
Hun Sen deposed him as co-prime minister in a coup last year that
brought battles with tanks, mortars and rockets to Phnom Penh.
	   The vote is aimed at putting to rest political divisions that
have festered in Cambodia since the coup, but critics say that Hun
Sen has stacked the polls in his favor. The opposition is trying to
dispel an atmosphere of fear that if Hun Sen fares poorly, he will
again call out the army.
	   Gen. Ke Kim Yan, the army chief of staff, told reporters
Wednesday that forces are already being deployed for election
security. Some 95,000 security personnel will take up posts on
election day to monitor the voting. The 11,600 polling stations
will each be guarded by five plainclothes officers, with only one
assault rifle between them to appear less intimidating.
	   Security is much better now than during the 1993 election, when
large swaths of land were under the control of Khmer Rouge
guerrillas, Ke Kim Yan said.
	   The Khmer Rouge caused the deaths of as many as 2 million
Cambodians between 1975 and 1979. It waged guerrilla warfare
against successive governments after being toppled by an invasion
by Vietnam, but mass defections over the past two years have left
the guerrillas on the verge of extinction.
	   However, die-hard guerrillas have vowed to disrupt the
elections. They can do little to derail the vote, but a raid on a
convoy of election workers near their former stronghold of Anlong
Veng last week killed two people and showed they remain capable of
hit-and-run raids.
	   Election officials said Wednesday, however, that security had
been beefed up in the area and that polling would go forward as
planned.

Germany: Kosovo crisis risks exploding
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany said Wednesday the fighting in
Serbia's Kosovo province risks spinning out of control and that
forceful NATO intervention will be needed to stop it.
	   Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel renewed an appeal by major powers
for a cease-fire, and he criticized ethnic Albanian rebels and Serb
forces for failing to talk peace.
	   ``The danger that the conflict will get out of control is
increasing,'' he said in a statement. ``On both sides, there is a
lack of serious effort to contain the armed violence and resume
negotiations.''
	   ``I believe there ultimately is no way around measures of
coercion under Chapter VII of the United Nations charter,'' which
can authorize the use of military force, Kinkel said.
	   Kinkel has also suggested international peace talks on Kosovo
modeled on those that yielded the Dayton peace agreement for Bosnia
in 1995.
	   Germany's major worry in the Kosovo fighting is an influx of
refugees who would join more than 100,000 Albanians and ethnic
Albanians from Kosovo living in Germany.

Thai government to auction golf club memberships of debtors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The Thai government plans to auction
off 60 memberships in 19 of the country's most prestigious golf
clubs, owned by finance company executives and other debtors who
can't pay.
	   The auction is set for Aug. 3-8 at the Queen Sirikit Convention
Center in Bangkok, the Financial Sector Restructuring Authority
said Wednesday.
	   The FBA has been assigned to liquidate the assets of 56 failed
finance companies the government was forced to shut down earlier
this year.
	   It will combine all memberships of each golf course into one lot
to be auctioned off, the statement said.
	   Among the 18 courses for which memberships will be available for
bidding are Nava Thanee and Green Valley, considered two of the
finest courses in the country.
	   Buying, selling and trading golf course memberships was a growth
industry in Thailand, particularly during the early 1990s, when a
golf course building boom was under way.
	   Bangkok even has a company that buys, sells and trades
memberships as though it were a stock exchange.
	   The sport has soared in popularity here since the emergence of
golfing sensation Tiger Woods, whose mother is Thai.
	   Thai golf course memberships and vacations are also popular with
Japanese businessmen and tourists because of the year-round warm
weather and low prices compared to Japan.

Thai Cabinet approves draft bill to set up futures market
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's Cabinet has approved a draft
bill to set up a futures market in agricultural products, the
government spokesman said Wednesday.
	   ``The bill still has to pass through several more stages, but
hopefully the market might open next year,'' said Akhapol
Sorasuchart, the spokesman.
	   Precisely which agricultural products will be traded on the
futures market has not been decided, he said. The bill details the
market's operational and management framework.
	   It will now be sent to the House of Representatives, where the
government hopes it will pass during the current session, Akhapol
said.
	   According to the Bangkok Post, Deputy Commerce Minister Paitoon
Kaewthong said the market would legalize futures trading already
taking place in the farm sector, enable fair pricing and allow
farmers to more accurately plan production.

Rain interferes with Yeltsin's vacation plans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Rains and strong winds forced Boris Yeltsin to
cancel a fishing expedition to a trout farm Wednesday in the
northwestern region of Karelia, where the president is spending his
summer break.
	   Yeltsin has been on vacation since Sunday in the government
lakeside resort of Shuiskaya Chupa, near the border with Finland.
	   Due to the rain, the 67-year-old president spent the day working
on government documents, Karelia's leader Sergei Katanandov said.
	   Yeltsin ``has not had much luck this time in Shuiskaya Chupa
with the weather, which is changing his plans,'' Katanandov was
quoted as saying by Interfax news agency.
	   The Kremlin has not said how long the president intends to be
away from Moscow. Last summer, he spent a month on vacation in
Karelia and along the Volga River.

Argentina's President Menem won't seek third term

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ President Carlos Menem's
announcement that he would not seek a third straight term in next
year's election has ended speculation that dominated national
politics for most of the year.
	   ``After a prolonged analysis, I have resolved to exclude myself
from whatever course of action to compete in 1999,'' Menem said
Tuesday, addressing a question that created friction in his
Peronist Party and stalled important legislation.
	   A third term would have required a constitutional amendment or a
special Supreme Court ruling. His term ends Dec. 10, 1999, and the
constitution currently bars him from running again.
	   If Menem had sought such an amendment, his effort would have
been one of several by South American presidents looking to extend
their time in office. Peru's Alberto Fujimori and Brazil's Fernando
Henrique Cardoso are also exploring ways to around their countries'
constitutional term limits.
	   In his news conference announcing that he did not plan to run
for a third term, Menem did not discuss constitutional change.
Instead, he spoke of the need to continue his work to finish out
his second term as president.
	   Months of Menem re-election talk caused a rift among the
Peronists, particularly with supporters of his rival for the
presidential nomination, Buenos Aires Gov. Eduardo Duhalde.
	   It also stalled much-needed tax and labor code reforms.
	   A push by Menem supporters to have him run again outraged
Duhalde, who considered himself the party's ``natural'' candidate.
	   ``This ends the internal political fighting,'' said Antonio
Cafiero, a top Peronist official.
	   Even opposition leaders expressed relief that the controversy
was over.
	   ``We are now able to return to the most important things and
leave to the side these adventures that created a political pain in
the country and risk for its institutions,'' said Fernando De la
Rua, a member of the Alliance opposition and head of the Buenos
Aires city government. ``Menem has saved the Constitution.''
	   Others were skeptical.
	   ``I don't believe one word he says,'' said Carlos Alvarez, a
leader of the left-leaning opposition party, Frepaso.
	   Menem was elected in 1989 for a single six-year term. The
constitution was amended to allow him to run for a second four-year
term.

Customs officials intercept Viagra shipments
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Customs officials are involved in
a nationwide hunt for bottles of Viagra which are being illegally
imported to satisfy a growing demand for the impotency pill which
has not yet been approved for sale in the Netherlands.
	   Dozens of packages containing the drug have been found at postal
sorting offices in recent weeks, Dutch daily De Telegraaf reported
Wednesday.
	   Customs spokesman Peter Mulder said his officers already have a
``black book'' of illegal Viagra importers. ``We discover a
shipment almost every day,'' he said. ``Anyone can order a pot of
pills from America via the Internet.''
	   Last week a routine check at Eindhoven airport uncovered 4,500
pills, which sell for up to 30 guilders (dlrs 15) each. The pills
were being sent from a German company to a pharmacy in the southern
city of Venlo.
	   Another 50,000 guilders (dlrs 25,000) worth of pills were
discovered during a search of the pharmacy. Customs at Amsterdam's
Schiphol airport also regularly intercept packages containing the
pill.
	   Viagra, made by U.S. company Pfizer Inc., is expected to be
given European Union approval in September, Dutch health ministry
spokesman Richard Lancee said. If it is approved, the drug will be
available in the Netherlands only on prescription.

Malaysian officials lay down demands for press
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RANJAN ROY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ After the editors of two top
dailies were removed, reportedly over differences with ruling party
bosses, officials now are demanding that reporters shun foreign
journalists and stop criticizing leaders.
	   On Wednesday, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's top economic
aide insisted on unqualified loyalty from the press.
	   ``It is important that the stewardship of the national economy
of the honorable prime minister be accepted without any further
speculation,'' said Daim Zainuddin, minister of special functions.
	   On Tuesday, the Information Ministry advocated self-censorship
during the economic crisis and avoiding ``derogatory stories'' by
the foreign press.
	   Malaysian media should not collaborate with foreign reporters by
exchanging information, Shafie Apdal, a top Information Ministry
official, was quoted as saying by the domestic news agency,
Bernama.
	   Officials are increasingly echoing Mahathir, who has heaped
scorn on the foreign media before turning the heat on the local
press for highlighting Malaysia's problems.
	   ``To hear the press tell it, we are all corrupt and all our
companies are bankrupt,'' Daim said.
	   ``Every paper and homepage must have its own pull-out section on
the (Asian) crisis, from the London Financial Times to the South
China Morning Post, from the Sydney Morning Herald to The New York
Times.''
	   Political observers say the changes in leadership at the
Malay-language papers resulted from a perception that these dailies
were questioning Mahathir's economic policies and taking sides in a
subterranean rivalry between Mahathir and his deputy, Finance
Minister Anwar Ibrahim.
	   The removal of Ahmad Nazri Abdullah as editor of Berita Harian
on Saturday came five days after Johan Jaafar, editor-in-chief of
the Utusan Malaysia, resigned. On Tuesday, Mohd Khalid Mohd., a
deputy editor, was named Johan's successor.
	   Utusan and Berita are the main Malay-language dailies, with wide
influence over the ruling party's political constituency. They
reported charges of cronyism and nepotism leveled by Mahathir's
detractors during last month's annual convention of the United
Malays National Organization.
	   ``They were seen as providing space in newspapers to those
people who were supportive of Anwar,'' said Chandra Muzaffar, a
professor of politics at University Malaya.
	   Anwar refused to comment on reports that the two editors were
moved out because of their close ties with him.
	   ``The prime minister has said this is an ongoing normal change,
but to my mind what is more important is that the media must remain
credible and objective,'' he said.
	   The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists said it
feared greater press restrictions in Malaysia, based on the Utusan
resignation.
	   ``It is alarming that even the mild criticisms raised by the
Utusan Malaysia in recent weeks seem to have encountered political
pressure,'' it said in a statement last week.
	   Analysts say it is easy to scare local reporters into submission
because of the links of newspaper owners to UMNO and other parties
in the governing coalition. The government can easily wield the
threat of canceling annual publishing licenses.
	   Political leaders have traditionally appointed editors. Johan
took over Utusan Malaysia in 1992 after his predecessor fell out of
favor with Mahathir. Last week, he handed his resignation to
Mahathir personally.
	   In the 17 years that he has ruled Malaysia, Mahathir has shown
little patience for criticism. In a nationwide crackdown on dissent
in 1987, three national newspapers were closed down.

Palestinians say they're not inclined to hold another meeting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian officials said Wednesday they were
not inclined to hold more talks on a West Bank troop withdrawal
after Israel failed to make any new proposals in three sessions.
	   The talks, arranged by the United States, are widely seen as the
last chance for Israel and the Palestinians to reach agreement on
the scope of an Israeli troop pullback. Earlier this month, the
United States said it has exhausted its role as a mediator.
	   The Clinton administration has been trying since January to win
support for a land-for-security plan under which Israel would
withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank, in exchange for greater
Palestinian efforts to crack down on Islamic militants.
	   The Palestinians have accepted the U.S. initiative, but Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has balked at the scope of the
withdrawal and said he needed stronger guarantees that the
Palestinians will live up to their security obligations.
	   Nabil Abourdeneh, an adviser to Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat, said Wednesday that in three negotiating sessions, the most
recent one Tuesday evening, Israel has rejected the American plan,
but has not put any new offers on the table.
	   ``The Americans asked us to meet with the Israelis, but the
Israelis did not propose anything new,'' Abourdeneh said.
	   He said it was time for the United States to step up pressure on
Netanyahu. ``What is needed now from the Americans is a serious
position which would make the Israeli government agree to the
American initiative,'' he said.
	   A high-ranking Palestinian official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said no preparations were under way for another round of
talks because there was no sign of progress after three sessions.
	   Netanyahu said he did not want to focus only on the troop
pullback, but also wanted to raise issues such as the extradition
of Palestinians suspected of killing Israelis and the reduction of
the Palestinian police force. ``There are at least eight or nine
other issues and I want specific answers on all of them,''
Netanyahu told Israel TV on Tuesday, before the latest round.
	   With the resumption of the talks, Netanyahu has come under
renewed pressure from both hardliners and moderates in his
government. The hawks threatened to topple the government if
Netanyahu carried out the withdrawal and the doves said they would
do so if the land wasn't handed over soon.
	   However, unless a motion of no-confidence is brought next week,
Netanyahu's coalition will be secure for several weeks.
	   Parliament goes into recess July 29 and will begin its fall term
Oct. 19. During this period, the government cannot be brought down
by a motion of no confidence.
	   Netanyahu said Wednesday he was trying to negotiate the best
possible agreement, and that once he had done so would he would
present it to parliament for approval without hesitation.
	   Israel's dovish opposition, meanwhile, was divided over whether
it should try to bring down Netanyahu at any cost, even if it meant
voting against a withdrawal pullback.
	   More than a dozen legislators of the Labor Party said they would
agree to a proposal, floated by former Prime Minister Shimon Peres,
to give Netanyahu a parliamentary safety net for the next six
months if he agrees to a troop withdrawal.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's Cabinet has approved a draft

government spokesman said Wednesday.
	   ``The bill still has to pass through several more stages, but

	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ The economy of Shanghai grew by 9.4
percent in the first half of 1998, missing the 10-percent target
for China's commercial capital amid a slowing national economy,
according to figures released Wednesday.
	   Total economic output in this city of 15 million people was
173.6 billion yuan (dlrs 20.9 billion) from January to June, the
Shanghai Municipal Statistics Bureau announced.
	   Investment in fixed assets was 51.3 billion yuan (dlrs 6.2
billion), down 8.1 percent from the same period last year. But Pan
Jianxin, director of the statistics bureau, insisted that decline
was a reflection of recent high investment, not economic weakness.
	   ``Mainly this is because of the high rate of increase of more
than 40 percent over the past few years, forming a very large basis
for comparison,'' he said at a news conference.
	   However, China overall has suffered a sharp decline in foreign
investment amid East Asia's financial crisis and as companies grow
frustrated with low profits.
	   The Chinese government announced last week that the national
economy grew by 7 percent in the first six months of the year. That
is below the 8 percent level regarded as essential for creating
jobs for workers laid off in a massive restructuring of state
industry.
	    &UR; ___
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's 1998 rice exports had
reached 3,577,066 metric tons by July 19, up 36.6 percent from
2,619,220 tons in the same period last year, the Commerce Ministry
said Wednesday.
	   Thailand is the world's largest rice exporter. Rising rice
exports have been one of the few bright spots amid the economic
slump that has hit Thailand since July 1997.
	    &UR; ___
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's Cabinet has authorized
seizing the assets of a troubled textile company if it fails to pay
severance to laid-off workers, the government spokesman said
Wednesday.
	   ``It would be a measure of last resort,'' said Akhapol
Sorasuchart, the spokesman. ``So far the company has not officially
closed yet.''
	   The company, Thai Melon Textiles, announced earlier this week it
was shutting down operations because it could no longer obtain
loans from banks to buy raw materials.
	   Thai Melon is one of the largest textile companies in Thailand.
Its closure would put as many as 5,000 people out of work.
	   The company has scheduled a meeting with the employees' union
next Tuesday to discuss the compensation issue, warning it may not
have enough funds to pay the legal rates because of the its debts.
	   Workers began demonstrating at the company and at Parliament
demanding full compensation.
	   At least 1,000 of the workers are 20-year veterans of the
company who by law are entitled to 6.5 months worth of salary as
severance pay.
	   The government said earlier this week that it would do whatever
possible to help Thai Melon stay in business. The company responded
by saying it would investigate all options and that it hoped its
closure might prove temporary.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's tourist arrivals fell by nearly 17
percent in the first half of the year from the same period in 1997,
according to government statistics reported by media Wednesday.
	   The Singapore Tourism Board said that the culprit was ongoing
economic turmoil in Asia, which has cut the number of visitors from
the region by 38 percent, The Straits Times newspaper and TV news
said. The government released the statistics Tuesday.
	   The number of Japanese and Indonesian visitors, who once made up
the bulk of arrivals in Singapore, slumped sharply.
	   Singapore relies heavily on tourism and in the past has drawn
several times its population in annual visitors. But only 3 million
tourists arrived in Singapore in the first half of 1998.
	   Still, the number of visitors from Hong Kong, China and India
has risen due to competitive packages from airline companies.
	    &UR; ___
	   TOKYO (AP) _ With sales slumping, Toyota Motor Corp., Japan's
largest automaker, now expects its domestic production this year to
be 7 percent less than forecast earlier, a spokeswoman said
Wednesday.
	   The new forecast of 3.2 million vehicles was presented by
Hiroshi Okuda, the company's president, at a news conference in
Nagoya, where Toyota has its headquarters, the spokeswoman said.
	   Auto sales in Japan have slumped in line with shrinking overall
consumer demand as the economy suffers its worst recession since
World War II.
	   Last year, Toyota's produced 3.5 million vehicles at its
Japanese plants.
	    &UR; ___
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's prime minister said the
country will plow ahead with massive infrastructure projects to
spend its way out of economic problems, news reports said
Wednesday.
	   ``The bigger the construction, the more economic activities,''
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad was quoted as saying by Wednesday's
Star newspaper.
	   Mahathir said the new policy had been worked out by the National
Economic Action Council, a committee of experts and officials,
which he chairs.
	   ``We will spend money on anything involved with infrastructure
so that there will be spinoffs to stimulate other industries,''
Mahathir said, adding that 140 industries would benefit from the
construction spree.
	   Malaysia has made a dramatic about-face in recent weeks, with
Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim announcing two fiscal stimulus
packages worth 12 billion ringgit (dlrs 3 billion).
	   The cash injection reverses a fiscal austerity package the
government announced last year, which included 18 percent spending
cuts in an effort to choke off excess demand and stabilize the
economy. The reforms were widely viewed to be as stringent as those
recommended by the International Monetary fund.

reporter, he said it had not changed.
	   Pan acknowledged that foreign trade was under ``tremendous
pressure'' because of the Asian financial crisis, which has made
products from neighboring countries cheaper, but he said Shanghai's
exports grew 9.5 percent to dlrs 8 billion.
	   Exports of new and high-technology goods led the way, with an
increase of 53.2 percent, Pan said. He said sales to Europe grew
35.6 percent in the first five months of the year, while sales to
the United States rose 28.6 percent.

	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ U.S. Vice President Al Gore arrived in
Ukraine on Wednesday for a two-day visit that will take him to the
country's most infamous landmark _ the Chernobyl nuclear power
plant.
	   Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma greeted Gore at the ornate
Mariinsky Palace in downtown Kiev, and the two proceeded to a
closed-doors meeting. Wednesday's talks were expected to focus on
economic cooperation.
	   Gore will get an up-close look Thursday at the concrete and
steel sarcophagus covering Chernobyl's Reactor No. 4, which was
destroyed in the world's worst nuclear accident in 1986.
	   He will also hold discussions on a new international effort to
raise funds to rebuild the huge shelter, which has been steadily
deteriorating and raised concerns that radioactive materials could
leak out.
	   So far, Ukraine has secured less than half of the dlrs 758
million needed to repair the sarcophagus.
	   During his visit to Chernobyl, the U.S. vice president will stop
at Pripyat, a town next to the plant that has been evacuated due to
radioactive fallout from the accident.
	   Gore, who has been involved in environmental issues throughout
his political career, chaired an international conference in New
York last year on the Chernobyl clean-up.
	   ``Chernobyl was one of the key events of this century that made
us realize we are all neighbors... on an interlinked planet,'' the
vice president said at the time. ``We seek to avoid further
tragedy.''
	   Meanwhile, Gore and Kuchma were to co-chair the second meeting
of the U.S.-Ukrainian bilateral cooperation commission, which was
to examine ways to enhance cooperation and trade, according to U.S.
Ambassador to Ukraine Steven Pifer.
	   The United States is Ukraine's largest foreign investor,
accounting for more than dlrs 400 million of the dlrs 2.1 billion
invested in the former Soviet republic since independence in 1991.
	   But officials on both sides say the figure could be much higher.
Western businessmen frequently complain that bureaucracy and
corruption in Ukraine make it difficult for foreign firms to
operate effectively.
	   The commission is also to discuss Ukraine's role in European
security, Kiev's pledges to speed up economic reforms, and the
development of small-scale businesses.
	   Washington has expressed displeasure with the pace of economic
reforms in Ukraine, and had threatened to withhold part of its dlrs
225 million in assistance to Ukraine in 1998.
	   Ukraine, which has a population of about 50 million, is
currently the third-largest recipient of American financial aid.
	   From Ukraine, Gore will travel to Moscow for meetings with
Russian officials, including Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko.

Spain's digital TV companies end war and announce plans to merge
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CIARAN GILES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Ending a nearly two-year battle for
supremacy, Spain's two main digital television companies made a
surprise announcement Thursday that they plan to merge.
	   Between them, government-backed Via Digital and privately owned
Canal Satelite Digital currently have some 800,000 subscribers and
offer some 150 channels.
	   In a statement issued after a day of talks Wednesday,
Telefonica, the main shareholder in Via Digital, said the two
companies would proceed with the legal, commercial and financial
steps necessary to conclude the agreement by September 30.
	   The announcement took many by surprise because less than a year
ago the two companies were locked in bitter disputes over issues
ranging from the lucrative rights to broadcast soccer games to
which types of decoders would be used by each company.
	   Many saw the disagreements as part of a broader battle between
the conservative government of Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar and
Sogecable, owner of Spain's largest media conglomerate, Grupo
Prisa, which is traditionally linked to the opposition Socialist
party.
	   The daily El Mundo reported Wednesday that under the deal, each
company would hold 50 percent of the new enterprise. Its
chairmanship would alternate between them every two years.
	   The accord was reached by Telefonica chairman Juan Villalonga
and Jesus Polanco, head of Canal Satelite's parent company,
Sogecable.
	   El Mundo said meetings in recent weeks between the two companies
led to speculation of increased cooperation but that a fusion had
not been expected.
	   Canal Satelite was launched in January 1997 while Via Digital,
whose shareholders also include Spanish national television and the
Mexican media conglomerate Televisa, began broadcasting eight
months later.

Dollar surges in Tokyo, Japanese stocks fall sharply
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS; UPDATES with late afternoon bond and currency prices &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The dollar surged against the yen Wednesday on
worries that the apparent front runner to become Japan's next prime
minister is not the right man to lead an economic recovery. Tokyo
stocks fell sharply.
	   The dollar bought 140.66 yen in late afternoon, up 1.18 yen from
late Tuesday in Tokyo and also above its late New York rate of
140.40 yen overnight.
	   The yen weakened on concern that Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi
will win a three-way race to succeed outgoing Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto. The governing party plans to elect a new
president Friday, and the winner will then become the next prime
minister.
	   ``Nobody is looking at an Obuchi win as a yen-positive factor,''
said Kazuo Takayama, chief foreign exchange manager at the Tokyo
office of Midland Bank. ``Therefore, yen selling is likely to
continue.''
	   Opinion polls show greater public support for Health Minister
Junichiro Koizumi and veteran politician Seiroku Kajiyama. But the
mathematics of governing party factional politics suggest that
Obuchi is leading the race, Japanese newspapers reported Wednesday.
	   The dollar ranged between 140.18 yen and 140.95 yen in Tokyo
trading.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, shares dropped amid spreading
sentiment that choosing Foreign Minister Obuchi as the next prime
minister would be a minus for the Japanese economy, traders said.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average sank 263.63 points,
or 1.6 percent, closing at 16,293.06. On Tuesday, the average had
lost 14.09 points, or 0.09 percent.
	   ``What the market wants is drastic financial reforms, but Obuchi
seems to lack the ability to launch such reforms,'' said Sachio
Ishikawa, general manager of the stock division at Chuo Securities
Co.
	   Led lower by bank stocks, the broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of
all issues listed on the first section lost 19.32 points, or 1.5
percent, to 1,257.85. On Tuesday, it had slipped 0.78 points, or
0.06 percent.
	   ``The market doesn't approve of Obuchi as the next prime
minister,'' said Kunihiro Hatae, general manager of stock trading
at Tokyo Securities Co.
	   An estimated 390 million shares changed hands on the first
section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, up from 363 million the
previous day. Declines exceeded advances 885 to 250, with 133
issues unchanged.
	   Shares of the troubled Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. fell
2 percent to 49 yen (dlrs 0.35), after hitting a record low of 48
yen (dlrs 0.34) in earlier trading. The stock was hit by concern
about the outlook for a proposed merger with Sumitomo Trust and
Banking Co. and worry over its bad loan load, traders said.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 1.385 percent from Tuesday's finish of
1.415 percent, driving its price up to 110.50 yen from 110.30 yen.

King Hussein suspected to be suffering from cancer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ King Hussein is suspected to be suffering
from cancer of the lymph cells and will begin undergoing
chemotherapy next week if tests confirm the condition.
	   King Hussein, who is being treated at the Mayo Clinic, disclosed
the diagnosis in a letter to his brother, Crown Prince Hassan, on
Tuesday. The letter was read on Jordanian television Tuesday night.
	   The king wrote that an ``excised lymph node and symptoms all
seem to point to lymphoma,'' or cancer of the lymphatic tissue. At
the same time there could be other reasons for the infection and
related symptoms, the letter said.
	   Doctors at the hospital in Rochester, Minnesota, are waiting for
full details of tests done on Friday. If the cancer is ``confirmed
next Tuesday, (the) physicians will begin chemotherapy,'' Hussein
wrote. He also noted that early chemotherapy treatment might harm
neutrophil and platelet, two vital components of blood.
	   Hussein was admitted to the Mayo Clinic July 14, suffering from
spells of fever and cold sweats almost three times a day during the
previous 12 days.
	   The fever now occurs only once every 24 hours but the severely
low neutrophil and platelet count in his blood has not improved,
the king wrote.
	   The king said many American specialists were involved in
reaching a diagnosis and the private physician of President Clinton
has been placed at his disposal.
	   On Wednesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wished
Hussein a quick recovery. ``I hope he will overcome it (his
illness) with his great strength _ a spiritual and physical
strength he has gained over the years,'' Netanyahu said in an
interview with Israeli radio.
	   Since a cancer scare in August 1992, when an inflamed kidney was
found to be infected with cancerous cells, the king has undergone
regular medical checkups at Mayo Clinic.
	   He underwent an operation in November 1997 to remove an inflamed
lymph gland that was found to be benign. In April of the same year,
he underwent surgery for enlarged prostate that was also found to
be benign.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The U.N. refugee organization on
Wednesday cast doubt on Serb claims to have cleansed a strategic
central Kosovo town of militant separatists, saying its staff heard
sounds of fighting during a recent visit.
	   Staff employed by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said
Orahovac resounded with the sounds of gunfire and occasional
explosions on Tuesday. Its streets were empty except for fortified
Serbian police positions, said Maki Shinohara of the UNHCR.
	   Albanian resistance appeared to be coming from hills to the
north of the town, where guerrillas had dug in late last week.
	   The report buttressed claims by Kosovo Albanians fighting for
independence from Serbia that the battle for Orahovac was
continuing. They said at least 36 ethnic Albanians died Tuesday, on
the fourth day of clashes near the town of 20,000, about 50
kilometers (30 miles) southwest of Pristina.
	   The fighting cast doubt on the possibility of a negotiated
settlement between Serbia, the dominant republic of Yugoslavia, and
ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of Kosovo's population.
Germany's foreign minister said NATO would likely have to get
involved to end the violence.
	   ``On both sides, there is a lack of serious effort to contain
the armed violence and resume negotiations,'' Foreign Minister
Klaus Kinkel said in Bonn, Germany, Wednesday, adding: ``I believe
there ultimately is no way around measures of (NATO) coercion.''
	   The continued fighting also led the U.N. Security Council to
vote Tuesday to expand the peacekeeping force in Macedonia by about
300 troops, mostly to strengthen security along borders with Kosovo
and Albania. U.S. troops will make up about half of the 1,000-plus
force.
	   Ending a visit to the violence-torn province, the Organization
for Security and Cooperation issued a report Wednesday noting an
influx of armed fighters from neighboring Albania, increased
abductions by both sides and growing shortages of food and
medicines.
	   In an attempt to cobble together peace talks in Kosovo,
Christopher Hill, the U.S. ambassador to Macedonia, met Tuesday
with Ibrahim Rugova, the moderate ethnic Albanian leader. Hill had
conferred with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic in Belgrade on
Monday.
	   Rugova's party, the Democratic League of Kosovo, on Tuesday
condemned what it called the ``violence and massacre by Serb forces
in Orahovac.''
	   The capture of Orahovac, located about 30 miles (50 kilometers)
southwest of the provincial capital, Pristina, would have expanded
the nearly 40 percent of Kosovo the KLA is said to control _ and
given the rebels command of a strategic road.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, which is close to ethnic Albanian
politicians, claimed Serb forces, which moved into the town
Saturday, were still shelling KLA positions in Orahovac on Tuesday
and that fighting was also raging in outlying villages.

South Korea's militant workers begin new strike

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Thousands of South Korean metal
workers in the auto, shipbuilding and other heavy industries walked
off their jobs Wednesday to protest rising layoffs.
	   Organizers of the indefinite strike said about 60,000 workers
were participating, but the government put the figure at fewer than
10,000.
	   Lee Gap-yong, head of the maverick Confederation of Korean Trade
Unions, said telephone, subway and hospital workers would join the
walkout Thursday.
	   The government called the strikes illegal and threatened to send
in riot police to break them up. It fears labor unrest will scare
away needed foreign investment.
	   Later Wednesday, 3,000 striking metal workers marched along
sidewalks in downtown Seoul, carrying signs criticizing government
economic policies.
	   ``Fight! Fight! Fight for job security!'' they chanted, pumping
their clenched fists into the sky. They wore red vests and
headbands urging workers' solidarity.
	   Riot police stood guard, but there were no reports of violence.
	   It was the second strike in a week called by the militant labor
confederation to protest layoffs by manufacturers seeking to cut
costs in the face of plummeting sales.
	   The walkout was led by thousands of unionized workers at South
Korea's two largest auto plants _ Hyundai Motor Co. and Daewoo
Motor Co. Both companies have announced plans to dismiss thousands
of workers.
	   Labor leaders said thousands of laid-off workers will pack
blankets and tents and travel to Seoul this week to stage sit-down
protests in subway stations and plazas.
	   Armed with arrest warrants, police already were seeking some 100
union leaders accused of instigating a series of illegal,
short-lived strikes earlier this month.
	   The number of jobless people has doubled to nearly 1.5 million
since the government accepted a dlrs 58 billion bailout of the
economy in December and began the task of restructuring.
	   One of the hardest hit sectors is the automobile industry, which
has seen sales drop by more than 50 percent. Hyundai, for example,
is operating at 40 percent of its capacity of 1.25 million vehicles
a year.

Iran's Parliament approves interior minister's nomination
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's hard-line Parliament on Wednesday
overwhelmingly approved the nomination of a moderate cleric as
interior minister, handing reformist President Mohammad Khatami a
major victory.
	   Abdolvahed Mousavi-Lari won the votes of 177 deputies in the
Majlis, with 67 voting against him. There were 22 abstentions, and
four members did not attend the session in the 270-member
Parliament.
	   The vote was seen as a major test for Khatami even though the
Parliament, dominated by conservatives, had been widely expected to
approve the appointment because of Khatami's popularity. They
apparently feared rejection would provoke a backlash among the
millions of Iranians who voted Khatami to power last year.
	   Khatami has won wide support for his efforts to ease social
restrictions, encourage political freedom and end nearly 20 years
of hostility with the United States.
	   Just before the vote, Mousavi-Lari, 44, called for the country's
leaders to be more accepting of diverse ideas and opinions.
	   ``The government should increase its tolerance to accept the
ideas and opinions of its opponents,'' he said.
	   Mousavi-Lari, a vice president and key ally of Khatami, was
named to the post earlier this month after the Parliament impeached
former Interior Minister Abdollah Nouri for allowing political
demonstrations that rocked the country.
	   The hard-liners already control the armed forces, the
Intelligence Ministry, and the state-run radio and television. But
the Interior Ministry is one of the most powerful institutions in
the government. It oversees police and domestic security as well as
giving the authority for political demonstrations.
	   In a speech to the Majlis before the vote, Khatami, said ``real
security'' could only be achieved if the public is able to express
itself and feel it is participating in determining its future.
	   Mousavi-Lari was deputy minister of culture and Islamic guidance
from 1982 to 1992, when Khatami was the minister. He quit the
ministry when Khatami was forced to resign by hard-liners who
objected to his giving the press more freedom, liberalizing
state-run television and permitting filmmakers to pursue
non-Islamic themes.
	   Conservatives also have moved against Khatami as preident,
bringing to trial on graft charges the mayor of Tehran, who ran
Khatami's election campaign, and closing several liberal
newspapers.
	   The majority parliament faction, Hezbollah, had said Tuesday it
would not oppose Mousavi-Lari's nomination despite claims by some
of its members that the nominee was too inexperienced to ``handle
the heavy responsibility.''

	   SAN VICENTE, El Salvador (AP) _ Two former national guardsmen
convicted in the rapes and murders of three American nuns have been
paroled from prison, complicating efforts to investigate
allegations that the murders were ordered by high-ranking officers.
	   A five-man squad kidnapped, raped and killed Roman Catholic nuns
Ita Ford, Dorothy Kazel and Maura Clark and layworker Jean Donovan
on Dec. 2, 1980. A third member could be released Wednesday.
	   The two guardsmen were released Tuesday under a new law intended
to ease prison overcrowding. Each had served 17 years of a 30-year
prison sentence.
	   The two other former guardsmen convicted in the case did not
qualify for release because one previously had been convicted on
weapons charges and the other had participated in a prison
disturbance.
	   The crimes caused outrage in the United States, which strongly
supported the Salvadoran government during the 1980-1992 civil war.
The women apparently were killed because military-backed death
squads suspected them of sympathizing with leftist guerrillas.
	   ``The families of the churchwomen have felt that the government
of El Salvador should certainly not have released these men before
closely questioning them on the matter of higher orders: Who
ordered this crime and who covered it up,'' said William Ford, Ita
Ford's brother, in a telephone interview from his home in Upper
Montclair, New Jersey.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton's administration and the U.S. State
Department previously had criticized the plan to parole the
guardsmen, a process that has been delayed by appeals from
prosecutors.
	   Former Guardsman Jose Roberto Moreno Canjura quietly left La
Esperanza prison, 4 miles (6 kilometers) north of San Salvador,
while Sgt. Luis Colindres _ who commanded the guard squad _ walked
out of a prison in San Vicente, about 40 miles (65 kilometers)
southeast of San Salvador.
	   ``I have always worked in accordance with the law,'' Colindres
told reporters at the prison gates, breaking a 14-year silence on
his conviction. He refused to back up claims by other members of
the squad that they received orders from ``higher ups'' to murder
the four women.
	   ``Unfortunately, as a low-ranking officer, one must often keep
to the sidelines,'' Colindres said, without elaborating.
	   The New York-based Lawyers Committee for Human Rights reported
earlier this year that one of the convicted guardsmen quoted
Colindres as telling the squad: ``Don't be worried. This is an
order that comes from higher levels, and nothing is going to happen
to us.''
	   A 1993 U.N. commission report determined that the director of
the national guard at the time of the slayings, Col. Eugenio Vides
Casanova, and Defense Minister Jose Guillermo Garcia, had tried to
hide the killings. It also concluded that Vides Casanova knew that
the guardsmen had killed the women on the orders of superiors.
	   The victims' families and supporters were angered earlier this
year when they learned that both former officials were living in
the United States.
	   William Ford said both men ``should certainly be called to
testify under oath in front of Congress about what they know about
the orders to murder the women and the subsequent coverup.''
	   Vides Casanova has denied those accusations, saying ``my
conscience would never be able to rest if I knew their orders to
kill came from above.''
	   In June, the Salvadoran government said it could not reopen the
probe into the slayings despite evidence that those who
orchestrated the killings were never punished.
	   Chief Prosecutor Manuel Cordova said the 10-year statute of
limitations on murder had expired, so ``technically it is not
possible to reopen the case, independent of the evidence,
complaints or information that has been received.''
	   The guardsmen were sentenced to 30 years in prison in May 1984
and have been jailed since 1981. They were to be given credit for
time served before their convictions and, together with other
credits, have served about two-thirds of their total sentences.
	   The national guard was disbanded after a 1992 peace agreement
ended the country's civil war, which killed an estimated 75,000
people.

Officials defend inquiry into airport mess
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS, UPDATES with comments from commission chairman &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The chairman of a special government commission
pledged Wednesday to conduct an open and impartial inquiry into the
problems of Hong Kong's new airport, summoning outside experts and
senior officials to testify if needed.
	   Justice Woo Kwok-hing, who also headed the commission overseeing
the May 24 legislative elections, told reporters that the
investigation would operate under the rules of a judicial inquiry.
	   ``We have the power to question a lot of people,'' Woo said,
adding that the commission hadn't discussed the possibility of
questioning Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa.
	   ``We understand that the community is looking forward to early
conclusion of our inquiry and then early implementation of
improvement measures. The commission will do everything possible to
achieve this objective,'' Woo said in a statement.
	   Critics have questioned the lack of outside experts on the
commission, the amount of time it will take to issue a report, and
whether it would be able to scrutinize independent contractors such
as the air cargo handler.
	   Woo said the absence of outside experts would give the
commission greater flexibility in seeking opinions.
	   ``Even the experts can be put to the witness stand and
cross-examined,'' he said.
	   Woo also said the commission might take longer than six months
to wrap up the investigation of the new U.S. dlrs 20 billion Chek
Lap Kok airport.
	   Financial Secretary Donald Tsang told Hong Kong radio earlier
that the commission appointed by Tung, which also includes former
stock exchange chairman Edgar Cheng, might seek foreign expert
testimony, but that Hong Kong could not expect any overseas expert
to stay with it for the entire length of the study.
	   ``This is a judicial inquiry, and it has to do a very thorough
job, including taking evidence from a whole host of people: the
Airport Authority, the government officials, and there will be all
the franchisees involved,'' Tsang said.
	   Despite press reports Wednesday that a passenger had become
stuck in the airport's driverless people-mover and missed two
flights to London, most people agree that passenger services have
improved since the airport's opening on July 6.
	   However, cargo-handling problems are more serious. After
computer and mechanical breakdowns, the main cargo handler now says
it plans to be up to full speed at the new airport only at the end
of August.
	   Economists have warned that crimps in air cargo supplies could
lead to more layoffs. At 4.5 percent, Hong Kong's unemployment
already is at a 15-year high.
	   ``We have been disappointed, and we want to get to the bottom of
it,'' Tsang said.
	   A government ombudsman and the legislature also have announced
inquiries into the airport's failures.

Charge against former SLOC president dropped
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) _ A domestic battery charge against former
Olympic organizing president Tom Welch has been dropped following
Welch's completion of a year of probation and family counseling.
	   Welch pleaded no contest last August to assaulting his wife,
Alma Welch, during a July 9 argument in the garage of their Salt
Lake City home. He denied attacking his wife, saying he entered the
plea to ``stop the media frenzy.''
	   Welch told 3rd District Judge Ronald Nehring on Tuesday that he
had attended some two dozen counseling sessions and that they had
been productive.
	   ``Then I expect not to see you again,'' Nehring said.
	   According to police reports, the fight was sparked by his
admission that he had a platonic relationship with another woman.
Welch reportedly threw his wife against a wall, put her in a
headlock and wrestled her to the floor of their garage. The
couple's 11-year-old son called the emergency number, 911.
	   Welch resigned as president of the Salt Lake Organizing
Committee three days before entering his plea to the class B
misdemeanor battery charge.
	   A month later, SLOC's board of trustees agreed to pay Welch dlrs
10,000 a month as a consultant's fee for the 55 months through the
2002 Games, plus up to dlrs 500,000 in retirement benefits.
	   SLOC president Frank Joklik, who replaced Welch, would not
comment on what Welch has done for the committee.
	   ``Our relationship with Tom Welch remains the same as it has in
the past,'' Joklik said.

Arson on the rise in economically-troubled Singapore
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Arson is on the rise in Singapore, though
authorities said Wednesday they don't know yet whether the trend is
due to increasing insurance fraud as the economy worsens.
	   The number of suspected arson cases surged 52 percent in the
first half of 1998 compared to the same period last year, the
state-run television reported.
	   Figures released by the Singapore Civil Defense Force indicate
328 such fires in the first six months this year, up from 215 in
January-June last year.
	   The force expressed concern Wednesday about the increase, but
officials were reluctant to link the trend to a possible rise in
insurance fraud.
	   ``We have no evidence to conclude that the economic downturn has
brought about incendiary fires,'' Maj. Jackson Lim, head of the
force's public affairs department, was quoted as saying.
	   But he added that for many of the cases, the motives for the
arson have not been determined yet.
	   The overall number of fires also climbed to 3,363 in 1998's
first half from 3,226 in January-June last year.

Metal hunters cause damage, blamed for deaths in Ukraine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Two Ukrainian workers died when an
electrical pole collapsed on them after it has been partially
dismantled by thieves who stole the metal, a newspaper reported
Wednesday.
	   The incident highlighted the growing hunt for non-ferrous metals
that has become a ``national calamity'' in the eastern Ukrainian
industrial region of Donetsk, the newspaper Fakty said.
	   As many as 184 companies with 400 offices across the region are
engaged in the purchase of non-ferrous metals which they later try
to sell abroad, the report said.
	   The pillar targeted by thieves in the fatal incident several
days ago was part of a high-voltage reserve line leading to the
Zapirizhya nuclear power plant, Fakty reported. It collapsed just
as the workers were preparing to start repairs.
	   No suspects have been detained.
	   Other recent thefts included four rolls of trolley bus cable
valued at 12,000 hryvna (dlrs 6,000) and 400 meters (yards) of
cable stolen at a metal plant. A major cable theft has forced a
rolling mill at the Mariupol metals plant to stop work for a month,
causing heavy financial losses, the paper said.
	   Last year, 800 criminal cases were launched in the Donetsk
region alone against metal hunters, who caused an estimated 6
million hryvna (dlrs 3 million) in damages, according to Fakty.

Palestinians say they're not inclined to hold another meeting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian officials said Wednesday they were
not inclined to hold more talks on a West Bank troop withdrawal
after Israel failed to make any new proposals in three sessions.
	   The talks, arranged by the United States, are widely seen as the
last chance for Israel and the Palestinians to agree on the scope
of an Israeli troop pullback. Earlier this month, the United States
said it has exhausted its role as a mediator.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton's administration has been trying
since January to win support for a land-for-security plan under
which Israel would withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank, in
exchange for greater Palestinian efforts to crack down on Islamic
militants.
	   The Palestinians have accepted the U.S. initiative, but Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has balked at the scope of the
withdrawal and said he needed stronger guarantees that the
Palestinians will meet their security obligations.
	   Nabil Abourdeneh, an adviser to Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat, said Wednesday that in three negotiating sessions, the most
recent one Tuesday evening, Israel has rejected the American plan,
but has not put any new offers on the table.
	   ``The Americans asked us to meet with the Israelis, but the
Israelis did not propose anything new,'' Abourdeneh said.
	   He said it was time for the United States to step up pressure on
Netanyahu. ``What is needed now from the Americans is a serious
position which would make the Israeli government agree to the
American initiative,'' he said.
	   A high-ranking Palestinian official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said no preparations were under way for another round of
talks because there was no sign of progress after three sessions.
	   Netanyahu said he did not want to focus only on the troop
pullback, but also wanted to raise issues such as the extradition
of Palestinians suspected of killing Israelis and the reduction of
the Palestinian police force. ``There are at least eight or nine
other issues and I want specific answers on all of them,''
Netanyahu told Israel TV on Tuesday, before the latest round.
	   With the resumption of the talks, Netanyahu has come under
renewed pressure from both hard-liners and moderates in his
government. Legislators against further withdrawal threatened to
topple the government if Netanyahu carried it out, while the peace
advocates said they would do so if the land wasn't handed over
soon.
	   However, unless a motion of no-confidence is brought next week,
Netanyahu's coalition will be secure for several weeks.
	   Parliament goes into recess July 29 and will begin its fall term
Oct. 19. During this period, the government cannot be brought down
by a motion of no confidence.
	   Netanyahu said Wednesday he was trying to negotiate the best
possible agreement, and that once he had done so would he would
present it to parliament for approval without hesitation.
	   Israel's dovish opposition, meanwhile, was divided over whether
it should try to bring down Netanyahu at any cost, even if it meant
voting against a withdrawal pullback.
	   More than a dozen legislators of the Labor Party said they would
agree to a proposal, floated by former Prime Minister Shimon Peres,
to give Netanyahu a parliamentary safety net for the next six
months if he agrees to a troop withdrawal.

Top Northern League officials given suspended sentences
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP Photo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ The two top officials of the
secession-minded Northern League received suspended sentences of
seven and eight months Wednesday for a clash with police seeking
evidence against the party.
	   Party leader Umberto Bossi, given seven months, and Roberto
Maroni, given eight, were convicted on charges of insulting police
and interfering with police operations.
	   The charges date to Sept. 18, 1996, when police pushed their way
past party officials guarding the headquarters of the party in
Milan.
	   Bossi and Maroni, a former interior minister, and other
officials had tried to prevent police from entering the offices by
forming a human chain.
	   Maroni claimed he was was punched in the face as he attempted to
block police.
	   Police were particularly looking for evidence against the
League's green-shirted security force, which reminds some Italians
of security forces that flourished under Fascist rule.
	   Bossi has declared ``independence'' for a broad section of
northern Italy.
	   Polls have shown that the vast majority of Bossi's supporters
oppose attempts to separate the comparatively wealthy north from
the rest of the country, but do want lower taxes and more
accountability from the central government in Rome.

Four French World Cup stars escape unharmed from boat accident
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAINT TROPEZ, France (AP) _ Four members of France's World Cup
winning squad escaped unharmed from a boating accident during a
short vacation in southern France.
	   French captain Didier Deschamps and teammates Marcel Desailly,
Christophe Dugarry and Alain Boghossian were on board a high-speed
boat which hit a fisherman's boat after leaving the port of Cannes
on Tuesday.
	   The boat, driven by a professional, smashed the fisherman's boat
in two. The fisherman, Patrick Filancia, was pulled from the water
by the soccer players.
	   Nobody was injured, but Filancia was still in a state of shock
on Wednesday, his wife said.
	   Local police were investigating the accident, and the players,
the boat's driver, and the fisherman were all questioned.

Chinese reportedly operate `floating brothels' off Quemoy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Chinese fishermen are doing a booming
business on floating shops and brothels moored off the outlying
Taiwanese island of Quemoy, a newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   Small convoys of 10 or more boats moor about 50 meters (165
feet) offshore and avoid Quemoy's coast guard, the United Daily
News said.
	   Clients wade into the water and board the fishing boats to shop
for merchandise or visit prostitutes, who charge as little as 500
Taiwan dollars (dlrs 14), it said.
	   Business is reportedly booming because there are no brothels on
Quemoy.
	   The Chinese fishermen also trade goods including tea, seafood
and antiques on the beaches, the report said. The long shoreline
allows them enough time to flee back to their boats before they can
be caught, it said.
	   The military stronghold of Quemoy is just two kilometers (1.6
miles) off China's coastal Fujian province. Many Chinese have
smuggled goods into the islet or fish in the rich fishing grounds
there, center of many disputes between China and Taiwan.
	   Quemoy's coast guard rarely has fired at the Chinese since China
accused it of accidentally killing intruding Chinese fishermen in
efforts to disperse them.
	   Taiwan is the seat of the Nationalist government driven out of
mainland China by Communist forces in 1949. The business on
floating boats is illegal because Taiwan still bans direct travel
between the two sides.

Ukrainian doctors warn against picking up dangerous mushrooms
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ After several recent poisonings and one
death blamed on wild mushrooms, doctors urged Ukrainians to refrain
from the popular summer pastime, a newspaper said Wednesday.
	   ``Picking mushrooms is especially dangerous now,'' Health
Ministry toxicologist Borys Sheiman told the Kievskiye Vedomosti
newspaper. ``The mushrooms are influenced by weather, air pressure
and the level of radiation.''
	   At just one Kiev hospital, eight children were admitted last
weekend with mushroom poisoning, and one of them, a 4-year-old
girl, has died, he said.
	   ``It's better for the grown-ups and children not to pick
mushrooms, so that the pleasure does not become a fatal mistake,''
said Sheiman.
	   Mushroom hunting is extremely popular during the summer months
in the former Soviet Union _ and poisoning cases are quite common.
	   A total of 4,578 people have suffered from mushroom poisoning in
Ukraine over the past two years, and 266 of them died, including 97
children, according to official figures.
	   Health authorities have also urged people to avoid buying
mushrooms at outdoors markets, saying that some of these mushrooms
were gathered in areas affected by radioactive fallout from the
1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The U.N. refugee organization on
Wednesday cast doubt on Serb claims to have cleared a strategic
central Kosovo town of militant separatists, saying its staff heard
sounds of fighting during a recent visit.
	   Staff employed by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said
Orahovac resounded with the sounds of gunfire and occasional
explosions on Tuesday. Its streets were empty except for fortified
Serbian police positions, said Maki Shinohara of the UNHCR.
	   Albanian resistance appeared to be coming from hills to the
north of the town, where guerrillas had dug in late last week.
	   The report buttressed claims by Kosovo Albanians fighting for
independence from Serbia that the battle for Orahovac was
continuing. They said at least 36 ethnic Albanians died Tuesday, on
the fourth day of clashes near the town of 20,000, about 50
kilometers (30 miles) southwest of Pristina.
	   The fighting has called into question the possibility of a
negotiated settlement between Serbia, the dominant republic of
Yugoslavia, and ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of
Kosovo's population. Germany's foreign minister said NATO would
likely have to get involved to end the violence.
	   ``On both sides, there is a lack of serious effort to contain
the armed violence and resume negotiations,'' Foreign Minister
Klaus Kinkel said Wednesday in Bonn, Germany. ``I believe there
ultimately is no way around measures of (NATO) coercion.''
	   The continued fighting also led the U.N. Security Council to
vote Tuesday to expand the peacekeeping force in Macedonia by about
300 troops, mostly to strengthen security along borders with Kosovo
and Albania. U.S. troops will make up about half of the 1,000-plus
force.
	   Ending a visit to the violence-torn province, the Organization
for Security and Cooperation issued a report Wednesday noting an
influx of armed fighters from neighboring Albania, increased
abductions by both sides and growing shortages of food and
medicines.
	   In an attempt to cobble together peace talks in Kosovo,
Christopher Hill, the U.S. ambassador to Macedonia, met Tuesday
with Ibrahim Rugova, the moderate ethnic Albanian leader. Hill had
conferred with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic in Belgrade on
Monday.
	   Rugova's party, the Democratic League of Kosovo, on Tuesday
condemned what it called the ``violence and massacre by Serb forces
in Orahovac.''
	   The capture of Orahovac would have expanded the nearly 40
percent of Kosovo the militant Kosovo Liberation Army is said to
control _ and given the rebels command of a strategic road.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, which is close to ethnic Albanian
politicians, claimed Serb forces, which moved into the town
Saturday, were still shelling KLA positions in Orahovac on Tuesday
and that fighting was also raging in outlying villages.

Stolen Boston Marathon medal found
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A gold medal stolen from the Japanese winner of the
1951 Boston Marathon has been found in a police raid, officers said
Wednesday.
	   ``It is like a dream,'' said Shigeki Tanaka, 67, who was a
college student when he won the race 47 years ago in 2 hours, 27
minutes, 45 seconds. Tanaka, from Hiroshima, the first city ever
hit by an atomic bomb, was hailed by the U.S. media as ``Atom
Boy.''
	   After his original medal was stolen from his house on May 5,
along with some money, the Boston Athletic Association awarded
Tanaka a replacement medal on July 10 for his achievement as the
first Japanese to win the race.
	   Last Saturday night, police arrested a Brazilian boy for
allegedly breaking into a civil hall in Utsunomiya, 99 kilometers
(62 miles) north of Tokyo, said Itsuo Usui, a spokesman of
Utsunomiya-Higashi police.
	   In their investigation, police raided the apartment house of
another Brazilian and found the medal in a cabinet, Usui said. The
apartment was about 700 meters (800 yards) from Tanaka's residence,
he added.
	   He declined to identify the Brazilians while they are still
under investigation.
	   ``I personally feel I can't hold two medals,'' Tanaka said. ``So
I will consult with people concerned'' about whether to return one
to the Boston Athletic Association.

Pakistan pushes for international mediation on Kashmir dispute
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By KATHY GANNON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan's foreign minister pressed
his country's case for international mediation to settle a dispute
with India over the volatile border region of Kashmir in talks
Wednesday with a top U.S. official.
	   Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub told U.S. Deputy Secretary of State
Strobe Talbott that Kashmir is probably the the world's most
dangerous conflict now that both Pakistan and India are declared
nuclear powers, government officials said. They spoke on condition
of anonymity.
	   ``The foreign minister conveyed to the United States the
importance of preserving peace and security in South Asia,
including the resolution of Kashmir,'' according to a statement
issued by the foreign ministry following talks. More details were
not available.
	   Talbott was to meet with Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif later
Wednesday.
	   In the past, India has refused international mediation on
Kashmir, the former princely state that was divided between the
uneasy neighbors in 1947, when they gained independence from
Britain.
	   Muslim rebels have been fighting a separatist war in
India-controlled Kashmir since 1989. India and Pakistan have fought
two of three wars over the region.
	   Meanwhile, the biggest item on Pakistan's agenda, the lifting of
U.S-led economic sanctions, appeared to be settled by a U.S.
promise not to block new international loans to cash-strapped
Pakistan.
	   In Washington, senior state department and treasury officials
said Tuesday that the U.S. decision not to block any new
International Monetary Fund loans was made by high-level officials
after consultations with interested members of the U.S. Congress.
	   For Pakistan the decision was good news.
	   Economic sanctions were imposed against both Pakistan and India
after the South Asian neighbors conducted underground nuclear tests
last May.
	   The tests were condemned by the industrialized nations and the
U.S. immediately imposed sanctions in line with U.S. laws. For
Pakistan, the sanctions meant a loss of dlrs 1.5 billion. They cost
India dlrs 3 billion.
	   But, Pakistan, unlike its neighbor India, is heavily dependent
on loans from international lending institutions.
	   Compounding Pakistan's economic woes is waning investor
confidence. The Karachi Stock Exchange, which has been dropping
daily, has reduced its hours to try to stem the tide.
	   The Foreign Exchange reserves also are dropping daily, with one
report Wednesday that they had dropped to dlrs 300 million, a
record low.
	   On Tuesday, Finance Minister Sartaj Aziz announced an economic
package to try to improve its trade balance, by reducing imports
and increasing exports.
	   Meanwhile, government officials, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said that the United States was seeking some commitment
from Pakistan to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and refrain
from developing nuclear weapons.
	   While not ruling out signing the treaty, Pakistan has said it
won't compromise its security. Pakistan also warned that while it
didn't want an arms race on the subcontinent, it wouldn't be left
behind if India pursues nuclear weapons.

Israeli defense minister asks for U.S. help in negotiations
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Israeli defense minister urging the Americans to
resume their role as mediator, EDITS to TRIM; adds byline &QL; 
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Signaling that the first direct talks with the
Palestinians in months have failed, Israel's defense minister on
Wednesday urged the United States to resume its role as mediator.
	   The Palestinians also hinted that the negotiations on an Israeli
troop withdrawal in the West Bank have broken down, saying they
were not inclined to attend another meeting with the Israelis.
	   The talks had been arranged by the United States after it
announced earlier this month that it had exhausted its role as
broker. The negotiations were widely seen as the last chance for
Israel and the Palestinians to reach agreement a withdrawal.
	   The Clinton administration has been trying since January to win
support for a land-for-security plan under which Israel would
withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank, in exchange for greater
Palestinian efforts to crack down on Islamic militants.
	   The Palestinians have accepted the U.S. initiative, but Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has balked at the scope of the
withdrawal and said he needed stronger guarantees that the
Palestinians will live up to their security obligations.
	   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said Wednesday it was
time for Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to meet to
try and resolve the disputes. ``What is also needed now is
high-level American involvement, with the (U.S. Mideast) envoy,
Dennis Ross and Secretary Madeleine Albright helping us to reach an
agreement,'' Mordechai said.
	   The Israeli-Palestinian contacts began with a Sunday meeting
between Mordechai and Arafat's deputy, Mahmoud Abbas, followed by
contacts between lower-level negotiators. Abbas left Wednesday for
Jordan, making it unlikely he and Mordechai would meet again this
week, as initially planned, Israeli radio reports said.
	   A high-ranking Palestinian official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said no preparations were under way for another round of
talks because there was no sign of progress after three sessions.
	   Arafat adviser Nabil Abourdeneh said Israel has rejected the
American plan, but has not put any new offers on the table. He said
it was time for the United States to step up pressure on Netanyahu.
	   Netanyahu has said he did not want to focus only on the troop
pullback, but also wanted to raise several other issues such as the
extradition of Palestinians suspected of killing Israelis.
	   With the resumption of the talks, Netanyahu came under renewed
pressure from both hardliners and moderates in his government.
	   However, unless a motion of no-confidence is submitted to
parliament by next week, neither side will be able to make good on
threats to bring down Netanyahu. Parliament goes into recess July
29 and will begin its fall term Oct. 19. During this period, the
government cannot be toppled by a motion of no confidence.
	   Israel's dovish opposition was divided over whether it should
try to bring down Netanyahu at any cost, even if it meant voting
against a withdrawal pullback.
	   More than a dozen legislators of the Labor Party said they would
agree to a proposal, floated by former Prime Minister Shimon Peres,
to give Netanyahu a parliamentary safety net for the next six
months if he agrees to a troop withdrawal.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ After days of pitching their proposals to the
public, Japan's three top candidates for prime minister hunkered
down Wednesday to jockey for support among the only people voting
in this week's ballot: members of the ruling party.
	   Though the battle to replace resigning Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto has been an unusually public competition for Japan,
Friday's vote for Liberal Democratic Party president _ and most
likely prime minister _ is in the hands of 413 party members.
	   So instead of pressing the flesh in the streets and at shopping
malls, the candidates _ Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi, former Chief
Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama and Health Minister Junichiro
Koizumi _ were lobbying among their buddies in Parliament.
	   ``I'm getting requests from all three,'' LDP legislator Yoshio
Yoshikawa said, sitting in his office with a pamphlet from one of
the candidates. ``I'm intentionally not making up my mind until I
have to vote.''
	   The campaign has turned into a horse-race, by Japanese
standards. Obuchi, the old-guard favorite, is leading but still far
short of garnering the majority, according to Japanese media
surveys released Wednesday.
	   The Yomiuri newspaper, polling those expected to vote, found
that nearly 180 support Obuchi. About 95 said they support Health
Minister Junichiro Koizumi, and 65 were for former Chief Cabinet
Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama, the Yomiuri said. Dozens of votes are
still undecided, it said.
	   Those projections would not give Obuchi the majority of the 366
lawmakers and 47 prefectural (state) representatives voting at LDP
headquarters on Friday, meaning the party would have to hold an
immediate run-off ballot.
	   The winner is virtually assured of becoming prime minister
because the LDP commands a majority in the more powerful lower
house of Parliament.
	   The three are racing to take over from Hashimoto, who announced
last week he would quit after the party's humilating defeat in July
12 upper house elections _ a defeat widely seen as a backlash
against the government's failure to remedy Japan's souring economy.
	   The electoral setback has forced the LDP to try to stage a more
open contest for president, after decades of choosing leaders
through backroom deals among power brokers, making the vote _ if
they bothered taking one _ a predictable ritual.
	   The selection has never before been so up for grabs.
	   If it weren't for the electoral disaster, Obuchi would have been
guaranteed the prime minister's seat. But looming fears that he
lacks the dynamic personality to win the next election have greatly
boosted the chances for Koizumi and Kajiyama.
	   ``This is unprecedented,'' said Yoshimasa Hayashi, a legislator
who is supporting Kajiyama's bid. ``This time, there is no telling
who's going to win.''
	   Hayashi has been busy all week, visiting and telephoning
lawmakers, as well as appearing on TV shows, making Kajiyama's
case. Kajiyama, considered tough on economic reform, has backing
from the business sector.
	   The possibility that the Kajiyama and Koizumi camps may join
forces to block Obuchi in a run-off is further evidence that it's
no longer business as usual at the LDP.
	   ``An Obuchi win is not a good image,'' Hayashi said. ``The party
is really changing.''
	   For decades, Japanese politics was dominated by ``habatsu,'' or
groups of lawmakers whose bosses, mostly former prime ministers,
doled out campaign cash and Cabinet posts to their members.
	   But recent changes in campaign-funding laws requiring money to
go through the party, as well as changes to single-seat districts,
have gradually made the habatsu obsolete.
	   Still, skepticism about the diminishing grip of habatsu remains.
	   ``What do you know? The party campaign continues to be dominated
by a habatsu-oriented numbers game,'' the Asahi newspaper said in
an editorial Wednesday.
	   Lawmaker Masatoshi Abe has yet to make up his mind on which
candidate to support, but he welcomes the new openness in his party
as a healthy sign of gradual change in Japanese politics.
	   ``People should vote on their convictions, not by which group
they are in,'' he said. ``Habatsu is falling apart. It can't
control everyone like before.''

Blind lottery salesmen protest against ticket vending machines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ About 50 blind lottery ticket salesmen
have protested outside Thailand's executive office building against
a government plan to sell the tickets through vending machines, a
government spokesman said Wednesday.
	   The blind salesmen, who staged their protest Tuesday, handed a
letter to a government representative voicing their opposition to
the plan.
	   Selling lottery tickets provides a meager living for more than
20,000 poor rural people who travel to Bangkok each month to ply
the streets carrying wooden boxes full of numbered slips.
	   There are two draws each month, for which 31 million tickets are
printed. Five million of those are given to organizations for the
disabled to be sold to handicapped vendors at a discount.
	   Lottery tickets sell for 40 baht (dlrs 0.97) each. The vendors
pay 36 baht (dlrs 0.87) for each ticket, giving them a profit of 4
baht (about 10 cents) on each one sold.

Novotna pulls out of Fed Cup match
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Citing exhaustion, Czech tennis
player Jana Novotna withdrew from this weekend's Federation Cup
playoff against Italy, a newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   The daily Mlada Fronta Dnes said that Novotna, ranked second in
the world, will be replaced by Lenka Nemeckova, ranked 91 by the
World Tennis Association.
	   ``I'm very disappointed,'' the daily quoted Czech team coach
Frantisek Pala as saying.
	   Novotna, relaxing in Florida, said her difficult program in
recent weeks had exhausted her.
	   ``I had no time to rest,'' Mlada Fronta Dnes quoted her as
saying.
	   In the last six weeks, Novotna won three consecutive tournaments
and five titles, including her first Grand Slam title at Wimbledon.
	   Her withdrawal from the playoff will leave four inexperienced
players on the Czech team, and is likely to send the team from
World Group I to World Group II.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian officials said Wednesday they were
not inclined to hold more talks on a West Bank troop withdrawal
after Israel failed to make any new proposals in three sessions.
The talks, arranged by the United States, are widely seen as the
last chance for Israel and the Palestinians to agree on the scope
of an Israeli troop pullback. Earlier this month, the United States
said it has exhausted its role as a mediator. (ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's hard-line Parliament on Wednesday
overwhelmingly approved the nomination of a moderate cleric as
interior minister, handing reformist President Mohammad Khatami a
major victory. The Parliament, dominated by conservatives,
apparently feared rejection of Abdolvahed Mousavi-Lari would
provoke a backlash among the millions of Iranians who voted Khatami
to power last year. Khatami has won wide support for his efforts to
ease social restrictions, encourage political freedom and end
nearly 20 years of hostility with the United States. (IRAN-INTERIOR
MINISTER)
	   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) _ Tajikistan's president said
Wednesday that four United Nations workers were killed by
``traitors'' intent on undermining the country's fragile peace
process. President Emomali Rakhmonov stopped short of directly
blaming former guerrilla fighters for Tuesday's killings of the
U.N. military observers, but claimed that militants had previously
threatened U.N. personnel in the mountainous Central Asian nation.
The president announced that a special government commission had
been set up to find and punish the attackers. (TAJIKISTAN-UN)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The U.N. refugee organization on
Wednesday cast doubt on Serb claims to have cleared a strategic
central Kosovo town of militant separatists, saying its staff heard
sounds of fighting during a recent visit. Staff employed by the
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said Orahovac resounded with
the sounds of gunfire and occasional explosions on Tuesday.
Albanian resistance appeared to be coming from hills to the north
of the town, where guerrillas had dug in late last week. The report
buttressed claims by Kosovo Albanians fighting for independence
from Serbia that the battle for Orahovac was continuing.
(YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodian election officials said
Wednesday they have tightened security in the former Khmer Rouge
stronghold of Anlong Veng after a murderous attack on election
workers and expect voting to go forward there. About 5,000 former
Khmer Rouge guerrillas who defected to the government when Anlong
Veng was captured in April are scheduled to vote in Sunday's
parliamentary elections, but a remaining hard-line guerrilla
faction has vowed to disrupt the polling. (CAMBODIA-ELECTION-KHMER

Swiss president appeals to Clinton over sanctions threats
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Swiss Foreign Ministry statement, more details,
reactions, minor edits. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss President Flavio Cotti is making
a direct appeal to his U.S. counterpart Bill Clinton over threats
of sanctions by some U.S. cities and states, the Swiss Foreign
Ministry said Wednesday.
	   In a letter, Cotti warns Clinton that the threats are
``undermining the traditionally good relations'' between
Switzerland and the United States and calls on him and his
administration to ``take decisive action against the sanctions,''
the ministry said in a statement.
	   A number of U.S. cities and states have threatened to impose
sanctions on Switzerland's two major banks if they do not agree an
acceptable settlement of Holocaust survivors' claims.
	   Talks have been stalled since Jewish leaders reacted angrily to
the offer by the banks on June 19 of dlrs 600 million to settle the
claims.
	   Switzerland's ambassador in Washington, Alfred Defago, will
deliver the letter to the White House on Wednesday afternoon,
ministry spokesman Franz Egle said.
	   Cotti's intervention was welcomed by Switzerland's four major
political parties and by the main industry body, Vorort.
	   ``We're very glad of any support from official circles,'' said
Silvia Matile, spokeswoman for the Swiss Bankers Association.
	   The Clinton administration, which has praised Switzerland for
the efforts it is making to assess its wartime past and make amends
for any wrongdoing, has repeatedly opposed the sanctions.
	   Cotti restated Switzerland's intention to continue with those
efforts, which include a fund to help needy Holocaust survivors, an
independent panel of historians reviewing the period, and a
U.S.-led committee investigating Holocaust-era assets in Swiss
banks.
	   His letter referred to ``the exceptionally intense nature of
economic relations between the two countries, as well as to the
fact that Switzerland ranks as one of the United States' largest
investors.''
	   During a brief visit to Geneva in May, the U.S. president
assured Swiss officials of his opposition to sanctions.
	   Cotti noted a joint statement by the U.S. and Swiss governments
in March, opposing any local or state boycotts from the United
States against Swiss banks over treatment of Holocaust victims.

Russian tax police crack down on U.S. firm Johnson and Johnson

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian tax police have accused Johnson and
Johnson, the U.S. health care products company, of failing to pay
nearly dlrs 20 million in back taxes and fines, officials said
Tuesday.
	   In addition, criminal charges were filed last week against two
expatriate workers, John Bailey, the former director general of the
Russian office Johnson and Johnson Ltd., and the company's chief
accountant in Russia, Vane Blachard, said Oleg Mikhailov, a tax
police spokesman. They were accused of tax evasion and may face up
to four years in prison if convicted.
	   ``It's the first time the tax police filed charges against top
executives of a big foreign company that is known worldwide,''
Mikhailov said in a telephone interview.
	   Earlier this year, tax officials moved to freeze some of the
company's assets, Mikhailov said.
	   Olga Fedanova, a spokeswoman for Johnson and Johnson in Moscow,
said the company hadn't received official word on charges filed
against Bailey and Blachard and refused further comment. Blachard
was on vacation in the United States, she said.
	   Bailey left Russia in January after his contract ended and his
whereabouts were not known. One Russian newspaper said he had
returned to his native New Zealand, and another said he had gone to
the United States.
	   According to Mikhailov, tax officials began investigating the
company in 1996 and the following year accused Johnson and Johnson
of tax-dodging. The company challenged the accusations in court but
finally lost the case last November, Mikhailov said.
	   Together with fines, the company now owes the government 117
million rubles (dlrs 19 million) in back taxes for 1994, 1995 and
the first nine months of 1996, Mikhailov said.
	   In recent months, Russian government has moved to boost tax
collections, which have long been below the targets. The government
has said it would be looking into foreign companies to make sure
they had paid their taxes.

	   A summary of late financial and business news from The
Associated Press. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets closed generally lower
Tuesday, with the key indexes in both Singapore and Bangkok
tumbling more than 3 percent as investors took profits on recent
gains. The Singapore market posted the largest loss in Asia because
of the profit-taking, snapping a four-day rally. The Singapore
Stock Exchange's Straits Times Industrial Index slid 39.80 points,
or 3.6 percent, to 1,062.52. Thai shares also slumped following
four consecutive sessions of gains. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The dollar surged against the yen Wednesday on
worries that the apparent front runner to become Japan's next prime
minister is not the right man to lead an economic recovery. Tokyo
stocks fell sharply. The dollar bought 140.66 yen in late
afternoon, up 1.18 yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo and also above
its late New York rate of 140.40 yen overnight. The yen weakened on
concern that Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi will win a three-way
race to succeed outgoing Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto. The
governing party plans to elect a new president Friday, and the
winner will then become the next prime minister. (JAPAN-MARKETS)
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's prime minister said the
country will plow ahead with massive infrastructure projects to
spend its way out of economic problems, news reports said
Wednesday. ``The bigger the construction, the more economic
activities,'' Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad was quoted as saying
by Wednesday's Star newspaper. ``e will spend money on anything
involved with infrastructure so that there will be spinoffs to
stimulate other industries,'' Mahathir said, adding that 140
industries would benefit from the construction spree. Malaysia has
made a dramatic about-face in recent weeks, with Finance Minister
Anwar Ibrahim announcing two fiscal stimulus packages worth 12
billion ringgit (dlrs 3 billion).
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Thousands of South Korean metal
workers in the auto, shipbuilding and other heavy industries walked
off their jobs Wednesday to protest rising layoffs. Organizers of
the indefinite strike said about 60,000 workers were participating,
but the government put the figure at fewer than 10,000. Lee
Gap-yong, head of the maverick Confederation of Korean Trade
Unions, said telephone, subway and hospital workers would join the
walkout Thursday. The government called the strikes illegal and
threatened to send in riot police to break them up. It fears labor
unrest will scare away needed foreign investment. (SKOREA-LABOR)
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ Shanghai's economy grew by 9.4 percent in
the first half of 1998, missing the 10 percent target for China's
commercial capital amid a slowing national economy, according to
figures released Wednesday. Total economic output in this city of
15 million people was 173.6 billion yuan (dlrs 20.9 billion) from
January to June, the Shanghai Municipal Statistics Bureau
announced. Investment in fixed assets was 51.3 billion yuan (dlrs
6.2 billion), down 8.1 percent from the same period last year.

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The army chief of staff said
Wednesday that 95,000 security personnel will be deployed around
Cambodia to assure voter safety in parliamentary elections that
have been preceded by a violence-marred campaign.
	   Hundreds of foreign election observers fanned out into the
countryside, but the opposition said they weren't nearly enough to
stop intimidation and a fraudulent victory by strongman Hun Sen.
	   Gen. Ke Kim Yan told reporters that 95,000 police, military
police and soldiers will assure security for Sunday's vote.
Five-man plainclothes teams will be stationed at each of the 11,600
polling stations, with only one rifle between them to appear less
intimidating.
	   But for many Cambodians, the presence of the security personnel
could prove frightening, since they are controlled by Hun Sen and
members of the police have been accused of violence and
intimidation against opposition figures.
	   Cambodians also fear that if the vote goes against Hun Sen, he
would use the army to retain power. Hun Sen has pledged to transfer
power peacefully, but memories remain fresh of fighting he
unleashed last year to depose his co-premier, Prince Norodom
Ranariddh.
	   Election watchdog and human rights groups held a seminar for
high-ranking police and urged them to allow voters to cast ballots
freely without fear of retribution. About 60 police officers
attended, but 50 invited members from the military police did not.
	   Glenys Kinnock, head of the European Union's observer mission,
said the National Election Committee had responded to her
complaints over dubious accreditation given to most of the 60,000
Cambodian observers believed to come from obscure, Hun Sen-linked
groups.
	   The NEC, itself packed with Hun Sen supporters, said it would
try to weed out the questionable observers by voting day, Kinnock
said.
	   It will also grant free access to 16,000 members of three
well-regarded independent groups, who had previously lacked
accreditation, to all polling stations. Kinnock, who will assess
whether the elections are credible for the EU, insisted on their
participation.
	   About 650 foreign observers are being coordinated by the United
Nations, but apart from fleets of new vehicles, their activity is a
dim shadow of the operation mounted by the temporary U.N.
administration in 1993 to bring peace and democracy to a country
devastated by decades of war and the Khmer Rouge genocide.
	   ``In five years, we've gone from (the U.N.) spending dlrs 3
billion and deploying 20,000 peacekeepers to the election being
taken charge of by the Cambodians themselves and the international
community being invited to provide technical support,'' said
Marie-Ange Lescure, spokeswoman for the European Union delegation.
	   Hun Sen has invited the observers to win international
endorsement for the election, hoping to regain legitimacy and
foreign aid lost when he deposed Ranariddh, whose royalist
FUNCINPEC party won the 1993 elections but was forced to share
power when Hun Sen threatened civil war.
	   The standard for an acceptable election has divided the
international community. The United States, which has already
served notice that violence has hopelessly marred the process, has
said it will render a separate verdict from the final U.N.
statement likely to be dominated by the EU, which is setting less
stringent conditions.
	   The prince, campaigning in a province where a party activist was
reported murdered Saturday, said that the current levels of
political violence were ``acceptable'' compared to 1993, when the
Khmer Rouge still numbered thousands of guerrilla fighters.
	   The movement is nearly extinct following mass defections and the
loss of its last major stronghold, Anlong Veng, in April. But a
raid near Anlong Veng against a convoy of election workers last
week killed two people and showed the guerrillas retain the
capability to mount hit-and-run attacks.
	   The NEC said security has been beefed up and that all 11 polling
stations in the area will remain open. They will serve some 5,000
guerrillas who defected when Anlong Veng fell, most voting for the
first time in their lives.
	   The Khmer Rouge caused the deaths of as many as 2 million people
when it ruled between 1975 and 1979.

King Hussein suspected to be suffering from cancer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ King Hussein is being tested for cancer of
the lymph cells and will begin undergoing chemotherapy next week if
tests confirm the condition.
	   King Hussein, who is being treated at the Mayo Clinic, disclosed
the diagnosis in a letter to his brother, Crown Prince Hassan, on
Tuesday. The letter was read on Jordanian television Tuesday night.
	   Prime Minister Abdul-Salam Majali said Wednesday that the king
asked that the letter be read on television to inform Jordanians of
his condition.
	   The king wrote that an ``excised lymph node and symptoms all
seem to point to lymphoma,'' or cancer of the lymphatic tissue. At
the same time there could be other reasons for the infection and
related symptoms, the letter said.
	   Doctors at the hospital in Rochester, Minnesota, are waiting for
full details of tests done on Friday. If the cancer is ``confirmed
next Tuesday, (the) physicians will begin chemotherapy,'' Hussein
wrote.
	   Hussein was admitted July 14 to the renowned Mayo Clinic in
Rochester, Minnesota, after suffering from numerous spells of fever
and cold sweats.
	   The fever now occurs only once every 24 hours, but a severely
low neutrophil and platelet count in his blood has not improved,
the king wrote.
	   On Wednesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wished
Hussein a quick recovery. ``I hope he will overcome it (his
illness) with his great strength _ a spiritual and physical
strength he has gained over the years,'' Netanyahu said in an
interview with Israeli radio.
	   Since a cancer scare in August 1992, when an inflamed kidney was
found to be infected with cancerous cells, the king has undergone
regular medical checkups at the Mayo Clinic.
	   He underwent an operation in November 1997 to remove an inflamed
lymph gland that was found to be benign. In April of the same year,
he underwent surgery for enlarged prostate that was also found to
be benign.

Floods threaten millions along China's longest river

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Dikes holding back surging floodwaters along
China's Yangtze River could collapse under expected heavy rains,
threatening millions of people, state media reported Wednesday.
	   The already waterlogged embankments are the only flood
protection for southern Hunan province's Yueyang city and the
Dongting Lake area, home to 10 million people, the China Daily
said.
	   Floodwaters washed away a 3,000-meter (1.8-mile) section of
newly constructed dikes in Hunan's Huarong County and opened a
600-meter (1,970-foot) crack in the embankment surrounding Caisang
Lake, both near Yueyang, the Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   In a sign of official concern, President Jiang Zemin personally
ordered the reinforcement of dikes along the Yangtze, the world's
third longest river, Xinhua said in a separate report.
	   Yueyang has mobilized 230,000 people and 140 boats to fight the
flooding, the agency said.
	   More than 1,000 people have already died this year in flooding
from seasonal rains that began earlier and have been heavier than
usual. The floods have caused more than 84 billion yuan (U.S. dlrs
10 billion) in economic losses. Forecasters expect more rains in
late July and August.
	   High waters were weakening the waterlogged dikes throughout the
Dongting Lake area. Waters have remained above alarm levels for
weeks and were still rising, the China Daily said. It added that
the channel where the lake flows into the Yangtze was almost a
meter (a yard) above danger level.
	   Hunan's provincial capital, Changsha, on the south end of
Dongting, was threatened. Farmers in the area have been manning
dikes while their families hurried to bring in the early rice crop,
the newspaper said.
	   Downstream, in the industrial city of Wuhan, nearly half a meter
(1.6 feet) of rain fell in 11 hours Tuesday, the highest level ever
registered, the Economic Daily reported.
	   China Central Television showed cars and bicycles floating down
Wuhan's streets and reported that one-fifth of the city suffered
flooding.
	   Sandbags were piled along the banks of the Yangtze, which runs
through the city and already was 1.2 meters (4 feet) above danger
levels, the Economic Daily reported.

Russia's oil companies criticize government's IMF-mandated
</HEADLINE>
policies &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's largest oil companies accused the
government Wednesday of carrying out ``irresponsible'' and
dangerous policies at the behest of the International Monetary Fund
and other foreign lenders.
	   The government is implementing an economic austerity program
demanded by the IMF as a condition for a multi-billion dollar loan
package. The program includes spending cuts and improved tax
enforcement.
	   ``We are forced to state that the economic policy of
international financial organizations toward basic industries is
irresponsible,'' Russia's largest oil companies said in a statement
reported by news agencies.
	   ``It deepens the crisis, aggravates the social situation and is
fraught with the risk of bankruptcy for enterprises that are unable
to work effectively,'' the statement said, according to the
ITAR-Tass and Interfax news agencies.
	   Government policies may lead to ``irreversible social
consequences'' in the next two to three months, the statement said,
	   Such predictions, common among Communist lawmakers, are unusual
from oil companies, who generally enjoy a good relationship with
the government and are favored in its policies.
	   The new austerity program calls for enforced tax collection from
oil companies, which provide a large share of budget revenues. But
it also calls for rescheduling the companies' tax debts, and
shifting the tax burden from producers to consumers.
	   After showing its first signs of growth last year, Russia's
economy has been collapsing for months.
	   The first, dlrs 4.8 billion, installment of the IMF loan is to
be deposited in the Central Bank this week. The loan is also
expected to pave the way for additional lending from the World Bank
and the Japanese government, which will bring Russia's total
bailout to dlrs 17 billion this year and next.

Philippine official says growing ASEAN integration requires more
</HEADLINE>
openness &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ More openness, not interference in
domestic affairs, will help Southeast Asian countries deal better
with their common problems, Philippine Foreign Secretary Domingo
Siazon said Wednesday.
	   In meetings that start Thursday in Manila, foreign ministers
from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations are to discuss a
possible change in their longstanding policy of not intervening in
the internal affairs of other member nations.
	   The Philippines and Thailand are proposing a shift from
non-intervention to ``flexible engagement,'' which would allow
ASEAN greater leeway in discussing problems in countries that
affect other nations, such as forest fires in Indonesia that
blanket the region in haze.
	   ``In ASEAN, we are moving toward growing economic integration,
so it's probably time to start the practice of speaking out openly
on issues of common concern,'' Siazon told reporters.
	   Siazon said the policy shift would not mean interference in
domestic affairs.
	   ``What is being proposed is that ... it should be permitted for
ASEAN countries to speak on issues occurring in another ASEAN
country when these issues have an impact on other countries,'' said
Siazon, who is ASEAN's chairman this year.
	   He cited as an example disturbances in Cambodia that have
triggered a flow of refugees into Thailand.
	   However, some ASEAN members, including Indonesia, are wary of
the proposed policy shift, particularly if it touches on
politically sensitive problems such as the pro-democracy movement
in Myanmar or Indonesian rule over the territory of East Timor.
	   ``The apprehension is that we may be abandoning the 31-year-old
principle that is the bedrock of ASEAN relations,'' said Philippine
Foreign Undersecretary Lauro Baja.
	   Baja said the foreign ministers will have ``very extensive
discussions'' of the proposed shift.
	   At meetings in Manila earlier this week, ASEAN's standing
committee adopted a plan to stop the spread of the haze through
coordinated efforts to prevent and control forest fires.
	   The committee also agreed to cooperate in water conservation,
nuclear safety and waste management, and discussed transnational
crimes such as drug trafficking, money laundering, terrorism, arms
smuggling, piracy, and trafficking in women and children.
	   ASEAN began to stretch its non-intervention policy last year
when it postponed Cambodia's bid for membership because of a coup
led by co-premier Hun Sen. Since then, ASEAN has urged the
Cambodian government to normalize politics by holding elections,
which are scheduled for July 26 _ during the foreign ministers'
meetings.
	   ASEAN consists of Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar,
the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

Survey: Campaign to have infants sleep on backs showing success
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By F.N. D'ALESSIO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ A national awareness campaign apparently is
working in alerting parents to the danger of allowing infants to
sleep on their stomachs _ a practice that increases the risk of
Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.
	   Three studies published in Wednesday's Journal of the American
Medical Association show more parents are placing babies on their
backs or sides to sleep.
	   The studies come four years after the U.S. Public Health Service
and a group of other agencies started the ``Back to Sleep''
campaign. The effort began after several studies found that babies
who sleep on their stomachs are more likely to die of SIDS.
	   A telephone poll conducted by researchers at the National
Institute of Child Health and Human Development surveyed just over
1,000 people every year from 1992 to 1996.
	   The study found the number of parents who said they placed
babies on their stomachs decreased from 70 percent to 24 percent
over those years. The poll had a margin of error of 5 percent.
	   Although the SIDS rate declined approximately 38 percent during
that time, researchers said a cause and effect relationship cannot
be proven.
	   ``I think it's safe to say that having infants sleep on their
backs will reduce the risk of SIDS, but it will not eliminate the
possibility,'' said Marian Willinger, a SIDS specialist who led the
NICHHD study.
	   A study led by Dr. Samuel M. Lesko of the Boston University
School of Medicine looked at some 7,800 mothers in Massachusetts
and Ohio. It found that 18 percent of the mothers had their
1-month-old babies sleep on their stomachs, while 29 percent let
the babies sleep on their stomachs at 3 months.
	   A third study led by Dr. Ruth A. Brenner, also of the NICHHD,
found that 40 percent of low-income mothers from the District of
Columbia allowed babies to sleep on their stomachs.
	   Both Lesko's and Brenner's studies showed mothers were
influenced by, among other things, child-rearing advice from family
and friends.
	   Brenner's study also found that many mothers followed the advice
of hospital personnel.

Gold mine death toll rises to 16; another five killed in Irian
</HEADLINE>
Jaya &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Searchers have found more bodies
buried under tons of mud and rock, bringing to 16 the number killed
by a landslide as they tried to steal gold from an open cut mine,
police said Wednesday.
	   Another 30 people were injured in the accident before dawn
Monday.
	   Searchers initially found 11 bodies, but later recovered another
five.
	   Police said a group of people climbed into a pit under the cover
of darkness, apparently to steal ore at the government-owned mine,
near Bogor, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) southeast of Jakarta.
The landslide was triggered by heavy rain.
	   Meanwhile, five village gold prospectors were killed in another
landslide in Irian Jaya, the western half of New Guinea, about
3,200 kilometers (2,000 miles) east of Jakarta.
	   The newspaper Kompas said the landslide occurred at Abepura in
the eastern part of Irian Jaya on Tuesday.
	   One man was reported missing and four others were injured.

Israeli defense minister asks for U.S. help in negotiations
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Israeli defense minister urging the Americans to
resume their role as mediator, EDITS to TRIM; adds byline &QL; 
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Signaling that the first direct talks with the
Palestinians in months have failed, Israel's defense minister on
Wednesday urged the United States to resume its role as mediator.
	   The Palestinians also hinted that the negotiations on an Israeli
troop withdrawal in the West Bank have broken down, saying they
were not inclined to attend another meeting with the Israelis.
	   The talks had been arranged by the United States after it
announced earlier this month that it had exhausted its role as
broker. The negotiations were widely seen as the last chance for
Israel and the Palestinians to reach agreement a withdrawal.
	   The Clinton administration has been trying since January to win
support for a land-for-security plan under which Israel would
withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank, in exchange for greater
Palestinian efforts to crack down on Islamic militants.
	   The Palestinians have accepted the U.S. initiative, but Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has balked at the scope of the
withdrawal and said he needed stronger guarantees that the
Palestinians will live up to their security obligations.
	   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said Wednesday it was
time for Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to meet to
try and resolve the disputes. ``What is also needed now is
high-level American involvement, with the (U.S. Mideast) envoy,
Dennis Ross and Secretary Madeleine Albright helping us to reach an
agreement,'' Mordechai said.
	   The Israeli-Palestinian contacts began with a Sunday meeting
between Mordechai and Arafat's deputy, Mahmoud Abbas, followed by
contacts between lower-level negotiators. Abbas left Wednesday for
Jordan, making it unlikely he and Mordechai would meet again this
week, as initially planned, Israeli radio reports said.
	   A high-ranking Palestinian official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said no preparations were under way for another round of
talks because there was no sign of progress after three sessions.
	   Arafat adviser Nabil Abourdeneh said Israel has rejected the
American plan, but has not put any new offers on the table. He said
it was time for the United States to step up pressure on Netanyahu.
	   Netanyahu has said he did not want to focus only on the troop
pullback, but also wanted to raise several other issues such as the
extradition of Palestinians suspected of killing Israelis.
	   With the resumption of the talks, Netanyahu came under renewed
pressure from both hardliners and moderates in his government.
	   Neither side will be able to make good on threats to bring down
Netanyahu, unless a motion of no-confidence is submitted to
parliament by next week. Parliament goes into recess July 29 and
will begin its fall term Oct. 19.
	   Israel's dovish opposition was divided over whether it should
try to bring down Netanyahu at any cost, even if it meant voting
against a withdrawal pullback.
	   More than a dozen legislators of the Labor Party said they would
agree to a proposal, floated by former Prime Minister Shimon Peres,
to give Netanyahu a parliamentary safety net for the next six
months if he agrees to a troop withdrawal.

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ A leading human rights activist went on
trial Wednesday on charges of inciting racial hatred for a speech
he gave two years ago calling for greater freedom for Kurds.
	   Akin Birdal, who survived an assassination attempt in May,
arrived at the court house in a wheelchair after the judges
rejected his request to testify at home.
	   Birdal, the chairman of the independent Human Rights
Association, is being retried after an appeals court overturned a
verdict which sentenced him to one year in prison. The appeals
court had ordered a new trial saying his speech did not constitute
a crime.
	   Birdal appealed to the court to abide with the appeals court
ruling.
	   Birdal was shot six times by two ultra-nationalist gunmen who
were later captured. He is known for his opposition to torture and
the forced evacuation of Kurdish villages in southeastern Turkey by
the military in its war against Kurdish guerrillas.
	   Some 37,000 people have died in the war since 1984.

Kohl challenger rejects tolls on the autobahn
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germans rarely pass up a chance to defend
their free superhighways, and election-year front runner Gerhard
Schroeder seized his on Wednesday.
	   The Social Democrat who hopes to unseat Chancellor Helmut Kohl
in September rejected a call by a politician in Kohl's camp for an
annual 100 mark (dlrs 56) fee for motorists using the autobahn.
	   Bavarian governor Edmund Stoiber said this week he would seek
legislation introducing the toll next year. He said it would raise
money for Germany's superhighway system _ also from foreign drivers
_ and noted that most neighboring countries have tolls.
	   But in a car-adoring nation used to unfettered cruising on the
autobahn, condemnation was swift.
	   ``I categorically reject that,'' Schroeder was quoted Wednesday
as saying in the nation's most-read newspaper, Bild. ``We can't
expect German motorists to bear any greater burden.''
	   But Schroeder said he would support European Union efforts for
an eventual uniform system of transportation tolls.
	   In the meantime, taxpayer money should continue to fund the
autobahn, because tolls would unfairly hit commuters and hurt the
German auto industry, he said.
	   Schroeder, the governor of Lower Saxony, sits on the supervisory
board of Volkswagen, Europe's biggest automaker, which is based in
his state.
	   The Free Democrats, junior partner in Kohl's center-right
coalition, also protested. Party chief Wolfgang Gerhardt said
Stoiber's proposal had ``no chance'' in the coalition.
	   Proposals to charge car drivers for autobahn use come up
regularly in Germany, but the government has dared impose tolls
only on heavy trucks.
	   The Greens party, a possible coalition partner for Schroeder if
he wins the Sept. 27 election, caused a storm recently by calling
for a general speed limit on the autobahn.
	   Under Stoiber's plan, all vehicle owners would have to buy a
windshield sticker each year to use the autobahn or face a fine if
caught without it.
	   Buses and trucks up to 7.5 tons would cost 450 marks (dlrs 250).
For trucks up to 12 tons, the fee would be 900 marks (dlrs 500).

Ground personnel of ailing Philippine Airlines go on strike

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Ground personnel at ailing Philippine
Airlines went on strike Wednesday, demanding that the company
recall thousands of workers laid off during a recent devastating
pilots' strike.
	   The strike came as foreign ministers from the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations began arriving for an annual meeting in
Manila on Friday.
	   ``The strike will last until the airline closes unless PAL
changes its position and recalls the retrenched workers,'' ground
crew union president Alex Barrientos told The Associated Press.
``We will not stop the strike.''
	   PAL warned that the strike could be a fatal blow for the
57-year-old flag carrier, Asia's oldest airline.
	   The airline initially announced it had canceled all but two of
its flights Wednesday, but later said it would be able to fly to
all of its destinations, although with substantial delays.
	   PAL said employees were in full attendance at 19 of its 20
domestic stations and operations remained normal at its offices in
Singapore, Japan, Taiwan, Los Angeles and San Francisco. The
airline said only 200 strikers were picketing at Manila's domestic
and international airports and at a cargo terminal.
	   Union vice president Gerry Rivera disputed the report, saying 90
percent of its more than 8,000 members were joining the picketing
in shifts.
	   PAL's ground crews also service 19 out of 35 international
carriers at Manila's airport, including Japan Airlines, Singapore
Airlines and Northwest Airlines.
	   A Singapore Airlines official said flights were delayed by the
strike, with PAL caterers refusing to load food. Managers and a few
extra workers were handling passengers' baggage, she said.
	   Cabinet ministers from Myanmar, Cambodia and Vietnam were
scheduled to arrive later Wednesday, with other ASEAN ministers set
to arrive Thursday.
	   Philippine President Joseph Estrada called the strike
unfortunate and scheduled a dinner meeting Wednesday with union
officials and Labor Secretary Bienvenido Laguesma.
	   ``This will have a big effect on our economy and on our
tourism,'' said Estrada, adding that a closure of PAL would
embarrass the country.
	   In June, PAL was embroiled in a crippling three-week pilots'
strike that brought the company close to financial ruin.
	   At the height of the strike, the flag carrier laid off 5,000 of
its nearly 14,000 workers to minimize its losses.
	   The ground personnel union then threatened to go on strike to
demand the reinstatement of the terminated workers, but the labor
department assumed jurisdiction of the dispute on July 10 and
prohibited any work stoppage.
	   The labor department also ordered the airline to suspend any
more layoffs.
	   The union, however, said it would go ahead with the strike
plans.
	   PAL says it is unable to make payments on about dlrs 2 billion
of debt and is discussing a rehabilitation program with Manila's
Securities and Exchange Commission.
	   The plan includes layoffs, the disposal of most of the airline's
planes, and a sharp reduction of flights.
	   SEC chairman Perfecto Yasay expressed pessimism Wednesday over
whether that plan would be viable with the strike by ground
personnel.

Spanish and Turkish premiers discuss Europe, sign plan of action

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ The prime ministers of Spain and Turkey
held talks Wednesday on Turkey's bid to join the European Union and
agreed to boost bilateral ties.
	   Jose Maria Aznar of Spain is the first European leader to visit
Turkey since the EU summit in Cardiff last month failed to repair
relations between the EU and Ankara.
	   Aznar said the European Union should not put additional
conditions on Turkey's candidacy.
	   ``Turkey is on the road to Europe,'' Aznar said after a private
meeting with his Turkish counterpart Mesut Yilmaz.
	   Ankara has put its relations with the EU on hold since its
exclusion from the first round of enlargement in December. Yilmaz
thanked Aznar for Spain's support within the EU, but reiterated
Turkey's anger at being ``discriminated'' against by the union.
	   The two leaders also signed a plan of action, mainly aimed at
boosting economic and commercial relations between the two
countries.

Israeli warplanes attack guerrilla bases in south Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RASHAYA, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes struck suspected
guerrilla positions in southern Lebanon Wednesday, security
officials said.
	   Two Israeli jets swooped down on the hills between the towns of
Mashgara and Ein el-Tineh in the western Bekaa Valley, firing six
air-to-surface missiles, the Lebanese officials said. They spoke on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   There was no immediate word on casualties from the 1.30 p.m.
(10:30 GMT) raid.
	   An Israeli defense spokesman confirmed the attack and said
pilots reported accurate hits.
	   Thick black smoke could be seen billowing from the stricken
area, which is believed to be used by guerrillas of the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah as a base to launch attacks on Israeli
troops and their allied militiamen in a border enclave they occupy
in south Lebanon.
	   Wednesday's air raid came a day after Hezbollah guerrillas
killed an Israeli-allied militiaman and wounded two others in a
roadside bomb explosion on the edge of the occupied zone.
	   Hezbollah, or the Party of God, is leading a guerrilla war to
try to oust some 1,500 Israeli soldiers and the 2,500 members of
the Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army militia from the occupied
zone.
	   The zone was established by Israel in 1985 to shield its
northern towns against cross-border guerrilla incursions.

Government orders inquiry into Tamil mass grave
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DILIP GANGULY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) - The government ordered an inquiry
Wednesday into a soldier's claim that he helped bury hundreds of
Tamil prisoners killed by security forces in northern Sri Lanka.
	   The soldier made the claim while appealing a death sentence in
his conviction for rape and murder. Since then, human rights groups
and Tamil political parties have urged the government to
investigate the allegation.
	   Four Sri Lankan soldiers and a police officer were sentenced to
death on July 3 for the rape and murder of a Tamil schoolgirl and
her family. They claimed they merely buried the victims and could
show authorities the graves of hundreds of other Tamil civilians
killed by security forces.
	   ``We didn't kill anyone. We only buried bodies. We can show you
where 300 to 400 bodies have been buried,'' Corporal Dewage
Somaratne said when judges asked him why he should not be given the
death sentence. His codefendants, three privates and a police
constable, seconded his claim.
	   The case has been closely followed in Sri Lanka as a test of the
government's commitment to protect minorities and punish attacks
against them in a country torn by ethnic war.
	   The government ``does not condone such atrocities'' and is fully
committed to the safeguarding lives, said M.S. Wiackramarachchi, a
senior Defense Ministry official who ordered the inquiry.
	   Wiackramarachchi said in a statement the inquiry will be
conducted by the Criminal Investigation Department, which is
independent of the police and the army.
	   In Parliament, opposition political parties demanded the
government appoint a presidential commission, which carries more
weight, to investigate the charges.
	   ``We are going to be very tough and we will ask the government
to make the details public,'' said Murukesu Sivasithamparam,
president of the Tamil United Liberation Front. The TULF will
support a motion to debate the issue, Sivasithamparam said.
	   As many as 500 Tamil civilians have disappeared in the northern
Jaffna Peninsula, the Tamil heartland, since the military drove out
rebels and took control in May 1996.
	   The rebels are fighting for an independent homeland for the
ethnic Tamil minority which they claim is discriminated against by
the majority Sinhalese who dominate the government and the
military.

FIFA President Blatter steps down from Swiss Olympic bid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SION, Switzerland (AP) _ Sepp Blatter, the newly elected
president of soccer's world governing body FIFA, is to step down
next month as head of the committee bidding for the 2006 Winter
Olympics to come to Switzerland.
	   The organizing committee of the bid to host the games in Sion,
in Blatter's native canton (state) of Valais, said Wednesday he
would resign the chairmanship on August 28, when a replacement
would be named.
	   Blatter, 62, has said he doesn't think holding the double role
of head of FIFA and the Winter Olympics bid is possible any longer.
	   However, he is one of the most prominent campaigners for the
Sion bid and has said he will continue to support it.
	   Blatter was elected as FIFA president in June.

Gas tanker drivers end strike, harbor pilots stay out
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Gas tanker truck drivers Wednesday
called off a strike and resumed deliveries to the estimated 80
percent of Portugal's gas stations which had run dry during the
48-hour stoppage.
	   But no end was in sight for a strike by 80 harbor pilots which
has virtually choked the flow of imports and exports by sea.
	   The 2,000 truck drivers voted to return to work after the
government agreed late Tuesday to drop a system of mandatory
written tests for drivers, meeting the strikers' main demand, while
the employers agreed to pay them a risk subsidy, although without
specifying how much.
	   The National Road Transport Association, which represents
employers, said more than 1,500 tanker trucks from about 130
distribution companies were due to begin deliveries.
	   The National Association of Gas Vendors estimated it would take
three days for gas station tanks to be fully replenished.
	   ``There was panic-buying Tuesday night. The major cities were
the hardest hit,'' the Association's President Carlos Cazenave said
by phone.
	   Meanwhile, the government late Tuesday temporarily suspended a
law requiring ships' captains to hire a harbor pilot to guide their
vessels into port. The suspension, aimed at getting port traffic
moving again, effectively made the pilots' job redundant.
	   Four ships entered Lisbon harbor on Wednesday, port authorities
said.
	   But at least nine cargo ships were anchored outside, their
captains apparently reluctant to steer their vessels into port
without the help of a harbor pilot. A cruise liner carrying 1,200
passengers turned back from Lisbon and headed to another country,
according to the government.
	   The Harbor Pilots' Union warned the move could endanger
shipping, especially in Lisbon where large vessels carrying crude
oil must maneuver around a sandbank at the mouth of the River
Tagus.
	   The government said it would not enter into talks with the
harbor pilots, who began a 14-day stoppage Tuesday to demand a pay
hike, a risk subsidy and the right to set their own working
conditions.
	   Following widespread allegations of corruption among the harbor
pilots, the government this year placed them under the supervision
of the port authorities _ a move resisted by the pilots.
	   More than 90 percent of harbor pilots are under investigation
for corruption, extortion and criminal association linked to their
work before it came under senior supervision.

Novotna pulls out of Fed Cup match
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Citing exhaustion, Czech tennis
player Jana Novotna withdrew from this weekend's Federation Cup
playoff against Italy, a newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   The daily Mlada Fronta Dnes said that Novotna, ranked second in
the world, will be replaced by Lenka Nemeckova, ranked 91 by the
World Tennis Association.
	   ``I'm very disappointed,'' the daily quoted Czech team coach
Frantisek Pala as saying.
	   Novotna, relaxing in Florida, said her difficult program in
recent weeks had exhausted her.
	   ``I had no time to rest,'' Mlada Fronta Dnes quoted her as
saying.
	   In the last six weeks, Novotna won three consecutive tournaments
and five titles, including her first Grand Slam title at Wimbledon.
	   Her withdrawal from the playoff will leave four inexperienced
players on the Czech team, and is likely to send the team from
World Group I to World Group II.

German on trial in Iran might be released on bail soon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ An Iranian court trying a German man for
having sex with a local woman indicated Wednesday that it will soon
free him on bail, a source said.
	   The court said it would review ``in a positive light'' a bail
request by Helmut Hofer's lawyer, said the source close to the
case. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   The bail will likely be set at 20 million rials (dlrs 6,667)
which the German embassy has agreed to pay, the source said.
	   Hofer was sentenced to death in January soon after his arrest
for having sex with a 26-year-old medical student. Iranian law
punishes sex between unmarried Muslim couples with flogging but if
the man is a non-Muslim, he faces the death penalty.
	   The justice ministry ordered a retrial after Hofer, 54,
contended that he converted to Islam before having sex with the
woman.
	   Hofer, a businessman, appeared in court Wednesday, the first
session of his retrial. The German ambassador Horst Baechmann, the
consul and a translator were also present.
	   The trial was closed to the public and the press. The court
adjourned till the end of August but no date for a second session
was set.
	   The embassy would not comment on the case.
	   Hofer told the court he is ready to marry the woman, which would
affect his case favorably, the source said.
	   Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi told reporters Wednesday he was
pleased that the case was being retried as it would help expand
relations with Germany.
	   ``We received a request from the German government which we
transferred to the judiciary and we are happy that the case is
being reviewed,'' he said.
	   ``But this is a case for the judiciary and is not political and
we have said this to the German government,'' Kharrazi added.
	   Bonn had warned Tehran that if Hofer is executed German-Iranian
relations would deteriorate. Germany is Iran's biggest trading
partner in the Europe Union.
	   While there is no evidence that the government has influenced
the decision to retry Hofer, President Mohammad Khatami, a moderate
who took office in August, is known to favor fewer death sentences
than previous presidents.

Britain says U.S., Dutch have discussed possible trial for Pan Am
</HEADLINE>
bomb suspects &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prime Minister Tony Blair has talked with U.S.
President Bill Clinton and Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok about the
possibility of trying two Pan Am bombing suspects in the
Netherlands, Blair's spokesman said Wednesday.
	   U.S. and British officials said Tuesday that they were
considering the possibility of a third-country trial for two
Libyans accused of killing 270 people by putting a bomb aboard a
Pan AM Boeing 747 in 1988. The bomb exploded as the plane passed
over Lockerbie, Scotland.
	   Libya has refused to hand over the two suspects for trial,
despite sanctions imposed by the U.N. Security Council. It contends
that the two men could not get a fair trial in Scotland or the
United States.
	   The two suspects _ Libyan intelligence agents Abdel Basset
al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah _ were indicted in Scotland and
the United States in 1991 for planting the bomb that exploded Dec.
21, 1988.
	   Alastair Campbell, Blair's spokesman, said Britain had never
accepted criticism of the Scottish system but was prepared to look
at alternatives in the interest of justice for the families of the
victims.
	   ``That is why we did launch discussions with the U.S. some
months ago and more recently with the Dutch about the possibility
of a trial under Scottish law with Scottish judges _ not as has
been said an international panel of judges,'' Campbell said.
	   Though there were be considerable legal and technical
difficulties, he said, ``We do think that they can be resolved and
should be resolved reasonably speedily.''
	   Campbell said Blair and Clinton had discussed the issue several
times, though not in recent days. Discussions between Blair and Kok
were more recent, he said.
	   Clinton confirmed Tuesday that a third-country trial had been
discussed, ``but I don't know that it can be done.''
	   ``We've tried to find some way that has real integrity that will
work, but there are all kinds of practical difficulties,'' Clinton
said in Washington.

Asian shares end lower on Wall Street drop, uncertainty in Japan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets ended lower Wednesday on
uncertainty over Japan's political leadership and a 1.1 percent
drop overnight on Wall Street.
	   Tokyo stocks closed sharply lower on growing signs that Foreign
Minister Keizo Obuchi will be Japan's next prime minister, and on a
continued tumble in banking shares. The Nikkei average fell 263.63
points, or 1.6 percent, closing at 16,293.06.
	   Japanese media suggested Obuchi was close to sewing up Friday's
election for president of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. As
party president, he would become prime minister.
	   ``The market doesn't approve of Obuchi as the next prime
minister,'' said Kunihiro Hatae of Tokyo Securities. He said a
victory by Obuchi would indicate a triumph for factional party
politics and little change.
	   Comments by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on
Tuesday urging Japan to move ``expeditiously'' to address deep
problems in its banking sector weighed on bank stocks.
	   Foreign investors sold bank shares because they expected more
banking reforms. The Financial Supervisory Agency has started
investigating bad loans at Japan's 19 major banks, and all three
prime ministerial candidates have said that they would let weak
banks fail.
	   Hong Kong stocks ended lower, dragged down by the fall on Wall
Street and a weakening yen.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator of blue chips,
was down 143.83 points, or 1.7 percent, closing at 8,420.72.
	   Greenspan's testimony before Congress on Tuesday raised fears of
higher interest rates in the United States, traders said, prompting
investors to cash in after the index gained more than 450 points in
the past six sessions.
	   Elsewhere:
	   SEOUL: Share prices on the Korea Stock Exchange ended lower on
profit-taking after recent sharp advances. The benchmark KOSPI
Index was down 2.69 points, ending at 362.07.
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand shares finished lower, dragged down by a
drop on Wall Street and a fall in Fletcher Challenge Ltd.'s
building and energy division shares. The NZSE-40 Capital Index shed
28.89 points, ending at 2,128.39.
	   SYDNEY: Australian shares closed lower in response to Wall
Street. The All Ordinaries Index fell 20.40 points, closing at
2,767.50.
	   JAKARTA: Profit-taking on major blue chips depressed prices as
investors sold on Wall Street's overnight loss. The JSX index was
down 5.184 points, or 1.1 percent, ending at 483.055.
	   SINGAPORE: Shares closed mostly lower, reacting to Wall Street
and a slide in regional currencies. The Straits Times Industrial
Index was down 9.86 points, or 0.9 percent, ending at 1,052.66.
	   KUALA LUMPUR: A heavy sell-off in blue-chip stocks sent
Malaysia's key share index tumbling 3.6 percent as investors bailed
out on another fall in the ringgit. The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange
Composite Index fell 15.91 points to 421.91.
	   BANGKOK: Thai stocks ended lower after public banks and finance
companies posted disappointing first-half results. The Stock
Exchange of Thailand index fell 0.82 points, or 0.3 percent, to end
at 286.52.
	   TAIPEI: Taiwan shares ended lower for the second consecutive
session, following the U.S. market. The Weighted Price Index of the
Taiwan Stock Exchange closed down 68.14 points, or 0.85 percent, at
7,881.06.
	   MANILA: Philippine shares ended lower, dragged down by the
renewed weakness in Asian currencies against the U.S. dollar and
Wall Street's drop overnight. The PSE Index fell 30.90 points, or
1.8 percent, to 1,711.75.

Israeli warplanes attack guerrilla bases in south Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RASHAYA, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes struck suspected
guerrilla positions in southern Lebanon Wednesday, security
officials said.
	   Two Israeli jets swooped down on the hills between the towns of
Mashgara and Ein el-Tineh in the western Bekaa Valley, firing six
air-to-surface missiles, the Lebanese officials said. They spoke on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   There was no immediate word on casualties from the 1.30 p.m.
(10:30 GMT) raid.
	   An Israeli defense spokesman confirmed the attack and said
pilots reported accurate hits.
	   Thick black smoke could be seen billowing from the stricken
area, which is believed to be used by guerrillas of the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah as a base to launch attacks on Israeli
troops and their allied militiamen in a border enclave they occupy
in south Lebanon.
	   Wednesday's air raid came a day after Hezbollah guerrillas
killed an Israeli-allied militiaman and wounded two others in a
roadside bomb explosion on the edge of the occupied zone.
	   Hezbollah, or the Party of God, is leading a guerrilla war to
try to oust some 1,500 Israeli soldiers and the 2,500 members of
the Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army militia from the occupied
zone.
	   The zone was established by Israel in 1985 to shield its
northern towns against cross-border guerrilla incursions.

Thai rice farmers accuse American rice company of `biopiracy'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos BK103-104 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Chanting ``stop biopiracy,'' about 500
Thai rice farmers protested in front of the U.S. Embassy Wednesday,
demanding that the American government revoke a Texas-based
company's patent on a strain of rice similar to Thai jasmine rice.
	   About 60 Thai riot police stood guard in front of the embassy as
the blue-shirted farmers raised their fists and shouted ``chaiyo,''
or victory.
	   The farmers claimed that ``Jasmati'' rice, grown and marketed by
RiceTec Inc. of Alvin, Texas, fools consumers into buying a product
they believe is related to Thai jasmine rice.
	   The farmers, who came mostly from the poor northeast, said they
feared that the patent would allow the American company to tell
them they can't grow Thai jasmine rice.
	   ``Jasmine rice is ours,'' they chanted. ``America, don't steal
it.''
	   Thailand is the world's leading rice exporter. Its jasmine
fragrant rice is its highest-quality variety and is popular in many
markets around the world.
	   The American Embassy in Bangkok said no one is seeking to
prevent Thailand from growing or marketing its jasmine rice and
that no one is going to copyright the name jasmine rice.
	   Jasmati rice is a patented variety grown in the United States,
and was designed to combine the flavor and texture of Thai jasmine
rice and Indian Basmati rice, the embassy said.
	   ``Jasmati rice is actually derived from Italian, not Thai, rice
strains,'' said an embassy spokesman, who spoke only condition of
anonymity.
	   The protesters said the patent amounts to ``stealing the natural
resources and natural heritage'' of poor farmers in developing
countries.
	   The Agriculture Ministry has said RiceTec's Jasmati has no
genetic relation to Thai jasmine rice, but some officials, as well
as the rice farmers, believe RiceTec is misusing the jasmine name.

German on trial for premarital sex in Iran might be released on
</HEADLINE>
bail soon &QL; 
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ An Iranian court retrying a German man
sentenced to death for having sex with a local woman indicated
Wednesday that it will soon free him on bail, a source said.
	   The court said it would review ``in a positive light'' a bail
request by Helmut Hofer's lawyer, according to a source close to
the case who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   The bail will likely be set at 20 million rials (dlrs 6,667)
which the German embassy has agreed to pay, the source said.
	   Hofer was sentenced to death in January soon after his arrest
for having sex with a 26-year-old medical student. Iranian law
punishes sex between unmarried Muslim couples with flogging but if
the man is a non-Muslim, he faces the death penalty.
	   The justice ministry ordered a retrial after Hofer, 54,
contended that he converted to Islam before having sex with the
woman.
	   Hofer, a businessman, appeared in court Wednesday, the first
session of his retrial. The German ambassador Horst Baechmann, the
consul and a translator were also present.
	   The trial was closed to the public and the press. The court
adjourned till the end of August but no date for a second session
was set.
	   The embassy would not comment on the case.
	   Hofer told the court he is ready to marry the woman, which would
affect his case favorably, the source said.
	   Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi told reporters Wednesday he was
pleased that the case was being retried as it would help expand
relations with Germany.
	   ``We received a request from the German government which we
transferred to the judiciary and we are happy that the case is
being reviewed,'' he said.
	   ``But this is a case for the judiciary and is not political and
we have said this to the German government,'' Kharrazi added.
	   Bonn had warned Tehran that if Hofer is executed German-Iranian
relations would deteriorate. Germany is Iran's biggest trading
partner in the Europe Union.
	   While there is no evidence that the government has influenced
the decision to retry Hofer, President Mohammad Khatami, a moderate
who took office in August, is known to favor fewer death sentences
than previous presidents.

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Citing exhaustion, Czech tennis
player Jana Novotna withdrew from this weekend's Federation Cup
playoff against Italy, a newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   The daily Mlada Fronta Dnes said that Novotna, ranked second in
the world, will be replaced by Lenka Nemeckova, ranked 91 by the
World Tennis Association.
	   ``I'm very disappointed,'' the daily quoted Czech team coach
Frantisek Pala as saying.
	   Novotna, relaxing in Florida, said her difficult program in
recent weeks had exhausted her.
	   ``I had no time to rest,'' Mlada Fronta Dnes quoted her as
saying.
	   In the last six weeks, Novotna won three consecutive tournaments
and five titles, including her first Grand Slam title at Wimbledon.
	   Her withdrawal from the playoff will leave four inexperienced
players on the Czech team, and is likely to send the team from
World Group I to World Group II.

Police round up 40 Sri Lankans, 29 to be arraigned
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HENRY WASSWA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Twenty nine of 40 Sri Lankans detained in
Kampala were to be arraigned Wednesday on charges of working
illegally in Uganda.
	   Spokesman Bob Ngobi said the 40 were detained earlier this week
in a police sweep of the area which turned up 23 Sri Lankans living
in one house and 17 in another.
	   ``They say they came to Uganda to join their brothers and escape
harrassment at home,'' Ngobi said. ``They came from the northern
part of Sri Lanka, which is a rebel area, and they say they are
being looked at suspiciously by the government at home.''
	   Uganda has seen an enormous influx of Asians from India,
Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh since the government decided in
1993 to invite Asians expelled by former dictator Idi Amin in 1972
to return.
	   Uganda's economy crumbled after Amin forced out at least 80,000
Asians, most of them businessmen and traders, in a move that was
initially highly popular with Ugandan Africans. He handed over many
of the businesses and properties to his cronies.
	   Amin was ousted in 1979.
	   President Yoweri Museveni, who took power in 1986, has been
trying to lure the Ugandan Asians back to invest in the East
African nation.
	   But the policy has also attracted tens of thousands of
poverty-stricken Asians hoping to find work.
	   Ngobi said many illegal aliens come in to visit families living
in Uganda and then, finding work, outstay their visas or fail to
get work permits.
	   ``There is an increase in the number of illegal aliens from Asia
coming into this country,'' Ngobi said. ``Their visas may become
invalid with time once they fail to get employment or they may get
employment but fail to get work permits. This is where security and
immigration get them.''
	   Ngobi said there were also a large number of Pakistanis who
outstay their visas while trying to preach Islam.
	   Asian businessmen have complained that despite having invested
millions of dollars into businesses in Uganda, they are regularly
harrassed by police and authorities deny them permanent residency,
forcing them to renew their work permits every three years.

Officials defend inquiry into airport mess
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS chairman's appeal for more leeway, grafs 6-7 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The chairman of a special government commission
pledged Wednesday to conduct an open and impartial inquiry into the
problems of Hong Kong's new airport, summoning outside experts and
senior officials to testify if needed.
	   Justice Woo Kwok-hing, who also headed the commission overseeing
the May 24 legislative elections, told reporters that the
investigation would operate under the rules of a judicial inquiry.
	   ``We have the power to question a lot of people,'' Woo said,
adding that the commission hadn't discussed the possibility of
questioning Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa.
	   ``We understand that the community is looking forward to early
conclusion of our inquiry and then early implementation of
improvement measures. The commission will do everything possible to
achieve this objective,'' Woo said in a statement.
	   Critics have questioned the lack of outside experts on the
commission, the amount of time it will take to issue a report, and
whether it would be able to scrutinize independent contractors such
as the air cargo handler.
	   Woo appealed for greater leeway in conducting an impartial
inquiry, saying separate investigations to be carried out by the
government ombudsman and the legislature should not affect the
commission's findings.
	   ``I do not know what other inquiries are about ... (and) nobody
should make any comments on whether (the inquiry) is truthful or
not,'' Woo said.
	   Woo said the absence of outside experts would give the
commission greater flexibility in seeking opinions.
	   ``Even the experts can be put to the witness stand and
cross-examined,'' he said.
	   Woo also said the commission might take longer than six months
to wrap up the investigation of the new U.S. dlrs 20 billion Chek
Lap Kok airport.
	   Financial Secretary Donald Tsang told Hong Kong radio earlier
that the commission appointed by Tung, which also includes former
stock exchange chairman Edgar Cheng, might seek foreign expert
testimony, but that Hong Kong could not expect any overseas expert
to stay with it for the entire length of the study.
	   ``This is a judicial inquiry, and it has to do a very thorough
job, including taking evidence from a whole host of people: the
Airport Authority, the government officials, and there will be all
the franchisees involved,'' Tsang said.
	   Despite press reports Wednesday that a passenger had become
stuck in the airport's driverless people-mover and missed two
flights to London, most people agree that passenger services have
improved since the airport's opening on July 6.
	   However, cargo-handling problems are more serious. After
computer and mechanical breakdowns, the main cargo handler now says
it plans to be up to full speed at the new airport only at the end
of August.
	   Economists have warned that crimps in air cargo supplies could
lead to more layoffs. At 4.5 percent, Hong Kong's unemployment
already is at a 15-year high.
	   ``We have been disappointed, and we want to get to the bottom of
it,'' Tsang said.

Report: Slain Bahraini was intelligence agent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ A man found shot to death in a mountain
town was a Bahraini intelligence agent, news reports said
Wednesday. Bahrain dismissed the reports as false and astonishing.
	   An-Nahar and other newspapers reported that the body of a man
identified as Tawfik Abdel-Nabi al-Baharna was found Monday in the
mountain town of Beit Mery with a gunshot wound to his head and a
pistol in his left hand to imply that he committed suicide.
	   The state-run National News Agency said the victim was a
Bahraini security officer and apparently was on a mission to
monitor the activities of Bahraini opposition figures in Lebanon.
	   However, Bahrain rejected the claims.
	   Al-Baharna ``had no connection with state security or any other
official body in Bahrain,'' the country's official Gulf News Agency
said quoting a source. It, however, did not say what al-Baharna was
doing in Lebanon.
	   It said the source expressed ``deep astonishment'' at the NNA
report. The Bahraini ambassador in Lebanon is authorized to pursue
the ``false allegations'' with Lebanese authorities, it said.
	   The Lebanese Foreign Ministry also has instructed Lebanon's
ambassador to Bahrain, Zuhair Kazzaz, to follow up the case, NNA
said.
	   It quoted investigators as saying that al-Baharna had entered
Lebanon eight times using different names last year.
	   Al-Baharna, initially described as a tourist, was staying at a
Beit Mery hotel.
	   An-Nahar said preliminary investigations indicate that

Amount of bad credit card debt doubles in Singapore
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's deteriorating economy seems to be
putting the pinch on consumers, who are increasingly unable to
repay their credit card debts, according to government figures
released Wednesday.
	   A statement from the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the
country's de facto central bank, showed that the amount of bad
credit card debt written off by local banks rose sharply in the
second quarter.
	   From April to June, such bad debt jumped to 14.7 million
Singapore dollars (dlrs 8.6 million), or 0.8 percent of total
billings, double the percentage in the previous quarter.
	   In 1998's first three months, banks were forced to write off 7.8
million Singapore dollars (dlrs 4.6 million), or 0.4 percent of
total charges.
	   Rollover balance, another indication of whether consumers are
able to cope with their debt, also grew in the second quarter.
	   On June 31, such outstanding debt stood at about 1.1 billion
Singapore dollars (dlrs 637 million), compared to about 1 billion
Singapore dollars (dlrs 591 million) at the end of the first
quarter.
	   Bad credit card debt has been growing since 1996, according to
past figures and media reports.
	   Fearing a trend of increasingly irresponsible purchasing on
credit, the monetary authority imposed limits in early 1996 on the
amount a cardholder could charge before repayment.
	   The credit line was capped at two months' salary for all cards
from the same bank. Prior to that measure, cardholders could spend
up to two months' salary on each card held.
	   Despite the current economic uncertainties, total credit card
charges have not dropped, however.
	   In the latest quarter, local cardholders' charged about 1.92
billion Singapore dollars (dlrs 1.12 billion), up from 1.84 billion
Singapore dollars (dlrs 1.08 billion) in the previous quarter.

Tajik president says U.N. observers killed by `traitors'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Rakhmonov ousting officials in new 4th graf. &QL; 
 &UR; By UMED BABAKHANOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) _ Tajikistan's president said
Wednesday that four United Nations workers were killed by
``traitors'' intent on undermining the country's fragile peace
process.
	   President Emomali Rakhmonov stopped short of directly blaming
former guerrilla fighters for Tuesday's killings of the U.N.
military observers. But he claimed that militants had previously
threatened U.N. personnel in the mountainous Central Asian nation.
	   The president announced that a special government commission had
been set up to find and punish the attackers, and he offered his
condolences in a meeting with Jan Kubis, the U.N. special
representative to Tajikistan.
	   Rakhmonov also sacked two deputy defense ministers and
reprimanded several top officials for the failure to prevent the
attack. He ordered an increase in protection for U.N. workers in
Tajikistan.
	   The four U.N. workers were ambushed Tuesday while on a regular
patrol trip about 90 miles (144 kilometers) east of the capital
Dushanbe. All were shot in the the head, Kubis said.
	   About 70 U.N. observers are stationed in Tajikistan to monitor
last year's peace deal that ended five years of civil war in the
former Soviet republic. Kubis said Wednesday he had recalled all
U.N. field teams to Dushanbe pending the outcome of the
investigation.
	   Kubis told a news conference that the U.N. workers were killed
near the village of Labidzhar while traveling a distance of 10
kilometers (six miles) between a government checkpoint and an
opposition position.
	   The main opposition alliance issued a statement condemning the
shootings. It said the U.N. workers were killed after they met the
opposition commander in the Tavildara region, and were heading for
the government-controlled Garm region.
	   Despite last year's peace accord, Tajikistan remains restive.
There are periodic clashes between the hard-line government and the
mostly Islamic opposition. Also, there are numerous warlords who do
not recognize the peace deal and wage turf battles with one
another.
	   Tajik officials initially claimed that the U.N. observers had
died when their car plunged off a cliff in the Pamir Mountains. But
later they confirmed the U.N. report of an ambush.
	   The four U.N. workers were: Maj. Ryszard Szcwczyk of Poland;
Maj. Adolfo Sharpegue of Uruguay; civil affairs officer Yutaka
Akino of Japan and a Tajik translator, Jourajon Mahramov.
	   Tuesday's attack was not the first time U.N. workers have been
targeted in Tajikistan.
	   Bakhrom Sadirov, a rebel warlord, kidnapped 23 people in
December 1996 and 16 people in February 1997. In both cases, most
of the hostages were U.N. workers. All were released unharmed after
the government freed some of Sadirov's supporters.

Customs officials intercept Viagra shipments
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Customs officials are hunting
throughout the Netherlands for bottles of Viagra, illegally
imported to satisfy a growing demand for the impotency pill.
	   Dozens of packages containing the drug have been found at postal
sorting offices in recent weeks, Dutch daily De Telegraaf reported
Wednesday. The drug has yet to be approved for sale in the
Netherlands.
	   Customs spokesman Peter Mulder said his officers already have a
``black book'' of illegal Viagra importers. ``We discover a
shipment almost every day,'' he said. ``Anyone can order a pot of
pills from America via the Internet.''
	   Last week a routine check at Eindhoven airport uncovered 4,500
pills, which sell for up to 30 guilders (dlrs 15) each. The pills
were being sent from a German company to a pharmacy in the southern
city of Venlo.
	   Another 50,000 guilders (dlrs 25,000) worth of pills were
discovered during a search of the pharmacy. Customs at Amsterdam's
Schiphol airport also regularly intercepts packages containing the
pill.
	   Viagra, made by U.S. company Pfizer Inc., is expected to be
given European Union approval in September, Dutch health ministry
spokesman Richard Lancee said. If it is approved, the drug will be
available in the Netherlands only by prescription.

	   SALONICA, Greece (AP) _ Authorities sought Wednesday to track
down other members of an alleged antiquities smuggling ring
following the discovery of a cache of objects used in burials up to
2,500 years old.
	   Three men were arrested Tuesday after 43 ancient earthenware
objects were found in a car bound for Kerdylia, about 65 kilometers
(40 miles) northeast of Salonica, police said.
	   The objects, vessels and small urns, were used for funeral rites
from the 3rd to 5th centuries B.C.
	   Authorities were seeking the alleged ringleader of the smuggling
network.

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Thirty people, at least half of them
children, were confirmed dead and up to 45 missing following late
Monday's flash floods in northeast Slovakia, a rescue team official
said Wednesday.
	   ``The number of victims is hardly final,'' said Jaroslav Timko,
spokesman for the rescue team in the Presov region.
	   He said most of the victims were from a Roma settlement near the
village Jarovnice, consisting of shacks built by one of the rivers
that went over its bank.
	   Timko said water sources in the entire area were contaminated,
so special trucks were delivering water to people.
	   The Ministry of Labor asked regional employers to pay those
employees who are taking time off to repair houses damaged by
floodwater, Slovak radio reported.
	   Total damage caused by the floodwater has not yet been
estimated. The government-appointed flood commission was expected
to meet in Bratislava later Wednesday and may provide information
on the extent of damage afterward.

	   CALCUTTA, India (AP) _ A cricket bat autographed by sports icon
Sir Donald Bradman has fetched dlrs 12,000 in an auction of cricket
memorabilia, with the proceeds going towards a home for children of
lepers.
	   The auction was organized and conducted by Australian cricket
captain Steve Waugh Tuesday night to raise money to help the Udayan
charity build a girls' wing for the home it now runs for boys in
Barrackpore, just outside Calcutta.
	   The bidding for the bat started at 25,000 rupees, or about dlrs
600, but quickly shot up to 300,000 rupees (dlrs 8,000). A local
businessman who heads a government-run factory finally won the bid
at 500,000 rupees (dlrs 12,000).
	   Bradman, who leads a reclusive life in Australia, is
acknowledged as the best batsman to have played the game, finishing
his career in 1946 with an unequaled average of 99.94.
	   Another bat signed by the entire Australian team sold for dlrs
5,000 and a ball signed by the Waugh brothers, Shane and Steve, and
by leg spinner Shane Warne fetched dlrs 5,000.
	   ``Its simply great,'' said Waugh after the auction. ``All these
efforts will go a long way to make our dreams ... a success.''
	   Earlier in Australia, Waugh raised dlrs 25,000 to build the
girls' home. The Canterbury Rugby League Club donated another dlrs
10,000.
	   The children, often shunned by a society that still fears
leprosy, cannot live with their parents for fear they will contract
the disease.
	   Waugh's interest in the project began when Shamlu Dudeja, an
Udayan volunteer, left a note about her organization at Waugh's
hotel when the Australians were in Calcutta during a match in
April. To her surprise, not only did Waugh call, he agreed to visit
Udayan.
	   Indian television showed Waugh displaying his batting style to
older boys on a weedy pitch in this eastern Indian city, signing
autographs and bouncing little ones on his lap.
	   Udayan, which means ``new sunrise'' in Bengali, was founded in
1970 by Englishman John Gregory Stevens. It is funded mostly from
the royalties of French writer Dominque Lapierre, author of ``City
of Joy.''

England turns to experience and youth in desperation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NOTTINGHAM, England (AP) _ Robert Croft _ a hero when he batted
gamely to salvage a draw for England in the third cricket test
against South Africa _ was axed Wednesday from the England team for
the fourth test.
	   England, trailing 1-0 in the five match series, will only use
one spinner for the Trent Bridge test starting Thursday and Croft's
inability to take wickets this series has cost him his place.
	   In search of some inspiration, England selectors selected leg
spinner Ian Salisbury among a host of new and recalled players in a
bid to provide bowling breakthroughs and batting strength.
	   Batsman Graeme Hick has been recalled, while left-arm medium
pace bowler Alan Mullally and big-hitting Lancashire all-rounder
Andrew Flintoff have also been added to the England team.
	   The inclusion of Hick might add strength to the fragile England
batting, but his ability against quality fast bowling _ Allan
Donald and Shaun Pollock _ could have an unbalancing effect at the
same time.
	   Hick, 33, a 46-test veteran, gets his first recall after two
years to fill the batting position made vacant by the injured
Graham Thorpe.
	   ``I feel this is a fresh start because I have changed my
attitude and approach to the game,'' Hick said at training
Wednesday.
	   ``I don't feel as anxious and uptight about playing for England
as I have done in the past.''
	   Flintoff, 20, could go in at No.7 for England which would force
selectors to choose between two bowlers _ most likely Alan Mullally
or Angus Fraser.
	   The recall of 28-year-old Salisbury, who played against Pakistan
two summers ago, would indicate England is clinging to the belief
that the South Africans are vulnerable to leg spin.
	   However, South African coach Bob Woolmer said his team was not
susceptible to leg-spin.
	   ``We have played enough cricket against India, Pakistan and
Australia in the last year or so, so I can't see him (Salisbury)
being a threat,'' Woolmer said.
	   ``He can't be better than Shane Warne or Mushtaq Ahmed or Anil
Kumble,'' Woolmer added.
	   Mike Atherton, who suffered a bruised right thumb while batting
for Lancashire on Monday, and Mark Ramprakash (tonsillitis) trained
without any problem Wednesday.
	   South Africa has its share of injury concerns with Lance
Klusener undergoing surgery in Pretoria on the ankle injury he
sustained during the third test at Old Trafford and fast bowler
Makhaya Ntini nursing an injury.
	   However, Shaun Pollock has recovered from the quadriceps strain
which ruled him out of the third test and will add some fire power
to the Proteas batting and bowling attack.
	   South Africa is expected to wait until just before the toss on
Thursday to decide on the fitness of Makhaya Ntini.
	   Peter Pollock, South Africa's convenor of selectors, joined the
tour party this week, but hasn't decided on a replacement for
Klusener.
	   ``The guys on tour are the best we have,'' he said. ``That's why
they were selected in the first place. There's no cause for
panic.''
	   Peter Pollock, father of paceman Shaun, played a major role in
South Africa's triumph over England at Trent Bridge in 1965 when he
took a 10-wicket haul for the match.

Weekly: Baghdad court sentences four to death
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A Baghdad court has sentenced four men to
death for allegedly breaking into 30 houses in a wealthy Baghdad
neighborhood, a weekly magazine reported Wednesday.
	   Al-I'Lam published pictures of the four men and identified them
with their names. It did not say when the sentences were passed or
whether the four men have the right to appeal.
	   Iraq's state-controlled media rarely publish crime stories or
give names of criminals except when the crimes are considered very
serious.
	   The weekly said the four concentrated their burglaries in
Zayouna, a district mainly inhabited by army officers in the heart
of the capital.
	   Al-I'Lam did not say when and how the death sentence will be
administered.
	   Widespread poverty spawned during the last eight years of U.N.
economic sanctions has been blamed for a dramatic rise in crime in
Iraq, once one of the safest places in the Middle East.

Resistance leader vows to keep fighting after Cambodian elections

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The general commanding troops loyal
to Cambodia's deposed co-premier said Wednesday they will keep
fighting if their nemesis, strongman Hun Sen, wins elections this
weekend.
	   Gen. Nhek Bunchhay has been commanding the resistance troops
since Prince Norodom Ranariddh was deposed in a bloody takeover by
Hun Sen last year. His forces have been battling government troops
in recent days after months of calm.
	   If his troops still are viewed as ``outlaws'' after the
parliamentary vote Sunday, in which Ranariddh is running, ``we will
continue to fight. ... I'm not going to step back,'' he said.
	   ``I know Hun Sen will continue to try to wipe us out,'' Nhek
Bunchhay said. ``But I believe my rebellion will not die.''
	   Nhek Bunchhay said Hun Sen's commanders were using artillery and
had sent 100 more troops to the front Wednesday, bringing the total
to 500 against his 200 men. The fighting erupted Saturday in a
village north of the border crossing to Thailand at Poipet, 335
kilometers (220 miles) northwest of Phnom Penh.
	   Nhek Bunchhay accused the government of violating a cease-fire
reached in March that was a vital part of the diplomatic peace plan
that enabled Ranariddh to return from exile to contest the
elections. But unlike the prince, Nhek Bunchhay was given no
amnesty by Hun Sen's government and his position after the vote is
uncertain.
	   Government commanders have blamed the new fighting on Nhek
Bunchhay. Gen. Ke Kim Yan, army chief of staff, told reporters that
the resistance troops had attacked Baray village Saturday after
learning that election materials were due to arrive in the town.
	   Ke Kim Yan added that the government learned of the plot and
delayed plans to deliver the election materials. He accused Nhek
Bunchhay of ``opportunism.''
	   ``The royal government has no reason to launch any military
offensive,'' Ke Kim Yan said, adding that only 10 or 20 rebel
soldiers were involved in the fighting, not 200. ``Its goal now is
to hold elections.''
	   A Thai military officer, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said that unofficial Thai support for Nhek Bunchhay's forces could
end after the vote if the result is recognized as free and fair by
the international community. Until now, Thailand has regarded the
general as a legal officer serving a prime minister recognized by
the Thai government.
	   Nhek Bunchhay expressed confidence that he could continue the
struggle.
	   ``We will not be totally isolated like the Khmer Rouge,'' Nhek
Bunchhay said of the guerrillas who also oppose Hun Sen and have
occasionally fought alongside his forces, though he denies it. ``We
are going to be rebels with honor.''
	   Nhek Bunchhay said he hoped to get supplies from Cambodians
living in the United States or from the American government, which
has been an outspoken critic of Hun Sen's takeover.

Reuters earnings hurt by Asia, currency rates
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Reuters Group PLC said Wednesday its half-year
profits slipped 3 percent to 294 million pounds (dlrs 491 million)
as the Asian crisis and unfavorable currency rates took their toll.
	   The results at Reuters for the six months ending June 30
compared with restated earnings of 303 million pounds during the
first half of 1997.
	   The chief executive of the financial information and news
provider, Peter Job, said that despite ``adverse conditions in many
markets,'' the Reuters profits would have been 9 percent higher if
exchange rates had held steady.
	   Revenues at Reuters rose 3 percent to 1.45 billion pounds (dlrs
2.43 billion) for the half-year just ended, compared with 1.41
billion pounds a year earlier.
	   Like virtually all British multinationals, Reuters saw overseas
profits hurt by the strength of sterling. Despite those currency
woes and more troubles in Asia, Job predicted ``a satisfactory
underlying performance for the full year.''
	   Reuters handed out 1.5 billion pounds (dlrs 2.5 billion) to
shareholders in February and said it had increased its global staff
by 3 percent to 16,699 in the first half of the year.
	   ``We continue to advance despite adverse conditions in many
markets,'' Job said in a statement.
	   ``The business climate continues to be extremely challenging.
The fall-out from the financial crisis in Asia has begun to spread
to other time zones as Japanese clients scale back their overseas
operations. We are also seeing a retrenchment of European-based
banks in the United States.''
	   Reuters shares were little changed, up 1 penny (1.6 U.S. cents)
at 632 pence (dlrs 10.37) by midafternoon on the London Stock
Exchange.

President spells out terms for reunification, urges more
</HEADLINE>
cooperation &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNIE HUANG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui on Wednesday
countered China's growing diplomatic clout with his most specific
policy statement to date on reunification, urging more cooperation
between the foes to narrow their differences.
	   ``China must be reunified,'' Lee said in a policy statement.
``However, this reunification must be under a system of democracy,
freedom and equitable prosperity that will safeguard the rights and
interests of all Chinese.''
	   He urged China not to press his island of 21 million people too
hard for reunification.
	   ``Reunification of China should proceed in a gradual and orderly
fashion,'' Lee told the annual meeting of the National Unification
Council, a consultative body formed six years ago. ``When
conditions are ripe, success will come naturally.''
	   Lee's insistence on reunification only under democratic
conditions is nothing new. But the pledge, showing greater
sincerity, could please Beijing, which has long accused Lee of
making covert efforts toward independence.
	   The comments came amid indications that Taiwan is preparing for
talks with China on political issues. The president apparently was
reacting to a perception that China is gaining international
support for its effort to isolate Taiwan. That concern grew during
U.S. President Bill Clinton's trip to China.
	   For the first time for a U.S. president, Clinton publicly stated
U.S. policy that it would not support Taiwan's independence or
membership in organizations such as the United Nations.
	   Taiwan is governed by the Nationalists, who fled to the island
in 1949 after being swept out of the Chinese mainland by Mao
Tse-tung's Communists. The two sides were bitter enemies for
decades. China regards Taiwan as a renegade province and reserves
the right to retake it by force.
	   The two, however, recently started moving slowly toward resuming
dialogue that Beijing froze three years ago. Taiwan has wanted the
dialogue to pick up where it left off by focusing on practical
matters such as trade and fishing disputes, but there are
indications it may agree to China's demand for political talks.
	   Lee tried to underscore Taiwan's advantage as a full-fledged
democracy, and sought to ease public concerns that the United
States, Taiwan's greatest ally, was tilting toward Beijing.
	   He called for an improvement in Taiwan-U.S. relations as the
United States improves its ties with China to ensure peace and
prosperity in the Asian-Pacific region.
	   Chang King-yu, chairman of the government Mainland Affairs
Council, urged Taiwanese to have the ``psychological and
substantive readiness'' for political negotiations, and prepare
themselves to fulfill any agreements they reach.
	   Taiwan's top negotiator with China, Koo Chen-fu, plans to visit
China in September to prepare for a formal session with his Chinese
counterpart. The two last met in Singapore in 1993.
	   On Friday, Li Yafei, a deputy secretary-general of the Chinese
Association on Relations across the Taiwan Strait, a semi-official
body for negotiations with Taiwan, will visit the island.
	   Also Wednesday, about 200 activists demonstrated outside the
Foreign Ministry building to demand scrapping the guidelines on
unification that the council drafted, saying they ignore the wish
of many Taiwanese for independence from China.
	   Some tossed paint balls at the building as they demanded a
referendum on Taiwan's future.

Georgia to delay decision on whether Russian peacekeepers should
</HEADLINE>
stay &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ The mandate for Russian peacekeepers in
Georgia runs out this month, but the government said it had not yet
decided whether it wants to keep the troops to monitor a breakaway
region.
	   Georgia has accused the Russian peacekeepers of being too
sympathetic to the separatists in Abkhazia during fighting in May
between the separatists and militia groups that support Georgian
central government.
	   Georgia's Security Council is expected to review the May clashes
at a July 30 meeting, and afterward a decision will be made about
whether the peacekeepers should stay or leave, said Georgian
Foreign Minister Irakly Menagarishvili.
	   The Georgians have often said that they want the Russian
peacekeepers to advance into a larger area of Abkhazia _ or pull
out of Georgia altogether.
	   ``Our position will be determined after the Security Council
gives an assessment of the latest events in the conflict zone,''
the foreign minister said.
	   Abkhazia, a Black Sea province in northwest Georgia, declared
independence in 1992. The separatists drove out Georgian troops and
ethnic Georgian civilians in a 13-month war.
	   Violence has broken about sporadically since then, despite the
presence of Russian peacekeepers in the region.

Observers move into countryside; 95,000 security forces to deploy

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The army chief of staff said
Wednesday that 95,000 security personnel will be deployed around
Cambodia to assure voter safety in parliamentary elections that
have been preceded by a violence-marred campaign.
	   Hundreds of foreign election observers fanned out into the
countryside, but the opposition said they weren't nearly enough to
stop intimidation and a fraudulent victory by strongman Hun Sen.
	   Gen. Ke Kim Yan told reporters that 95,000 police, military
police and soldiers will assure security for Sunday's vote.
Five-man plainclothes teams will be stationed at each of the 11,600
polling stations, with only one rifle between them to appear less
intimidating.
	   But for many Cambodians, the presence of the security personnel
could prove frightening, since they are controlled by Hun Sen and
members of the police have been accused of violence and
intimidation against opposition figures.
	   Cambodians fear that if the vote goes against Hun Sen, he would
use the army to retain power. Hun Sen has pledged to transfer power
peacefully, but memories remain fresh of fighting he unleashed last
year to depose his co-premier, Prince Norodom Ranariddh.
	   Gen. Nhek Bunchhay, who has led a few hundred soldiers loyal to
Ranariddh in a resistance movement, said Wednesday that his men
would continue fighting if Hun Sen wins the elections.
	   A cease-fire observed by both sides for several months has been
broken by fighting since Saturday near the Thai border. Each side
accuses the other of starting it.
	   Election watchdog and human rights groups held a seminar for
high-ranking police and urged them to stay neutral. About 60 police
officers attended, but 50 invited members from the military police
did not.
	   Glenys Kinnock, head of the European Union's observer mission,
said the National Election Committee had responded to her
complaints over dubious accreditation given to most of the 60,000
Cambodian observers believed to come from obscure, Hun Sen-linked
groups.
	   The NEC, itself packed with Hun Sen supporters, said it would
try to weed out the questionable observers by voting day, Kinnock
said.
	   It will also grant free access to 16,000 members of three
well-regarded independent groups, who had previously lacked
accreditation, to all polling stations. Kinnock, who will assess
whether the elections are credible for the EU, insisted on their
participation.
	   About 650 foreign observers are being coordinated by the United
Nations, but apart from fleets of new vehicles, their activity is a
dim shadow of the operation mounted by the temporary U.N.
administration in 1993 to bring peace and democracy to a country
devastated by decades of war and the Khmer Rouge genocide.
	   ``In five years, we've gone from (the U.N.) spending dlrs 3
billion and deploying 20,000 peacekeepers to the election being
taken charge of by the Cambodians themselves and the international
community being invited to provide technical support,'' said
Marie-Ange Lescure, spokeswoman for the European Union delegation.
	   Hun Sen has invited the observers to win international
endorsement for the election, hoping to regain legitimacy and
foreign aid lost when he deposed Ranariddh, whose royalist
FUNCINPEC party won the 1993 elections but was forced to share
power when Hun Sen threatened civil war.
	   The standard for an acceptable election has divided the
international community. The United States, which has already
served notice that violence has hopelessly marred the process, has
said it will render a separate verdict from the final U.N.
statement likely to be dominated by the EU, which is setting less
stringent conditions.
	   The prince, campaigning in a province where a party activist was
reported murdered Saturday, called the level of violence
``acceptable'' compared to 1993, when the Khmer Rouge still
numbered thousands of guerrillas.
	   The movement is nearly extinct following mass defections and the
loss of its last major stronghold, Anlong Veng, in April. But a
raid near Anlong Veng against a convoy of election workers last
week killed two people and showed the guerrillas can still mount
attacks.
	   The NEC said security has been beefed up and that all 11 polling
stations will remain open. They will serve some 5,000 guerrilla
defectors, most voting for the first time in their lives.
	   The Khmer Rouge caused the deaths of as many as 2 million people
between 1975 and 1979.

Tajik president says U.N. observers killed by `traitors'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS day that killings occurred to Monday, sted of
Tuesday, in grafs 2, 5. &QL; 
 &UR; By UMED BABAKHANOV &QC;

<TEXT>
	   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) _ Tajikistan's president said
Wednesday that four United Nations workers were killed by
``traitors'' intent on undermining the country's fragile peace
process.
	   President Emomali Rakhmonov stopped short of directly blaming
former guerrilla fighters for Monday's killings of the U.N.
military observers. But he claimed that militants had previously
threatened U.N. personnel in the mountainous Central Asian nation.
	   The president announced that a special government commission had
been set up to find and punish the attackers, and he offered his
condolences in a meeting with Jan Kubis, the U.N. special
representative to Tajikistan.
	   Rakhmonov also sacked two deputy defense ministers and
reprimanded several top officials for the failure to prevent the
attack. He ordered an increase in protection for U.N. workers in
Tajikistan.
	   The four U.N. workers were ambushed Monday while on a regular
patrol trip about 90 miles (144 kilometers) east of the capital
Dushanbe. All were shot in the the head, Kubis said.
	   About 70 U.N. observers are stationed in Tajikistan to monitor
last year's peace deal that ended five years of civil war in the
former Soviet republic. Kubis said Wednesday he had recalled all
U.N. field teams to Dushanbe pending the outcome of the
investigation.
	   Kubis told a news conference that the U.N. workers were killed
near the village of Labidzhar while traveling a distance of 10
kilometers (six miles) between a government checkpoint and an
opposition position.
	   The main opposition alliance issued a statement condemning the
shootings. It said the U.N. workers were killed after they met the
opposition commander in the Tavildara region, and were heading for
the government-controlled Garm region.
	   Despite last year's peace accord, Tajikistan remains restive.
There are periodic clashes between the hard-line government and the
mostly Islamic opposition. Also, there are numerous warlords who do
not recognize the peace deal and wage turf battles with one
another.
	   Tajik officials initially claimed that the U.N. observers had
died when their car plunged off a cliff in the Pamir Mountains. But
later they confirmed the U.N. report of an ambush.
	   The four U.N. workers were: Maj. Ryszard Szcwczyk of Poland;
Maj. Adolfo Sharpegue of Uruguay; civil affairs officer Yutaka
Akino of Japan and a Tajik translator, Jourajon Mahramov.
	   The attack was not the first time U.N. workers have been
targeted in Tajikistan.
	   Bakhrom Sadirov, a rebel warlord, kidnapped 23 people in
December 1996 and 16 people in February 1997. In both cases, most
of the hostages were U.N. workers. All were released unharmed after
the government freed some of Sadirov's supporters.

Fires race through Athens suburbs

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A fast-moving brush fire scorched the edge
of Athens Wednesday, sending towering plumes of smoke over the city
from a blackened mountainside.
	   The blaze, which appeared to have started in a pine forest on
the Imittos mountain east of the city center, was fanned by gale
force winds that reached 75 kilometers (47 miles) an hour.
	   Some bombs and shells left from World War II exploded from the
flames, which were generally pushed away from populated areas. But
the fire destroyed a large tract of one of the last wooded groves
on the mountain.
	   Aircraft dropped water on the parched scrub land and forest, but
it failed to halt the advance of the flames. No injuries were
reported, local media said.
	   In neighborhoods at the base of the mountain, firefighters were
assisted by local residents with garden hoses.
	   Meanwhile, other brush fires burned in the southern seaside
suburbs of Saronida and Lagonisi, forcing the evacuation of at
least one children's summer camp, media reports said. At least two
warehouses and an evacuated apartment building were burned.
	   A military Chinook helicopter assisted firefighters on the
ground, but strong winds prevented any firefighting planes from
battling the blaze.
	   Another large brush fire was reported on the island of
Zakinthos, about 250 kilometers (160 miles) west of Athens.
	   Wildfires are common during the hot and dry summers in Greece.
But this season has been called one of the most devastating in
decades.

Six killed in fighting between East and West Timor villagers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Indonesia-East Timor &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Six people were killed when rival
villagers, living on opposite sides of the border between East and
West Timor, attacked each other with knives and spears, police said
Wednesday.
	   Hundreds of people from Nemo village in East Timor crossed the
border Monday and attacked Builalu village in West Timor.
	   The assault was apparently in revenge for the killing last week
of an East Timorese man at a party in Builalu.
	   Animosity between the two groups worsened when Builalu villagers
refused to hand over the dead man's body.
	   ``The fighting between the two villages had no political
motives. It was merely a misunderstanding between the people of the
two villages,'' a local police chief, Maj. Budi Susilo, said.
	   Politically motivated violence is common in East Timor, where
separatist guerrillas have been fighting a war against Indonesian
rule for more than two decades.
	   Indonesia invaded East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, from
West Timor in 1975.
	   Peace negotiations involving the United Nations are currently
under way.
	   Timor island lies about 2,000 kilometers (1,200 miles) east of
Jakarta.

Netanyahu denies reports of secret negotiations with Syria
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to UPDATE with parliament giving preliminary approval
to a bill that would require a Golan withdrawal to be approved in a
referendum &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Parliament on Wednesday gave preliminary
approval to a bill stipulating that the government must hold a
referendum on any decision to withdraw from the Golan Heights.
	   Critics warned that the legislation, which is supported by some
members of the dovish opposition, will make it even more difficult
to negotiate a peace agreement with Syria. Negotiations between
Israel and Syria were suspended in February 1996.
	   The bill also stipulates that a special majority of 61 members
of the 120-seat parliament must approve a Golan pullback. The
legislation was submitted by the Third Way, a party staunchly
opposed to a troop withdrawal from the strategic heights Israel
captured from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanuyahu, meanwhile, denied Wednesday
that he was engaged in secret peace talks with Syria.
	   Netanyahu responded to reports that Cabinet hawk Ariel Sharon
warned Golan settlers that the prime minister was secretly
negotiating an Israeli pullback from the strategic plateau.
	   Netanyahu said such negotiations were impossible as long as
Syrian President Hafez Assad insisted that Israel first commit in
principle to a withdrawal from all of the Golan.
	   ``We have sent many messages to Assad from all possible
directions that if he wants negotiations, and we are prepared for
them, Syria must back down from the preconditions it has set,''
Netanyahu told Israel radio.
	   ``There is a difference of opinion between us. They want us to
leave the Golan Heights and we don't want to,'' Netanyahu said.
	   Israeli media speculated Wednesday that Sharon, who is on a
visit to China, may have made the allegations in hopes of
pressuring the Third Way which, while being hawkish on the Golan
issue, advocates territorial compromise with the Palestinians.
	   In recent days, the Third Way has threatened to bring down the
government unless Netanyahu reached agreement with the Palestinians
by next week on a troop withdrawal from 13 percent of the West
Bank. Sharon staunchly opposes such a pullback, saying it would
endanger Israel's security.
	   In a meeting with Golan settler leaders last week, Sharon
reportedly said that by pushing for a 13 percent withdrawal, the
Third Way was unwittingly paving the way for a Golan withdrawal.
	   Netanyahu is holding secret talks with the Syrians, and once a
West Bank pullback is out of the way, the Golan would be next,
Sharon reportedly told the Golan settlers.

China orders end to subsidized housing, but leaves timing open
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China has ordered an end to subsidized housing
but, mindful of growing unemployment and other social strains, is
letting local governments decide the timing, state media reported
Wednesday.
	   In a directive issued Tuesday, the State Council, China's
Cabinet, ordered housing subsidies phased out, forcing employees of
government offices and state businesses to purchase their homes,
the Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   The move ends a program of subsidized housing almost as old as
the 49-year reign of the Communist Party and has been expected
since Premier Zhu Rongji announced a new housing policy at his
inaugural news conference in March.
	   But resistance by local authorities and worries that slashing
subsidies would exacerbate ill feeling among urbanites already
beset by rising layoffs and tighter welfare payments forced Zhu's
government to relent on a midyear deadline for housing reform.
	   Authorities will be allowed to implement the policy ``in
accordance with local situations,'' Xinhua said.
	   Under the government plan, individuals will pay up to 30 percent
for an apartment out of their own pockets. The rest will come from
housing funds set aside by their employers and bank mortgages. The
poor will still be eligible for subsidies.
	   China wants to privatize housing to get people to spend some of
the 5 trillion yuan (dlrs 602 billion) they have in banks and free
money-losing state factories and government departments from
welfare commitments left over from the era of central planning.
	   Subsidized housing, health care, education and pensions eat up
huge chunks of state industries' budgets, hampering efforts to
modernize them to compete in an increasingly capitalist-style free
market.
	   Many insolvent state businesses are also unwilling to sell off
land and housing, among their most valuable assets.

2002 World Cup may be rescheduled to avoid rainy season
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with FIFA reaction in 10th graf bgng, `In Geneva,
FIFA...' &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ The 2002 World Cup may have to be
rescheduled to avoid the usual June-July rainy season in Japan and
South Korea, South Korea's top soccer official said Wednesday.
	   The World Cup finals have traditionally been held in June and
July, avoiding pro league schedules in Europe and South America.
But Japan and South Korea think that schedule should be changed in
2002 to avoid the rains.
	   Japan and South Korea are co-hosts of the 2002 World Cup,
soccer's first premier event to be held in Asia.
	   ``The rescheduling is an urgent matter that should be decided on
by the end of this year at the latest,'' Chung Moon-joon, head of
the (South) Korean Football Association, said at a luncheon meeting
with local journalists.
	   Chung, a vice president representing Asia in soccer's governing
body, FIFA, suggested that the 2002 World Cup finals be rescheduled
for September.
	   He noted that the 1998 Summer Olympics in Seoul were held in
September and that the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo were staged in
October.
	   When the issue was unofficially raised at a FIFA executive
meeting in Paris in June, Chung said he understood that most
members showed support for the suggested rescheduling.
	   ``This year, as usual, Japan and South Korea had much rain
during the World Cup in France,'' he said. This year's World Cup
was held from June 10 to July 12.
	   Chung said changing the schedule will not be easy, because it
will require agreement from all major national soccer committees
and clubs in Europe and South America, which virtually control
FIFA.
	   In Geneva, FIFA spokesman Andreas Herren said the governing body
had not been officially informed yet of the proposal, and that it
still was too early to discuss it.
	   Chung also said he still wants North Korea to share two or three
of the 32 World Cup matches South Korea will stage in 2002. The
other 32 matches will be played in Japan.
	   North Korea so far has taken no official stand on the proposed
sharing, suggested by South Korea and endorsed by FIFA last year.
	   ``I think the important thing for now is that North Korea should
try to build trust by taking part in regional friendship
tournaments or inter-Korea goodwill matches,'' Chung said.

Commission stands by 1994 decision on Air France state aid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Commission on Wednesday
stood by its 1994 decision to allow the French government to pour
20 billion French francs (dlrs 3.3 billion) into Air France, a
month after a European court declared the aid illegal.
	   By a majority vote, the European Union's executive body agreed
it would not reconsider the decision it took four years ago, but
would provide detailed information in two areas where the court
found the Commission had been too lax.
	   ``We have not changed the argument, we have provided reasoning
at length,'' Transport Commissioner Neil Kinnock told a news
conference.
	   ``For us to assess the 1994 situation and come to a different
decision now would be absurd,'' he said. ``Canceling the aid is
neither feasible in law nor in practice.''
	   Last month, the European Court of First Instance, the arm of the
Court of Justice that deals with competition cases, declared the
Commission's decision to approve the aid for Air France void.
	   The court's ruling was a victory for rival airlines who had
argued the aid violated EU competition rules. The airlines were
British Airways, British Midlands Airways, Dutch flag carrier KLM
and SAS, which is jointly owned by Norway, Sweden and Denmark.
	   The court agreed with the plaintiffs on two points - that the
use of some of the funds by Air France to buy 17 new aircraft was
unjustified, and that the Commission failed to investigate the
negative impact the aid would have on routes outside the European
Union, particularly transatlantic routes.
	   The court did not question the Commission's decision as a whole,
Kinnock said. ``I am absolutely confident that the proposal we have
today will satisfy the requirements of the court,'' he added.
	   The Commission authorized the aid because it hoped the money
would help develop European air transport. Its conditions included
assurances that Air France would neither acquire new aircraft,
merge with its Air Inter unit nor open any new routes within Europe
for three years.
	   Furthermore, the airline was to restructure and return to
profitability by 1996.
	   ``The outcome of the aid for Air France has been positive,''
Kinnock said. He said the airline had cut 9,000 jobs, reduced
operational costs by 21 percent and is on the edge of being
substantially privatized.
	   He said that other airlines, including Ireland's Aer Lingus and
Spain's Iberia, had greatly improved their record thanks to state
aid the Commission had authorized.
	   The Commission can veto state aid plans it judges harm fair
competition rules in the 15-nation bloc.

Truck driver charged in Kyrgyz cyanide spill
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Kyrgyz authorities have brought criminal charges
against the driver of a truck that crashed and spilled its cargo of
deadly cyanide powder into a river, a news report said Wednesday.
	   The truck carrying 20 tons of sodium cyanide powder veered off a
mountain road and crashed into the Barskaan River on May 20. Four
deaths have been linked to the spill and some 2,600 have sought
medical help for cyanide poisoning, according to Kyrgyz officials.
	   The driver, Murat Murtazin, has been charged with violating the
rules for transporting sodium cyanide, Interfax news agency
reported. The charge carries a sentence of up to 10 years in
prison, it said.
	   A parliamentary commission that has investigated the accident
has has blamed a Canadian-owned company that operates a mine where
the cyanide was being delivered.
	   The commission said the Kumtor Operating Company was
transporting a cargo of 40 tons, instead of permitted 13 tons,
along aging road and bridges, Interfax reported.

Bangladesh rivers continue flooding, death toll rises
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ All the major rivers in Bangladesh were
flooding new areas Wednesday, as torrential rains lashed much of
the country for the 12th straight day, meteorologists said.
	   The death toll rose to 109, with newspapers in Dhaka reporting
six new victims in the Sirajganj, Netrokona and Rangpur districts.
	   With the rivers already swollen by the monsoon rains in India,
the floods affected nearly 10 million people across 29 districts,
according to reports.
	   Officials of the Flood Forecasting and Warning Center in the
capital said a huge swath of land in the northern and central part
of the country was inundated by the Brahmaputra, Ganges and Meghna
rivers and the situation would worsen by Thursday.
	   The floods, which began July 10, have caused extensive damage to
crops, washed away mud-and-straw dwellings and disrupted road and
rail communications across the country.
	   The Disaster and Relief Ministry said 250 medical teams were
spread out across the worst affected areas to prevent an outbreak
of diarrhea, dysentery and other waterborne diseases.
	   Bangladesh, a low-lying delta nation of 120 million people, is
buffeted by floods and cyclones that kill hundreds of people every
year.

Internet `father': NASA to extend Cyberspace to outer space
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALEXANDER G. HIGGINS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ NASA scientists are preparing for the first
interplanetary Internet ``gateway'' on the next Mars mission, a key
telecommunications figure said Wednesday.
	   The idea is to go beyond the earthly Internet site that many
people around the world visited last year to follow the adventures
of the Mars Pathfinder's rover on the Red Planet, said Vinton Cerf,
widely regarded as a ``father'' of the Internet.
	   ``The time is now to think beyond the Earth,'' Cerf told INET
'98, the annual meeting of the global Internet Society. ``There is
now an effort under way to design and build an interplanetary
Internet.''
	   The system would serve space exploration and link future
astronauts in space with the earthly Internet.
	   Cerf, a senior vice president for MCI Communications Corp., said
he and other Internet experts have been working on the project with
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory since last November.
	   ``This is quite real,'' Cerf said. ``The effort is becoming
extraordinarily concrete over the next few months because the next
Mars mission is in the planning stages now.''
	   NASA is planning a series of Mars missions at two-yearly
intervals starting in 2001, that would lead up to astronauts
landing on the Red Planet.
	   Cerf said the planners envision planetary internets networks
that look very much like the Internet on Earth, but that something
must be done to link the networks.
	   A key problem are the great distances, which means it can take
six hours to send a message from planet to another, he said.
	   Cerf, co-inventor during the early 1970s of the so-called
``TCP-IP,'' the basic building block of the Net, said the plan is
to leave equipment in Mars orbit.
	   The Transmission Control Protocol-Internet Protocol is the set
of standards that lets any Internet message be read by any
computer.
	   Cerf said the equipment to be put on the next mission will be
designed to let computers talk to each other over the time lags
caused by the vast distances of outer space.
	   The devices could be ``an orbiting interplanetary gateway which
serves future missions and allows us to recreate Internet on an
interplanetary scale.''
	   One of the decisions that planners need to make is whether to
add new domain name suffixes such as ``.mars'' or ``.earth'' to
addresses for an interplanetary system, Cerf said.
	   While the Internet continues to grow rapidly on Earth, ``we
still have a lot of work to do to cover the planet,'' he said.

Israeli defense minister asks for U.S. help in negotiations
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to UPDATE with quotes by Arafat and his adviser &QL; 
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Signaling that their first direct talks in
months have failed, Israel and the Palestinians on Wednesday urged
the United States to resume its role as mediator.
	   The negotiations had been arranged by the Clinton administration
after it announced earlier this month it had exhausted its efforts
to broker agreement on an Israeli troop pullback in the West Bank.
	   The talks were widely seen as the last chance for Israel and the
Palestinians to reach such an agreement.
	   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said Wednesday it was
time for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat to meet to try and resolve the disputes.
	   ``What is also needed now is high-level American involvement,
with the (U.S. Mideast) envoy, Dennis Ross and Secretary Madeleine
Albright helping us to reach an agreement,'' Mordechai said.
	   When asked what he thought of Mordechai's call for U.S. help,
Arafat said: ``We are not against it.''
	   Arafat adviser Nabil Abourdeneh said three days of meetings
``ended yesterday without any progress because the Israeli side did
not present anything new and continues to reject the U.S.
initiative.''
	   The Clinton administration has been trying since January to win
support for a land-for-security plan under which Israel would
withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank, in exchange for greater
Palestinian efforts to crack down on Islamic militants.
	   The Palestinians have accepted the U.S. initiative, but Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has balked at the scope of the
withdrawal and said he needed stronger guarantees that the
Palestinians will live up to their security obligations.
	   The Israeli-Palestinian contacts began with a Sunday meeting
between Mordechai and Arafat's deputy, Mahmoud Abbas, followed by
contacts between lower-level negotiators.
	   Netanyahu has said he did not want to focus only on the troop
pullback, but also wanted to raise several other issues such as the
extradition of Palestinians suspected of killing Israelis.
	   With the resumption of the talks, Netanyahu came under renewed
pressure from both hardliners and moderates in his government.
	   However, unless a motion of no-confidence is submitted to
parliament by next week, neither side will be able to make good on
threats to bring down Netanyahu. Parliament goes into recess July
29 and will begin its fall term Oct. 19. During this period, the
government cannot be toppled by a motion of no confidence.
	   Israel's dovish opposition was divided over whether it should
try to bring down Netanyahu at any cost, even if it meant voting
against a withdrawal pullback.
	   More than a dozen legislators of the Labor Party said they would

to give Netanyahu a parliamentary safety net for the next six
months if he agrees to a troop withdrawal.

Russian economy to shrink a half percent this year
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Finance Ministry predicting economy
will decline, government raises pension contributions, stocks
down. &QL; 
 &UR; By MAURA REYNOLDS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's economy will shrink by 0.5 percent this
year because of the current sharp and severe financial crisis, the
Finance Ministry said Wednesday.
	   The ministry had originally predicted 2 percent growth for 1998,
following a 0.8-increase last year _ Russia's first growth since
the 1991 Soviet collapse.
	   The Finance Ministry's macroeconomics chief, Anton Siluanov,
told the Interfax news agency that the revised forecast is likely
to worsen Russia's deficit, since the government's budget was based
on 2-percent growth.
	   Reducing the deficit is one of several conditions imposed on
Russia by the International Monetary Fund, which approved a
multibillion-dollar rescue package this week.
	   However, Russia's markets remain nervous. At midafternoon
Wednesday, stocks were down 6.5 percent over the previous day. They
have lost more than half their value in the past six months.
	   Siluanov blamed several factors for the economy's poor
performance particularly the steep drop in world prices for oil, a
major Russian export, and reverberations from the financial crisis
in Asia.
	   In other economic news:
	   _ Russia's largest oil companies pleaded with the government
Wednesday to lower taxes on oil production, warning of ``open
social conflict'' unless such measures are pursued.
	   ``We are forced to state that the economic policy of
international financial organizations toward basic industries is
irrational and irresponsible,'' the companies said in a statement.
	   In particular, they asked President Boris Yeltsin to rescind his
veto of a bill passed by parliament that would have lowered oil
excise taxes. The IMF has insisted the government raise, not lower,
taxes.
	   _ The government announced Wednesday that Russians will have to
start contributing more to the pension fund starting Aug. 1.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Sysuyev told a news conference that
pension contributions will rise from the current 1 percent of
income to 3 percent of income.
	   The higher rate will apply to investment income as well as
wages, Sysuyev said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   After showing its first signs of growth last year, Russia's
economy began to plummet a few months ago as wary investors fled
Russian stocks and securities.
	   The first installment of the IMF loan _ dlrs 4.8 billion _ is to
be deposited in the Central Bank this week in an effort to
forestall a run on the Russian currency, the ruble.
	   The new loan is expected to be followed by additional lending
from the World Bank and the Japanese government, which will bring
Russia's total bailout to dlrs 17 billion this year and next.

Former champ wants to end retirement and meet Roy Jones
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Former world super-middleweight champion Steve
Collins says he wants to come out of retirement to set up a fight
with WBA and WBC light-heavyweight champion Roy Jones Jr.
	   He calls it unfinished business.
	   The 34-year-old Irishman, who retired 10 months ago because he
couldn't get the fight with Jones he'd been waiting for, now
believes it could happen.
	   And, if it does, he would like to warm up by meeting Chris
Eubank for the third time.
	   ``If (promoter) Frank Warren came to me and said `Steve, you've
got the Jones fight in December', and Eubank had won the
cruiserweight championship of the world, I would take him as a
warm-up,'' said Collins.
	   ``I would fight Eubank and I would class it as a warm-up for Roy
Jones. I would class it as unfinished business and I need to get it
out of my system.''
	   Collins' comments came the weekend after Jones won a decision
over Lou Del Valle after being knocked down for the first time and
Eubank was stopped for the first time in his 52-fight career by WBO
cruiserweight titlist Carl Thompson.
	   That was Eubank's fourth world title loss in a row but the
Englishman has postponed any decision on retirement until
September.
	   Collins, unbeaten for six years before he quit, says he remains
in fighting shape.
	   ``The difference between me and Chris Eubank is that I am still
at my peak,'' the Dubliner said. ``Things were going well for me
when I retired.
	   ``I finished at my best and I have never taken a beating in my
career,'' said Collins, whose three losses in a 39-fight career
were all on points in world title fights against Mike McCallum,
Reggie Johnson and Sumbu Kalambay.
	   ``I fought on an extra year just to get a crack at Jones but he
avoided me. There was no other challenge out there for me.
	   ``Now that I have been retired, I still want to fight Jones. I
desperately want that fight. There is no doubt that I would come
back for that fight and I know it could happen,'' Collins said.
	   ``In fact it should happen because the public want it.''
	   Jones has indicated in the past that he would welcome a fight
with Collins as long as the money was right.

House of Lords may vote down lower age of consent for gays
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: time of vote uncertain but likely after 2000 GMT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Conservatives in the House of Lords set out
Wednesday to block the House of Commons from lowering the age of
consent for homosexuals to 16 _ the same as the age for consent for
heterosexuals.
	   	   ``It is the kind of thing that worries mothers and fathers who
have a 16-year-old son and don't want the promotion of
homosexuality,'' said Baroness Young, a Conservative in the House
of Lords who led opposition to the change.
	   The age of consent for homosexuals now is 18.
	   Even before the vote, there was grumbling in the House of
Commons that the unelected Lords, with a huge Conservative
majority, was blocking the will of the democratically elected House
of Commons, with a big Labor majority.
	   The change in the age was included as an amendment to the
government's Crime and Disorder bill, and approved on a vote of
333-129 on May 22.
	   If the Lords rejects the amendment, the government may face a
choice between abandoning the amendment or losing the entire bill.
	   ``What we are up against is the last remnant of the hereditary
and patronage systems which is completely unacceptable,'' said Tony
Benn, a Labor member of the Commons.
	   But Lord Weatherill, who was speaker of the House of Commons
from 1982 to 1992, said the Lords were acting correctly.
	   ``The proper role of the House of Lords is to scrutinize
legislation that comes before it. W've had very considerable
success during the course of the last government and in the course
of this government in putting right things which patently needed to
be put right. I think this is a very important case in point,''
Weatherill said.
	   There are 158 Labor members of the House of Lords but 471
Conservatives, including the bulk of the hereditary peers who make
up more than half of the total membership. There are also 52
Liberal Democratic Lords and 323 ``crossbenchers'' with no party
affiliation.
	   The Lords has defeated Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labor
government 30 times since it took office in May 1997, compared to
about 13 defeats a year for the previous Conservative governments
of Margaret Thatcher and John Major.
	   Blair has pledged to abolish hereditary membership of the House
of Lords before the next general election.

Kohl takes re-election campaign to holidaymakers on Baltic coast
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HERINGSDORF, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl made an
eastern German swing in his re-election campaign Wednesday, warning
holidaymakers at a Baltic Sea resort that voting for the opposition
might bring former communists into the national government.
	   Kohl told several thousand people gathered in Heringsdorf in
Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania it was ``shameful'' that the
left-leaning Social Democrats were cooperating with the
ex-communists in another eastern state.
	   The Social Democrats rule Saxony-Anhalt in a minority government
with tacit support from the former communists, the Party of
Democratic Socialism.
	   Kohl, who trails Social Democratic challenger Gerhard Schroeder
in opinion polls, maintains this arrangement may be repeated in
Bonn after parliamentary elections Sept. 27.
	   The chancellor interrupted his traditional summer vacation in
Austria for the second time in a week to campaign, making several
stops on holiday islands near the Polish border.
	   ``Red scare'' tactics have been a staple of Kohl's campaign this
year, as they were in his successful re-election efforts four years
ago.
	   However, Schroeder has consistently ruled out working with the
former communists on the national level.
	   And while shunned in the west because some of its members are
unreformed Marxists, the PDS resonates with easterners who feel
left behind and colonized in the region's shift from communism to
capitalism.
	   Kohl's speech Wednesday drew mostly applause from the crowd, but
also a few boos.

Turkey's premier survives censure motion in parliament
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz survived a
censure motion in parliament Wednesday presented by opposition
parties for his grant of state-owned land to a Turkish-U.S. joint
venture.
	   Parliament's speaker announced that 230 deputies had voted to
censure Yilmaz -- 46 votes short of the required absolute majority.
	   Lawmakers had debated whether to censure Yilmaz for allocating
the land free to a joint venture between Ford Motor Company and
Turkey's largest industrial holding, Koc Holding.
	   The Islamic Virtue Party, backing the motion, claimed the deal
cost the state 20 trillion Turkish lira (dlrs 74 million). Yilmaz
has defended the move, saying it would attract large investments
and create 4,000 new jobs.
	   The premier said he would attend the ground-breaking ceremony
for the car plant near Istanbul scheduled Sunday.
	   President Suleyman Demirel, in a rare show of support for
Yilmaz, said the deal with Ford was so important that he would have
allotted the gardens of the presidential palace free of charge.
	   Yilmaz came to power a year ago after the military pressured
Turkey's first Islamic-led government to resign.

EU developing plans to fight counterfeiting of single currency
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The introduction of a single currency
in 11 European countries will present the criminal element with a
new challenge and European Union law enforcement with an even
bigger one.
	   The EU Commission, the Union's executive arm, instructed its
anti-fraud task force Wednesday to begin evaluating the needs for
legislation to fight counterfeiting of the new currency, to be
called the euro.
	   The euro will be introduced Jan. 1. Actual notes and coins will
come into circulation in January 2002.
	   ``The euro will circulate very widely both within and outside
the European Union thus increasing its attraction to all kinds of
counterfeiting, including some by organized crime,'' the Commission
said.
	   A communication sent to the European Council of Ministers, the
European Parliament and the European Central Bank suggested a
number of measures.
	   Among them is expansion of the mandate of Europol, the new
European Union police organization based in The Hague, Netherlands.
Europol, created in 1994, is limited now to fighting five areas of
crime: drugs, stolen cars, illegal immigrants, nuclear material and
money laundering.
	   The Commission identified four areas where it felt quick action
is needed - prevention and training; information, communication
systems and databases; cooperation and mutual assistance; and the
legal framework.
	   The design of the new euro incorporates a wider range of
security features and anticounterfeiting measures than any national
notes and coins in circulation today, the EU says. But that won't
be enough.
	   The EU wants to launch a new training policy next year aimed at
the professionals who will play a role in the detection of
counterfeit money.
	   A Counterfeiting Analysis Center will be put under the control
of the European Central Bank to process technical information and
will help Europol with analyses.
	   In parallel with EU regulations, the question of penal law must
be addressed, the Commission said. Defining offenses, penalties and
mutual legal assistance must be worked out and harmonized through
the EU.

Mubarak appeals to Israeli people to save peace
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MAAMOUN YOUSSEF &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Warning that developments in the Middle East
will effect the whole world, President Hosni Mubarak on Wednesday
called on the Israeli people to help save the peace process.
	   He appealed to ``the Israeli people, who share with us the
responsibility of peace, to recognize the current dangerous
situation and the grave eventual repercussions if the peace process
collapses or reaches a dead-end,'' he said.
	   Mubarak was addressing the final session of the ruling National
Democratic Party congress, which also marked the 46th anniversary
of the July 23 revolution of late President Gamal Abdel Nasser that
toppled the monarchy.
	   Mubarak said the hurdles faced by the peace process are ``the
result of rigid policies and unjust practices which cannot build
bridges of love and co-existence among the nations.''
	   The Middle East peace process, which has stumbled since the
election of hard-line Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in
May 1996, was recently crippled by a dispute over the scope of
Israeli troops withdrawal from West Bank.
	   Three days of direct talks between Israel and the Palestinians
ended Tuesday without any agreement.
	   The United States has suggested a 13 percent withdrawal from the
West Bank, which was accepted by the Palestinians. The Israelis
rejected it, saying it would compromise the country's security.
	   Mubarak also called on other ``peace loving people of the
world'' to double their efforts to help the Middle East peace
process.
	   ``Any incident that takes place in this sensitive region will
surely be strongly echoed and widely reflected all over the
world,'' he said.
	   Mubarak urged the international community to work for the
elimination of mass destruction weapons.
	   Mubarak promised to continue with economic reforms that he
started in 1991 by initiating a program to privatize state-run
companies. He also vowed to safeguard democracy in Egypt.
	   ``I assure you that this era is the first which believes in
democracy and considers it as part of the basic rights of the
people ... You remedy the problems of democracy by offering wider
scope of democracy,'' he said.
	   The government's critics say the Egypt is hardly the democracy
that Mubarak claims it to be, and cite the restrictions on the
media and one-party rule. Mubarak has been president since 1981 and
critics say his party has rigged elections to stay in power.

	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The National Industries Co., a leading
manufacturer, plans to raise 35 million dinars (dlrs 114.37
million) through a bond issue this fall, the Gulf Investment Corp.
announced Wednesday.
	   Kuwait-based GIC said in a statement that the company has asked
the GIC and the Kuwait Financial Center to arrange the issue.
Launching is scheduled for September.
	   ``This mandate represents GIC's continued commitment to play a
leading role in assisting GCC businesses raise finance from the
securities market,'' the statement said.
	   GIC is owned by the governments of the six members of the Gulf
Cooperation Council. The economic and political alliance groups
Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and
Bahrain.
	   NIC manufactures building materials, car batteries and
detergents. It is listed on the Kuwait Stock Exchange with a
paid-up capital of 50.79 million dinars (dlrs 165.98 million).

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Jordan has lost an estimated dlrs 3 billion
in tariffs and transport fees as a result of the U.N. trade
sanctions imposed on Iraq for invading Kuwait in 1990, Jordanian
charge d'affaires told a Baghdad magazine this week.
	   The remarks by the charge, Awad Khalid al-Sarhan, were carried
by Al-Musawir magazine.
	   Jordan's Aqaba port had been a major outlet for Iraqi exports.
Since the embargo, it has been a major port of entry for imports
that are transported by truck to Iraq.
	   Al-Sarhan estimated that nearly 120,000 Iraqis live in Jordan.
Many fled the harsh economic conditions prevailing in Iraq since
the sanctions were imposed.
 &UR; ___
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq has been unable to retrieve any of the
oil tankers impounded by countries to which Baghdad owes money, an
Oil Ministry official said Wednesday. It also has been denied
permission to maintain them, the official said.
	   Before the 1990-91 Gulf conflict, Iraq had a fleet of 15
tankers, the official said. Four were destroyed in the war, and
just one remains in Iraqi hands, he said. He spoke on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   Five Iraqi tankers are known to be in Kuwait, but the official
did not say where the others were.
	   In recent weeks, Kuwait has sought to sell the five tankers in
its custody, saying the rusty ships could sink any time. Iraq has
demanded that they be returned instead.
 &UR; ___
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanon and Canada signed an agreement
Wednesday under which a Canadian company will invest up to dlrs 92
million to rehabilitate Lebanon's outdated postal services.
	   Alfonso Gagliano, Canada's minister of public works and
government services, and Prime Minister Rafik Hariri attended the
ceremony.
	   Signing for the Canadians were Philippe Lemay, a member of the
board of directors of Canada Post Systems Management Ltd., and
Philippe Lamarre, manager of PROFAC Management Group Ltd.
	   Under the agreement, CPSML/PROFAC will set up a company with a
capital of dlrs 20 million to upgrade and run Lebanon's postal
service.
	   The firm will invest up to dlrs 92 million over the next 12
years.
	   The aim is to ``provide modern and first-class quality services
to citizens at a minimum cost,'' a statement by the prime
minister's office said.
	   Lebanon's postal service deteriorated during the 1975-90 civil
war.
 &UR; ___
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ A credit agency owned by the Canadian
government has extended a dlrs 10 million credit line to Lebanon
that is designed to finance the purchase of Canadian goods.
	   The English-language Daily Star newspaper said Wednesday that
Canada's Export Development Corp. advanced the money to Credit
Libanais, thus making Lebanon the first country in the region to
receive such a facility.

AC Milan not giving up on Kluivert
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ AC Milan is in the process of rebuilding but is not
giving up on Dutch striker Patrick Kluivert, the Serie A club's
owner said Wednesday.
	   Kluivert was a disappointment in his first season in Italy after
a transfer from Ajax of Amsterdam, with just seven goals in league
play, and he was reportedly on the trading block.
	   But an impressive performance late in the World Cup, where he
helped the Netherlands reach the semifinals, appears to have
prompted Milan to change plans.
	   ``Kluivert is 22 years old, has a lot of talent and a great
physique,'' Milan owner Silvio Berlusconi told reporters. ``There
might have been problems in the past, with the environment or the
coach or in the locker room. But now we will do what we need to to
keep him.''
	   Milan has had back-to-back losing seasons after winning four
titles in five years at the start of the decade. Since the end of
last season, the team has hired Alberto Zaccheroni to replace Fabio
Capello as coach, and revamped the roster. New faces include German
striker Oliver Bierhoff, Danish midfielder Thomas Helveg and French
defender Bruno N'Gotty.

	   SISSANO, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ Amid the stench of death
surrounding Sissano Lagoon in Papua New Guinea, signs of life
slowly returned Wednesday to the villages crushed by a giant wave.
	   Officials say at least 1,200 people were killed and 6,000 are
missing and feared dead. Estimates of those found alive so far
range from 2,500 to 3,500 in the chaos after the deluge.
	   It appears that the majority of the 8,000 to 10,000 villagers in
this stretch of coastline may have been killed.
	   Burials gave way to gasoline-fueled cremations on the spot as
rescue and recovery workers found the rotting corpses falling apart
in the tropical heat as they tried to move them.
	   On the outskirts of what had been the village of Sissano, which
has become the base for a massive international relief and rescue
operation, a small boy erupted from the scrub Wednesday, his wooden
bow and arrow poised to bring down a chicken scratching in the
dirt.
	   Terrence Mulo missed the elusive bird, but with the help of two
friends wielding some sticks as makeshift clubs, he managed to kill
three chickens by day's end. One bird was cooked immediately, while
the other two were destined for his parents, who are living as
refugees in a new village in the hills, away from the coast.
	   The thousands of people displaced by the tsunami, which struck
Friday, have been warned to stay away from the low-lying beach
front regions where their homes are either completely gone or badly
damaged, and where the danger of disease is high.
	   Food and clean water are in short supply. More pressing is the
increasing risk of disease such as malaria and scrub typhus.
	   Papua New Guinea, with a population of 4 million, occupies the
eastern half of the island of New Guinea about 90 miles (145
kilometers) north of Australia. Some of its people live a
near-Stone Age existence in the jungles and swamps.
	   John Tekwi, governor of the West Septik province where the
tsunami occurred, stood in his aluminum runabout boat and raised a
rifle to his shoulder.
	   With one clean shot, he felled a dog gnawing on a human corpse,
bloated and barely recognizable among the mangrove roots lining the
bank of the lagoon's many channels.
	   ``Crocodiles, dogs and pigs are scavenging on the corpses,''
Tekwi said, cursing under his breath at the animals. ``We were on
that island there burying people and they were feasting on the
bodies.''
	   The bodies of victims trapped in their houses when the tidal
surge hit continue to float to the surface, where they catch on
floating debris or tangle in the thorn-like mangrove roots that
stick out of the gray sand.
	   Prime Minister Bill Skate said the bodies were contaminating the
water and posed a large risk of disease.
	   Skate toured the lagoon Tuesday, passing more than a dozen
bodies caught in the floating debris of houses or impaled on tough
mangrove roots sticking out of the gray mud banks.
	   Upturned canoes, the roofs of houses and massive uprooted trees
are still scattered across the lagoon.
	   ``Every day the site gets uglier and uglier. It's not improving
at all,'' Skate told The Associated Press.
	   ``We have to look at the environment because it really could be
infested. The water is contaminated and it is very, very
unhealthy,'' he said adding that evacuation of the area could
become necessary.
	   Skate on Tuesday invoked emergency powers under the constitution
to put Police Commissioner Peter Agilo in complete control of the
rescue and relief operation.
	   This was intended to end the chaotic scene at local airstrips
where dozens of light and medium aircraft, helicopters and military
planes jostle for runway space, with little or no air control.
	   The remoteness of the region hampered emergency officials from
Australia, Papua New Guinea and New Zealand, who were coordinating
a rescue operation.

President appoints new government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ President Vaclav Havel on
Wednesday appointed the first leftist government since the collapse
of communist rule eight years ago.
	   Eighteen ministers, 17 of them Social Democrats, signed the oath
of office in a ceremony held at the Prague Castle.
	   The only non-Social Democrat is Justice Minister Otakar Motejl
who is unaffiliated. Motejl so far has served as Supreme Court
chairman. Premier is Milos Zeman, head of the Social Democrats.
	   News reports last week said Havel had objections against at
least two Cabinet members, Foreign Minister Jan Kavan and Interior
Minister Vaclav Grulich.
	   Kavan, who returned from Britain after the 1989 collapse of
communist regime, has been accused of being an informer of the
former secret police, the STB. A court later cleared him, ruling
Kavan did not know he was talking to an STB agent.
	   Grulich was repeatedly accused in the media of clandestine
contact to Russian diplomats. The accusations never were confirmed,
and Grulich has denied them.
	   While it is the president who names the ministers, the
constitution does not give him the power to veto a candidate
proposed by premier.
	   Although the Social Democrats hold only 74 seats in the 200-seat
lower chamber of the parliament, the Cabinet is expected to survive
the initial confidence vote scheduled for Aug. 18.
	   Under Zeman's agreement with the election runner-up, the Civic
Democratic Party of ex-Premier Vaclav Klaus, the 63 deputies for
Klaus' party will leave the chamber during the vote, effectively
ensuring that the government will be endorsed.
	   Havel appointed the ministers just one day before he is to enter
hospital for an abdominal surgery, with the operation to remove a
tube inserted in his colon most likely on Sunday.

Iran says U.S. must change attitude, policies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ The United States must change its attitude
and policies if it is sincere about improving relations with Iran,
the Foreign Minister said Wednesday.
	   ``If this attitude is changing, we will respond if necessary,''
the minister, Kamal Kharrazi, told a news conference.
	   His remarks came weeks after Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei warned that Washington's softer tone toward Tehran was no
more than ``a hypocritical political undertaking'' and Iranians
should not be deceived.
	   Kharrazi said Iran recognizes that the U.S. overtures are a
reality. ``But this change of tone could be valuable only when it
is coupled with changing U.S. policies and attitudes towards
Iran,'' he said.
	   Although Iran's moderate President Mohammad Khatami has called
for cultural exchanges with the United States as a way of easing
tensions, his authority is circumscribed by Khamenei who leads a
hard-line faction among the ruling clergy.
	   Iran and the United States broke off relations after the 1979
Islamic revolution, which toppled the U.S.-supported shah and
brought a clerical group to power.
	   In June, U.S. President Bill Clinton and U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said positive changes in Iran since Khatami's
election could eventually lead to normal relations.
	   The United States has long considered Iran a rogue state that
should be isolated. It says that Iran sponsors international
terrorism and is trying to acquire weapons of mass destruction.
	   Iran denies the charges and blames the United States for trying
to exert its will on the rest of the world.

	   FUKUOKA, Japan (AP) _ Chinese sprinter Yan Jiankui became a
double gold medalist at the Asian Athletic Championships Wednesday,
while her team grabbed 14 of the 19 golds at stake on the meet's
final day.
	   That gave the Chinese 26 of the meet's 43 golds, far ahead of
Japan's six. Qatar had three and Kazakstan and Sri Lanka two each.
	   Chinese women missed only one of nine gold medals on Wednesday,
and finished with 17 in all.
	   Yan edged teammate Huang Mei 23.00 seconds to 23.21 in the 200
meters, adding that gold to her victory Monday in the 100.
	   ``I knew I could win both events,'' she said. ``And I thought I
could run much faster today. Maybe I was a little tired.''
	   India's P.T. Usha, in her first international meet after several
years of self-imposed retirement, was third in 23.46, taking her
second bronze medal of the meet.
	   ``I'm more than happy,'' the 33-year-old Usha said. ``Hopefully
I'll be better fit and run faster in the Asian Games.''
	   She didn't have to wait until December for gold, however. Later
Wednesday, she anchored India's victorious 4 x 100-meter relay
quartet.
	   That was the only women's event on Wednesday that China didn't
win.
	   She also anchored her country's silver medal team in the 4 x
400, which finished .16 behind China.
	   Japan won three of the 10 men's gold medals Wednesday, and Qatar
won one, when Mubarak S. Al-Nubifaraj took the men's 400-meter
hurdles.
	   For Japan, Koji Ito edged China's Han Chaoming by 0.07 second in
the 200 meters, winning in 20.70. Toshinari Takaoka beat India's
Gulab Chand by more than a second in the 5,000. And Japan won the 4
x 400-meter relay, more than a second ahead of South Korea.
	   Chinese women's triple jump winner Ren Ruiping came 0.55 meters
short of her 2-year-old Asian record of 14.66, but noted that
``none of my Asian rivals has ever beaten me.''
	   ``I'll try to be qualified for Bangkok in a national meet in
September, and to set a much better record in the Asian Games,''
the 22-year-old Ren added.
	   In the women's discus, 192-centimeter (6-foot, 3 1/2-inch)-tall
Yu Xin threw 57.47 meters for the gold, beating the 56.81 of Neelam
J. Singh of India and 53.32 of Asian record-holder Xiao Yanling,
also of China. Xiao said she has almost recovered from a leg injury
she suffered in April.
	   ``I'm glad to win the gold in my first international meet,''
said the 21-year-old Yu. ``I'm not satisfied with today's record,
however, and I feel like I can overcome the pressure next time and
do a better job.''
	   In the distance races, China left home the latest batch of women
runners in ``Ma's Army,'' the pupils of coach ma Junren who broke a
succession of world records in the early 1990s.
	   But in the 10,000, China's Liu Shixiang, silver medalist in the
5,000, spurted ahead of Japan's Chiemi Takahashi with 100 meters
left and won in 32 minutes, 28.49 seconds. Takahashi was second in
32:32.99.
	   A sumo fan from Mongolia, Dashdendev Mahashiri, will take home
his nation's only medal, a silver he won with 57.00 meters in the
men's discus.
	   ``It's a good present for my wife and my 4-month-old daughter,''
said the 30-year-old Mahashiri.
	   China's Li Sahojie took the gold with 60.28, while Ajit Badhuria
won the bronze with 55.46.

	   ORAHOVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Albanian rebels withdrew under cover
of darkness early Wednesday from their last positions in this
strategic Kosovo town as international monitors visited the site of
one of the biggest battles in weeks.
	   Serb policemen, shielding themselves beneath large umbrellas
from the blistering summer sun, stared toward the wooded hills for
signs of snipers. But Serb officials said the Kosovo Liberation
Army had pulled back several kilometers (miles) to the north and no
longer threatened the town, which they attacked Friday.
	   Reporters traveling here from Pristina, 50 kilometers (30 miles)
to the east, passed convoys of Serb police waiving large Serbian
flags.
	   Earlier Wednesday, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees cast
doubt on claims that the town of 20,000 inhabitants was completely
in Serb hands, saying the area resounded with gunfire and
occasional explosions when UNHCR staff visited late Tuesday.
	   By Wednesday morning, however, the town was quiet. The streets
were empty except for fortified Serbian police positions and the
body of a dead horse which lay on the pavement.
	   The fighting around Orahovac cast doubt on the possibility of a
negotiated settlement between Serbia, the dominant republic of
Yugoslavia, and Kosovo Albanians, who make up 90 percent of the
province's population.
	   Germany's foreign minister said NATO would likely have to get
involved to end the violence.
	   ``On both sides, there is a lack of serious effort to contain
the armed violence and resume negotiations,'' Foreign Minister
Klaus Kinkel said in Bonn, Germany, on Wednesday.
	   Kosovo Albanians, fighting for independence from Serbia, said at
least 36 ethnic Albanians had been killed in the fighting.
	   On Wednesday, a group of Russian diplomats -- part of an
international observer group in Kosovo -- arrived for their first
visit since the fighting began.
	   The observers issued no statement but one of them said it was
difficult to assess what had happened since the warring sides made
such widely conflicting claims. The observer refused to give his
name.
	   The fighting led the U.N. Security Council to vote Tuesday to
expand the peacekeeping force in Macedonia by about 300 troops,
mostly to strengthen security along borders with Kosovo and
Albania. U.S. troops will make up about half of the 1,000-plus
force.
	   Ending a visit to Kosovo, the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe issued a report Wednesday noting an influx of
armed fighters from neighboring Albania, increased abductions by
both sides and growing shortages of food and medicines.
	   In an attempt to cobble together peace talks, Christopher Hill,
the U.S. ambassador to Macedonia, met Tuesday with Ibrahim Rugova,
the moderate ethnic Albanian leader. Hill had conferred with
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic in Belgrade on Monday.
	   Rugova's party, the Democratic League of Kosovo, on Tuesday
condemned what it called the ``violence and massacre by Serb forces
in Orahovac.''
	   The capture of Orahovac would have expanded the nearly 40
percent of Kosovo the KLA is said to control _ and given the rebels
command of a strategic road.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, which is close to ethnic Albanian
politicians, claimed Serb forces, which moved into the town
Saturday, were still shelling KLA positions in Orahovac on Tuesday
and that fighting was also raging in outlying villages.

Persistence pays for Manchester United as Swede signs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANCHESTER, England (AP) _ Persistence paid for Manchester
United manager Alex Ferguson on Wednesday when he finally got the
signature of Swedish international Jesper Blomqvist after three
failed attempts.
	   Blomqvist signed a three-year deal with the Reds, completing a
4.4 million-pound (dlrs 7.23 million) move from Italian team Parma.
	   The international winger had reportedly been reluctant to join
the Premier League giants because he was concerned about his
chances of securing a permanent place in the first team.
	   Ferguson had made three failed attempts to lure the former IFK
Goteborg and AC Milan star to the Reds, before agreeing a deal with
his Serie A team Parma last week and finalizing personal terms with
Blomqvist on Tuesday.
	   Ferguson said it usually did not take this long to get his man.
	   ``We are getting with Jesper, at 24, the best years of his
career and we were lacking wingers here,'' Ferguson said.
	   Blomqvist warned against the comparisons being made between
himself and United's Welsh international Ryan Giggs.
	   ``You can't put two players together and say they are the
same,'' he said Wednesday. ``Of course you can find similarities
but there are also a lot of differences.''
	   Blomqvist has a foot injury which is expected to keep him out of
action for three to four weeks, which means he would miss the
traditional season opener, the Charity Shield game against league
and cup titlist Arsenal Aug. 9, and even the first Premier League
game against Leicester a week later.

Russian, Chinese foreign ministers discuss South Asia, summit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS throughout to UPDATE with remarks by Primakov, Tang,
Zhu &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Russia's and China's foreign ministers on
Wednesday discussed ways to contain South Asia's nuclear arms race
and prepared for a summit between their presidents.
	   Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov, at the start of a
five-day visit aimed at improving cooperation between the giant
neighbors, also discussed the Asian financial crisis and reviving
lagging trade with Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji.
	   ``We share the wish to further promote friendship and
cooperative relations between the two countries,'' Zhu was quoted
by China's official Xinhua News Agency as saying.
	   Primakov and Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan echoed Zhu's
sentiment in brief remarks to reporters after their meeting.
	   Much of the foreign ministers' work concerned preparations for a
scheduled September meeting in Russia between Russian President
Boris Yeltsin and Chinese President Jiang Zemin, their fifth summit
in less than three years.
	   Primakov, who will meet Jiang on Thursday, said he and Tang
succeeded in narrowing the agenda for the summit.
	   Given that Russia and China both hold permanent seats on the
U.N. Security Council, the foreign ministers discussed the ethnic
conflict in Yugoslavia's Kosovo region, the stalled Middle East
peace process and other international security issues, Primakov
said.
	   He said they also discussed possible international strategies
for stopping the nuclear arms race between India and Pakistan and
preventing its effects from spilling over to other regions.
	   Tang and Primakov both noted that their governments share
consensus on most major issues and that, in Tang's words, they have
a ``good cooperative, strategic partnership.''
	   Beijing and Moscow see their relations as a counterbalance to
Washington's dominant global influence. Both governments have also
sought to improve relations with Japan.
	   When asked by a reporter if China would consider holding
Northeast Asia security talks with Russia, Japan and the United
States, Tang said the proposal was worth considering.
	   Although the two countries have succeeded in burying their Cold
War rivalry for the socialist world's allegiances, problems remain.
Most nagging is slipping commerce. Trade fell 10 percent last year
to dlrs 6.1 billion and the two want to raise the total to dlrs 20
billion by 2000.

European ministers seek agreement on marine pollution policy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BARRY HATTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SINTRA, Portugal (AP) _ European environment ministers met here
Wednesday to discuss new rules on marine pollution in the North
East Atlantic, including measures to curb contentious issues such
as decommissioned oil rigs and levels of radioactive waste
discharges.
	   The two-day meeting at this town on Lisbon's outskirts was
attended by ministers from 12 European Union nations as well as
Norway and Iceland who together make up the Convention for the
Protection of the Marine Environment of the North East Atlantic,
also called OSPAR.
	   A lot is riding on the outcome of the conference for oil and
nuclear companies who could face multimillion-dollar clean-up
bills.
	   The meeting, the first of OSPAR at ministerial level, was due to
announce its decisions Thursday.
	   Most European nations want a sweeping ban on the dumping of
decommissioned oil rigs at sea _ an issue which sharpened in 1995
when public opinion forced oil company Shell to back down on a
decision to dump its Brent Spar loading buoy in deep waters.
	   Norway, the world's largest oil exporter, and Britain had been
the only two countries opposed to a total ban.
	   However, the British government last week announced a change in
its stance, saying it would support a total ban at the meeting.
	   Norway's Deputy Oil Minister Haakon Gill said Wednesday that
Oslo will support a ban as long as new rules allow special
consideration for offshore units that are too big or dangerous to
dismantle.
	   ``There is a bit of a tug-of-war going on over the large
platforms,'' Gill told The Associated Press in Oslo. ``We accept a
general ban ... but when it comes to the large steel platforms, it
must be decided on a case by case basis.''
	   Greenpeace, which has observer status at the meeting, says
Norway is reluctant to accept a sweeping ban because it wants to
expand operations into the Arctic circle where oil installations
will require heavier steel structures.
	   Proposals on radiation discharges, concerning Britain and
France, range from a total ban on discharges of nuclear waste _ the
so-called zero option _ to emissions being capped at agreed levels.
	   More than 90 percent of all radioactive waste discharges into
the sea covered by OSPAR come from three nuclear reprocessing
plants which are located at La Hague in France and at Sellafield
and Dounreay in Britain.
	   Norway wants an end to discharges from Sellafield, claiming that
radioactive buildup along its coast can be traced back to the
British plant.
	   OSPAR members have agreed to hold future meetings every five
years.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Prime minister candidate Junichiro Koizumi vowed
Wednesday to bring back the days when Japan was seen as the world's
model economy.
	   ``Only a few years ago the world was saying other countries
should become more like Japan, but what has happened to us?''
Koizumi, Japan's health minister, told foreign reporters.
	   Koizumi is one of three candidates vying to succeed Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, who announced last week he was
resigning after the ruling Liberal Democratic Party was defeated in
July 12 elections for the upper house of Parliament.
	   The LDP votes on Friday for a party president, who is almost
certain to become prime minister when Parliament convenes next week
since the LDP controls the powerful lower house.
	   Koizumi, seen as trailing Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi in the
race, said the answer to Japan's economic renaissance is
overhauling the system.
	   ``I believe we have not moved forward with the necessary
structural reforms,'' Koizumi said.
	   Koizumi vowed to push forward drastic reforms including
privatization of state companies and cutting by half the number of
Parliament members and government bureaucrats.
	   Koizumi earned a reputation as a maverick within the ruling
party for his proposal to privatize the postal system, a plan many
LDP members opposed. Like the other candidates, he also wants to
cut taxes.
	   A third candidate, former Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroku
Kajiyama, is calling for tax cuts and remaking the country's
troubled banking system.

Jewish extremists paste anti-Netanyahu posters in southern city
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEERSHEVA, Israel (AP) _ Using similar tactics from their hate
campaign against slain leader Yitzhak Rabin, Jewish extremists
pasted posters Wednesday depicting Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu as an Arab sympathizer and a liar.
	   The outlawed anti-Arab group Kach claimed responsibility for the
photo montages showing Netanyahu in an Arab headdress, a symbol of
Arab nationalism, with the word `Liar,' printed below.
	   The posters appeared in the southern desert city of Beersheva.
Others have been displayed in Jerusalem.
	   ``Benjamin Netanyahu wearing a kaffiyeh (Arab headdress) shows
he is acting like an Arab. Instead of assisting Israel like a
Jewish prime minister he is endangering its residents,'' Kach
activist Noam Federman told Israel Radio.
	   Federman, a Jewish settler in the West Bank city of Hebron, said
his group was engaged in a campaign to discredit Netanyahu, whom
they fear will go ahead with a promise to cede West Bank land to
the Palestinians as part of peace agreements.
	   Netanyahu was narrowly elected with the support of the settlers
who believed the right-wing politician would put an end to peace
deals with the Palestinians.
	   After going ahead with land-for-peace deals, Rabin became the
target of an intensive hate campaign, and posters showing him
wearing a checkered Arab headdress, similar to the one worn by
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, were commonplace. Rabin was
assassinated by a Jewish extremist in November 1995.

Ten bombs explode outside businesses in Medellin, one killed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Ten bombs went off outside banks and
other businesses in Medellin early Wednesday, shattering shop
windows and blowing off doors, police said.
	   A man suspected of setting at least one of the blasts was
killed, police said. The bombs went off at about 4:30 a.m. There
were no other reports of injuries.
	   The motive for the attacks was unclear. Police said they were
investigating. Colombia is home to leftist rebels, right wing
paramilitary fighters, and drug traffickers, and has one of the
world's highest crime rates.
	   Police said no group has taken responsibility.

Indonesian president reassures Chinese business people
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Desperate to revive Indonesia's
battered economy, President B.J. Habibie assured key ethnic Chinese
business leaders Wednesday that the government and security forces
will protect their companies and families.
	   Many members of the Chinese minority, who dominate Indonesian
commerce and industry, have been targeted as scapegoats for
Indonesia's economic crisis and fled the country during riots in
May.
	   Hundreds of Chinese stores and houses were ransacked and burned
by indigenous Indonesian mobs. Human rights groups have also
alleged that many Chinese women were raped.
	   Critics say the armed forces did little to protect the Chinese
during the riots that helped force Suharto to quit as president
after 32 years in power.
	   Analysts have said the economy will struggle to recover without
Chinese capital and business skills.
	   China has also voiced concern about the plight of Indonesia's
Chinese community, which accounts for only a fraction of the
Southeast Asian nation's 202 million people.
	   Habibie, who came to power after the May riots, met 10 Chinese
tycoons at the presidential palace.
	   ``Habibie said the law treats all citizens equally regardless of
their ethnic group, provided that all give their full dedication to
the interests of the nation state,'' Ciputra, an Indonesian-born
ethnic Chinese property developer and banker, said after the
meeting.
	   He said the group was reassured by Habibie that the government
would provide security for all citizens, regardless of their ethnic
group.
	   Habibie recently ratified a U.N. convention against racial
discrimination.
	   Ciputra said many Chinese who had fled are returning and
bringing their capital back with them.
	   There is no reason for business people to stay overseas because
``their business cannot be easily removed to other countries,'' he
said.
	   Ciputra said the group was also reassured that the Indonesian
economy will improve after general elections next year.
	   The businessmen met Habibie to seek assurances on security
following the president's reported remarks recently that the
economy will survive even if ethnic Chinese entrepreneurs don't
return because their place will be taken over by other Indonesians.
	   In an interview with The Washington Post last weekend, Habibie
downplayed the need for ethnic Chinese business people to return to
the country.
	   Inflation, unemployment and poverty are all rising dramatically
because of the economic crisis. There are fears that violence could
break out again if the hardship continues.

Human rights group protests government threat to use security law
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A Malaysian human rights group on
Wednesday protested a threat of jail without trial for two people
alleged to have supplied media with pictures of riots at a
detention camp for illegal immigrants.
	   ``SUARAM strongly protests the use of the Internal Security Act,
as threatened by Deputy Home Minister Tajol Rosli, against a police
photographer and a former journalist for allegedly supplying
pictures of the Semenyih riots to the media,'' said Elizabeth Wong,
coordinator for the Malaysian human rights group SUARAM.
	   Riots erupted in March at four detention camps in Malaysia. The
worst occurred at the Semenyih camp, south of the capital, in which
at least eight Indonesians and one Malaysian officer were left
dead.
	   A photograph that ran in the International Herald Tribune showed
a Malaysian police officer at Semenyih poking a man with a stick as
he lay motionless on the ground. The man and several others
scattered around him appeared to have had their hands bound behind
their backs.
	   The publication of the photo prompted an investigation by the
Home Ministry.
	   Under the Internal Security Act, detainees can be put in jail
without trial.
	   Wong, in a statement, questioned why the pictures were
``suppressed'' by the Home Ministry unless it wanted to obscure the
truth.
	   Malaysian authorities have denied that human rights were
violated during the violent riot.
	   ``SUARAM demands that an inquiry be established in order to find
out the truth behind the violent event at the Semenyih camp,'' Wong
said in the statement.

PolyGram's net profit plunges due to lack of major music releases
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Dutch entertainment group PolyGram
NV said Wednesday its net profit plunged 86 percent to 38 million
guilders (dlrs 19 million) in the first six months of 1998.
	   The drop was due to a lack of major music releases and poor
showing from its film division.
	   PolyGram, the largest record company in the world, said
operating profit of the music division in the first half fell 49
percent to 274 million guilders (dlrs 137 million).
	   The decline came on the back of a weak pop music release
schedule which caused pop sales to drop by 7 percent, said
PolyGram.
	   The financial crisis in Asia also had a negative impact on
results in the first half, said the company.
	   Top selling pop releases in the reporting period included
Hanson's third album ``3 Car Garage,'' which sold 1.5 million
copies, and DMX's ``It's Dark and Hell is Hot,'' which sold 1.2
million copies.
	   PolyGram is owned by Dutch giant Philips Electronics NV, which
is in the process of selling its 75 percent stake in the music
company to Seagram Co. of Canada.
	   The Canadians have already said they will sell off PolyGram's
film division.
	   The buyer, however, will be faced with a division in the red.
	   The film unit posted an operating loss of 165 million guilders
(dlrs 82.5 million), up from a loss of 108 million guilders (dlrs
54 million) in the like period in 1997.
	   For the second half of the year, PolyGram's film releases
include ``What Dreams May Come,'' with Robin Williams and Cuba
Gooding Jr. and ``Mickey Blue Eyes'' starring Hugh Grant.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Alain Afflelou, one of France's best known
entrepreneurs, has been detained for questioning by Paris police
investigating financial scams at the Bordeaux soccer club he once
headed, judicial sources said Wednesday.
	   Afflelou, who owns a nationwide chain of eyeglass stores that
cater to the young sophisticate, was president of the club between
1991 and 1996.
	   Police are investigating whether funds from Italian financial
company Fondo Sociale di Cooperazione Europea were illegally used
to buy players and other activities.
	   Police detained Afflelou on Tuesday, judicial sources said on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   French soccer has been rocked by several financial scandals in
recent years.
	   In April, Francis Borelli, former president of Paris-Saint
Germain, was given a 15-month suspended jail sentence and fined
100,000 francs (dlrs 16,700) for irregularities during his reign at
the soccer giant.
	   In the early 1990's, former Olympique Marseille president
Bernard Tapie was at the center of a series of match-fixing
scandals.

EU opens free trade talks with Mercosur, Chile
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union's executive
Commission on Wednesday agreed on a set of rules for negotiating
free trade agreements with five Latin American countries.
	   The decision had been postponed earlier this month to give EU
farm officials time to study the impact for European farmers of
free trade accords with Chile and the Mercosur group - Brazil,
Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay.
	   But the EU's Commissioner for Latin American relations, Manuel
Marin, said that opening talks should no longer be delayed.
	   ``It's not as though this were an improvised decision. We've
been talking about it since 1995,'' he told a news conference. He
noted that since the economic crisis broke out in Asia last year,
``Latin America has become the most dynamic region in the world.''
	   France, backed by farming organizations, had raised concern that
free trade with Mercosur and Chile would harm its farming sector,
particularly meat and grain producers.
	   The European Union has been striving to expand its links with
Latin America, especially following the 1994 North American Free
Trade Agreement between Canada, Mexico and the United States.
	   The EU and Mercosur signed an agreement on trade and economic
cooperation in 1995. A similar agreement was signed with Chile, an
associate member of Mercosur, in June 1996.
	   Both agreements set out a phased dismantling of trade barriers
and increased consultations on political and economic issues. The
agreements also cover a wide range of issues from nuclear safety to
consumer protection.
	   The Commission's negotiating mandate must now be approved by EU
countries at ministerial level.

Malaysia seeking dlrs 3 billion in foreign loans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The Malaysian government plans to
seek dlrs 3 billion in foreign loans to help finance its economic
recovery packages, the Finance Ministry said Wednesday.
	   Deputy Finance Minister Affifuddin Omar said the country hopes
to raise an additional dlrs 6 billion from domestic sources, the
government news agency Bernama reported.
	   The government recently announced two fiscal stimulus packages
worth dlrs 12 billion. The planned cash injection reverses a fiscal
austerity package introduced last year to cut government spending
by 18 percent.
	   Malaysia has already secured dlrs 300 million in funding from
the World Bank and, earlier this week, Finance Minister Anwar
Ibrahim said the global lender backed a proposal for Malaysia to
borrow an additional dlrs 700 million.
	   Affifuddin said the government is trying to secure extra funds
from the Asian Development Bank, the Islamic Development Bank,
Canada and Japan.
	   He said foreign loans usually came with attractive terms such as
low premiums and long repayment periods.
	   Affifuddin noted, however, that the World Bank was charging
Malaysia the maximum rate of 6.75 percent, whereas Bangladesh was
granted loans with an interest rate of 2 percent a year.
	   Besides the fiscal stimulus programs, Malaysia is also looking
for up to 25 billion ringgit (dlrs 6.1 billion) to finance its
bad-loan bank, the Asset Management Company.
	   Moreover, Anwar has estimated that Malaysia needs another dlrs
16 billion to pay for the recapitalization of its banking sector.
	   Affifuddin said Malaysia's foreign debt totals 156.6 billion
ringgit (dlrs 38.2 billion), 38.8 billion ringgit (dlrs 9.5
billion) of which is short term.

European ministers seek agreement on marine pollution policy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BARRY HATTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SINTRA, Portugal (AP) _ European environment ministers met here
Wednesday to discuss new rules on marine pollution in the North
East Atlantic, including measures to curb decommissioned oil rigs
and levels of radioactive waste discharges.
	   Oil and nuclear companies who could face multimillion-dollar
clean-up bills depending on the outcome of the two-day meeting of
ministers from 12 European Union nations and Norway and Iceland.
	   The meeting in this town on Lisbon's outskirts, the first of the
Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the
North East Atlantic (OSPAR) at ministerial level, was due to
announce its decisions Thursday.
	   Most European nations want a sweeping ban on the dumping of
decommissioned oil rigs at sea _ an issue which sharpened in 1995
when public opinion forced oil company Shell to back down on a
decision to dump its Brent Spar loading buoy in deep waters.
	   Norway, the world's largest oil exporter, and Britain had been
the only two countries opposed to a total ban until last week, when
Tony Blair's government announced it would support a total ban at
the meeting.
	   Norway's Deputy Oil Minister Haakon Gill said Wednesday that
Oslo will support a ban as long as new rules allow special
consideration for offshore units that are too big or dangerous to
dismantle.
	   ``There is a bit of a tug-of-war going on over the large
platforms,'' Gill told The Associated Press in Oslo. ``We accept a
general ban ... but when it comes to the large steel platforms, it
must be decided on a case by case basis.''
	   Greenpeace, which has observer status at the meeting, says
Norway is reluctant to accept a sweeping ban because it wants to
expand operations into the Arctic circle where oil installations
will require heavier steel structures.
	   Proposals on radiation discharges, concerning Britain and
France, range from a total ban on discharges of nuclear waste _ the
so-called zero option _ to emissions being capped at agreed levels.
	   More than 90 percent of all radioactive waste discharges into
the sea covered by OSPAR come from three nuclear reprocessing
plants which are located at La Hague in France and at Sellafield
and Dounreay in Britain.
	   Norway wants an end to discharges from Sellafield, claiming that
radioactive buildup along its coast can be traced back to the
British plant.
	   OSPAR members have agreed to hold future meetings every five
years.

Czech poet and scientist dead at 74
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Miroslav Holub, a Czech poet known
for his sharp descriptions of grim human experiences such as aging
and suffering has died, the Czech Academy of Science said
Wednesday. He was 74.
	   Holub was still active as an immunologist in the academy and
vice-chairman of the Czech branch of the PEN Club. He died suddenly
July 14, a spokesman for the academy said. No cause of death was
given.
	   Ted Hughes called Holub one of this century's half-dozen most
important poets. Collections of his poetry that have appeared in
English include ``The Dimension of the Present Moment,''
``Although,'' ``Vanishing Lung Syndrome'' and ``Poems Before and
After.''
	   Born in the western Czech region Bohemia in 1923, the author
studied medicine and published his first book in 1958. He was the
author of 16 books of poetry, six collections of prose and three
monographs, some of which were translated into 38 languages.
	   Holub's works were banned in his home country, following the
1968 Soviet invasion of then Czechoslovakia _ an experience he
described as a ``a perfect situation of inner and outer
absurdity.'' His works were not published in his home country until
1990, after the collapse of the communist government.
	   Holub was married three times and is survived by wife and three
children.

Prodi seeks support from Communist allies in Chamber
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Will be updated after vote, expected around 1800 GMT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Premier Romano Prodi urged his troublesome Communist
allies Wednesday to join the parties in his center-left coalition
in a long-term alliance.
	   After nearly causing the government to fall last month by
refusing to vote for NATO's eastward expansion, the Communist
Refoundation party is now saying it will back Prodi in a vote of
confidence planned later Wednesday in the Chamber of Deputies.
	   But even a favorable outcome of the vote, which Prodi needs to
demonstrate his majority is still viable, may only buy temporary
peace.
	   Already, Fausto Bertinotti's Communists have hinted they may
withdraw their support this fall if the 1999 budget does not meet
their demands.
	   Refoundation is not part of the coalition government, but Prodi
counts on its votes for a majority in the lower house.
	   To win the Communists' support, Prodi promised to invest 36
trillion lire (dlrs 20 billion) over the next three years for the
south, where the unemployment rate runs twice the national average
of 12.5 percent. He also pledged to give businesses tax breaks and
implement the 35-hour work week within a year.
	   But the Communists want to make sure Prodi carries out his
pledges before giving him full support.
	   ``Today we have reached a turning point, especially on job
creation policies and aid to the south,'' the Communist's group
leader Oliviero Diliberto said during the debate. ``But much still
remains to be done to reach the final goal.''
	   On Tuesday, Prodi easily won a vote of confidence in the Senate
where he does not rely on Refoundation for a majority.

<TEXT>
	   FUJINOMIYA, Japan (AP) _ American Lisa Fernandez and China's Qin
Xuejing each pitched a no-hitter, and Italians Sun Yue Fen and
Vitalitani Patrizia combined for another Wednesday in the Women's
World Softball Championship.
	   In Group 1, Fernandez pitched a no-hitter with 14 strikeouts as
the United States beat Italy 3-0. Michele Smith hit a home run in
the second inning and Nima Lindenberg added a two-run shot in the
fourth.
	   ``It was a great step in the right direction,'' Fernandez said
after her 68-pitch performance.
	   The United States, the 1996 Olympic gold medalist, is trying to
win its fourth consecutive world softball title in the 17-nation
tournament.
	   Earlier, Italy had trounced Denmark 13-0. Fen struck out seven
over 3 2/3 innings, and Patrizia struck out three over 1 1/3
innings. The game was called after five innings.
	   Italy rapped out nine hits, including two triples and two
doubles.
	   Taiwan beat Colombia 10-0 behind Tu Hui-mei's one-hitter and led
Group 1 with a 3-0 record, followed by the United States at 2-0,
Italy at 2-1 and the Netherlands at 2-2.
	   In other games in Group 1, Canada beat the Netherlands 3-0, the
Czech Republic edged Colombia 3-2 and the Netherlands blanked South
Africa 3-0.
	   In Group 2, Australia, the 1996 Olympic bronze medalist, and
Japan remained undefeated at 3-0, followed by Venezuela and New
Zealand at 2-1.
	   Australia beat Venezuela 7-0 on Frankie McRae's home run and
Japan trounced the Philippines 12-0.

Kuwait denies it is holding Iraqi war prisoners
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Kuwait denied Iraqi allegations Wednesday that it
was holding some 1,000 Iraqis reported missing from the 1991 Gulf
War, and accused Baghdad of trying to overshadow the issue of
missing Kuwaitis.
	   Iraq said Tuesday that more than 1,000 Iraqis are still missing
and called on foreign countries to pressure Kuwait to help account
for them.
	   ``There is not a single Iraqi who is held here, except for a
crime,'' Foreign Minister Sheik Sabah al-Ahmed al-Sabah said. His
remarks were reported by the Kuwait News Agency.
	   He said Baghdad's allegations were aimed at overshadowing Iraq's
failure to account for some 600 Kuwaitis unaccounted for since
Iraq's 1990 invasion of the emirate.
	   Kuwait says it has documented proof that the missing were
arrested during the crisis, but Baghdad insists it has released all
Gulf War prisoners or lost track of them in an uprising that
followed the conflict.

	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Police detained a two Belgians and a
Dutch citizen after finding 100,000 Ecstasy tablets worth dlrs 1
1/2 million in a truck, law enforcement officials said Wednesday.
	   None of the suspects were identified beyond first names and last
initials. The tablets, worth about 18 million schillings, were
found in two travel bags, said the Austria Press Agency.
	   The Belgian driver of the truck was arrested close to
Eisenstadt, about 30 kilometers (nearly 20 miles) south of Vienna.
The two others were detained in a Vienna hotel.
	   The news agency said the arrests followed an international
investigation.

PLO will resort to `all means' for freedom from Israeli occupation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The Palestine Liberation
Organization will resort to ``all means'' to free the Palestinian
people from Israeli occupation, a PLO official said Wednesday.
	   ``As long as our lands are occupied, we have the right to use
all means to defend our legal national rights,'' Farouk Kaddoumi,
head of the PLO's political department, was quoted as saying by the
Bernama news agency.
	   Asked whether the PLO would renew terrorist attacks on Israel if
progress was not made in peace talks, Kaddoumi replied:
	   ``I don't know how the Palestinians can be patient when their
living conditions are becoming worse and worse.''
	   He added, ``When you squeeze the cat into a corner and the cat
doesn't find any outlet, it would scratch you.''
	   Kaddoumi, who arrived Sunday for a five-day visit, urged Arab
states to sever ties with Jerusalem to show support for the
Palestinian people.
	   ``We should tighten our boycott on Israeli commodities and
freeze our relations and close our liaison offices established
after the peace process was launched by the U.S.,'' Kaddoumi said.
He thanked Malaysia for its continued support.
	   Malaysia, a predominantly Muslim country, long has supported the
PLO.
	   On Monday, Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi
blamed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the stalled
Middle East peace process.
	   Israeli and Palestinian negotiators are currently meeting at the
behest of the United States.
	   The United States has called for Israel to carry out a promised
West Bank pullback and for the Palestinians to make greater efforts
to fight terrorist attacks. Palestinian leader Yassar Arafat
accepted the plan, but Netanyahu has balked, citing security
reasons.
	   During his stay in Malaysia, Kaddoumi met with Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad.

Smuggled Viagra turning up in China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese police have arrested a pharmacist for
selling smuggled pills of the much talked about impotence drug
Viagra, the Beijing Morning Post reported Wednesday.
	   Li Zhi, a pharmacist in southwestern Chengdu city, admitted to
selling Viagra on a ``very limited basis,'' the newspaper said.
	   Li sold the little blue pills for 300 yuan (dlrs 36) each, a
fantastic sum by Chinese standards and about 3 1/2 times the going
rate in the United States, where the drug is made.
	   Li claimed the bottle of Viagra found in his possession had been
given to him by a Hong Kong pharmaceuticals dealer as a gift, the
newspaper said.
	   Viagra has not yet been declared safe by Chinese health
authorities and its sale is illegal, the Beijing Morning Post said.
	   Black markets for Viagra have sprung up throughout Asia _ where
traditional cures for impotence abound _ and the drug is possibly
the most talked about medication since penicillin.

EU developing plans to fight counterfeiting of single currency
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Preparing for the introduction of a new
European currency, the European Union's executive arm instructed
its anti-fraud task force on Wednesday to evaluate the needs for
legislation to fight counterfeiters.
	   The currency, called the euro, will be introduced on Jan. 1.
Actual notes and coins will come into circulation in January 2002.
	   ``The euro will circulate very widely both within and outside
the European Union thus increasing its attraction to all kinds of
counterfeiting, including some by organized crime,'' the EU
executive Commission said.
	   A letter sent to the European Council of Ministers, the European
Parliament and the European Central Bank suggested a number of
measures.
	   Among them is expansion of the mandate of Europol, the new
European Union police organization based in The Hague, Netherlands.
Europol, created in 1994, is limited now to fighting five areas of
crime: drugs, stolen cars, illegal immigrants, nuclear material and
money laundering.
	   The Commission identified four areas where it felt quick action
is needed _ prevention and training; information, communication
systems and databases; cooperation and mutual assistance; and the
legal framework.
	   The EU says the euro will have a wider range of security
features than any currency in circulation. But officials say that
won't be enough.
	   It wants to offer training to professionals involved in
detecting counterfeit money. It also wants to standardize laws and
penalties for counterfeiting throughout the EU countries.

Miroslav Holub, Czech poet and scientist, dead at 74
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Miroslav Holub, a Czech poet known
for his sharp descriptions of grim human experiences such as aging
and suffering has died, the Czech Academy of Science said
Wednesday. He was 74.
	   Holub was still active as an immunologist in the academy and
vice-chairman of the Czech branch of the PEN Club. He died suddenly
July 14, a spokesman for the academy said. No cause of death was
given.
	   Ted Hughes called Holub one of this century's half-dozen most
important poets. Collections of his poetry publishded in English
translation include ``The Dimension of the Present Moment,''
``Although,'' ``Vanishing Lung Syndrome'' and ``Poems Before and
After.''
	   He was one of the few poets who successfully fused cold,
technical scientific terminology with the warmth of experience.
	   In ``Haemophilia/Los Angeles,'' he infused his observations on
dying and art with sensibilities garnered through medical training:
	   ``out of the piano floats
	   a pink C-sharp in the upper octave,
	   out of the violin
	   blood may trickle at any time,
	   and in the joints of the trombone
	   there swells a fear of the tiniest staccato ...''
	   Born in the western Czech region Bohemia in 1923, the author
studied medicine and published his first book in 1958. He was the
author of 16 books of poetry, six collections of prose and three
monographs, some of which were translated into 38 languages.
	   Holub's works were banned in his home country, following the
1968 Soviet invasion of then Czechoslovakia _ an experience he
described as a ``a perfect situation of inner and outer
absurdity.'' His works were not published in his home country until
1990, after the collapse of the communist government.
	   Afterwards, he traveled easily in the worlds of poetry and
science. Visiting Jerusalem in 1990 as one of the stars of an
international poetry festival, he was sought out by Israeli
immunologists.
	   Holub was married three times and is survived by wife and three
children.

Tajik president says U.N. observers killed by `traitors'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with UNHCR condemning killing, ADDS full Rakhmonov
quote, EDITS throughout to conform. &QL; 
 &UR; By UMED BABAKHANOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) _ Tajikistan's president blamed
``traitors'' Wednesday for the deaths of four United Nations
workers, saying the culprits are intent on undermining the
country's fragile peace process.
	   President Emomali Rakhmonov stopped short of directly blaming
former guerrilla fighters for Monday's killings of the U.N.
military observers. But he said that militants had previously
threatened U.N. personnel in the mountainous Central Asian country.
	   ``The people who committed this cruel crime are traitors of the
Tajik people,'' he said, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees expressed anger over the
killings.
	   ``I am deeply shocked and saddened by yet another assault on
people who have dedicated their lives to the service of peace and
humanity,'' Sadako Ogata, the U.N. refugees commissioner, said in a
statement.
	   Rakhmonov announced that a government commission had been set up
to find and punish the attackers, and he offered his condolences in
a meeting with Jan Kubis, the U.N. representative to Tajikistan.
	   Rakhmonov also fired two deputy defense ministers and
reprimanded several top officials for the failure to prevent the
attack. He ordered an increase in protection for U.N. workers in
Tajikistan.
	   The four U.N. workers were ambushed Monday while on a regular
patrol about 90 miles (144 kilometers) east of the capital
Dushanbe. All were shot in the the head, Kubis said.
	   Tajik officials initially claimed that the U.N. observers had
died when their car plunged off a cliff in the Pamir Mountains. But
later they confirmed the U.N. report of an ambush.
	   About 70 U.N. observers are stationed in Tajikistan to monitor
last year's peace deal that ended five years of civil war in the
former Soviet republic. Kubis said Wednesday he had recalled all
U.N. field teams to Dushanbe pending the outcome of the
investigation.
	   Kubis told a news conference that the U.N. workers were killed
near the village of Labidzhar while traveling between a government
checkpoint and an opposition position.
	   The main opposition alliance condemned the shootings. It said
the U.N. workers were killed after they met the opposition
commander in the Tavildara region, and were heading for the
government-controlled Garm region.
	   Despite the peace accord, Tajikistan remains restive. There are
periodic clashes between the hard-line government and the mostly
Islamic opposition. Also, there are numerous warlords who do not
recognize the peace deal and wage turf battles with one another.
	   The four U.N. workers were: Maj. Ryszard Szcwczyk of Poland;
Maj. Adolfo Sharpegue of Uruguay; civil affairs officer Yutaka
Akino of Japan and a Tajik translator, Jourajon Mahramov.
	   The attack was not the first time U.N. workers have been
targeted in Tajikistan.
	   Bakhrom Sadirov, a rebel warlord, kidnapped 23 people in
December 1996 and 16 people in February 1997. In both cases, most
of the hostages were U.N. workers. All were released unharmed after
the government freed some of Sadirov's supporters.

Three firefighters die as flames race through Athens suburbs

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A fast-moving wall of fire scorched the
edge of Athens Wednesday, killing three firefighters and sending
towering plumes of smoke over the city from a blackened
mountainside.
	   The blaze, which appeared to have started in a pine forest on
the Imittos mountain east of the city center, was fanned by gale
force winds that reached 75 kilometers (47 miles) an hour.
	   The badly charred bodies of three firefighters were found beside
their burned fire truck, authorities said. Their vehicle apparently
became surrounded by the flames, which also touched off explosions
of some bombs and shells left from World War II.
	   The fire was generally pushed away from populated areas by the
winds. But it destroyed a large tract of one of the last wooded
groves on the mountain.
	   Aircraft dropped water on the parched scrub land and forest,
managing to slightly abate the fire.
	   In neighborhoods at the base of the mountain, firefighters were
assisted by local residents with garden hoses.
	   Meanwhile, other brush fires burned in the southern seaside
suburbs of Saronida and Lagonisi, forcing the evacuation of at
least one children's summer camp, media reports said.
	   At least two warehouses and an evacuated apartment building were
burned.
	   A military Chinook helicopter assisted firefighters on the
ground, but strong winds prevented any fire-fighting planes from
battling the blaze.
	   Another large brush fire was reported on the island of
Zakinthos, about 250 kilometers (160 miles) west of Athens.
	   Wildfires are common during the hot and dry summers in Greece.
But this season has been called one of the most devastating in
decades.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with vote for prime minister likely next week in graf

 &UR; By YURI KAGEYAMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ After days of pitching their proposals to the
public, Japan's three top candidates for prime minister hunkered
down Wednesday to jockey for support among the only people voting
in this week's ballot: members of the ruling party.
	   Though the battle to replace resigning Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto has been an unusually public competition for Japan,
Friday's vote for Liberal Democratic Party president _ and most
likely prime minister _ is in the hands of 413 party members.
	   So instead of pressing the flesh in the streets and at shopping
malls, the candidates _ Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi, former Chief
Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama and Health Minister Junichiro
Koizumi _ were lobbying among their buddies in Parliament.
	   ``I'm getting requests from all three,'' LDP legislator Yoshio
Yoshikawa said, sitting in his office with a pamphlet from one of
the candidates. ``I'm intentionally not making up my mind until I
have to vote.''
	   The campaign has turned into a horse race, by Japanese
standards. Obuchi, 61, the old-guard favorite, is leading but still
far short of garnering the majority, according to Japanese media
surveys released Wednesday.
	   The newspaper Yomiuri, polling those expected to vote, found
that nearly 180 support Obuchi. About 95 said they support Koizumi,
and 65 were for the 72-year-old Kajiyama, the Yomiuri said. Dozens
of votes are still undecided, it said.
	   Those projections would not give Obuchi the majority of the 366
lawmakers and 47 prefectural (state) representatives voting at LDP
headquarters Friday, meaning the party would have to hold an
immediate run-off ballot.
	   The winner is virtually assured of being elected prime minister
in a vote tentatively slated for late next week because the LDP
commands a majority in the more powerful lower house of Parliament.
	   The three are racing to take over from Hashimoto, who announced
last week he would quit after the party's humiliating defeat in
July 12 upper house elections _ a defeat widely seen as a backlash
against the government's failure to remedy Japan's souring economy.
	   The electoral setback has forced the LDP to try to stage a more
open contest for president, after decades of choosing leaders
through backroom deals among power brokers, making the vote _ if
they bothered taking one _ a predictable ritual.
	   The selection has never before been so up for grabs.
	   If it weren't for the electoral disaster, Obuchi would have been
guaranteed the prime minister's seat. But looming fears that he
lacks the dynamic personality to win the next election have greatly
boosted the chances for Koizumi, 56, and Kajiyama.
	   ``This is unprecedented,'' said Yoshimasa Hayashi, a legislator
who is supporting Kajiyama's bid. ``This time, there is no telling
who's going to win.''
	   Hayashi has been busy all week, visiting and telephoning
lawmakers, as well as appearing on TV shows, making Kajiyama's
case. Kajiyama, considered tough on economic reform, has backing
from the business sector.
	   The possibility that the Kajiyama and Koizumi camps may join
forces to block Obuchi in a run-off is further evidence that it's
no longer business as usual at the LDP.
	   ``An Obuchi win is not a good image,'' Hayashi said. ``The party
is really changing.''
	   For decades, Japanese politics was dominated by ``habatsu,'' or
groups of lawmakers whose bosses, mostly former prime ministers,
doled out campaign cash and Cabinet posts to their members.
	   But recent changes in campaign-funding laws requiring money to
go through the party, as well as changes to single-seat districts,
have gradually made the habatsu obsolete.
	   Still, skepticism about the diminishing grip of habatsu remains.
	   ``What do you know? The party campaign continues to be dominated
by a habatsu-oriented numbers game,'' the newspaper Asahi said in
an editorial Wednesday.
	   Lawmaker Masatoshi Abe has yet to make up his mind on which
candidate to support, but he welcomes the new openness in his party
as a healthy sign of gradual change in Japanese politics.
	   ``People should vote on their convictions, not by which group
they are in,'' he said. ``Habatsu is falling apart. It can't
control everyone like before.''

	   PARIS (AP) _ A U.N. delegation flew to Algeria Wednesday on an
unprecedented mission to shed light on the sources of more than six
years of massacres, bombings and savagery.
	   The critical question is whether the group will have full
freedom of movement during its two-week mission and access to all
parties involved in the drama that has taken an estimated 75,000
lives since 1992.
	   More than 50 people were killed over three days last week,
including two sunbathers killed in a new form of violence: bombs

Mario Soares, departed from Lisbon at 1:50 p.m. (1250 GMT), U.N.
officials said. Their visit represents a breakthrough in
international efforts to carry out an independent inquiry into the
violence.
	   Algeria has long resisted an inquiry, saying such a probe would
amount to interference in the country's internal affairs.,

Afghan tribal leaders call for strict arms embargo on Afghanistan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ A council of tribal leaders from throughout
Afghanistan urged world powers Wednesday to impose a strict arms
embargo on combatants in their country's civil war.
	   Delegates to the Committee for Peace and National Unity, winding
up a five-day conference in Bonn, also called for a similar
gathering of tribal leaders in Afghanistan to try to draft peace
proposals, promote democracy and create a stable government.
	   ``We want a central government that is respected by the
international community. We don't have that now,'' conference
spokesman Hamid Sidiq said.
	   Some 85 percent of Afghanistan is controlled by the Islamic
Taliban religious army, which captured the capital Kabul in 1996.
The country has been without a central government since Islamic
insurgent groups swept communists from power in 1992 and began
fighting each other.
	   Sidiq said delegates were concerned about news Monday that the
Taliban was ousting foreign aid workers from the capital after they
refused to move from their offices to abandoned dormitories.
	   ``This is very sad for us. If we had a viable central
government, this kind of thing wouldn't happen,'' Sidiq said.
	   The committee has limited influence inside Afghanistan because
it is not supported by the Taliban, which sent no representative to
the Bonn talks.
	   But Sidiq noted that the 147 delegates that traveled from
Afghanistan included local leaders from areas controlled by the
Taliban, and that the Islamic group had not blocked their travel to
Bonn.
	   Sidiq said the group wants an arms embargo, especially from
neighboring Pakistan, which is considered a strong ally of the
Taliban army.
	   ``This is so our Afghan brothers stop killing each other,'' he
said.
	   The United Nations has proposed an arms embargo against
Afghanistan, but has not come up with an effective way to enforce
one. Policing Pakistan's porous, 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) border
with Afghanistan is virtually impossible because of a maze of roads
on the frontier.

	   ORAHOVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Albanian rebels withdrew under cover
of darkness early Wednesday from their last positions in this
strategic Kosovo town as international monitors visited the site of
one of the biggest battles in weeks.
	   Serb police, shielding themselves beneath large umbrellas from
the blistering summer sun, stared toward the wooded hills for signs
of snipers. But Serb officials said the Kosovo Liberation Army had
pulled back several (kilometers) miles to the north and no longer
threatened the town, which they attacked Friday.
	   Convoys of Serb police waving large Serbian flags rumbled along
the road from the provincial capital of Pristina, 50 kilometers (30
miles) to the east.
	   Earlier Wednesday, the U.N. refugee agency cast doubt on claims
that the town of 20,000 inhabitants was completely in Serb hands,
saying the area resounded with gunfire and occasional explosions
when its staff visited late Tuesday.
	   By this morning, however, Orahovac was quiet. The streets were
empty except for Serb police behind sandbagged abutments. A dead
horse lay on the pavement.
	   The fighting around Orahovac cast doubt on the possibility of a
negotiated settlement between Serbia, the dominant republic of
Yugoslavia, and ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of
Kosovo's population.
	   Kosovo Albanians, fighting for independence from Serbia, said at
least 36 ethnic Albanians had been killed in the fighting.
	   The capture of Orahovac would have expanded the nearly 40
percent of Kosovo the KLA is said to control _ and given the rebels
command of a key road.
	   Germany's foreign minister said NATO would likely have to get
involved to end the violence.
	   ``On both sides, there is a lack of serious effort to contain
the armed violence and resume negotiations,'' Foreign Minister
Klaus Kinkel said in Bonn, Germany.
	   Also Wednesday, a group of Russian diplomats, part of an
international observer group in Kosovo, arrived for their first
visit since the fighting began.
	   The observers issued no statement, but one acknowledged it was
difficult to assess what had happened since the warring sides made
such widely conflicting claims. The observer refused to give his
name.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, which is close to ethnic Albanian
politicians, claimed Serb forces, which moved into the town
Saturday, were still shelling KLA positions in Orahovac on Tuesday
and that fighting was also raging in outlying villages.
	   The fighting led the U.N. Security Council to vote Tuesday to
expand the peacekeeping force in Macedonia by about 300 troops,
mostly to strengthen security along borders with Kosovo and
Albania. U.S. troops will make up about half the 1,000-plus force.
	   Ending a visit to Kosovo, the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe issued a report today noting an influx of
armed fighters from neighboring Albania, increased abductions by
both sides and growing shortages of food and medicines.

Eleven soldiers detained in kidnappings of democracy activists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesian military police said
Wednesday they have detained a total of 11 members of an elite army
division accused of abducting pro-democracy activists.
	   Last week seven arrests were announced. Three more soldiers were
arrested during the weekend and the latest was taken into custody
Wednesday, said military police chief Maj. Gen. Syamsu Djalaludin.
	   Member of the Kopassus special forces group have been accused of
kidnapping dozens of activists in the weeks before Indonesia's
former President Suharto stepped down in May, ending 32 autocratic
years in power.
	   Some activists, who are now free, have testified to Indonesia's
National Human Rights Commission that they were abducted by masked
men, tortured and questioned about their political activities.
	   Human rights groups say as many as 14 activists are still
missing.
	   On Friday, Lt. Gen. Prabowo Subianto, a son-in-law of Suharto
and the former Kopassus commander, said he was ready to take
responsibility for the kidnappings if they were proven.
	   Prabowo, a controversial figure within the powerful armed
forces, said he would await the results of a military
investigation.
	   Human rights activists have accused top military brass of
ordering the abductions and have called for investigations of
Prabowo and other senior officials.
	   According to the military, the accused soldiers had only been
ordered to monitor the activities of several anti-government
protesters, but went beyond this and allegedly took the activists
captive.

Finance minister says South Africa will stick to free-market
</HEADLINE>
policies &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ South Africa's finance minister
declared Wednesday the country will stick to free-market policies,
despite calls by its labor and communist allies to vastly increase
social spending.
	   As unemployment and interest rates rise in the face of the
sinking rand, the ruling African National Congress has come under
pressure from labor and communist allies to boost spending to
create jobs and relieve poverty.
	   But Finance Minister Trevor Manuel said during a parliamentary
debate on the rand's sickly health that there would be no shift
away from the market friendly policy, known as GEAR, that the
government has pursued so far.
	   ``We have all come too far, endured too many hardships and made
too many sacrifices to reverse the course we have embarked on,'' he
said.
	   Manuel insisted that reducing South Africa's debt burden and
keeping a tight lid on inflation were the key to sustainable
growth, even if they caused pain in the short-term.
	   The rand has lost about 23 percent of its value against the
dollar this year, the same amount it lost in all of 1996, the last
time it was unstable.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Alain Afflelou, one of France's best known

headed, judicial sources said Wednesday.
	   Afflelou, who owns a nationwide chain of eyeglass stores that

100,000 francs (dlrs 16,700) for irregularities during his reign at

Progress made toward approving Ukraine's budget
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ The speaker of Ukraine's parliament
indicated Wednesday that lawmakers will not insist on debating the
government's 1998 budget before it is put into effect.
	   The decision will likely speed up implementation of the budget _
including measures required for an international loan _ and stave
off a prolonged battle between President Leonid Kuchma and
lawmakers.
	   The proposed budget calls for reducing the budget deficit by one
percentage point to 2.3 percent of gross domestic product, a key
requirement of the International Monetary Fund, which is
considering a dlrs 2.5 billion loan for Ukraine.
	   Many leftist lawmakers are opposed to budget cuts and want more
money for social programs, even if it means increasing the deficit.
	   An IMF mission is scheduled to arrive in Kiev on Thursday to
review Ukraine's economic performance, and Ukrainian officials have
said that the mission may then recommend approval of the loan.
	   Kuchma's government has undertaken a series of economic reforms
designed to appease the IMF and attract foreign investment. He has
implemented more than 30 of them by decree because parliament has
been bogged down since it took office in May with electing a
speaker.
	   After more than 20 votes, the parliament, the Verkhovna Rada,
elected Oleksandr Tkachenko, a former Communist Party official and
Soviet-era agrarian minister, on July 7.
	   Kuchma's aide, Pavlo Haidutsky, told reporters Wednesday that
the Cabinet was ready to approve the 1998 budget as soon as
lawmakers formally confirm their wish to let the government deal
with the issue.
	   Ukrainian legislation allows parliament to delegate to the
government the authority to approve budget amendments.
	   Tkachenko told lawmakers Wednesday the government should ``take
the responsibility'' for approving the budget, and that parliament
might assess the consequences of that decision afterwards.
	   Also Wednesday, Kuchma made another step to please the arriving
IMF mission by signing four new economic decrees.
	   The decrees would simplify customs taxes and ban banks from
opening anonymous accounts, a measure seen as increasing the
government's control over Ukraine's shadow economy _ said to amount
to up to 60 percent of GDP.
	   The others would speed up administrative reform, a step required
by both the IMF and World Bank, and set up a state committee to
oversee production and distribution of alcohol and tobacco and
control tax collection in this sector.

Gas tanker drivers end strike, harbor pilots stay out
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Gas tanker truck drivers on Wednesday
called off a strike and resumed deliveries to the estimated 80
percent of Portugal's gas stations that had run dry during a
48-hour stoppage.
	   But no end was in sight for a strike by 80 harbor pilots, who
guide ships into port. The strike has virtually choked the flow of
imports and exports by sea.
	   The 2,000 truck drivers voted to return to work after the
government agreed late Tuesday to drop a system of mandatory
written tests for drivers, meeting the strikers' main demand, while
the employers agreed to pay them a risk subsidy _ a bonus for the
dangerous nature of the job _ although without specifying how much.
	   The National Road Transport Association, which represents
employers, said more than 1,500 tanker trucks from about 130
distribution companies were due to begin deliveries.
	   The National Association of Gas Vendors estimated it would take
three days for gas station tanks to be fully replenished.
	   ``There was panic-buying Tuesday night. The major cities were
the hardest hit,'' the association's President Carlos Cazenave said
by phone.
	   Meanwhile, the government late Tuesday temporarily suspended a
law requiring ship captains to hire a harbor pilot to guide their
vessels into port. The suspension was aimed at getting port traffic
moving again.
	   Four ships entered Lisbon harbor on Wednesday, port authorities
said.
	   But at least nine cargo ships were anchored outside, their
captains apparently reluctant to steer their vessels into port
without a harbor pilot. A cruise liner carrying 1,200 passengers
turned back from Lisbon and headed to another unspecified country,
the government said.
	   The Harbor Pilots' Union warned the move could endanger
shipping, especially in Lisbon, where large vessels carrying crude
oil must maneuver around a sand bank at the mouth of the Tagus
River.
	   The government said it would not enter into talks with the
harbor pilots, who began a 14-day stoppage Tuesday to demand a pay
hike, a risk subsidy and the right to set their own working
conditions.
	   Following widespread allegations of corruption among the harbor
pilots, the government this year placed them under the supervision
of the port authorities _ a move resisted by the pilots.
	   More than 90 percent of harbor pilots are under investigation
for corruption, extortion and criminal association.

million in a truck, law enforcement officials said Wednesday.
	   None of the suspects were identified beyond first names and last
initials. The tablets, worth about 18 million schillings, were
found in two travel bags and the men arrested Tuesday night, said
the Austria Press Agency.
	   The Belgian driver of the truck was arrested close to
Eisenstadt, about 30 kilometers (nearly 20 miles) south of Vienna.
The two others were detained in a Vienna hotel.
	   The news agency said the arrests followed an international
investigation.

Head of UN relief coordinator for Iraq leaving
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Denis J. Halliday, the U.N. relief
coordinator for Iraq, is leaving his post at the end of September,
a statement said Tuesday.
	   ``He has the intention of winding up his assignment in Iraq at
the end of September for personal reasons,'' said the statement
from Halliday's spokesman, Eric Fault. The statement gave no
details.
	   Halliday, of Ireland, took over as the humanitarian coordinator
in Iraq last September. He replaced Staffan de Mistura, a Swede, in
handling the distribution network of the unique U.N. oil-for-food
program, which allows Iraq to sell limited amounts of oil to buy
food, medicine and other humanitarian goods.
	   Iraq has been barred from selling oil on the open market since
U.N. sanctions were imposed following Baghdad's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.

Israeli defense minister asks for U.S. help in negotiations
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to UPDATE with quotes by Arafat and his adviser &QL; 
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Signaling that their first direct talks in
months have failed, Israel and the Palestinians on Wednesday urged
the United States to resume its role as mediator.
	   The negotiations had been arranged by the Clinton administration
after it announced earlier this month it had exhausted its efforts
to broker agreement on an Israeli troop pullback in the West Bank.
	   The talks were widely seen as the last chance for Israel and the
Palestinians to reach such an agreement.
	   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said Wednesday it was
time for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat to meet to try and resolve the disputes.
	   ``What is also needed now is high-level American involvement,
with the (U.S. Mideast) envoy, Dennis Ross and Secretary Madeleine
Albright helping us to reach an agreement,'' Mordechai said.
	   When asked what he thought of Mordechai's call for U.S. help,
Arafat said: ``We are not against it.''
	   Arafat adviser Nabil Abourdeneh said three days of meetings
``ended yesterday without any progress because the Israeli side did
not present anything new and continues to reject the U.S.
initiative.''
	   The Clinton administration has been trying since January to win
support for a land-for-security plan under which Israel would
withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank, in exchange for greater
Palestinian efforts to crack down on Islamic militants.
	   The Palestinians have accepted the U.S. initiative, but Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has balked at the scope of the
withdrawal and said he needed stronger guarantees that the
Palestinians will live up to their security obligations.
	   The Israeli-Palestinian contacts began with a Sunday meeting
between Mordechai and Arafat's deputy, Mahmoud Abbas, followed by
contacts between lower-level negotiators.
	   Netanyahu has said he did not want to focus only on the troop
pullback, but also wanted to raise several other issues such as the
extradition of Palestinians suspected of killing Israelis.
	   With the resumption of the talks, Netanyahu came under renewed
pressure from both hardliners and moderates in his government.
	   However, unless a motion of no-confidence is submitted to
parliament by next week, neither side will be able to make good on
threats to bring down Netanyahu. Parliament goes into recess July
29 and will begin its fall term Oct. 19. During this period, the
government cannot be toppled by a motion of no confidence.
	   Israel's dovish opposition was divided over whether it should
try to bring down Netanyahu at any cost, even if it meant voting
against a withdrawal pullback.
	   More than a dozen legislators of the Labor Party said they would
agree to a proposal, floated by former Prime Minister Shimon Peres,
to give Netanyahu a parliamentary safety net for the next six
months if he agrees to a troop withdrawal.

<TEXT>
	   OVERLOOKING SISSANO LAGOON, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ On the hills
behind Papua New Guinea's disaster zone, a rough collection of low
huts built of sticks and sheets of woven coconut palm leaves is
being built.
	   ``We don't have a name for it yet, we just call it the
mountain,'' said Clara Asupot, one of about 200 people who have
made the narrow ridge their new home.
	   When the massive tsunami waves crushed coastal villages Friday
evening, the mountains were the only safe place. They were where
the survivors fled, battered, without possessions, many badly
injured and dying.
	   Officials say at least 1,200 people were killed and 6,000 are
missing and feared dead. Estimates of those found alive range from
2,500 to 3,500 in the chaos after the deluge.
	   For four intense and chaotic days, a motley fleet of aircraft,
from Australian military C-130 Hercules transport planes to
single-engine Cessnas and Russian-built heavy-lift helicopters,
ferried the wounded to hospitals in nearby villages.
	   The lucky uninjured remained in the hills, and makeshift refugee
camps are becoming the new villages in the 18-mile (30-km)
devastated region of the country's northwest coast.
	   ``We are afraid that the sea, the waves will come again,''
Kaiyus Rome says as he ties a nylon tarpaulin to a rough frame of
wiry twigs, the roof of his family's new home. ``We don't want to
go back down. We'll stay here. We'll build a new house.''
	   The Rev. Leo Ahanotu, a Nigerian Roman Catholic missionary,
opened his small aluminum attache case and removed the tools of his
trade: a white robe, two small silver goblets, a bottle of wine.
	   Beneath a rumbling sky of thunderhead clouds, Ahanotu performed
Mass. In a land where the belief in magic and sorcery is
traditional and the belief in Christianity is relatively new, not
all those in the village came. But many did.
	   ``We will pray for the souls of our lost brothers,'' Ahanotu
said before the Mass.
	   Cross-legged on the ground, he offered a prayer for the dead in
Pidgin, the melange of different languages that is the closest
thing to a national tongue in this nation of 700 languages.
	   On a neighboring ridge, a helicopter returns to what was Sissano
village, the former home of many of the residents here, and now the
center from which food, medicine and water are distributed.
	   This new village is a 45-minute ride away along a narrow channel
overhung by giant pandanus palms, through dense jungle.
	   What the helicopters can't carry, including household items
salvaged from the ruined villages, is ferried in by dugout canoes,
expertly maneuvered through the swamp by local men and women.
	   The new village now depends on emergency supplies of rice, flour
and water delivered by air, on the meager pickings of a few
vegetable gardens and on whatever can be foraged from the forest.
	   ``I was fishing before, but now the waves come and destroyed our
canoe,'' said Rome. ``Now some food we get from the gardens, but it
is not enough. ''
	   Around the huts, fishing traps lay unused. Inside is whatever
was left and could be carried in the narrow unstable canoes; pots
and pans, bags full of clothes, one or two kerosene lanterns.
	   Asupot sits outside her hut, grinding the flesh from a coconut
with a machete.
	   She and her family managed to jump into a canoe when they saw
the first giant wave approaching. The wave carried them into a
tree, unharmed.
	   Asupot fears her young children may now become sick; she says
the new village is cold at night. But fear prevents here from
returning to the low-lying beaches.
	   ``I don't know how long we will stay here,'' she said. ``Many of
us are still scared.''
	   Officials are warning residents to stay away from the villages
along Sissano Lagoon, because the waters are still contaminated
with bodies and clogged with debris.
	   ``The waves killed many people. We don't know how many of us are
here, some are still sleeping in the bush,'' Asupot said.
	   As those who fled emerge from the jungle, villages like the one
on the mountain may grow and become the new communities of Papua's
New Guinea's northwest coast.

Commission stands by 1994 decision on Air France state aid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Commission on Wednesday
stood by its 1994 decision to allow the French government to pour
20 billion French francs (dlrs 3.3 billion) into Air France, a
month after a European court declared the aid illegal.
	   By a majority vote, the European Union's executive body agreed
it would not reconsider its earlier decision, but would provide
detailed information in two areas where the court found the
Commission had been too lax.
	   ``We have not changed the argument, we have provided reasoning
at length,'' Transport Commissioner Neil Kinnock told a news
conference.
	   ``For us to assess the 1994 situation and come to a different
decision now would be absurd,'' he said. ``Canceling the aid is
neither feasible in law nor in practice.''
	   Last month, the European Court of First Instance, the arm of the
Court of Justice that deals with competition cases, declared the
Commission's decision to approve the aid for Air France void.
	   The court's ruling was a victory for rival airlines who had
argued the aid violated EU competition rules. The airlines were
British Airways, British Midlands Airways, Dutch flag carrier KLM
and SAS, which is jointly owned by Norway, Sweden and Denmark.
	   The court agreed with the plaintiffs on two points _ that the
use of some of the funds by Air France to buy 17 new aircraft was
unjustified, and that the Commission failed to investigate the
negative impact the aid would have on routes outside the European
Union, particularly transatlantic routes.
	   The court did not question the Commission's decision as a whole,
Kinnock said. ``I am absolutely confident that the proposal we have
today will satisfy the requirements of the court,'' he added.
	   The Commission authorized the aid because it hoped the money
would help develop European air transport. Its conditions included
assurances that Air France would neither acquire new aircraft,
merge with its Air Inter unit nor open any new routes within Europe
for three years.
	   Furthermore, the airline was to restructure and return to
profitability by 1996.
	   ``The outcome of the aid for Air France has been positive,''
Kinnock said. He said the airline had cut 9,000 jobs, reduced
operational costs by 21 percent and is on the edge of being
substantially privatized.
	   He said that other airlines, including Ireland's Aer Lingus and
Spain's Iberia, had greatly improved their record thanks to state
aid the Commission had authorized.
	   The Commission can veto state aid plans it judges harm fair
competition rules in the 15-nation bloc.

	   ORAHOVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Albanian rebels withdrew under cover
of darkness early Wednesday from their last positions in this
strategic Kosovo town as international monitors visited the site of
one of the biggest battles in weeks.
	   In the provincial capital Pristina, the Kosovo Information
Center, close to ethnic Albanian politicians, claimed 15,000 people
had fled Orahovac to escape the fighting, which began Friday with a
strong attack by the Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   The Albanian center said Serb police dragged civilians from
their homes and shot them. It quoted witnesses as saying police
also shot civilians who took refuge in the town mosque.
	   The reports could not be independently confirmed.
	   On Wednesday, Serb policemen, shielding themselves beneath large
umbrellas from the blistering summer sun, stared toward the wooded
hills for signs of snipers. But Serb officials said the KLA had
pulled back several kilometers (miles) to the north and no longer
threatened the town.

Central League beats Pacific 4-1
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAGOYA, Japan (AP) _ Rookie Kenshin Kawakami and former Boston
Red Sox pitcher Nathan Minchey gave up just three hits over the
first five innings as the Central League beat the Pacific League
4-1 Wednesday in the opener of Japan's two-game all-star series.
	   The Pacific League scored its only run in the fourth inning,
when former Milwaukee Brewers player Julio Franco singled, reached
second base on center fielder Hideki Matsui's error and came around
on two grounders. Franco, now playing for the Chiba Lotte Marines,
went 1-for-3.
	   Before he scored, the Central League already led 3-0 on a
first-inning homer by Matsui, of the Yomiuri Giants, and
second-inning RBI singles by Atsuya Furuta of the Yakult Swallows
and rookie Yoshinobu Takahashi of the Giants before more than
34,000 spectators at Nagoya Dome.
	   Matsui leads the Central League in homers this season with 20.
	   Kawakami, of the Chunichi Dragons, pitched the first three
innings, giving up two hits. Minchey, of the Hiroshima Toyo Carp,
pitched the next two innings and allowed only Franco's single.
Three other pitchers worked the last four innings.
	   In the bottom of the fourth, Kazuyoshi Tatsunami of the Dragons
walked, reached second on Takahashi's second hit of the game, and
scored the fourth run on a hit by Kenjiro Nomura of the Carp.
	   Most of the all-star players are chosen in voting by fans, but
the managers are allowed to select some additional players.
	   Franco and former Boston Red Sox player Tuffy Rhodes of the
Kintetsu Buffaloes were chosen by fans. Rhodes went hitless in two
at-bats.
	   Foreign players selected by the managers were Minchey, former
Seattle Mariners pitcher Edwin Hurtado of the Orix BlueWave and
South Korean Cho Sung-min of the Yomiuri Giants.
	   Hurtado relieved Pacific League starter Hiroshi Takamura of the
Buffaloes in the third inning and gave up one hit in one inning.
	   The most valuable player award of 2 million yen (dlrs 14,000)
went to Kawakami. He was the first rookie to win it since Kazuhiro
Kiyohara of the Seibu Lions was chosen in 1986.
	   The second game will be played Thursday at the Chiba Marine
Stadium.
	   Overall in Japanese all-star games, the Central League has 52
victories against 68 defeats. Six games ended in ties.

Singapore to launch radio station for foreigners, mainly Japanese
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore will launch a radio station for
foreigners _ mainly Japanese residents of the island republic _
later this year, the country's state-run radio corporation
announced Wednesday.
	   The International Channel will be jointly operated by the Radio
Corporation of Singapore and two Japanese-owned companies, Comm Pte
Ltd. and Newsnet Asia Pte Ltd., which will produce and market the
station's programming.
	   Scheduled to start in October, the broadcasts will be primarily
in Japanese, though shorter programs in French and German will be
introduced later.
	   Singapore has a population of about 3.1 million, not including
short-term foreign residents such as the sizable Japanese
community.
	   About 100,000 Japanese live, work and study in Singapore,
forming the largest foreign community here, the Japanese ambassador
said earlier this year.
	   ``But because of the language barrier they cannot get (regional)
information. ... I would like to provide daily updated information
to them,'' Newsnet Asia managing director Takaaki Tanabe was quoted
as saying in a report on state-run television.
	   He added that the 1.1 million Japanese tourists who visit
Singapore each year will also find the Japanese broadcasting
service useful.
	   The Japanese programming will comprise news, information and
music catering to the interests and tastes of its target audience.

Caterpillar to build plant near St. Petersburg
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ Caterpillar Inc., the American
construction equipment maker, will spend dlrs 50 million to build a
plant near St. Petersburg.
	   A groundbreaking ceremony will be held Aug. 5 for the factory,
which will produce road construction and excavation equipment, the
Leningrad region said in a statement Tuesday.
	   The plant will be capable of producing 1,500 road construction
units and 14,000 component pieces annually.
	   Caterpillar, based in Peoria, Illinois, will be exempt from
local taxes until the factory earns back its investments, expected
to happen in 2005, and for two years afterward.
	   Caterpillar is the world's largest manufacturer of construction
and mining equipment, natural gas engines and industrial gas
turbines. It employs more than 65,000 people and has more than $20
billion in assets, with 38 plants in the United States and 14 other
countries.

Prodi seeks support from Communist allies in Chamber
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING FOR ALL NEEDING &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: Will be led after vote, expected around 1800 GMT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Premier Romano Prodi urged his troublesome Communist
allies Wednesday to join the parties in his center-left coalition
in a long-term alliance.
	   After nearly causing the government to fall last month by
refusing to vote for NATO's eastward expansion, the Communist
Refoundation party is now saying it will back Prodi in a vote of
confidence planned later Wednesday in the Chamber of Deputies.
	   But even a favorable outcome of the vote, which Prodi needs to
demonstrate his majority is still viable, may only buy temporary
peace.
	   Already, Fausto Bertinotti's Communists have hinted they may
withdraw their support this fall if the 1999 budget does not meet
their demands.
	   Refoundation is not part of the coalition government, but Prodi
counts on its votes for a majority in the lower house.
	   To win the Communists' support, Prodi promised to invest 36
trillion lire (dlrs 20 billion) over the next three years for the
south, where the unemployment rate runs twice the national average
of 12.5 percent. He also pledged to give businesses tax breaks and
implement the 35-hour work week within a year.
	   But the Communists want to make sure Prodi carries out his
pledges before giving him full support.
	   ``Today we have reached a turning point, especially on job
creation policies and aid to the south,'' the Communist's group
leader Oliviero Diliberto said during the debate. ``But much still
remains to be done to reach the final goal.''
	   On Tuesday, Prodi easily won a vote of confidence in the Senate
where he does not rely on Refoundation for a majority.

Zoff, hero of 1982 World Cup, Italy's new coach
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Dino Zoff, a link to Italy's past soccer glory, was
named the new head coach of the national soccer team Wednesday.
	   Zoff replaces Cesare Maldini, who agreed Saturday to step down,
and becomes Italy's third coach in 19 months. The federation
announced Zoff signed a four-year contract, which runs through the
next World Cup, in 2002.
	   As a player, Zoff captained Italy to its last major triumph, the
1982 World Cup title. The goalkeeper played in a record 112 games
for the country.
	   He has had brief stints as coach of Lazio of Rome and Juventus
of Turin in Serie A, and is currently president of Lazio.

IMF to give dlrs 1 billion a month to Indonesia: IMF official
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The International Monetary Fund plans
to release dlrs 1 billion from a bailout package to crisis-ridden
Indonesia every month until at least the end of the year, the
fund's top official in Asia said Wednesday.
	   Hubert Neiss, IMF director for Asia and Pacific affairs, also
said an additional dlrs 1.3 billion would be released in the second
half of August.
	   Neiss made the comments to reporters on his arrival in Jakarta
to conduct a monthly review of the IMF's assistance.
	   Indonesia's economy is suffering its worst crisis in 30 years.
It has been the hardest hit by Asia's financial meltdown.
	   Neiss has been to Indonesia regularly in recent months and
played a key role in negotiating the bailout deal.
	   Last week, the IMF board approved the release of a dlrs 1
billion loan installment and a standby loan for the country.

Pakistan pushes for international mediation on Kashmir dispute

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan's foreign minister pressed
his country's case for international mediation to settle a dispute
with India over the volatile border region of Kashmir in talks
Wednesday with a top U.S. official.
	   Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub told U.S. Deputy Secretary of State
Strobe Talbott that Kashmir is probably the the world's most
dangerous conflict now that both Pakistan and India are declared
nuclear powers, government officials said. They spoke on condition
of anonymity.
	   India has refused international mediation on Kashmir, the former
princely state that was divided between the uneasy neighbors in
1947, when they gained independence from Britain. Talbott emerged
from talks in India this week with officials saying that progress
was slow.
	   Talbott also met with Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif for more than
an hour, but it appeared that no new promises were made.
	   Sharif told Talbott that ``Jammu and Kashmir was at the heart of
the deteriorating security situation in South Asia,'' according to
a statement issued following their talks.
	   The U.S. Embassy in Pakistan and Talbott's delegation have
refused to make any comment.
	   Talbott also met with Gen. Jehangir Karamat, Pakistan's powerful
army chief of staff, but an army spokesman said there would be no
statement about the substance of the talks.
	   It's widely believed that Talbott is seeking a promise from
Pakistan to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, something
Islamabad said it is willing to discuss.
	   Pakistan has also said that it will not allow itself to lag
behind neighboring India in the development of either conventional
or nuclear weapons.
	   Muslim rebels have been fighting a separatist war in
India-controlled Kashmir since 1989. India and Pakistan have fought
two of three wars over the region.
	   Hundreds of young men belonging to Pakistan's right wing
religious party, Jamaat-e-Islami, demonstrated about a mile
(kilometer) from where the meetings took place, shouting
anti-American slogans, and urging Talbott to leave.
	   One sign warned that any attempt to cap Pakistan's nuclear
program would occur ``over our dead bodies.''
	   The biggest item on Pakistan's agenda, the lifting of U.S-led
economic sanctions, appeared to be settled by a U.S. promise this
week not to block any new International Monetary Fund loans to
cash-strapped Pakistan.
	   Economic sanctions were imposed against both Pakistan and India
after the South Asian neighbors conducted underground nuclear tests
last May.
	   The tests were condemned by the industrialized nations and the
U.S. immediately imposed sanctions in line with U.S. laws. For
Pakistan, the sanctions meant a loss of dlrs 1.5 billion. They cost
India dlrs 3 billion.
	   Pakistan, unlike India, is heavily dependent on loans from
international lending institutions.
	   Foreign Exchange reserves are dropping daily, with one report
Wednesday that they had dropped to dlrs 300 million, a record low.

Australian foreign minister arrives for 3-day visit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Australia's foreign minister
arrived in Malaysia Wednesday for a three-day visit to discuss
investment ties and the regional economic crisis, the Bernama news
agency reported.
	   Foreign Minister Alexander Downer expressed his support for
Malaysia's efforts to reform and restructure its ailing economy.
	   ``I want to get a firsthand assessment of how that process is
developing,'' Downer was quoted as saying.
	   He said his visit would provide him a good opportunity to
discuss the regional downturn with Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad,
with whom he is scheduled to meet Thursday.
	   Downer was to meet with his Malaysian counterpart, Abdullah
Ahmad Badawi, Wednesday night and then on Thursday with Deputy
Prime Minister and Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim and Special
Functions Minister Daim Zainuddin, who is in charge of economic
recovery.
	   Downer said Indonesia's financial situation would also figure
into his talks with Malaysia's leaders, particularly Indonesia's
need for continued economic reforms and how to attract investors
back to Indonesia.
	   Downer is to talk with businessmen Thursday on the topic of
Australia's commitment to Malaysia and the Southeast Asian region,
said a statement from the Malaysia-Australia Business Council.
	   Asked about the anti-immigration policies of politician Pauline
Hanson, leader of the One Nation party, he said the Australian
government was concerned about engaging the Asian region, not
repelling it.
	   ``If Hanson's policies were to become reality, the Asian
investment in Australia would simply collapse,'' Downer said,
adding that hundreds of thousands of jobs were dependent on Asian
investment, the absence of which ``would cause enormous damage to
the Australian economy.''
	   Downer will leave for Manila Friday to attend the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations Regional Forum and post-ministerial
conferences July 26-29.

	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ U.S. Vice President Al Gore immediately got
down to business upon arrival in Ukraine on Wednesday, sitting down
with Ukrainian officials to discuss the former Soviet republic's
deep economic troubles.
	   The two-day visit will also allow Gore an up-close look at the
Chernobyl nuclear power plant, the site of the world's worst
nuclear accident in 1986.
	   Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma greeted and warmly embraced
Gore at the ornate Mariinsky Palace in downtown Kiev, and the two
leaders held a private meeting before opening a session of the
U.S.-Ukraine bilateral commission.
	   ``From declarations, we are passing on to real affairs,'' Kuchma
told his guest at the start of the session.
	   Kuchma praised Ukrainian-American cooperation, as did Gore, who
hailed Kiev for getting rid of the former Soviet nuclear arsenal,
the world's third-largest.
	   But Kuchma also said cooperation left much to be desired,
especially in aircraft, space and missile technologies. He also
complained of trade restrictions Ukraine faces in the United States
despite its most-favored nation status.
	   Kuchma said his government has moved to address complaints by
American and other foreign businessmen, who say bureaucracy and
corruption prevents effective business operations.
	   The United States is Ukraine's largest foreign investor,
accounting for more than dlrs 400 million of the dlrs 2.1 billion
invested since 1991 in the country of 50 million people.
	   The commission also was to discuss Ukraine's role in European
security, and Kiev's pledges to speed up economic reforms and
promote small businesses.
	   Washington has expressed displeasure with the pace of economic
reforms in Ukraine, and had threatened to withhold part of its dlrs
225 million in aid for 1998. Ukraine is the third-largest recipient
of U.S. aid.
	   Kuchma called for more assistance, saying, ``Ukraine's financial
crisis is no less complex and threatening than in Russia,'' which
has just received billions of dollars in international loans.
	   He called on Washington to help Ukraine in a project to
transport Caspian Sea oil to the West.
	   ``U.S. support for the Ukrainian route would be decisive,'' he
said.
	   Kuchma praised Gore efforts to deal with the consequences of the
Chernobyl disaster, but said more help is needed.
	   Gore, who has been involved in environmental issues throughout
his political career, chaired an international conference in New
York last year on the Chernobyl clean-up.
	   Gore will get a close look Thursday at the concrete and steel
sarcophagus covering Chernobyl's reactor No. 4, which was destroyed
in the 1986 explosion and fire.
	   He will also hold discussions on a new international effort to
raise funds to rebuild the huge shelter, which has been steadily
deteriorating.
	   So far, Ukraine has secured dlrs 390.3 million of the dlrs 758
million needed to repair the sarcophagus, Kuchma said. Kiev also
says it would need dlrs 1.2 billion to compensate for Chernobyl's
lost energy if it closes the plant by 2000, as promised.
	   During his visit to Chernobyl, Gore will stop at Pripyat, a town
next to the nuclear plant that has been evacuated due to
radioactive fallout from the accident.
	   From Kiev, Gore will travel to Moscow for meetings with Russian
officials, including Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko.

<TEXT>
	   HERINGSDORF, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl made an
eastern German swing in his re-election campaign Wednesday, warning
holidaymakers at the Baltic Sea that voting for the opposition
might bring former communists into the national government.
	   The chancellor interrupted his traditional summer vacation in
the Austrian Alps for the second time in a week to try to save his
flagging bid for a fifth term.
	   ``Freedom cannot go so far that radicals of any stripe can have
a chance of ruling Germany again,'' Kohl said in this upscale
resort, the first stop on a one-day tour of northeastern holiday
islands near Poland.
	   Kohl got applause from several thousand bathers on a square near
the dunes, but he was also heckled by a few extreme rightists and
leftist radicals.
	   Police removed one heckler after scuffles broke out between them
and the protesters.
	   Kohl trails Social Democratic challenger Gerhard Schroeder in
opinion polls. Eastern states like Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania,
where Kohl campaigned Wednesday, are especially disillusioned
because of high joblessness in the formerly communist area.
	   Kohl rolled out the ``red scare'' tactic that helped him gain
re-election in 1994 and is a campaign theme again this year.
	   He said it was ``shameful'' that the Social Democrats are
cooperating with the Party of Democratic Socialism, the successor
to the East German communists, to rule the eastern state of
Saxony-Anhalt.
	   Kohl maintains this arrangement may be repeated in Bonn after
parliamentary elections Sept. 27.
	   However, Schroeder has consistently ruled out working with the
former communists on the national level.
	   And while shunned in the west because some of its members are
unreformed Marxists, the PDS resonates with easterners who feel
left behind and colonized in the region's shift from communism to
capitalism.

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ About 600 striking baggage
handlers and airport bus drivers on Wednesday clashed with police
at Johannesburg International Airport, authorities said. At least
two officers were injured.
	   The workers were protesting future contracts for private ramp
handling companies at the nation's newly privatized airports.
	   The strikers used rolling staircases, buses and pickup trucks to
block arriving aircraft from reaching assigned parking bays.
	   With planes full of passengers parked nearby, strikers stabbed a
policeman in the leg and hurled a brick at a policewoman, who
needed several stitches in her forehead, said Supt. Eugene
Opperman, a police spokesman.
	   Police used stun guns and tear gas to move the strikers away
from the aircraft, and along with soldiers were guarding restricted
areas on the tarmac, officials said.
	   There was no danger to passengers or aircraft, said Nicky
Rose-Innes, an airport spokeswoman. The strike was called off
during negotiations in the afternoon between the union and
management.
	   About 3,000 passengers, including those on outbound flights to
Frankfurt and London, experienced travel and luggage delay, a South
African Airways spokesman said.
	   The strikers were employees of Apron Services, owned by the
company that also owns South African Airways. Under its contract
with SAA, Apron Services handles 84 percent of passenger transport
on the tarmac and baggage handling in Johannesburg, Rose-Innes
said.
	   Airports Company of South Africa, which operates the country's
nine major airports, on Monday formally requested ramp handling
companies to prove they meet certain standards, Rose-Innes said.
	   Airlines will now be able to hire only approved companies.
	   The union said that Apron Services would lose half its workers
if the company did not win approval.

Philippine president creates anti-crime agencies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada on Wednesday
created two new anti-crime agencies, moving forward on a campaign
promise to solve the Philippines' serious crime problem within six
months.
	   Estrada, who took office June 30, will personally head the
10-member Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Commission, which will
supervise a separate Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Task Force.
	   Estrada appointed a controversial police general, Panfilo
Lacson, to head the task force.
	   Lacson and 25 other police officers have been charged in the
summary murders of 13 suspected members of a robbery gang in 1995.
He and the other officers are free on bail.
	   Estrada said Lacson was the unanimous choice of various
citizens' anti-crime groups.
	   ``We mean business, but I ordered the task force to respect
human rights,'' Estrada said.
	   Lacson told reporters the task force will be composed of 800 to
1,000 policemen and soldiers.
	   The task force was ordered to prepare an anti-crime and
anti-corruption agenda for the government, identify and arrest
crime gang members and government employees involved in organized
crime, and recommend anti-crime laws.
	   The task force will focus on groups engaged in gun running,
illegal logging, kidnapping, robbery, illegal job recruitment, car
theft, smuggling, piracy, drug trafficking, forgeries, large-scale
swindling, film piracy, counterfeiting and bank fraud.
	   Citizens' groups have demanded that the government take a
tougher stand against rising crime, particularly ransom kidnapping,
which Estrada administration officials say has contributed to
capital flight estimated at dlrs 3 billion since 1996.
	   During the campaign for the May 11 presidential election,
Estrada promised to stop kidnappings and other major crimes within
six months after taking office.

French government unveils new tax measures
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France's Finance Minister on Wednesday announced a
package of tax measures which the government hopes will help create
jobs and streamline the country's cumbersome tax system.
	   Dominique Strauss-Kahn told a news conference that overall taxes
in 1999 would fall by 16.6 billion francs (dlrs 2.8 billion) from
1998's level as the government takes advantage of robust economic
growth.
	   He said growth in 1999 might exceed the 3 percent currently
forecast for this year.
	   Strauss-Kahn also said taxes levied on company payrolls and
fixed assets will be reduced over five years.
	   The measure will cost the government more than 27 billion (dlrs
4.5 billion), but is expected to create 25,000 jobs in 1999 and
``over 100,000 new jobs,'' over five years, he said.
	   Unemployment, considered France's most pressing problem,
currently stands at just under 12 percent.
	   Other tax adjustments announced include a cut in the value-added
tax on electricity and gas subscriptions to 5.5 percent from 20.6
percent.
	   Although the government excluded an overall increase in wealth
and inheritance taxes, it will create a new, highest rate for
wealth taxes of 1.8 percent on assessments of individuals' net
worth of more than 100 million francs (dlrs 16.7 million)
	   The government will also tighten regulations on taxing
expatriated capital.

	   LONDON (AP) _ The bones of Londoners who died in the past 4,000
years are going on display this fall after being dug up from
disused cemeteries and crypts, churchyards and plague pits.
	   The ``London Bodies'' exhibition at the Museum of London will
show how grim life was for many of the city's residents, whose
skulls and bones were damaged by violence, decay and diseases like
cancer, tuberculosis and osteoarthritis.
	   Simon Thurley, who oversees the skeletal remains of 6,500
Londoners in 120,000 cardboard boxes in the museum's basement, said
the exhibition focuses on the ways in which the appearance of the
city's residents has changed since prehistoric times.
	   ``We are all interested in our own bodies, and most of us are
interested in those of other people,'' he said.
	   The exhibition, which runs from Oct. 27 to Feb. 21, will start
off with photographs of today's Londoners like model Kate Moss and
athlete Linford Christie to see how their height, weight, shoe
size, teeth, cosmetic surgery and hair compares with people of the
past.
	   ``We think we have been getting bigger, but the average height
of a Roman male Londoner 1,600 years ago is the same as a Londoner
today, 5 foot 8 1/2 inches (1.74 meters),'' Thurley said.
	   The history begins with a 4,000-year-old Neolithic woman's
skeleton and skulls with cut marks and healed-over holes and dents
from 800 B.C. recovered from the river Thames.
	   There's a leather bikini from Roman times, perhaps worn by a
woman acrobat, and a fragment of human skin once nailed to the door
of Southwark Cathedral by the Saxons.
	   ``Marauding Vikings or Danes who were captured when pillaging
churches were flayed alive and their skin displayed as a warning,''
Thurley said.
	   Also on display will be the head of Archbishop Simon of Sudbury,
who was executed during the Peasants' Revolt of 1381. His head
survived because it was coated with pitch, which preserved it for
display by the rebels on London Bridge.
	   Other star items:
	   _Tudor codpieces made about 1540 to cover the front opening of
men's tights.
	   _The syphilis-deformed skull from a pauper burial ground of an
18th-century woman who died in her 20s in Southwark, notorious for
its brothels and drinking dens.
	   _Plaster casts of the heads of executed murderers.
	   _The earbones of a 9-year-old princess, Lady Anne Mowbray,
Duchess of York, who died in 1481, which were removed without
permission when her coffin was found by chance in 1961.
	   The museum had to get a special license from Britain's Home
Office to display the human relics, which it received after citing
the exhibition's educational benefits.

Indonesian president forms commission to investigate rapes in
</HEADLINE>
riots &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesian President B.J. Habibie
announced Wednesday he would set up an independent commission to
investigate rapes committed during recent rioting.
	   Women's groups say at least 168 women were sexually assaulted,
including 20 who died as a result of the attacks.
	   The riots, which broke out across the country in May, led to the
resignation of former President Suharto after 32 years in power.
About 1,200 people died in the violence.
	   Habibie told a group of women activists that the commission
would investigate rape cases and would help bring those guilty to
justice.
	   He said the commission would also look at ways of preventing a
similar outbreak of violence against women.
	   Activists say many of the rapes were committed against members
of Indonesia's ethnic Chinese minority.
	   Chinese make up a small fraction of Indonesia's 202 million
population. But they dominate industry and commerce and have become
the scapegoats for the worst economic crisis in 30 years.
	   Many Chinese are Christians and Buddhists, while most other
Indonesians are Muslims.
	   The National Human Rights Commission has accused the military
and the government of not having done enough to control May's
violence or to protect women during the crisis.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMES, Iowa (AP) _ Iowa State University basketball coach Tim
Floyd resigned Wednesday, and a New Orleans TV station said he was
expected to join the Chicago Bulls.
	   WWL-TV in New Orleans did not report what job Floyd would take
with the Bulls, and it did not say he would be the coach.
	   If he succeeds Phil Jackson as coach, it could hasten the
retirement of Michael Jordan, who has said he does not want to play
for a young college coach like Floyd.
	   Jordan has made no secret of his dislike for Floyd, who has no
NBA coaching experience and compiled a 243-130 career record with
five NCAA tournament appearances. Iowa State was 12-18 last season.
	   Jordan has ridiculed Floyd by calling him ``Pink'' _ as in the
rock group Pink Floyd. Dennis Rodman also has called the possible
hiring of Floyd ``a joke.''
	   Iowa State spokesman John McCarroll said this morning that
Floyd's resignation was effective immediately.
	   WWL-TV quoted informed, unidentified sources as saying that an
announcement of Floyd's hiring by the six-time champion Bulls could
come within 36 hours. The station said Floyd met with his players
to inform them of his decision.
	   Floyd coached at the University of New Orleans before joining
Iowa State.
	   Floyd, a good friend of Bulls vice president Jerry Krause,
interviewed with the team July 13 and was considered the leading
candidate for the job.

Britain's Royal Mail moves into Dutch postal market
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Royal Mail said Wednesday it has teamed up
with a Dutch delivery company to build a center for sending bulk
mail from the Netherlands to international points.
	   The venture with Selektvracht, a subsdiary of the Royal Nedlloyd
Group, is part of the Royal Mail's efforts to move into overseas
markets where possible. The deal follows Royal Mail's purchase
earlier this month of a 10.2 percent stake in CityMail, a Swedish
delivery company, for an undisclosed price.
	   The British and Dutch partners will build a mail sorting and
processing hub in Utretch, the Netherlands.
	   That will allow them to handle big international mailings from
Dutch companies, in a line of business that remains outside the
national monopolies held by the British and Dutch post offices.
	   Royal Mail would not disclose terms of the venture, calling them
commercially sensitive.

Saudi, Filipino executed for murder
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Saudi Arabia on Wednesday beheaded a
Filipino and a Saudi convicted of murder, the Interior Ministry
said.
	   Yolando Asanan, a Filipino, was convicted of murdering four
people by intentionally ramming his truck into their car, the
statement said.
	   Asanan was executed in the Red Sea port city of Jiddah.
	   Maqaad bin Nasser al-Subaiee was found guilty of fatally
shooting Amaash bin Marek al-Baqmy, a fellow Saudi, after an
argument. He was executed in Taif in western Saudi Arabia, a
ministry statement said.
	   The two executions bring to 18 the number of people beheaded in
the kingdom this year. Last year, 124 people were executed.
	   Saudi Arabia's Islamic courts impose the death sentence for
murder, rape, drug trafficking and armed robbery. Executions are
carried out with a sword in public.
	   Human rights groups have criticized the executions, saying that
suspects do not receive fair trials, are denied lawyers and do not
have the right to appeal.

German state party treasurer suspected of hiring hit men
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MAGDEBURG, Germany (AP) _ The treasurer for Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's party in an eastern state is suspected of hiring Russian
mobsters in a failed plot to kill a creditor, prosecutors said
Wednesday.
	   Manfred Wulfert, state treasurer for the Christian Democratic
Party in Saxony-Anhalt, denied the allegation. A party statement
said he had asked to be suspended from his party functions until
the case is cleared up.
	   Hubert Boehnig, chief prosecutor in Saxony-Anhalt state,
confirmed a local newspaper report that Wulfert was under
investigation for allegedly hiring hit men.
	   Boehnig said it might take up to six weeks to determine whether
criminal charges are filed against Wulfert, who has not been taken
into custody.
	   Prosecutors said Wulfert's name came up during an investigation
into the Russian mafia in Berlin. He is suspected of targeting a
creditor after running into financial difficulties with his
construction company, prosecutors said.
	   Wulfert denied having any contact with Russian mobsters, and
said he never hired any hit men. He declined to say anything
further.

Japanese starts swim to Korea to promote World Cup soccer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A 58-year-old Japanese began the last 51 kilometers
(31 miles) of a swim to South Korea on Wednesday to dramatize hopes
for a successful staging of the 2002 World Cup soccer finals by the
two nations.
	   The 2002 World Cup will be the first staged in Asia, and the
first with co-hosts _ Japan and South Korea.
	   Tomoshige Hirose, the owner of a sporting goods store, swam for
five hours Wednesday from Japan's Tsushima Island, going halfway
across the Korean Strait, said Keiji Shigematsu, a spokesman for
Japan's coast guard.
	   Hirose returned to Tsushima Wednesday night, and planned to
resume his swim Thursday, weather permitting, from the spot where
he left off, Shigematsu added.
	   Hirose's sponsor, Marine Pal Yobuko Co., which operates a
sightseeing boat, said Hirose was scheduled to meet the mayor of
Pusan Friday to present money to help Korean children buy tickets
for the World Cup finals.
	   Kiyonari Nakamichi, an official of Marine Pal Yobuko, said the
money would be some 400,000 yen (dlrs 2,800).
	   Hirose had left Yobuko on Japan's southern main island of Kyushu
last Wednesday and reached Tsushima on Sunday after swimming 80
kilometers (48 miles) via Iki island off Nagasaki prefecture
(state).

Israeli rabbi seeks holy scriptures in Lithuania
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) _ One of Israel's chief rabbis on
Wednesday began a visit to discuss what is to be done with about
300 scripture scrolls that survived World War II, when the
country's Jewish community was virtually wiped out.
	   Yisrael Meir Lau, Israel's chief rabbi for Jews of European
origin, wants the scrolls either handed over to synagogues or
disposed of according to Jewish custom.
	   The scrolls, currently kept at the Lithuanian National Library,
are in generally poor condition after decades of neglect under
Soviet rule of Lithuania.
	   Lithuania was a center of European Jewry before World War II.
During the Nazi occupation of 1941-44, more than 90 percent of the
country's 250,000 Jews were killed and nearly all of Lithuania's
synagogues were ransacked and burned.
	   Many of the scrolls now in the library were hidden before the
synagogue desecrations began. Many of them were kep for years on
the floor Liththe virut d.
	   Some of the scrolls were kept for years on the floor of a Roman
Catholic monastery, said Joel Lion, a spokesman for the Israeli
embassy in Riga, Latvia, which also serves Lithuania and Estonia.
	   Lion said he didn't expect a formal agreement on the scrolls
would result from the rabbi's unofficial visit.
	   ``We just want to explain to the Lithuanians how we see the
problem, to explain that these things are not like books,'' he said
by telephone.
	   Jewish tradition says damaged scriptures are to be buried in
consecrated ground, and those in good condition kept in a
synagogue, Lion said.

	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ The federal government said Wednesday
it was shelving immediate plans to sell off more than 49 percent of
the national telephone company Telstra in an effort to improve its
re-election chances.
	   Communications Minister Richard Alston said the remaining 51
percent would remain in public hands until an independent inquiry
gave the approval to Telstra's service standards.
	   The announcement followed threats of a revolt by the National
Party _ part of the ruling National-Liberal government coalition _
unless the sale was curbed at 49 percent.

Report: Slain Bahraini was intelligence agent
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with foreign minister saying slain Bahraini was an
intelligence agent &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ A Bahraini intelligence agent has been
found shot to death in a mountain town, news reports said
Wednesday. Bahrain dismissed the reports as false.
	   An-Nahar and other newspapers reported that the body of Tawfik
Abdel-Nabi al-Baharna was found Monday in the mountain town of Beit
Mery with a gunshot wound to his head and a pistol in his left hand
to imply that he committed suicide.
	   The state-run National News Agency said the victim was a
Bahraini security officer and apparently was on a mission to
monitor the activities of Bahraini opposition figures in Lebanon.
	   Lebanese Foreign Minister Fares Bweiz said Wednesday the
ministry has received confirmation from the government of Bahrain
that al-Baharna was working as an intelligence agent.
	   Bahrain's official Gulf News Agency, however, said al-Baharna
``had no connection with state security or any other official body
in Bahrain.'' It did not say what al-Baharna was doing in Lebanon.
	   Bahrain's ambassador in Lebanon is authorized to pursue the
``false allegations'' with Lebanese authorities, the agency added.
	   The Lebanese Foreign Ministry instructed Lebanon's ambassador to
Bahrain, Zuhair Kazzaz, to follow up the case, NNA said.
	   It quoted investigators as saying that al-Baharna had entered
Lebanon eight times using different names last year.
	   Al-Baharna, initially described as a tourist, was staying at a
Beit Mery hotel.
	   An-Nahar said preliminary investigations indicate that
al-Baharna was killed and his body thrown near a road in Beit Mery.

Former finance minister charged with fraud and embezzlement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ A former finance minister and member
of the Liberal Party has been indicted for fraud, embezzlement and
acting in bad faith, prosecutors said Wednesday. No trial date has
yet been set.
	   While not a member of parliament, George Danielescu is a member
of the Liberal Party, which forms part of the governing coalition.
	   Danielescu ``used money from an (investment) fund for his own
ends or to favor another company in which he had a personal
interest,'' read a statement from prosecutors, quoted by the daily
Curierul National. The prosecutor's office confirmed the report.
	   He was running a phony investment business similar to a pyramid
scheme in which many people lost large sums of money.
	   Between 1993 and 1996, Danielescu, who was manager of a savings
institute, diverted 167 billion lei, at the time worth up to dlrs
100 million according to rapidly changing exchange rates, the
statement said.
	   Acting as an investment agent, Danielescu's SAFI enterprise
received money from private investors on the understanding it would
invest the sums in other companies at interest rates of up to 40
percent a month.
	   While in pyramid schemes that collapsed in recent years from
Russia to Albania investors could withdraw their investment plus
fabulous interest money after several months, the contracts signed
by Danielescu did not allow early withdrawals.
	   A public investment watchdog revealed that the money SAFI
received was invested in a company belonging to one of SAFI'S
bosses.
	   When it was clear that SAFI was a fake enterprise, it was closed
down in March 1996 by the same group, and most investors lost large
amounts of money, sometimes their life savings.
	   Danielescu, who was finance minister in 1991-92, is not under
arrest.
	   Danielescu's party has not commented on the charges which were
first reported on Tuesday.

Australia to appeal WTO ruling on salmon imports
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australia will appeal a World Trade
Organization ruling allowing imports of Canadian salmon into
Australia, Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer said Wednesday.
	   Australia had refused to accept Canadian salmon on the grounds
that it threatened to introduce diseases into the local industry
that are endemic in the northern hemisphere. But the WTO overruled
Australia's objections.
	   Fischer said Australia could not allow the ruling to go
unchallenged.
	   ``The government is determined to defend Australia's sovereign
right to have quarantine procedures in place which reflect not only
our international trade obligations, but also our unique domestic
circumstance and relative freedom from pests and diseases,''
Fischer said in a statement.
	   Fischer said the formal notice of appeal was being lodged with
the WTO in Geneva, with a ruling expected toward the end of this
year.

Weapons make up 80 percent of Russia's exports
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Weapons account for 80 percent of Russia's
industrial exports, and are expected to reach dlrs 3.5 billion this
year, the head of state-run arms exporter said in a newspaper
article published Wednesday.
	   ``Weapons today are the most high-tech product exported by
Russia,'' Rosvooruzheniye chief Yevgeny Ananyev wrote.
	   Russia plans to deliver weapons to 59 countries this year,
Ananyev said. The dlrs 3.5 billion they will bring in is an
increase of dlrs 1 billion over 1997, he said.
	   Rosvooruzheniye has also signed contracts worth more than dlrs 8
billion for arms sales through 2005, he said.
	   In Soviet times, Moscow exported dlrs 16 billion worth of
weapons some years, but most of that was on barter basis or on
credit to the Soviet Union's indigent allies. Many of the debts
still have not been repaid.
	   In recent years, Russia has become a leading arms exporter,
actively seeking to expand its share of the market. The United
States has criticized Russia for selling arms to volatile regions,
but Moscow has shrugged off the complaint as a double standard on
the part of Washington.

Swiss president appeals to Clinton over sanctions threats
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS comment from U.S. ambassador to Switzerland in 9th graf. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss President Flavio Cotti is making
a direct appeal to his U.S. counterpart Bill Clinton over threats
of sanctions by some U.S. cities and states, the Swiss Foreign
Ministry said Wednesday.
	   In a letter, Cotti warns Clinton that the threats are
``undermining the traditionally good relations'' between
Switzerland and the United States and calls on him and his
administration to ``take decisive action against the sanctions,''
the ministry said in a statement.
	   A number of U.S. cities and states have threatened to impose
sanctions on Switzerland's two major banks if they do not agree an
acceptable settlement of Holocaust survivors' claims.
	   Talks have been stalled since Jewish leaders reacted angrily to
the offer by the banks on June 19 of dlrs 600 million to settle the
claims.
	   Switzerland's ambassador in Washington, Alfred Defago, will
deliver the letter to the White House on Wednesday afternoon,
ministry spokesman Franz Egle said.
	   Cotti's intervention was welcomed by Switzerland's four major
political parties and by the main industry body, Vorort.
	   ``We're very glad of any support from official circles,'' said
Silvia Matile, spokeswoman for the Swiss Bankers Association.
	   The Clinton administration, which has praised Switzerland for
the efforts it is making to assess its wartime past and make amends
for any wrongdoing, has repeatedly opposed the sanctions.
	   ``We are in basic agreement with President Cotti's principal
point that sanctions are inappropriate,'' Madeleine Kunin, U.S.
ambassador to Switzerland, said in a statement. ``We continue to
strongly oppose sanctions.''
	   Cotti restated Switzerland's intention to continue with its
efforts, which include a fund to help needy Holocaust survivors, an
independent panel of historians reviewing the period, and a
U.S.-led committee investigating Holocaust-era assets in Swiss
banks.
	   His letter referred to ``the exceptionally intense nature of
economic relations between the two countries, as well as to the
fact that Switzerland ranks as one of the United States' largest
investors.''
	   During a brief visit to Geneva in May, the U.S. president
assured Swiss officials of his opposition to sanctions.
	   Cotti noted a joint statement by the U.S. and Swiss governments
in March, opposing any local or state boycotts from the United
States against Swiss banks over treatment of Holocaust victims.

Australia's Antarctic icebreaker disabled by engine room fire
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HOBART, Australia (AP) _ An engine room fire has disabled the
Australian icebreaker Aurora Australis in sea ice, deep in
Antarctic waters, scientists said Wednesday.
	   There were no injuries and the ship was not in danger after the
fire Tuesday night, Australian Antarctic Division director Rex
Moncur said.
	   But Moncur said he expected the ship would have to abandon its
pioneering midwinter voyage to the edge of the Antarctic continent
and return to Hobart for repairs.
	   The fire had been extinguished and the engines were turned off,
leaving the ship in sea ice about 115 miles (185 kilometers) from
the Antarctic coast, he said.
	   The weather was good.
	   The crew had to wear breathing apparatus to enter the engine
room and it was likely to be 24 hours before the damage could be
fully assessed.
	   The Aurora, with 54 expeditioners and 25 crew, left Hobart last
Wednesday for a seven-week voyage that was to have focused on a
polynya, an area where savage winds break up the sea ice and cause
heavy, salt-laden water to sink to the bottom.
	   Oceanographers believe a closer study of the phenomenon would
lead to a better understanding of climate change and how the sea
absorbs carbon gases from the atmosphere.
	   The Aurora was just reaching the polynya when the fire, whose
cause was not yet known, broke out, Moncur said.

	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A Ukrainian passenger plane made an
emergency landing soon after taking off from the Boryspil Airport
near Kiev, the Emergency Situations Ministry said Wednesday.
	   The Boeing-737, owned by the Aerosweet air company, landed at

Indonesian fishing vessel sunk by Australian navy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ An Indonesian fishing boat was rammed
accidentally and sunk Wednesday by an Australian navy patrol boat
after being caught fishing illegally in Australia's northern
waters.
	   Five Indonesian crewmen and two members of a navy boarding party
were rescued unharmed from the water by the HMAS Cessnock, a navy
spokesman said.
	   He said two Indonesian fishing boats had been intercepted and
successfully boarded Tuesday after they were caught fishing
illegally within the Australian Fishing Zone.
	   ``At around 1:30 am. on July 22, Cessnock was leading the two
fishing boats to Darwin,'' the spokesman said. ``But because her
minimum speed was greater than the top speed of the foreign fishing
vessels, she needed to reverse course to circle around the boats
every two hours or so.
	   ``During one of the maneuvers, the trailing fishing boat
apparently swerved off course and crossed the bow of Cessnock. A
collision was unavoidable despite evasive action taken by
Cessnock.''
	   Wednesday's incident follows criticism of the defense force for
being too lenient on Indonesian fishing vessels after another
intruder led HMAS Cessnock on a 500-kilometer (300-mile) chase
earlier this month.
	   Despite shots fired across the bow and the two vessels colliding
without damage, the fishing boat escaped into Indonesian waters.

Drought returning to central Vietnam
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Drought is returning to central Vietnam
amid a heat wave that has sent temperatures soaring to 40 degrees
Celsius (104 F), the official Vietnam News Agency reported
Wednesday.
	   Since last November, the country has been battered by a typhoon,
the worst drought in a century and recent flooding after the late
onset of the rainy season.
	   Damage from Typhoon Linda and the drought has been estimated at
dlrs 1 billion and has led the government to start increasing its
national food reserves by 10 percent.
	   But clearing skies over much of Vietnam have ended the showers
and dried up many reservoirs, including 32 of 34 in the central
province of Quang Binh and 80 of 93 in neighboring Quang Tri
province, VNA said.
	   In Quang Tri province, the water table has fallen so much that
ocean saltwater has encroached 20 to 30 kilometers (12 to 19 miles)
inland.
	   Weather forecasters say no major rains are expected in the
center before the end of July or early August.
	   Meanwhile, rivers in the north are rising from showers upstream
and the discharge of water from the country's biggest reservoir,
Hoa Binh. Flash floods killed 12 people in five northern provinces
earlier this month.

Chinese president orders army out of business to stop smuggling
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese President Jiang Zemin has ordered the
military to shut down its business as part of a government campaign
to end rampant smuggling, state media reported Wednesday.
	   The order, issued at a closed-door meeting between Jiang and top
People's Liberation Army commanders Monday and Tuesday, confirmed
suspicions of military involvement in smuggling and that its
enterprises have been a conduit for the illegal trade.
	   In ordering the closing of the military's vast business empire _
which stretches from medicines to five-star hotels _ Jiang urged
the commanders to understand the PLA's reputation was at stake, the
Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   The move underscored the urgency of the week-old government
crackdown on smuggling and was a bold political stroke for Jiang.
	   The 3 million-member PLA is a powerful force in Chinese
politics. Although Jiang heads the ruling Communist Party and its
commission that oversees the PLA, he is a technocrat with no
military experience, unlike his revolution-hardened predecessors.
	   China Central Television, on the nationwide evening newscast,
showed Jiang flanked by senior PLA commanders, addressing a room
full of officers seated behind desks and taking notes.
	   Jiang told the officers that they must cooperate with
anti-smuggling investigators and that PLA enterprises will not be
spared, Xinhua said.
	   ``Smuggling has been rampant in parts of the country and some
government departments,'' Xinhua paraphrased Jiang as saying.
``This kind of severe crime will bring enormous danger to the
society if it is not firmly abolished.''
	   Smugglers spirit everything from oil to luxury cars and
cigarettes into China to avoid high taxes. The trade has distorted
government attempts to set up capitalist-style free markets,
compounded problems for the fledgling auto industry and cut profit
margins for domestic oil companies, Xinhua said.
	   All told, smuggling may be costing the Chinese government and
enterprises as much as 100 billion (dlrs 12 billion) a year in lost
revenues and business, Xinhua said, citing the General
Administration of Customs.
	   Jiang and Premier Zhu Rongji ordered the nationwide crackdown
last week and set up a new task force of police and customs and
business inspectors. The force, placed directly under Zhu's
authority, was given the power to arrest suspects and conduct
preliminary hearings.
	   Getting the military out of business may not be so easy. The PLA
depends on its enterprises for over a third of the funds needed to
keep the military going. State media gave no indication of how the
businesses are to be closed and by what time.
	   The move, however, has been long seen by some in China's defense
establishment as necessary to building a more modern military.
Weapons research and production, once the province of PLA companies
and think-tanks, have in recent years been turned over to companies
and institutions more directly controlled by the government.

Zoff, hero of 1982 World Cup, Italy's new coach
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INSERTS background &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Dino Zoff, a link to Italy's past soccer glory, was
named the new head coach of the national soccer team Wednesday.
	   Zoff replaces Cesare Maldini, who agreed Saturday to step down,
and becomes Italy's third coach in 19 months. The federation
announced that Zoff signed a four-year contract, which runs through
the next World Cup, in 2002.
	   As a player, Zoff captained Italy to its last major triumph, the
1982 World Cup title. The goalkeeper played in a record 112 games
for the country.
	   He has had brief stints as coach of Lazio of Rome and Juventus
of Turin in Serie A, and is currently president of Lazio.
Speculation that he would take over for Maldini began immediately
after Italy was knocked out of the World Cup quarterfinals by
France on penalty kicks.
	   Maldini replaced Arrigo Sacchi in December 1996 and had a record
of 11 wins, 7 draws and two losses as Italy's coach. But he often
was criticized for overly defensive tactics.
	   His contract expires at the end of the year and he has been
offered another position with the federation.
	   Zoff, 56, was a candidate to replace Sacchi in 1996.
	   During a playing career that spanned three decades, mostly with
Juventus and Napoli, Zoff won six Serie A championships and two
Italian Cups. He then coach Juventus to one Italian Cup title and
became president of Lazio in 1994.
	   When Lazio fired coach Zdenek Zeman during the 1996-97 season,
Zoff moved to the bench and lifted the club from 12th place up to
fourth in the final 18-team standings.

	   Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands from
the National Weather Service.
	   Dry and stable atmospheric conditions are expected to prevail
across the local area today before a modest increase in moisture
begins tomorrow evening. In addition, hazy skies will persist due
to another cloud of African dust moving across the Atlantic and
into our region.
	   The stable conditions aloft will only help to trap this dust in
the low and middle levels, and this could reduce visibility below 6
miles.
	   Strong trade winds continue across the local region today as
high pressure across the central Atlantic predominates. These winds
will gradually subside later today through Friday, with seas
diminishing very slowly.
	   A small craft advisory remains in effect for all local waters
and is expected to continue in effect until at least the evening.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with ethnic Albanian allegations of atrocities. Minor

<TEXT>
	   ORAHOVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian rebels withdrew
under cover of darkness early Wednesday from their last positions
in this strategic Kosovo town as international monitors visited the
site of one of the biggest battles in weeks.
	   Serb police, shielded beneath large umbrellas from the
blistering summer sun, stared toward the wooded hills for signs of
snipers. But Serb officials said the Kosovo Liberation Army, which
is fighting for independence from Serbia, had pulled back several
miles to the north.
	   Convoys of Serb police waving large Serbian flags rumbled along
the road from the provincial capital of Pristina, 50 kilometers (30
miles) to the east.
	   In Pristina, the Kosovo Information Center, which is close to
ethnic Albanian politicians, claimed 15,000 people had fled
Orahovac to escape the fighting, which began Friday with a strong
attack by the KLA.
	   The Albanian center said Serb police dragged civilians from
their homes and shot them. It quoted witnesses as saying police
also shot civilians who took refuge in the town mosque.
	   The reports could not be independently confirmed.
	   Earlier Wednesday, the U.N. refugee agency cast doubt on claims
that the town of 20,000 inhabitants was completely in Serb hands,
saying the area resounded with gunfire and occasional explosions
when its staff visited late Tuesday.
	   By this morning, however, Orahovac was quiet. The streets were
empty except for Serb police behind sandbagged abutments. A dead
horse lay on the pavement.
	   The fighting around Orahovac cast doubt on the possibility of a
negotiated settlement between Serbia, the dominant republic of
Yugoslavia, and ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of
Kosovo's population.
	   Kosovo Albanians said at least 36 ethnic Albanians had been
killed in the fighting.
	   The capture of Orahovac would have expanded the nearly 40
percent of Kosovo the KLA is said to control _ and given the rebels
command of a key road.
	   Germany's foreign minister said NATO would likely have to get
involved to end the violence.
	   ``On both sides, there is a lack of serious effort to contain
the armed violence and resume negotiations,'' Foreign Minister
Klaus Kinkel said in Bonn, Germany.
	   Also Wednesday, a group of Russian diplomats, part of an
international observer group in Kosovo, arrived for their first
visit since the fighting began. The observers issued no statement.
	   The Kosovo Information Center claimed Serb forces, which moved
into the town Saturday, were still shelling KLA positions in
Orahovac on Tuesday and that fighting was also raging in outlying
villages.
	   The fighting led the U.N. Security Council to vote Tuesday to
expand the peacekeeping force in Macedonia by about 300 troops,
mostly to strengthen security along borders with Kosovo and
Albania. U.S. troops will make up about half the 1,000-plus force.
	   Ending a visit to Kosovo, the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe issued a report Wednesday noting an influx of
armed fighters from neighboring Albania, increased abductions by
both sides and growing shortages of food and medicines.

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Ending a nearly two-year battle for
supremacy, Spain's two main digital television companies made a
surprise announcement Wednesday that they plan to merge.
	   Between them, government-backed Via Digital and privately owned
Canal Satelite Digital currently have some 800,000 subscribers and
offer some 150 channels.
	   In a statement issued after a day of talks Wednesday,
Telefonica, the main shareholder in Via Digital, said the two
companies would proceed with the legal, commercial and financial
steps necessary to conclude the agreement by September 30.
	   The announcement took many by surprise because less than a year
ago the two companies were locked in bitter disputes over issues
ranging from the lucrative rights to broadcast soccer games to
which types of decoders would be used by each company.
	   Many saw the disagreements as part of a broader battle between
the conservative government of Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar and
Sogecable, owned by Spain's largest media conglomerate, Grupo
Prisa, which is traditionally linked to the opposition Socialist
party.
	   The daily El Mundo reported Wednesday that under the deal, each
company would hold 50 percent of the new enterprise. Its
chairmanship would alternate between them every two years.
	   The accord was reached by Telefonica chairman Juan Villalonga
and Jesus Polanco, head of Canal Satelite's parent company,
Sogecable.
	   El Mundo said meetings in recent weeks between the two companies
led to speculation of increased cooperation, but that a fusion had
not been expected.
	   Canal Satelite was launched in January 1997 while Via Digital,
whose shareholders also include Spanish national television and the
Mexican media conglomerate Televisa, began broadcasting eight
months later.

More than 26,000 petitions, complaints handled in five months
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ In Vietnam, they can measure complaints
and petitions by the pound (kilogram).
	   In the first five months of the year, some 30,000 have been
filed by citizens, many complaining about the type of local
corruption and abuse of power that sparked unrest in several
provinces in 1997.
	   That has led the government to promise to be more responsive to
accusations from the grassroots level before they can inflame local
passions.
	   The newspaper People's Army reported Wednesday that more than
26,000 of the citizen initiatives have been settled by the central
or local governments.
	   It said inspection offices have recommended prosecution against
62 state workers who committed serious offenses and 30 citizens who
abused the complaint process to cause public disorder, attack
authorities and damage state and private property.
	   Prime Minister Phan Van Khai told the local press recently that
he receives dozens of pounds (kilograms) of petitions and
complaints from people each week.
	   The National Assembly failed at its spring session to pass a
much-publicized law on petitions and denouncements. It is expected
to be considered again at the monthlong session that opens in
October.

English wonderboy earns his first pro golf pay day

	   HILVERSUM, Netherlands (AP) _ Justin Rose, the amateur sensation
of the British Open, gained instant reward on his first day as a
professional Wednesday by winning a pro-am tournament.
	   This time the 17-year-old was able to take the 750 pound (dlrs
1,233) check home.
	   Rose teamed up with three local amateurs to win the friendly
tournament ahead of the Dutch Open which starts Thursday at the par
71 Hilversumsche course.
	   Virtually unknown a week ago, Rose became a national hero in
Britain after he wound up tied for fourth place as an amateur in
the Open at Royal Birkdale. He crowned his tournament with a
show-stopping 45-yard chip in from rough short of the 18th green.
	   Had he turned pro before the tournament he'd have earned
69,875-pound (dlrs 114,874) for his fourth place. Instead he picked
up a silver medal as the highest-placed amateur.
	   ``At Royal Birkdale I was surprisingly relaxed,'' Rose told a
packed press conference Wednesday. ``This week I guess I am
stepping into the unknown a little bit so there are going to be a
few nerves.''
	   But whatever happens in the Dutch Open, Rose has lofty
ambitions.
	   Asked what he wants to win in the coming decade, Rose replied:
``A couple of majors. ... And to play in the Ryder Cup. That would
be, you know, unbelievable. That is a top priority definitely.''
	   And established stars here were predicting Rose has the game to
fulfill those ambitions.
	   ``He's a very complete player,'' Nick Price said after playing
14 holes with Rose. ``He's a good driver, iron player. I didn't see
any flaws ... and his confidence level is probably as high as those
clouds up there,''
	   Phil Mickelson agreed.
	   ``The guy has a lot of talent,'' said Mickelson, one of the
favorites to take the Dutch Open title. ``I don't think it was a
surprise to him or the players after watching him in the Walker Cup
last year.''
	   Rose won two out of a possible four points as British and Irish
players lost amateur golf's top team event to their American
counterparts at Quaker Ridge last August.
	   Now his first goal is to gain a European Tour card without
having to go to qualifying school. He is entitled to seven
sponsor's exemptions this season and must win some 50,000 pounds
(dlrs 82,200) to earn his card.
	   Rose, who started swinging a club at 11 months and was playing
off a one handicap by 14 years, left school last year to play full
time. He said he had been considering turning pro for some time but
wanted to end his amateur career in style.
	   ``The way it turned out would have been the way I would have
written it in a fairy tale,'' said Rose, flashing the same broad
smile that was fixed to his face throughout the British Open.
	   Now it's down to the hard grind of the pro tour.
	   Playing for a winner's prize of 475,000 guilders (dlrs 219,145)
Rose takes on a field including left-hander Mickelson, Price, and
another rising English star, Lee Westwood.
	   Spain's Seve Ballesteros, Zimbabwe's Mark McNulty and Bernard
Langer of Germany, all previous winners of the Dutch Open, also are
in the field along with defending champion Sven Struver of Germany
who shot a final round five-under par 66 to win in a Hilversumsche
record 18-under 266 last year.
	   The undulating, heavily wooded course 40 kilometers (25 miles)
east of Amsterdam, is hosting the Dutch Open for the 19th time.

English character actor Michael Denison dies at 82
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Michael Denison, the most gentlemanly of English
character actors and a lifelong partner on and off stage with wife
Dulcie Gray, has died at age 82, his agent said Wednesday.
	   Miss Gray was with Denison when he died Tuesday night at his
home in Amersham, just outside London, agent Barry Burnett said.
The cause of death was not announced, but Denison recently had been
ill with cancer.
	   Denison and Miss Gray were married for 59 years and appeared
together in more than 30 theatrical productions in London.
	   His last appearance was with his wife in April in their
two-person show ``Curtain Up,'' an evening of reminiscences,
Burnett said.
	   In May 1996, they made their Broadway debut in an acclaimed
revival of Oscar Wilde's ``An Ideal Husband.'' Writing in The New
York Times, critic Vincent Canby said: ``It's good to see Denison
and Ms. Gray, who are husband and wife and icons of the English
cinema of the 1950s, so full of zest in the 1990s.''
	   That production's director, Sir Peter Hall, on Wednesday praised
Denison as ``a very complete actor.''
	   ``Because he was very much a gentleman-actor, people could very
easily underestimate what a consummate technician he was, and how
well he knew his theater and his theater technique,'' Hall told the
AP.
	   Denison met Miss Gray at a drama school, and they married in
1939. She established herself as a film star while Denison put
acting aside to serve in military intelligence during the war.
	   The pair first appeared together on screen in 1945 in ``My
Brother Jonathan,'' followed by another hit, ``The Glass
Mountain.''
	   Throughout his career, he moved between the theater, television
and film, working often _ though by no means exclusively _ opposite
his wife.
	   They appeared on stage together in such plays as ``The
Fourposter'' (1950), ``Heartbreak House'' (1961) and ``Where Angels
Fear To Tread'' (1963).
	   Away from his wife, Denison was a memorably witty Algernon in
the celebrated 1952 film of Wilde's best-known play, ``The
Importance of being Earnest.''
	   From 1957 to 1963, he made over 80 episodes of the TV series
``Boyd QC,'' in between which he toured to Australia in ``My Fair
Lady'' and to Hong Kong and the Berlin Festival.
	   But it was in his native England that Denison was hailed as the
embodiment of the well-bred gentleman-actor of a vanishing age.
	   In 1965, he appeared on the West End, again oppoite his wife, as
Sir Robert Chiltern in ``An Ideal Husband,'' returning to Wilde's
1895 comedy 27 years later in a senior role.
	   Hall's revival opened on the West End in 1992 and proved the
most successful-ever London production of a Wilde play. It is still
running.
	   Denison's last film role was in 1994's ``Shadowlands,'' which
starred Anthony Hopkins and Debra Winger.
	   Denison was born in Doncaster in Yorkshire, north England. His
education at Harrow and Oxford University equipped him well to play
members of the English elite.
	   In addition to his acting credits, he wrote two books,
``Overture and Beginners'' in 1973 and a companion piece, ``Double
Act,'' in 1985. At the time of his death, he had been planning a
book about the dramatist J.B. Priestley, who was a friend.
	   Denison and Miss Gray had no children.
	   Funeral arrangements were not immediately available.

Rios advances as upsets hit Mercedes Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ Chile's Marcelo Rios, making another
run at No. 1, won in straight sets Wednesday to avoid a rash of
upsets that swept the Mercedes Cup.
	   Rios, who would pass Pete Sampras at the top of the ATP rankings
if he reaches the final, blew past Germany's error-prone Jens
Knippschild, 7-6 (7-5), 6-2 to reach the third round of the dlrs
1.04 million tournament.
	   But five other seeds, including former French Open winner
Yevgeny Kafelnikov didn't fare as well.
	   Czech player Bohdan Ulihrach ousted the No. 4 seeded Russian,
6-3, 3-6, 6-3. Upsets also claimed No. 8 Alberto Berasategui of
Spain, No. 10 Thomas Muster and No. 12 Fabrice Santoro of France.
	   Rios, briefly the world No. 1 this spring, survived an early
break in the first set as the German charged the net and slammed
winners all over the court.
	   But Rios climbed back into the match when the German, who
reached the round of 16 at the French Open, began to make easy
errors.
	   Knippschild fell apart, losing the second set easily, after
letting a 4-1 lead in the tie break slip away. His double fault at
5-5 topped a string of mishit shots.
	   Rios also had a chance to pass Sampras for the top ranking at
Wimbledon but was ousted in the first round.
	   France's Guillaume Raoux swept past Berasategui, 6-1, 6-2,
France's Fernando Vicente downed Muster, 6-3, 6-7 (7-5), 7-5 and
Spain's Albert Portas edged Santoro, 1-6, 6-2, 7-6 (9-7).
	   Germany's Hendrik Dreekmann also upset 15th-seeded Magnus
Larsson of Sweden, 6-4, 7-5.
	   Albert Costa of Spain, the No. 6 seed, also advanced by rolling
past Argentina's Franco Squillari, 6-3, 6-4.
	   Boris Becker and French Open champion Carlos Moya were among the
top players scheduled to play later Wednesday.

Government pledges to stand firm on immigration
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ With Italy's allies watching, the government pledged
Wednesday to keep its tough immigration policy despite a new wave
reaching the country's coastlines.
	   Hundreds of would-be immigrants -- most of them North Africans
-- have been arriving nearly daily in Sicily and tiny Italian
islands near the African coast.
	   Since July 1, authorities have tracked dowm 2,773 people who
have landed on Italian shores.
	   Most of them are expected to be expelled quickly.
	   Interior Minister Giorgio Napolitano, answering questions in
parliament Wednesday, issued assurances that no amnesty was
contemplated.
	   ``There will be no legalization for anyone who arrived
clandestinely,'' he said.
	   Clandestine arrivals earlier this year by hundreds of Kurdish
refugees from Turkey led to an outcry from Germany, which claimed
Italy was a transit point for refugees seeking jobs and to reach
their families in northern Europe.
	   Under the European Union's open borders policy, Italy is obliged
to send illegal immigrants home.
	   Warm weather and calm seas have been an inducement to ship
captains bringing in people from North Africa or from the Balkans
and Turkey across the Adriatic.
	   At least nine people have drowned in the past month when small,
overloaded craft capsized off Italian shores.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A fast-moving wall of fire scorched the
edge of Athens Wednesday, killing four firefighters and sending
towering plumes of smoke over the city from a blackened
mountainside.
	   The blaze, which appeared to have started in a pine forest on
the Imittos mountain east of the city center, was fanned by gale
force winds that reached 75 kilometers (47 miles) an hour.
	   The badly charred bodies of three firefighters were found beside
their burned fire truck, which apparently became surrounded by the
flames, authorities said. A volunteer fireman who tried to help
them off the hillside was also killed, fire officials said.
	   The flames reportedly touched off explosions of some bombs and
shells left from World War II.

</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with details of Halliday's work on program, spokesman
saying dissatisfaction probably reason for leaving. RECASTS lede to
say Halliday criticized sanctions, UPDATES with Halliday quotes,
complaints about delays in New York, SUBS overline &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Denis J. Halliday, the U.N. relief
coordinator for Iraq who had criticized U.N. sanctions and had
pushed to get more humanitarian aid for Iraqis, is leaving his post
at the end of September.
	   Halliday's spokesman, Eric Fault, said in an interview Wednesday
that Halliday's dissatisfaction with the relief effort and the
sanctions program was probably among his reasons for leaving.
Nevertheless, he was the longest-serving U.N. relief coordinator in
Baghdad, a spokesman noted.
	   A statement said he was leaving Baghdad for personal reasons. A
successor hasn't been named.
	   Halliday, an Irish national, took over as the humanitarian
coordinator in Iraq in September of last year, trying to balance
the needs of the Iraqi people with the harsh sanctions imposed on
Iraq by the Security Council.
	   He replaced Staffan de Mistura, a Swede, in handling the
distribution network of the unique U.N. oil-for-food program, in
which Iraq can sell its oil to purchase food, medicine and other
humanitarian goods.
	   Iraq has been barred from selling oil on the open market since
U.N. sanctions were imposed following Baghdad's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.
	   He was one of the strongest U.N. advocates of increasing the
amount of aid Iraqis got, sometimes citing malnutrition reports in
his dealings with reporters.
	   His lobbying helped result in the Security Council increasing
the amount of oil Iraq can sell over six months to dlrs 5.2
billion, up from about dlrs 2 billion.
	   He told reporters in Baghdad in February that he opposed the
U.N. sanctions because of their ``devastating impact on the small
people.''
	   ``None of the (U.N.) member states intended that the sanctions
program would be so harsh on individual Iraqis,'' he said.
	   He repeatedly expressed concern about delays in New York in
approving Iraqi oil contracts because it delayed the delivery of
needed food, medicine and other goods.
	   John Mills, a spokesman for the Iraq program, said Halliday was
the longest-serving relief coordinator since the oil-for-food
program was launched. He said U.N. officials had known for some
time that Halliday had intended to complete the 12 months of what
he said was a very difficult and demanding job.

	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Tim Floyd resigned Wednesday from Iowa State
University and will be hired as head coach of the Chicago Bulls, a
source in the Bulls organization said.
	   The announcement will be made Thursday, the source said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Bulls spokesman Tim Hallam said he could not confirm the
information.
	   Floyd and his family were at the Ames, Iowa, airport this
morning and he said he was heading ``out of town.'' He wouldn't
comment further.
	   The hiring of Floyd to succeed Phil Jackson as coach could
hasten the retirement of Michael Jordan, who has said he does not
want to play for a young college coach like Floyd.
	   Jordan has made no secret of his dislike for the 44-year-old
Floyd, who has no NBA coaching experience and compiled a 243-130
career record with five NCAA tournament appearances. He has been at
Iowa State four years and his team went 12-18 last season.
	   Jordan has ridiculed Floyd by calling him ``Pink'' _ as in the
rock group Pink Floyd. Dennis Rodman also has called the possible
hiring of Floyd ``a joke.''
	   Iowa State spokesman John McCarroll said Floyd's resignation
took effect immediately.
	   WWL-TV in New Orleans had reported that Floyd would join the
Bulls' organization within 36 hours. It did not report what
position he would take.
	   Floyd, who coached at the University of New Orleans before
joining Iowa State, met with his players to inform them of his
decision, WWL-TV said.
	   Floyd, a good friend of Bulls vice president Jerry Krause,
interviewed with the team July 13 and was considered the leading
candidate for the job.

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Denis J. Halliday, the U.N. relief
coordinator for Iraq who had criticized U.N. sanctions and had
pushed to get more humanitarian aid for Iraqis, is leaving his post
at the end of September.
	   Halliday's spokesman, Eric Fault, said in an interview Wednesday
that Halliday's dissatisfaction with the relief effort and the
sanctions program was probably among his reasons for leaving.
Nevertheless, he was the longest-serving U.N. relief coordinator in
Baghdad, a spokesman noted.
	   A statement said he was leaving Baghdad for personal reasons. A
successor hasn't been named.
	   Halliday, an Irish national, took over as the humanitarian
coordinator in Iraq in September of last year, trying to balance
the needs of the Iraqi people with the harsh sanctions imposed on
Iraq by the Security Council.
	   He replaced Staffan de Mistura, a Swede, in handling the
distribution network of the unique U.N. oil-for-food program, in
which Iraq can sell its oil to purchase food, medicine and other
humanitarian goods.
	   Iraq has been barred from selling oil on the open market since
U.N. sanctions were imposed following Baghdad's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.
	   He was one of the strongest U.N. advocates of increasing the
amount of aid Iraqis got, sometimes citing malnutrition reports in
his dealings with reporters.
	   His lobbying helped result in the Security Council increasing
the amount of oil Iraq can sell over six months to dlrs 5.2
billion, up from about dlrs 2 billion.
	   He told reporters in Baghdad in February that he opposed the
U.N. sanctions because of their ``devastating impact on the small
people.''
	   ``None of the (U.N.) member states intended that the sanctions
program would be so harsh on individual Iraqis,'' he said.
	   He repeatedly expressed concern about delays in New York in
approving Iraqi oil contracts because it delayed the delivery of
needed food, medicine and other goods.
	   John Mills, a spokesman for the Iraq program, said Halliday was
the longest-serving relief coordinator since the oil-for-food
program was launched. He said U.N. officials had known for some
time that Halliday had intended to complete the 12 months of what
he said was a very difficult and demanding job.

President appoints new government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ President Vaclav Havel on
Wednesday appointed the first leftist government since the collapse
of communist rule eight years ago.
	   Eighteen ministers, 17 of them Social Democrats, signed the oath
of office in a ceremony held at the Prague Castle. The new premier
is Milos Zeman, who heads the Social Democrats.
	   Although the Social Democrats hold only 74 seats in the 200-seat
lower chamber of the parliament, the Cabinet is expected to survive
the initial confidence vote scheduled for Aug. 18.
	   Under Zeman's agreement with the runner-up, ex-Premier Vaclav
Klaus' Civic Democratic Party, Klaus' 63 deputies will leave the
chamber during the vote, effectively ensuring the government's
endorsment.
	   In return for tacitly supporting Zeman's minority government,
Klaus' party gets to appoint the speakers of both chambers of
Parliament and the chairmen of key parliamentary committees.
	   News reports last week said Havel had objections against at
least two Cabinet members, Foreign Minister Jan Kavan and Interior
Minister Vaclav Grulich, although Havel lacks any constitutional
authority to veto ministers.
	   Kavan, who returned from Britain after the 1989 collapse of the
communist regime, has been accused of being an informer for the
former secret police, the STB. A court later cleared him, ruling
Kavan did not know he was talking to an STB agent.
	   Grulich was repeatedly accused in the media of clandestine
contact with Russian diplomats. The accusations never were
confirmed, and Grulich has denied them.
	   The only non-Social Democrat is Justice Minister Otakar Motejl,
who is unaffiliated and has served as Supreme Court chairman until
now.
	   Havel appointed the ministers just a day before he is to enter
hospital for abdominal surgery.

Hitler &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British agents plotted several ways of killing
Adolf Hitler in the last months of World War II, considering the
merits of a sniper's rifle, a bazooka, high explosives, grenades, a
train derailment or poison, according to documents released
Thursday.
	   The plans came to nothing and Hitler killed himself in Berlin on
April 30, 1945.
	   ``Operation Foxley,'' the assassination plot detailed in a
120-page dossier released by the Public Record Office, began with a
tip from an agent in June 1944 that there might be an opportunity
to assassinate Hitler in Perpignan, France.
	   British Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden approved, and informed
Prime Minister Winston Churchill _ though no action was taken.
However, the Special Operations Executive continued planning ways
of killing Hitler, the records show.
	   Air Vice Marshal A.P. Ritchie was among the advocates of
assassination, arguing that Hitler was regarded by many Germans as
``something more than human.''
	   ``It is this mystical hold which he exercises over the German
people that is largely responsible for keeping the country together
at the present time,'' Ritchie said. ``Remove Hitler and there is
nothing left.''
	   But others were skeptical.
	   ``As a strategist, Hitler has been of the greatest possible
assistance to the British war effort,'' said an officer identified
only as Major Field-Robertson. ``I have no hesitation in saying
that his value to us has been the equivalent to an almost unlimited
number of first-class SOE agents strategically placed inside
Germany.''
	   The British worked out these options:
	   _Assassinate Hitler at Berchtesgarten, his Bavarian mountain
retreat, either with a high-powered rifle as he took his morning
walk to the local tea house, or with a bazooka as he rode back in
his car.
	   British agents said Hitler usually arose at 9 a.m. or later, and
had a breakfast of milk and toast at the tea house at 11 a.m.
Agents said Hitler was vulnerable to a sniper because he insisted
his guards stay out of sight, according to the papers.
	   _Derail Hitler's train by blasting the track as it went through
a tunnel, or alternatively throwing a suitcase of explosives off
the platform as it went through a station.
	   _Bomb Berchtesgarten and follow up with paratroops to kill any
survivors.
	   _Poison the water supply in Hitler's train. Agents thought one
of the six Frenchwomen who worked as cleaners on the train might
cooperate.
	   Other documents released Thursday detailed how the British
forged German stamps with the face of SS chief Heinrich Himmler.
The idea of this ``black propaganda'' operation was to encourage
rumors that Himmler planned a coup against Hitler and had ordered
the stamps to be issued afterwards.
	   Agents inside Germany used the six-pfennig stamps to send letter
to neutral European countries.
	   An initial mailing to Sweden got no response. One memo included
in the newly released record said: ``The mission failed owing to
the unobservant nature of the Swedes and their office staff.''
	   But eventually the stamps produced the desired result, and a
Swiss newspaper reported speculation about a coup attempt.
	   The project was expanded in 1943 with mailings to Spain,
Portugal and Morocco. Eventually, the records said, German
authorities issued a statement admitting the stamps had been
published in error.
	   ``The project has worked perfectly,'' an SOE memorandum said.
``Now that the story has got as far as this it will not be easy for
the Germans to put out a weak statement to the effect that the
stamp was forged by the British authorities. I do not think anybody
would believe such a fantastic story.''

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Kohl also rejecting highway toll for now. Edits,

 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Wednesday
rejected calls from inside his own camp to impose tolls on the
autobahn, Germany's superhighway system.
	   Kohl entered the fray after opposition candidate Gerhard
Schroeder, the front-runner for Sept. 27 election, jumped to the
defense of the car-adoring nation's motorists.
	   ``We can't expect German motorists to bear any greater burden,''
Schroeder was quoted Wednesday as saying in the nation's most-read
newspaper, Bild.
	   Bavarian governor Edmund Stoiber, whose party is closely allied
with Kohl's Christian Democrats, started the debate this week by
urging an annual 100 mark (dlrs 56) fee for motorists using the
autobahn.
	   He said it would raise money for the superhighway system _ also
from foreign drivers _ and noted that most neighboring countries
have tolls that Germans also must pay.
	   In a rare moment of agreement, both Schroeder and Kohl said they
could only imagine a European Union-wide accord on transportation
tolls.
	   In the meantime, Schroeder said, taxpayer money should continue
to fund the autobahn, because tolls would unfairly hit commuters
and hurt the German auto industry.
	   Schroeder, the governor of Lower Saxony, sits on the supervisory
board of Volkswagen, Europe's biggest automaker, which is based in
his state.
	   The Free Democrats, junior partner in Kohl's center-right
coalition, also protested. Party chief Wolfgang Gerhardt said
Stoiber's proposal had ``no chance'' in the coalition.
	   Proposals to charge car drivers for autobahn use come up
regularly in Germany, but the government has dared impose tolls
only on heavy trucks.
	   The Greens party, a possible coalition partner for Schroeder if
he wins the Sept. 27 election, caused a storm recently by calling
for a general speed limit on the autobahn.
	   Under Stoiber's plan, all vehicle owners would have to buy a
windshield sticker each year to use the autobahn or face a fine if
caught without it. Other European countries use this system.

PolyGram's net profit plunges due to lack of major music releases
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS year-earlier figures and operating profit; ADDS Seagram
also owns Universal Studios. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Dutch entertainment group PolyGram
NV said Wednesday its net profit plunged 86 percent to 38 million
guilders (dlrs 19 million) in the first six months of 1998.
	   The drop was due to a lack of major music releases and poor
showing from its film division.
	   Net profit in the same period a year ago totaled 270 million
guilders (dlrs 135 million).
	   Operating profit in the first half totaled 109 million guilders
(dlrs 54.5 million), down from 430 million (dlrs 215 million) a
year ago.
	   But a large chunk of that profit went into financial expenses,
income taxes and other expenses.
	   PolyGram, the largest record company in the world, said
operating profit of the music division in the first half fell 49
percent to 274 million guilders (dlrs 137 million) from 538 million
guilders (dlrs 269 million) in the year ago period.
	   The decline came on the back of a weak pop music release
schedule which caused pop sales to drop by 7 percent, said
PolyGram.
	   The financial crisis in Asia also had a negative impact on
results in the first half, said the company.
	   Top selling pop releases in the reporting period included
Hanson's third album ``3 Car Garage,'' which sold 1.5 million
copies, and DMX's ``It's Dark and Hell is Hot,'' which sold 1.2
million copies.
	   PolyGram is owned by Dutch giant Philips Electronics NV, which
is in the process of selling its 75 percent stake in the music
company to Seagram Co. of Canada.
	   Seagram, which also owns Universal Studios, has already said it
will sell off PolyGram's film division.
	   The buyer, however, will be faced with a division in the red.
	   The film unit posted an operating loss of 165 million guilders
(dlrs 82.5 million), up from a loss of 108 million guilders (dlrs
54 million) in the like period in 1997.
	   For the second half of the year, PolyGram's film releases
include ``What Dreams May Come,'' with Robin Williams and Cuba
Gooding Jr. and ``Mickey Blue Eyes'' starring Hugh Grant.

Pathologist says death of U.S. woman due to heavy blows to head
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NANYUKI, Kenya (AP) _ An American woman whose body was found in
a cottage in this central Kenyan town died of serious head injuries
caused by heavy blows with a blunt object, the pathologist who
performed the autopsy said Wednesday.
	   Leonard Mbuthia told reporters he found depressed head fractures
on the forehead and right ear of 72-year-old Luzzana Heliot, which
he said he believed were caused by heavy blows with a blunt object.
	   The woman's body was found July 16 in a cottage at the Lion's
Court Inn where she had been living since September.
	   Geoffrey Kaburu, senior police commander in Nanyuki, 130
kilometers (80 miles) north of Nairobi, said a night watchman and
the woman's driver were in custody.
	   The U.S. Embassy in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, said the woman
had registered there as Ruth Luzzana Heliot, but State Department
spokeswoman Phyllis Young on Tuesday identified her as Luzzana
Heliot Carosso.
	   An embassy spokesman said the woman's sons, who had been
planning to visit her, had been notified of her death. One or both
are believed to live in the San Diego, Calif., area.
	   The woman's remains were cremated earlier this week, and her
ashes were scattered at the base of Mt. Kenya.
	   Residents in Nanyuki said the woman had lived in the area for

Three bodies found near where lawmaker was killed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Three bodies have been found in the woods near the
country home where Russian lawmaker Lev Rokhlin was killed, but
they are not related to his shooting, a news agency said Wednesday.
	   Forensic tests show the three people died two weeks before
Rokhlin was killed on July 3, ITAR-Tass said, quoting a senior aide
to the prosecutor general, Alexander Zvyagintsev.
	   Rokhlin's wife, Tamara, has confessed to shooting the former
general and outspoken critic of President Boris Yeltsin after a
quarrel and has been charged with murder. Police say her
fingerprints were found on the gun.
	   However, Rokhlin's relatives, opposition leaders and the media
have speculated that unidentified assailants told Mrs. Rokhlin to
make a false confession, or they would attack other family members.
Several alternative scenarios have been put forth, but none have
included evidence to contradict the authorities.
	   Police say they continue to investigate.
	   Alexander Morozov, deputy head of the executive committee of the
Movement in Support of the Army, which Rokhlin founded with the
goal of ousting Yeltsin, said he doubted Mrs. Rokhlin could have
shot her husband with the Makarov pistol investigators said she
used.
	   ``Tamara Pavlovna never possessed that pistol,'' he said,
according to ITAR-Tass. ``The fact that Tamara Rokhlina's
fingerprints were found on the pistol does not prove that she fired
it. It could have been done by a person wearing gloves.''
	   Morozov said two shots were fired in the home, one in Rokhlin's
head and the other into a wall. Since no one heard two shots, the
killer must have used a silencer, which has not been found, he
said.
	   Morozov also questioned how three bodies could have remained in
the woods so close to the Rokhlin home without being found for more
than two weeks. He said the bodies were badly burned and had
gunshot wounds.
	   Rokhlin was a career soldier who won nationwide acclaim for his
performance during the 1994-96 war in Chechnya. He was elected to
parliament as a member of a pro-government faction, but later broke
away and became a fierce opponent of Yeltsin.

King Hussein suspected to be suffering from cancer

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with statement from doctors &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ King Hussein is suspected to be suffering
from cancer of the lymph cells and will begin chemotherapy next
week if tests confirm the condition.
	   King Hussein, who is being treated at the Mayo Clinic, disclosed
the diagnosis in a letter to his brother, Crown Prince Hassan, on
Tuesday. The letter was read on Jordanian television Tuesday night.
	   Prime Minister Abdul-Salam Majali said Wednesday that the king
asked that the letter be read on television to inform Jordanians of
his condition.
	   The king wrote that an ``excised lymph node and symptoms all
seem to point to lymphoma,'' or cancer of the lymphatic tissue. At
the same time there could be other reasons for the infection and
related symptoms, the letter said.
	   Doctors at the hospital in Rochester, Minnesota, are waiting for
full details of tests done on Friday. If the cancer is ``confirmed
next Tuesday, (the) physicians will begin chemotherapy,'' Hussein
wrote. He also noted that early chemotherapy treatment might harm
neutrophil and platelet, two vital components of blood.
	   Hussein's private physician, Samir Farraj, said in a brief
statement released by the Mayo Clinic Wednesday that the king was
expected to remain at the clinic for three more weeks. The
statement gave no new information about results of the tests or the
Jordanian leader's condition.

Prodi seeks support from Communist allies in Chamber
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Prodi quotes; ADDS background; will be updated
after vote planned at about 1800 GMT; ADDS BYLINE &QL; 
 &UR; By VANIA GRANDI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Hours before a confidence vote, Premier Romano Prodi
urged his troublesome Communist allies Wednesday to join the
parties in his center-left coalition in a long-term alliance.
	   But the hardliners said they are waiting to see if he delivers
on his economic promises.
	   ``We must give this country what it needs most: (political)
stability and long-term planning,'' Prodi said in an address to the
Chamber of Deputies, hours before a confidence vote on his
coalition was scheduled.
	   After nearly causing the government to fall last month by
refusing to vote for NATO's eastward expansion, the Communist
Refoundation party has said it will back Prodi in the vote.
	   Prodi has counted on the backing of the Communists in the lower
chamber for a majority since forming his coalition in May 1996.
	   But even after winning a confidence vote, Prodi would still face
a major test when the 1999 budget comes up for discussion after the
summer legislative recess.
	   On Tuesday, Prodi easily won a vote of confidence in the Senate,
where he does not rely on Refoundation for a majority.
	   Fausto Bertinotti's Communist Refoundation has hinted it might
withdraw support this fall if the budget does not meet its demands.
	   ``It is obvious that everything will be put off until this fall
when we have to face the budget _ the government's most demanding
economic policy issue,'' said Bertinotti.
	   Prodi said his Olive Tree coalition and Refoundation had already
taken ``important steps forward,'' and planned to remain loyal to
each other, while ``recognizing our differences.''
	   To win the Communists' support, Prodi promised to invest 36
trillion lire (dlrs 20 billion) over the next three years in the
south, where the unemployment rate runs twice the national average
of 12.5 percent. He also pledged to give businesses tax breaks and
implement within a year the 35-hour work week that Bertinotti has
demanded.
	   But the Communists want to make sure Prodi carries out his
pledges before giving him full support.
	   ``Today we have reached a turning point, especially on job
creation policies and aid to the south,'' the Communist's Chamber
whip Oliviero Diliberto said during the debate. ``But much still
remains to be done to reach the final goal.''
	   Prodi's government has already lasted longer than all but two of
the other 54 Italian governments since World War II.
	   Parliament's term ends in 2001.

PolyGram's net profit plunges due to lack of major music releases
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Dutch entertainment group PolyGram
NV said Wednesday its earnings plunged 86 percent in the first six
months of 1998 compared to the same period a year earlier.
	   Net profits were 38 million guilders (dlrs 19 million), compared
to 270 million guilders (dlrs 135) a year earlier.
	   The drop was due to a lack of major music releases and poor
showing from its film division. Financial expenses, income taxes
and other expenses also affected net profits.
	   The company said its operating profit in the first half of the
year totaled 109 million guilders (dlrs 54.5 million), down from
430 million (dlrs 215 million) a year ago.
	   PolyGram, the largest record company in the world, said
operating profit of the music division in the first half fell 49
percent to 274 million guilders (dlrs 137 million), from 538
million guilders (dlrs 269 million) in the year ago period.
	   The decline came on the back of a weak pop music release
schedule which caused pop sales to drop by 7 percent, said
PolyGram.
	   The financial crisis in Asia also hurt earnings, the company
said.
	   Top selling pop releases in the reporting period included
Hanson's third album ``3 Car Garage,'' which sold 1.5 million
copies, and DMX's ``It's Dark and Hell is Hot,'' which sold 1.2
million copies.
	   PolyGram is owned by Dutch giant Philips Electronics NV, which
is in the process of selling its 75 percent stake in the music
company to Seagram Co. of Canada.
	   Seagram, which also owns Universal Studios, has already said it
will sell off PolyGram's film division.
	   The buyer, however, will be faced with a division in the red.
	   The film unit posted an operating loss of 165 million guilders
(dlrs 82.5 million), up from a loss of 108 million guilders (dlrs
54 million) in the like period in 1997.
	   For the second half of the year, PolyGram's film releases
include ``What Dreams May Come,'' with Robin Williams and Cuba
Gooding Jr. and ``Mickey Blue Eyes'' starring Hugh Grant.

 &UR; Ullrich holds onto lead while Pantani takes stage &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with day's stage &QL; 
 &UR; BY SALVATORE ZANCA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PLATEAU DE BEILLE, France (AP) - Defending champion Jan Ullrich
held onto the lead in the Tour de France Wednesday despite the
efforts of Marco Pantani to cut deeply into the gap on a hot day in
the mountains.
	   Pantani took the 11th stage, once again breaking away from the
Ullrich group up the final climb. Wednesday's stage had five major
climbs including the finish up 1,750 meters (5,720 feet) in the
Pyrenees.
	   Roland Meier of Switzerland built up a lead of more than five
minutes on the pack entering the final climb. But Meier was
trailing Ullrich by more than five minutes in the overall standings
entering the day.
	   So Ullrich's Telekom team maintained a pace to keep Meier within
that distance and were ready to increase the pace if needed.
	   Ullrich had a flat with about 20 kilometers (12.5 miles) left in
the stage and was helped back to the pack with his teammates.
	   Once back, Ullrich worked his way through and then started
increasing the pace to catch the Meier.
	   As in Tuesday's stage, Ullrich had to do the work while the
others followed.
	   Also as in Tuesday, Pantani took off in an attempt to gain
ground. Ullrich let him go, knowing that Pantani trailed by nearly
five minutes in the overall standings.
	   Pantani caught Meier with about six kilometers (4.5 miles) left
and won his fifth stage of the Tour de France, all in mountain
stages including two in l'Alpe d'Huez.
	   After pacing the small group of chasing up the final climb,
Ullrich relaxed a little and came in eighth on the day 1 minute, 40
seconds behind Pantani. Ullrich lost seven seconds to a handful of
others, including Bobby Julich of the United States.
	   Julich now trails Ullrich by 1 minute 11 seconds in the overall
standings. Pantani and Laurent Jalabert of France are just over
three minutes back.
	   After a cool and foggy day on the first day in the mountains
Tuesday, the hot temperatures returned with the heat well above 30
C (86 F) on the route.
	   The heat took away one of the favorites when Abraham Olano of
Spain, the world road champion in 1995, dropped out with about 75
kilometers (46 miles) remaining in the 170-kilometer (105-mile) leg
from Luchon to Plataeu de Beille.
	   Olano was sixth in the overall standings and second in the
opening prologue. Once branded as five-time champion Miguel
Indurain's successor, Olano just missed the podium last year but
lost more than a minute in Tuesday's mountain stage.
	   There is a rest day on Thursday before the Tour resumes with a
222-kilometer (137-mile) leg from Tarascon-sur-Ariege to Cap d'Agde
as the Tour slowly makes its way across southern France before
hitting the Alps on Monday.
	   It was the second day in the mountains but the top climber of
the last four years, Richard Virenque, and his Festina teammates
are expected to be heard soon in a court in Lyon to explain their
involvment in the doping scandal.
	   Festina's director Bruno Roussel admitted a practice of
supplying illegal drugs with medical supervision to improve
performances which prompted Tour officials to exclude the
top-ranked Festina team the rest of the way.
	   The doctor for the banned Festina team, Erik Ryckaert, contended
that his riders were ordered by their manager to pay for
performance-enhancing drugs.
	   And now the Dutch TVM team is under suspicion. It was reported
that the same drug used by the Festina team was found in the car of
TVM officials in March.

Iran says U.S. must change attitude, policies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ The United States must change its attitude
and policies if it is sincere about improving relations with Iran,
the country's moderate Foreign Minister said Wednesday .
	   The remarks by Kamal Kharazzi came weeks after Iran's hard-line
supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned that Washington's
softer tone toward Tehran was no more than ``a hypocritical
political undertaking'' and Iranians should not be deceived.
	   Kharrazi said Iran recognizes that the U.S. overtures are a
reality. ``But this change of tone could be valuable only when it
is coupled with changing U.S. policies and attitudes towards
Iran,'' he said.
	   ``If this attitude is changing, we will respond if necessary,''
Kamal Kharrazi, told a news conference.
	   Although Iran's moderate President Mohammad Khatami has called
for cultural exchanges with the United States as a way of easing
tensions, his authority is circumscribed by Khamenei who leads a
hard-line faction among the ruling clergy.
	   Iran and the United States broke off relations after the 1979
Islamic revolution, which toppled the U.S.-supported shah and
brought a clerical group to power.
	   In June, U.S. President Bill Clinton and U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said positive changes in Iran since Khatami's
election could eventually lead to normal relations.
	   The United States has long considered Iran a rogue state that
should be isolated. It says that Iran sponsors international
terrorism and is trying to acquire weapons of mass destruction.
	   Iran denies the charges and blames the United States for trying
to exert its will on the rest of the world.

Jane's: Indian decision imminent on buying Russian carrier
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ India's decision on whether to buy the Russian
aircraft carrier Admiral Gorshkov is imminent, Jane's Defense
Weekly reported Wednesday.
	   India's Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Vishnu Bhagwat was due in
Moscow this week for a 10-day official visit to look at Russia's
plans to convert the heavy cruiser, the military magazine said,
quoting Indian sources.
	   The price tag for the modernized 44,500-ton ship is between dlrs
700 million and dlrs 800 million, Jane's said.
	   Russia's Nevskoye Project Design Bureau and state arms exporter
Rosvoorouzhenie have proposed lengthening the Admiral Gorshkov's
640-foot (194-meter) flight deck to the 899-foot (272-meter) length
of the ship, and adding a ski-jump takeoff ramp, the magazine said.
	   The sales package would also include a new carrier-capable
variation of the MiG-29 multi-role fighter, plus Ka-28
anti-submarine and Ka-31 airborne early-warning helicopters.
	   Nevskoye's chief designer, Boris Shmelov, said the conversion
would be completed within three years of contract signatures.
	   The Admiral Gorshkov was commissioned in the former Soviet
Union's Northern Fleet in 1987, with heavy armaments on its forward
section and a deck enabling short takeoff and vertical landing
operations. It was withdrawn from service in 1995.
	   Talks between India and Russia about a possible sale started in
1994 and resumed in December when Russia's Deputy Prime Minister
Anatoly Chubais visited New Delhi. An Indian delegation inspected
the Admiral Gorshkov in January, Jane's said.
	   India currently has one carrier, the Viraat, purchased from
Britain in 1986 after its service in the Falklands War, under its
original name, the HMS Hermes.
	   Russia and India have had extensive military ties for decades.
	   The two countries recently concluded negotiations on a new
10-year defense cooperation agreement that shifts the emphasis from
outright purchases to joint development of military hardware,
Jane's reported earlier this month.

Mubarak appeals to Israeli people to save peace
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ President Hosni Mubarak on Wednesday called
on the Israeli people to help save the peace process, an appeal
that reflected his increasing frustration with the policies of
Israel's right-wing government.
	   By appealing directly to ``the Israeli people, who share with us
the responsibility of peace, to recognize the current dangerous
situation and the grave eventual repercussions if the peace process
collapses or reaches a dead-end,'' Mubarak signaled his displeasure
with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government.
	   He told the final session of the ruling National Democratic
Party congress that the hurdles faced by the peace process are
``the result of rigid policies and unjust practices which cannot
build bridges of love and co-existence among the nations.''
	   The Middle East peace process, which has stumbled since the
election of Netanyahu's election in May 1996, was recently crippled
by a dispute over the scope of an Israeli troop withdrawal from
West Bank.
	   Three days of direct talks between Israel and the Palestinians
ended Tuesday without any agreement.
	   The United States has suggested a 13 percent withdrawal from the
West Bank, which was accepted by the Palestinians. The Israelis
rejected it, saying it would compromise the country's security.

Tribesmen blow up Yemen pipeline
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AHMED AL-HAJ &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Tribesmen have blown up an oil pipeline in
northern Yemen, causing a fire but no casualties, a security
official said Wednesday.
	   Members of the Abida tribe set off the Tuesday night blast, the
official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The fire was burning hours after the explosion in Marib
province, 170 kilometers (105 miles) northeast of the capital,
San`a, the official said.
	   The blast was the ninth attack on oil and gas pipelines since
June 19 when tribesmen and city residents started protesting a 40
percent rise in the price of fuel. The protests have often led to
clashes with security forces.
	   The pipeline runs from Marib to the Red Sea province of
al-Hudaydah, 140 miles (225 kilometers) west of San`a.
	   The government raised the prices of gasoline, kerosene and
cooking gas to meet demands by the International Monetary Fund.
	   Large parts of Yemen are lawless, inhabited by tribes who do not
hesitate to use firearms to settle scores with rivals or to express
discontent with the government.

Prime minister says U.S., Dutch have discussed Pan Am trial
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with Blair's statement; EDITS throughout to conform

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prime Minister Tony Blair said Wednesday he had
talked with U.S. President Bill Clinton and Dutch Prime Minister
Wim Kok about the possibility of trying two Pan Am bombing suspects
in the Netherlands.
	   U.S. and British officials said on Tuesday that they were
considering the possibility of a third-country trial for two
Libyans accused of killing 270 people by putting a bomb aboard a
Pan AM Boeing 747 in 1988. The bomb exploded as the plane passed
over Lockerbie, Scotland.
	   Blair, speaking in the House of Commons, said Britain wanted the
suspects tried either in Scotland or the United States, but due to
the lack of progress in bringing them to trial, ``we are prepared
to look at alternative ways of giving families the justice they
deserve.''
	   He said no final decision had been made.
	   ``There are many, many legal and other complexities to be
overcome before we can be sure that this is the right way to
proceed,'' the prime minister said, adding that any third country
solution needed to be ``fully consistent with our absolute
commitment to the integrity of the Scottish judicial system.''
	   Libya has refused to hand over the two suspects for trial,
despite sanctions imposed by the U.N. Security Council. It contends
that the two men could not get a fair trial in Scotland or the
United States. Blair on Wednesday strongly denied that.
	   The two suspects _ Libyan intelligence agents Abdel Basset
al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah _ were indicted in Scotland and
the United States in 1991 for planting the bomb that exploded Dec.
21, 1988.
	   Blair's spokesman, Alastair Campbell said that Britain launched
discussions with the U.S. some months ago and more recently with
the Dutch about the possibility of a trial in Holland under
Scottish law with Scottish judges, rather than an international
panel of judges.
	   Though there were be considerable legal and technical
difficulties, Campbell said, ``We do think that they can be
resolved and should be resolved reasonably speedily.''
	   Campbell said Blair and Clinton had discussed the issue several
times, though not in recent days. Discussions between Blair and Kok
were more recent, he said.
	   Clinton confirmed Tuesday that a third-country trial had been
discussed, ``but I don't know that it can be done.''
	   ``We've tried to find some way that has real integrity that will
work, but there are all kinds of practical difficulties,'' Clinton
said in Washington.

Rafters enter fifth day of strike

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ About 120 river rafting guides entered
their fifth day of a strike against a tour company Wednesday with
little sign of a possible agreement.
	   Rafters are hired by Rio Grande Attractions as independent
contractors, but they say they want to be classified as regular
employees, which would bring higher wages. They are also demanding
uniforms.
	   The guides carry passengers down Jamaica's Rio Grande on
handmade bamboo rafts. It is the biggest-earning tourist attraction
in the parish of Portland, where the river is located.

Main opposition conservative party kicks out two deputies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A parliament member who allegedly beat up
his mistress and another who angrily brandished a pistol were
expelled Wednesday from the main opposition conservative party.
	   New Democracy permanently expelled Varsamis Yiovanoudas, 44, a
married father of two, for allegedly beating up his 25-year-old
mistress last week after she demanded an end to their relationship.
	   It also suspended Gerasimos Yiakoumatos, 49, for nine months.
Last week, he stormed into parliament brandishing a pistol and
threatening to shoot the public order minister. He later apologized
for the incident, saying he had been mad because his house had been
burglarized.
	   Yiovanoudas denied he had beat up his mistress, who was
hospitalized for five days. He asked that parliament lift his
immunity from prosecution, but it is very rarely done in Greece.
	   The highly publicized scandals were another blow for New
Democracy, whose leader, Costas Caramanlis, has been trying to
rebuild the party's bruised image.
	   With the governing Socialists becoming ever more conservative,
New Democracy has lost much of its ideological base and was near
dissolution when Caramanlis, 41, was elected to run the party last
year.
	   In March, six influential New Democracy members were expelled
for refusing to vote against Socialist legislation on
privatization.

South Asian adolescents express views at UNFPA conference
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Youngsters complained they learn more
about sex in frogs than in humans, in a region where sex education
is still taboo in most schools.
	   Th United Nations Population Fund conference brought together
more than 100 educators, government officials and academics
Wednesday to discuss the problems of adolescents _ aged 10-19 _ in
the traditional societies of the Indian subcontinent. A score of
teenagers from the region also participated.
	   ``We learn about all the other human systems in detail but only
about frogs and other animals when it comes to the reproductive
system'' Huma Rasheed, a teenager from Pakistan, said at the launch
of the two-day conference.
	   Despite a high rate of AIDS and other sexually communicated
diseases, sex is rarely talked about by teachers, or even by
parents, participants said.
	   ``Sexual awareness is a must for women to have control of their
bodies'' said N.T. Vaidyaratne of Sri Lanka, discussing sexual
abuse within and outside the family, young pregnancies and forced
prostitution.

Ticket scam company offically shut down and under investigation

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A company at the center of an alleged World Cup
ticket scam was officially shut down by a London Court on
Wednesday.
	   Great Portland Entertainments, based in central London,
allegedly failed to deliver 40,000 pre-paid World Cup tickets,
worth an estimated 2.4 million pounds (dlrs 3.95 million), to
thousands of English and Scottish soccer fans.
	   The company, which was run by former bankrupt David Spanton and
was an authorized World Cup ticket supplier, had been placed under
receivership on June 4 _ six days before the tournament started.
	   Great Portland Entertainments is also under criminal
investigation after it emerged that fans and travel agents had not
received tickets they had paid for.
	   The government applied for the winding up order and was
supported by two creditors, owed at least 770,000 pounds (dlrs 1.28
million) between them.

Activists detained during anti-nuclear protest in Turkey
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Police detained nine Greenpeace members
who protested Wednesday against plans to build Turkey's first
nuclear power plant, a Greenpeace lawyer said.
	   The activists unfurled a banner that read ``Nuclear Salesman not
welcome,'' during a news conference of a French-German consortium
which is bidding to build a power station on the Mediterranean
coast.
	   Police detained two activists at the Istanbul hotel where the
conference of Nuclear Power International and Siemens was being
held and then detained another seven activists who had gone to the
police station to get news about their colleagues, said Greenpeace
lawyer Ergun Ozer.
	   ``They will soon be released,'' the lawyer said.
	   Westinghouse of the United States, Mitsubishi of Japan, and a
British-Canadian consortium, Atomic Energy Canada Ltd. and Kuarner
John Brown of England are also competing for the contract.
	   Turkey says a nuclear power plant is necessary to meet energy
demand not met now by thermal and hydroelectric plants.

Turkish NGO's demand language rights for Kurds
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Three groups promoting Turkish economic
development have concluded that giving more cultural freedom to
Kurds will attract investment to the southeast, where guerrillas
have been battling government troops for 14 years.
	   Turkey's 12 million Kurds are not allowed to use their language
in education or broadcasting.
	   Heads of the three non-governmental organizations groups
concluded in a report Wednesday that more liberties would improve
the general well-being of the whole country, said Arkin Miran, a
spokesman for independent lawmaker Sedat Aloglu, who was involved
in the report's drafting.
	   Similar recommendations by a group of leading industrialists
last year irked the powerful military.
	   The latest report urged the government to consider Kurdish as a
second language option to be taught at schools and that state-owned
television and radio be permitted to broadcast in Kurdish, Arabic
and Persian in the southeast, Miran said.
	   It also called on the government to introduce economic measures
to attract investments in the impoverished region.
	   ``As long as problems in the east and southeast are not
resolved, Turkey's other regions cannot flourish,'' Milliyet
newspaper quoted from the report.
	   Hundreds of writers, journalists and politicians have been
jailed in Turkey for promoting Kurdish cultural rights or allegedly
supporting Kurdish guerrillas seeking autonomy in southeastern
Turkey.

Gas tanker drivers end strike, harbor pilots stay out
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with ships entering ports in 3rd graf, EDITS to
conform &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Gas tanker truck drivers on Wednesday
called off a strike and resumed deliveries to the estimated 80
percent of Portugal's gas stations that had run dry during a
48-hour stoppage.
	   But no end was in sight for a strike by the country's 80 harbor
pilots, who guide ships into port, after the government refused to
negotiate with them. The 14-day stoppage, which began Tuesday,
initially choked the flow of imports and exports by sea.
	   To free up port traffic, the government suspended the law
requiring ship captains to hire a harbor pilot to steer their
vessels into port. By 5p.m. (1600 GMT) Wednesday 15 cargo ships had
docked at ports around the country, officials said.
	   The 2,000 tanker truck drivers voted to return to work after the
government agreed late Tuesday to drop a system of mandatory
written tests for drivers, meeting the strikers' main demand, while
the employers agreed to pay them a risk subsidy _ a bonus for the
dangerous nature of the job _ although without specifying how much.
	   The National Road Transport Association, which represents
employers, said more than 1,500 tanker trucks from about 130
distribution companies were due to begin deliveries.
	   The National Association of Gas Vendors estimated it would take
three days for gas station tanks to be fully replenished.
	   ``There was panic-buying Tuesday night. The major cities were
the hardest hit,'' Association President Carlos Cazenave said by
phone.
	   Meanwhile, the Harbor Pilots' Union warned that circumventing
their members could endanger shipping, especially in Lisbon, where
large vessels carrying crude oil must maneuver around a sand bank
at the mouth of the Tagus River.
	   The harbor pilots are demanding a pay hike, a risk subsidy and
the right to set their own working conditions.
	   Following widespread allegations of corruption among the harbor
pilots, the government this year placed them under the supervision
of the port authorities _ a move resisted by the pilots.
	   More than 90 percent of harbor pilots are under investigation
for corruption, extortion and criminal association.

Kuwait denies it is holding Iraqi war prisoners
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Kuwait denied Iraqi allegations Wednesday that it
was holding some 1,000 Iraqis reported missing from the 1991 Gulf
War, and accused Baghdad of trying to overshadow the issue of
missing Kuwaitis.
	   Iraq said Tuesday that more than 1,000 Iraqis are still missing
and called on foreign countries to pressure Kuwait to help account
for them.
	   ``There is not a single Iraqi who is held here, except for a
crime,'' Foreign Minister Sheik Sabah al-Ahmed al-Sabah said. His
remarks were reported by the Kuwait News Agency.
	   He said Baghdad's allegations were aimed at overshadowing Iraq's
failure to account for some 600 Kuwaitis unaccounted for since
Iraq's 1990 invasion of the emirate.
	   Kuwait says it has documented proof that the missing were
arrested during the crisis, but Baghdad insists it has released all
Gulf War prisoners or lost track of them in an uprising that
followed the conflict.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ Chile's Marcelo Rios, making his
latest run at No. 1, won in straight sets Wednesday to avoid the
rash of upsets that swept the Mercedes Cup.
	   Rios, who would pass Pete Sampras at the top of the ATP world
rankings if he reaches the final, blew past Germany's error-prone
Jens Knippschild, 7-6 (7-5), 6-2.
	   He reached the third round of the dlrs 1.04 million tournament,
along with Boris Becker. The German beat France's Cedric Pioline,
7-6 (7-5), 6-1 in his latest bid to claim a clay court title.
	   Becker, easing into retirement, came close two weeks ago at the
Swiss Open. But for the sixth time, the three-time Wimbledon winner
came up short in a clay final.
	   ``It's the same old song,'' said Becker, 30. ``I can't reach the
same level as on hard courts or grass. I always come up one match
short.''
	   Becker proved he's still has the impressive form he displayed at
the Swiss Open against Pioline, ranked 20th. After slamming an ace
to decide the first set, he rolled to victory in one hour, 21
minutes.
	   Former French Open winner Yevgeny Kafelnikov was among five
seeds that didn't survive the second round Wednesday.
	   Czech player Bohdan Ulihrach ousted the No. 4 seeded Russian,
6-3, 3-6, 6-3, while No. 8 Alberto Berasategui of Spain, No. 10
Thomas Muster and No. 12 Fabrice Santoro of France also were
beaten.
	   Rios, briefly the world No. 1 this spring, survived an early
break in the first set as the German charged the net and slammed
winners all over the court.
	   But Rios took control of the match after Knippschild let a 4-1
lead slip away in the tiebreak, then capped a string of errors by
hitting a double fault at 5-5.
	   Rios also had a chance to pass Sampras for the top ranking at
Wimbledon but was ousted in the first round.
	   France's Guillaume Raoux swept past Berasategui, 6-1, 6-2,
France's Fernando Vicente downed Muster, 6-3, 6-7 (7-5), 7-5 and
Spain's Albert Portas edged Santoro, 1-6, 6-2, 7-6 (9-7).
	   Germany's Hendrik Dreekmann also upset 15th-seeded Magnus
Larsson of Sweden, 6-4, 7-5.
	   Albert Costa of Spain, the No. 6 seed, also advanced by rolling
past Argentina's Franco Squillari, 6-3, 6-4.

	   ORAHOVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian rebels withdrew
under cover of darkness early Wednesday from their last positions
in this strategic Kosovo town as international monitors visited the
site of one of the biggest battles in weeks.
	   Serb police, shielded beneath large umbrellas from the
blistering summer sun, stared toward the wooded hills for signs of
snipers. But Serb officials said the Kosovo Liberation Army, which
is fighting for independence from Serbia, had pulled back several
miles to the north.
	   Convoys of Serb police waving large Serbian flags rumbled along
the road from the provincial capital of Pristina, 50 kilometers (30
miles) to the east.
	   In Pristina, the Kosovo Information Center, which is close to
ethnic Albanian politicians, claimed 15,000 people had fled
Orahovac to escape the fighting, which began Friday with a strong
attack by the KLA.
	   The Albanian center said Serb police dragged civilians from
their homes and shot them. It quoted witnesses as saying police
also shot civilians who took refuge in the town mosque.
	   In a statement Wednesday, Ibrahim Rugova, the moderate Albanian
politician most favored by the Americans and Europeans, condemned
the alleged atrocities and called on ``international institutions''
to intervene to stop them.
	   The reports could not be independently confirmed.
	   Earlier Wednesday, the U.N. refugee agency cast doubt on claims
that the town of 20,000 inhabitants was completely in Serb hands,
saying the area resounded with gunfire and occasional explosions
when its staff visited late Tuesday.
	   By Wednesday morning, however, Orahovac was quiet. The streets
were empty except for Serb police behind sandbagged abutments. A
dead horse lay on the pavement.
	   The fighting around Orahovac cast doubt on the possibility of a
negotiated settlement between Serbia, the dominant republic of
Yugoslavia, and ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of
Kosovo's population.
	   The Americans and Europeans have been urging the Albanians to
rally behind Rugova as their leader for future peace talks with
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. But the KLA has rejected
Rugova because of his opposition to violence.
	   On Wednesday, the self-styled Kosovo Albanian parliament, which
Rugova controls, issued a statement acknowledging the ``growth of
the liberation struggle in Kosovo.''
	   The reference to the ``liberation struggle'' was seen as an
overture by Rugova to the KLA in hopes of winning agreement to join
him in talks with the government.
	   Kosovo Albanians said at least 36 ethnic Albanians had been
killed in the fighting.
	   Germany's foreign minister said NATO would likely have to get
involved to end the violence.
	   ``On both sides, there is a lack of serious effort to contain
the armed violence and resume negotiations,'' Foreign Minister
Klaus Kinkel said in Bonn, Germany.
	   Also Wednesday, a group of Russian diplomats, part of an
international observer group in Kosovo, arrived for their first
visit since the fighting began. The observers issued no statement.
	   The Kosovo Information Center claimed Serb forces, which moved
into the town Saturday, were still shelling KLA positions in
Orahovac on Tuesday and that fighting was also raging in outlying
villages.
	   The fighting led the U.N. Security Council to vote Tuesday to
expand the peacekeeping force in Macedonia by about 300 troops,
mostly to strengthen security along borders with Kosovo and
Albania. U.S. troops will make up about one-third of the 1,000-plus
force.
	   Ending a visit to Kosovo, the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe issued a report noting an influx of armed
fighters from neighboring Albania, increased abductions by both
sides and growing shortages of food and medicines.

Swiss president appeals to Clinton over sanctions threats
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS comment from U.S. ambassador to Switzerland, minor
editing. New to some points. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss President Flavio Cotti has
appealed to U.S. President Bill Clinton for help in fighting
threats by U.S. cities and states to impose sanctions on Swiss
banks if a settlement is not reached on Holocaust survivors'
claims, the Swiss Foreign Ministry said Wednesday.
	   A number of U.S. cities and states, including Florida and New
York City, have threatened to impose sanctions on Switzerland's two
major banks. California has also said it won't seek new contracts
with the bank's U.S. subsidiaries.
	   In a letter, Cotti warns Clinton that the threats are
``undermining the traditionally good relations'' between
Switzerland and the United States and calls on him and his
administration to ``take decisive action against the sanctions,''
the ministry said in a statement.
	   Talks have been stalled since Jewish leaders reacted angrily to
the offer by the banks on June 19 of dlrs 600 million to settle the
claims.
	   Switzerland's ambassador in Washington, Alfred Defago, was to
deliver the letter to the White House on Wednesday afternoon,
ministry spokesman Franz Egle said.
	   Switzerland's four major political parties and by the main
industry body, Vorort, welcomed Cotti's intervention.
	   ``We're very glad of any support from official circles,'' said
Silvia Matile, spokeswoman for the Swiss Bankers Association.
	   The Clinton administration, which has praised Switzerland for
its efforts to assess its wartime past and make amends for any
wrongdoing, has repeatedly opposed the sanctions.
	   ``We are in basic agreement with President Cotti's principal
point that sanctions are inappropriate,'' said U.S. Ambassador
Madeleine Kunin. ``We continue to strongly oppose sanctions.''
	   Cotti restated Switzerland's intention to continue its efforts,
which include a fund to help needy Holocaust survivors, an
independent panel of historians reviewing the period, and a
U.S.-led committee investigating Holocaust-era assets in Swiss
banks.
	   His letter referred to ``the exceptionally intense nature of
economic relations between the two countries, as well as to the
fact that Switzerland ranks as one of the United States' largest
investors.''
	   During a brief visit to Geneva in May, the U.S. president
assured Swiss officials of his opposition to sanctions.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A company at the center of an alleged World Cup
ticket scam was officially shut down by a London Court on
Wednesday.
	   Great Portland Entertainments, based in central London,
allegedly failed to deliver 40,000 pre-paid World Cup tickets,
worth an estimated 2.4 million pounds (dlrs 3.95 million), to
thousands of English and Scottish soccer fans.
	   The company, which was run by former bankrupt David Spanton and
was not an authorized World Cup ticket supplier, had been placed
under receivership on June 4 _ six days before the tournament
started.
	   Great Portland Entertainments is also under criminal
investigation after it emerged that fans and travel agents had not
received tickets they had paid for.
	   The government applied for the winding up order and was
supported by two creditors, owed at least 770,000 pounds (dlrs 1.28
million) between them.

European ministers seek agreement on marine pollution policy

<TEXT>
	   SINTRA, Portugal (AP) _ European environment ministers met here
Wednesday to discuss new rules on marine pollution in the North
East Atlantic, including measures to curb decommissioned oil rigs
and levels of radioactive waste discharges.
	   Oil and nuclear companies could face multimillion-dollar
clean-up bills depending on the outcome of the two-day meeting of
ministers from 12 European Union nations and Norway and Iceland.
	   The meeting in this town on Lisbon's outskirts, the first of the
Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the
North East Atlantic (OSPAR) at ministerial level, was due to
announce its decisions Thursday.
	   Most European nations want a sweeping ban on the dumping of
decommissioned oil rigs at sea _ an issue which sharpened in 1995
when public opinion forced oil company Shell to back down on a
decision to dump its Brent Spar loading buoy in deep waters.
	   Norway, the world's largest oil exporter, and Britain had been
the only two countries opposed to a total ban until last week, when
Tony Blair's government announced it would support a total ban at
the meeting.
	   Norway's Deputy Oil Minister Haakon Gill said Wednesday that
Oslo will support a ban as long as new rules allow special
consideration for offshore units that are too big or dangerous to
dismantle.
	   ``There is a bit of a tug-of-war going on over the large
platforms,'' Gill told The Associated Press in Oslo. ``We accept a
general ban ... but when it comes to the large steel platforms, it
must be decided on a case by case basis.''
	   Greenpeace, which has observer status at the meeting, says
Norway is reluctant to accept a sweeping ban because it wants to
expand operations into the Arctic circle where oil installations
will require heavier steel structures.
	   Proposals on radiation discharges, concerning Britain and
France, range from a total ban on discharges of nuclear waste _ the
so-called zero option _ to emissions being capped at agreed levels.
	   More than 90 percent of all radioactive waste discharges into
the sea covered by OSPAR come from three nuclear reprocessing
plants which are located at La Hague in France and at Sellafield
and Dounreay in Britain.
	   Norway wants an end to discharges from Sellafield, claiming that
radioactive buildup along its coast can be traced back to the
British plant.
	   Britain's Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott said in a brief
speech to the conference that his country wanted to shed the
nickname of ``the dirty man of Europe.''
	   French Environment Minister Dominique Voynet favored changes to
radioactive discharge levels, but said any reductions would depend
on their ``technical feasibility.''
	   OSPAR members have agreed to hold future meetings every five
years.

Israeli parliament gives preliminary approval to Golan referendum
</HEADLINE>
bill

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's parliament on Wednesday gave
preliminary approval to a bill stipulating that the government must
hold a referendum on any decision to withdraw from the Golan
Heights.
	   Critics warned that the legislation, which is supported by some
members of the dovish opposition, will make it even more difficult
to negotiate a peace agreement with Syria. Negotiations between
Israel and Syria were suspended in February 1996.
	   The bill also stipulates that a special majority of 61 members
of the 120-seat parliament must approve a Golan pullback. The
legislation was submitted by the Third Way, a party staunchly
opposed to a troop withdrawal from the strategic heights Israel
captured from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanuyahu, meanwhile, denied Wednesday
that he was engaged in secret peace talks with Syria.
	   Netanyahu responded to reports that Cabinet hawk Ariel Sharon
warned Golan settlers that the prime minister was secretly
negotiating an Israeli pullback from the strategic plateau.
	   Netanyahu said such negotiations were impossible as long as
Syrian President Hafez Assad insisted that Israel first commit in
principle to a withdrawal from all of the Golan.
	   Israeli media speculated Wednesday that Sharon, who is on a
visit to China, may have made the allegations in hopes of
pressuring the Third Way which, while being hawkish on the Golan
issue, advocates territorial compromise with the Palestinians.
	   In recent days, the Third Way has threatened to bring down the
government unless Netanyahu reached agreement with the Palestinians
by next week on a troop withdrawal from 13 percent of the West
Bank. Sharon staunchly opposes such a pullback, saying it would
endanger Israel's security.
	   In a meeting with Golan settler leaders last week, Sharon
reportedly said that by pushing for a 13 percent withdrawal, the
Third Way was unwittingly paving the way for a Golan withdrawal.
	   Netanyahu is holding secret talks with the Syrians, and once a
West Bank pullback is out of the way, the Golan would be next,
Sharon reportedly told the Golan settlers.

Internet `father': NASA to extend Cyberspace to outer space
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALEXANDER G. HIGGINS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ NASA scientists are preparing for the first
interplanetary Internet ``gateway'' on the next Mars mission, a key
telecommunications figure said Wednesday.
	   The idea is to go beyond the earthly Internet site that many
people around the world visited last year to follow the adventures
of the Mars Pathfinder's rover on the Red Planet, said Vinton Cerf,
widely regarded as a ``father'' of the Internet.
	   ``The time is now to think beyond the Earth,'' Cerf told INET
'98, the annual meeting of the global Internet Society. ``There is
now an effort under way to design and build an interplanetary
Internet.''
	   The system would serve space exploration and link future
astronauts in space with the earthly Internet.
	   Cerf, a senior vice president for MCI Communications Corp., said
he and other Internet experts have been working on the project with
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory since last November.
	   ``This is quite real,'' Cerf said. ``The effort is becoming
extraordinarily concrete over the next few months because the next
Mars mission is in the planning stages now.''
	   NASA is planning a series of Mars missions at two-yearly
intervals starting in 2001, that would lead up to astronauts
landing on the Red Planet.
	   Cerf said the planners envision planetary internets networks
that look very much like the Internet on Earth, but that something
must be done to link the networks.
	   A key problem are the great distances, which means it can take
six hours to send a message from planet to another, he said.
	   Cerf, co-inventor during the early 1970s of the so-called
``TCP-IP,'' the basic building block of the Net, said the plan is
to leave equipment in Mars orbit.
	   The Transmission Control Protocol-Internet Protocol is the set
of standards that lets any Internet message be read by any
computer.
	   Cerf said the equipment to be put on the next mission will be
designed to let computers talk to each other over the time lags
caused by the vast distances of outer space.
	   The devices could be ``an orbiting interplanetary gateway which
serves future missions and allows us to recreate Internet on an
interplanetary scale.''
	   One of the decisions that planners need to make is whether to
add new domain name suffixes such as ``.mars'' or ``.earth'' to
addresses for an interplanetary system, Cerf said.
	   While the Internet continues to grow rapidly on Earth, ``we
still have a lot of work to do to cover the planet,'' he said.

Latest estimates on size of Cyberspace
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Internet-Beyond Earth &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   The latest estimates on the size of Cyberspace, according to
Vinton Cerf, an Internet pioneer in the keynote speech Wednesday to
the annual global meeting of the Internet Society:
	   _At least 100 million people use the Internet. There will be
between 300 million and 1 billion users by December 2000. ``I don't
believe the billion number,'' said Cerf. ``I don't think we'll have
enough computers for all those people, but I can easily believe the
300 million figure.''
	   _45 million computers can ``log on,'' still a small number when
compared with the world's telephone system of 828 million
connections.
	   _240 of 250 countries have Internet service, ranging from a per
capita low in countries like China, where the Internet is
``vigorous and growing,'' to Finland, with ``the highest per capita
penetration.'' He gave no figures.
	   _3 million ``domain names'' addresses, many of which are based
on company trade marks.
	   _75 percent of the Internet use is for the World Wide Web.
	   _1.5 million Web sites with 350 million ``pages,'' there is a
great deal of ``dark information'' that searchers cannot see, such
as large databases that are not in the standard ``HTML'' format.
	   _The Internet is growing at 100 percent a year, compared with
5-10 percent a year for the telephone system. If those rates
continue, the Internet with be larger than the phone system in the
middle of the next decade.
	   _There are 7,500 Internet service providers, 4,500 of them in
the United States alone.

Source: Floyd to be head coach of Chicago Bulls
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with Floyd's arrival in Chicago, comment
from Jordan's agent, background on Floyd. No pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By NANCY ARMOUR &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ In a move that could push Michael Jordan to
retire, the Chicago Bulls have chosen Iowa State University's Tim
Floyd as their new head coach, The Associated Press has learned.
	   The announcement will be made Thursday, a Bulls source said
Wednesday, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Bulls spokesman Tim Hallam said he could not confirm that Floyd
was hired to succeed Phil Jackson. Floyd and his family arrived in
Chicago from Ames, Iowa, Wednesday, but would not comment.
	   Jordan has made no secret of his unwillingness to play for the
44-year-old Floyd, who has no NBA coaching experience and compiled
a 243-130 career record with five NCAA tournament appearances. He
has been at Iowa State for four years and his team went 12-18 last
season _ his only losing season in 12 as a college coach.
	   In his most recent public comments, Jordan reiterated that he
won't play for any coach but Jackson, who left at the end of the
season after the team won its sixth championship.
	   Jordan said he wouldn't announce a decision on his future with
the Bulls until after after a labor dispute with the NBA ends.
	   He has ridiculed Floyd by calling him ``Pink'' _ as in the rock
group Pink Floyd. Dennis Rodman also has called the possible hiring
of Floyd ``a joke.''
	   David Falk, Jordan's agent, said Wednesday that Floyd's hiring
was not a surprise.
	   ``I think it would be a shock to anyone close to the scene had
Tim Floyd not been hired,'' Falk said. ``This was a decision that
was made a year ago.''
	   He wouldn't say where Jordan was or if he had made a decision on
next season.
	   ``It's safe to say the only thing that motivates (Jordan) as far
as playing is to win championships. He's not playing for money,
he's playing because he loves the game of basketball,'' Falk said.
	   ``We only have one piece of the picture. It may be that piece is
of sufficient weight to outweigh everything else. Only time will
tell.''
	   Floyd, a good friend of Bulls vice president Jerry Krause,
interviewed with the team July 13 and was considered the leading
candidate for the job. Iowa State spokesman John McCarroll said
Floyd's resignation took effect immediately.
	   There had been reports earlier this week that Floyd was having
cold feet over accepting the Bulls job, perhaps because Jordan said
he wouldn't play for him. That would mean Floyd could be
characterized as the man _ fairly or unfairly _ who drove the

Welsh Rugby Union says World Cup final venue will be finished on

<TEXT>
	   CARDIFF, Wales (AP) _ The Welsh Rugby Union Wednesday moved to
dispel rumors that the venue for the 1999 rugby World Cup final
won't be ready in time to stage the sport's biggest game.
	   A British television report Wednesday suggested that
construction of the 120 million-pound (dlrs 197.2 million)
Millennium Stadium in Cardiff was behind schedule and the World Cup
final might have to be transfered to Paris or Edinburgh.
	   However, WRU chairman Glanmor Griffiths said the new stadium, on
the site of the famous Arms Park in Cardiff, will definitely host
the tournament.
	   ``Despite what is said or written, this project is on time and
will be completed by June next year,'' he said.
	   ``We will open the stadium on June 26th with a game against
South Africa and will be ready for the World Cup with the opening
match on October 1.
	   ``It is a great project and what we are trying to build in Wales
is the finest stadium in the world.''

Daimler-Benz launches new truck model at Ontario plant
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ST. THOMAS, Ontario (AP) _ German automaker Daimler-Benz started
production Wednesday of a new brand of heavy-duty truck at its
Freightliner plant in southwestern Ontario.
	   Juergen Schrempp, chairman of Daimler-Benz AG, looked on as the
first Sterling truck rolled off the assembly line.
	   The newly founded Sterling Truck Corp., based in Willoughby,
Ohio, is the result of Daimler-Benz's takeover last year of Ford
Motor Co.'s heavy-duty truck unit. The new Sterling trucks will be
sold by former Ford dealers in Canada and the United States.
	   Freightliner, based in Portland, Oregon, was bought by
Daimler-Benz in 1981.
	   Last year, Freightliner sold 73,500 commercial vehicles, making
it North America's leading manufacturer of heavy-duty trucks that
exceed 15 tons. The company now controls about 30 percent of that
market.
	   The St. Thomas plant, which employs 1,200 people, will build two
Sterling models: the A-Line series, a long-distance, diesel-powered
transport truck, and the smaller L-Line series distribution trucks.
	   About 12,000 trucks are expected to come off the assembly lines
this year and production is expected to rise to 20,000 units next
year.
	   Kurt Lauk, head of the Daimler-Benz commercial vehicle division,
said he expects daily output to reach 80 units in September.

Russian economy to shrink by 0.5 percent, Finance Ministry
</HEADLINE>
predicts &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: AMs. UPDATES with stocks closing lower, report of Communist
appointed to Cabinet. &QL; 
 &UR; By MAURA REYNOLDS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's economy will shrink by 0.5 percent this
year because of the current sharp and severe financial crisis, the
Finance Ministry predicted Wednesday.
	   The ministry had originally estimated 2 percent growth for 1998,
following a 0.8 percent increase last year _ Russia's first growth
since the 1991 Soviet collapse.
	   The Finance Ministry's macroeconomics chief, Anton Siluanov,
told the Interfax news agency that the shrinkage is likely to
worsen Russia's deficit, since the government's budget was based on
2 percent growth.
	   Reducing the deficit is one of several conditions imposed on
Russia by the International Monetary Fund, which approved a
multibillion-dollar rescue package this week.
	   However, Russian lawmakers have resisted moves to raise taxes
and cut the budget. In response, the IMF approved its part of a
dlrs 17.1 billion loan package for Russia this week, but reduced
the first installment by dlrs 800 million.
	   With previous loans, that brings Russia's international bailout
to dlrs 22.6 billion.
	   The reduced installment _ dlrs 4.8 billion _ is to be deposited
this week in the Central Bank to forestall a run on the Russian
currency, the ruble.
	   Siluanov blamed several factors for the economy's poor
performance, particularly the steep drop in world prices for oil, a
major Russian export, and reverberations from the financial crisis
in Asia.
	   Those factors combined with labor unrest in late spring spooked
foreign investors, who have been pulling out of Russia's markets in
droves.
	   The pattern continued Wednesday, with the stock market dropping
6.6 percent in light trading. All together, Russian stocks have
lost more than half their value in the past six months.
	   In other economic news:
	   _ Russia's largest oil companies pleaded with the government
Wednesday to lower taxes on oil production, warning of ``open
social conflict'' unless such measures are pursued.
	   In particular, they asked President Boris Yeltsin to rescind his
veto of a bill passed by parliament that would have lowered oil
excise taxes. The IMF has insisted the government raise, not lower,
taxes.
	   _ The government announced Wednesday that Russians will have to
start contributing more to the pension fund starting Aug. 1.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Sysuyev told a news conference that
pension contributions will rise from the current 1 percent of
income to 3 percent of income.
	   The higher rate will apply to investment income as well as
wages, Sysuyev said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   _ Russian news agencies, citing unidentified government sources,
reported Wednesday that Yeltsin had appointed a long-time Communist
Party member to serve in his Cabinet as Minister of Industry and
Trade.
	   However, a duty officer at the Kremlin press service denied the
reports, and the official, Yuri Maslyukov, told the Interfax news
agency that he was unaware of the appointment.
	   International lenders, including the IMF, World Bank and Japan,
have pledged new loans to Russia of dlrs 17.1 billion over two
years. Combined with previously approved loans, the bailout totals
dlrs 22.6 billion.

Gas tanker drivers end strike, harbor pilots stay out
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with ships entering ports in 3rd graf, EDITS to
conform &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Gas tanker truck drivers on Wednesday
called off a strike and resumed deliveries to the estimated 80
percent of Portugal's gas stations that had run dry during a
48-hour stoppage.
	   But no end was in sight for a strike by the country's 80 harbor
pilots, who guide ships into port, after the government refused to
negotiate with them. The 14-day stoppage, which began Tuesday,
initially choked the flow of imports and exports by sea.
	   To free up port traffic, the government suspended the law
requiring ship captains to hire a harbor pilot when docking. By 5
p.m. (1600 GMT) Wednesday, 15 cargo ships had docked at ports
around the country, officials said.
	   The 2,000 tanker truck drivers voted to return to work after the
government agreed late Tuesday to drop a system of mandatory
written tests for drivers, meeting the strikers' main demand, while
the employers agreed to pay them a risk subsidy _ a bonus for the
dangerous nature of the job _ although without specifying how much.
	   The National Road Transport Association, which represents
employers, said more than 1,500 tanker trucks from about 130
distribution companies were due to begin deliveries.
	   The National Association of Gas Vendors estimated it would take
three days for gas station tanks to be fully replenished.
	   ``There was panic-buying Tuesday night. The major cities were
the hardest hit,'' Association President Carlos Cazenave said by
phone.
	   Meanwhile, the Harbor Pilots' Union warned that circumventing
their members could endanger shipping, especially in Lisbon, where
large vessels carrying crude oil must maneuver around a sand bank
at the mouth of the Tagus River.
	   The harbor pilots are demanding a pay hike, a risk subsidy and
the right to set their own working conditions.
	   Following widespread allegations of corruption among the harbor
pilots, the government this year placed them under the supervision
of the port authorities _ a move resisted by the pilots.
	   More than 90 percent of harbor pilots are under investigation
for corruption, extortion and criminal association.

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks fell sharply for a second session
Wednesday as the market grappled with disappointing profit news
from Disney and Hewlett-Packard.
	   At noon (1600 GMT) on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 91.40 at 9,098.79, extending Tuesday's 105-point
slide.
	   Hewlett-Packard, which warned late Tuesday that it won't meet
Wall Street expectations for its current quarter, sank 2 to 55~ as
one of the Dow's bigger decliners along with fellow technology
component IBM, down 2~ at 125\.
	   Disney was down 1/2 at 37 3/16 after coming in shy of analyst
forecasts with late Tuesday's report on second-quarter profits.
	   Merck was down 3 9/16 at 125.25 after leading Tuesday's Dow
decline with a 10-point slide triggered by the drugmaker's slightly
disappointing second-quarter report and a warning about the rest of
1998.
	   The news from Merck and Hewlett-Packard has aggravated lingering
worries about the impact of the fiscal crisis in Asia and an
apparent slowdown in the domestic economy.
	   Hopes for a stimulative cut in interest rates by Federal Reserve
have been dashed by this week's remarks by Alan Greenspan in the
central bank chairman's midyear report to Congress.
	   Greenspan, making his second appearance before Congress in as
many days, said the most likely outcome of the spillover from Asia
is a welcome slowdown that will keep inflation in check and prolong
the current economic expansion.
	   The Standard and Poor's 500 index was down 6.65 at 1,158.42, and
the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index was down 25.93 at
1,953.21.
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-2 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 330.91 million
shares, up from Tuesday's early pace.
	   The NYSE composite index was down 4.34 at 586.33, and the
American Stock Exchange composite index was down 6.12 at 727.84.
	   Overseas, Tokyo's Nikkei stock average fell 1.6 percent,
Frankfurt's DAX index fell 1.5 percent and London's FT-SE 100 fell
2.3 percent.

EU envoy fails to break impasse, warns of rising tension
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ The European Union's special envoy for
Cyprus warned Wednesday of rising tension following the Greek
Cypriot decision to buy Russian anti-aircraft missiles.
	   The envoy, David Hannay, also said that resuming U.N.-sponsored
peace talks between the Greek and Turkish Cypriots could help clear
the air but admitted that his effort this week failed to get the
two sides back to the negotiating table.
	   ``It has not proved possible to restart the U.N. process, which
is at an impasse,'' Hannay told a news conference at the end of his
three-day visit.
	   The talks have been deadlocked since August, when Turkish
Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash demanded recognition of his breakaway
state in the Turkish-occupied north of the island and cancellation
of EU entry talks with Cyprus as preconditions for returning to the
negotiating table.
	   Denktash has been refusing to see EU officials unless his terms
are accepted.
	   Hannay, who conferred with President Glafcos Clerides and other
Greek Cypriot officials this week, said Denktash refused his
request to see him.
	   Hannay said Denktash's stance amounted to ``a limitation on
Denktash to influence a number of countries which are going to be
absolutely fundamental to the future of both parts of the island.''
	   Cyprus has been split into a Greek Cypriot-controlled south and
Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since Turkish troops invaded in
1974 after an abortive coup by Greek Cypriots who supported union
with Greece.
	   The breakaway Turkish Cypriot state in the north is recognized
only by Ankara, which maintains 35,000 troops there.
	   Hannay said he spoke with Clerides about ways of reducing
tension, but declined to reveal details.
	   Clerides' government plans to deploy the Russian-made S-300
missiles this fall.
	   Turkey has said it will prevent deployment of the missiles,
prompting Greece to respond that it will come to the aid of Cyprus
if it's attacked.
	   Clerides has reacted to European and American calls to cancel
the missile deployment by saying he would do so if Turkey accepts
his demilitarization proposal.
	   Hannay said the EU was taking Clerides' proposal ``extremely
seriously.''
	   He added: ``But the first thing to do is to stop the level of
armaments and military presence on this island rising. Before you
start to reduce, you've got to stop rising.''

Investigator's report in Rajiv Gandhi killing to be made public
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ A special investigator's exhaustive
findings on the assassination of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi
will be made public next week, the government announced Wednesday.
	   The government also will submit to Parliament its own report
detailing the action it has taken since receiving the findings on
the suicide bombing that killed Gandhi at an election rally in
southern India in May 1991, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Madan
Lal Khurana was quoted as saying by Press Trust of India.
	   The preliminary report issued last November by Judge Milap Chand
Jain accused the DMK _ a regional Tamil party now governing the
southern state of Tamil Nadu _ of supporting Sri Lankan guerrillas
blamed for the assassination.
	   That set off a chain of political events that toppled the
coalition government of socialist and liberal groups that included
the DMK, and led to national elections early this year. A coalition
led by Hindu nationalists now governs India.
	   The final report was not expected to have the same explosive
impact as the interim report.
	   The contents of the full report, that ran thousands of pages,
were not disclosed when it was submitted to the government in
March.
	   Gandhi, the son of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and
grandson of Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, led India from 1984
until he was defeated in 1989. He was campaigning to return to
power when he was killed by a woman who detonated explosives
strapped to her body. Gandhi backed Sri Lankan government attempts
to contain the Tamil rebellion.
	   The party is now headed by Sonia Gandhi, Rajiv's widow, who
broke her seven-year political isolation this year to step into
politics.
	   In January, a special court sentenced to death 26 people _
including Tamil Tiger rebels and their Indian accomplices _ in an
unprecedented judgment that was appealed to the Supreme Court. The
court has granted an injunction on carrying out the sentence.

	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ A U.N. delegation arrived in Algeria
Wednesday on an unprecedented mission to shed light on the sources
of more than six years of massacres, bombings and savagery.
	   The critical question is whether the group will have full
freedom of movement during its two-week mission, and access to all
parties in the drama that has taken an estimated 75,000 lives since
1992.
	   More than 50 people were killed over three days last week,
including two sunbathers killed in a new form of violence: bombs
hidden under the sand on Mediterranean beaches.
	   On Tuesday, four members of a government-armed self-defense
group were killed and 16 wounded in an ambush by armed men dressed
as police on the road between Oran and Mascara, west of the
capital, newspapers reported Wednesday.
	   The visit of the six-member delegation, led by former Portuguese
President Mario Soares, represents a breakthrough in international
efforts to carry out an independent inquiry into the violence.
	   Algeria long had resisted an inquiry, saying it would amount to
interference in the country's internal affairs.

Arab League offers to handle travel for Lockerbie suspects

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The Arab League offered Wednesday to handle
travel and security for two Libyans suspects if they are tried in
The Hague for a 1988 blast that destroyed a Pam Am jet, Egypt's
Middle East News Agency reported.
	   U.S. and British officials had demanded that any trial take
place in America or Britain, but said Tuesday they were considering
the possibility of a trial in another country.
	   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi has said repeatedly he would
accept the trial of the two Libyans in a neutral country under an
international panel of judges headed by a Scottish judge.
	   ``The League is ready to carry out the necessary measures of
handing over the suspects and maintaining their security,'' said
Mohammed Ismail, the league's assistant secretary-general for

	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Thirty-four people, at least half of
them children, were confirmed dead and up to 45 missing following
flash floods in northeastern Slovakia, the government flood
commission said Wednesday.
	   The floods hit the region late Monday, after a sudden downpour
caused water levels in local streams to rise up to six meters
(yards) in a matter of hours, trapping dozens of victims and wiping
out roads and bridges.
	   Cleanup efforts and the search for more victims continued as the
waters receded Wednesday. Some 200 soldiers reinforced hundreds of
volunteer rescue workers already on the scene.
	   The force of the rapidly rising and receding waters scattered
debris and threw human bodies into trees or mired them in mud. A
three-month-old child was discovered late Wednesday, but more were
still unaccounted for.
	   ``We are very unhappy because we are still missing a lot of
small children,'' Maria Kundirykova, a regional state administrator
said.
	   ``The number of victims is hardly final,'' said Jaroslav Timko,
spokesman for the rescue team in the Presov region.
	   Timko said water sources in the entire area were contaminated
and special trucks were delivering water to people. Local
authorities, fearing the outbreak of epidemics, were rounding up
stray dogs and destroying them.
	   Most of the victims lived in a Roma settlement near the village
Jarovnice, Timko said. A community Roma, also know as Gypsies,
lived in shacks that were completely washed away when the nearby
Svinka River flooded its banks.
	   The mayor of Jarovnice, Marian Kyjovsky, told the Czech daily
Mlada Fronta Dnes that most of the village's 3,500 inhabitants were
at home Monday evening because it was raining. Then they heard
something like a thunderstorm but that soon changed into the sound
of a fast going train. In the end, it was a 6-meter high, 50-meter
wide wave that swept 130 houses in a moment.
	   ``The water was coming from every side,'' Kyjovsky told the
daily. ``First the small houses of the Roma collapsed. All were
running uphill, old people, women, little children, but some of the
unfortunately didn't make it and disappeared in the water.
	   Damages from the high water were estimated Wednesday at 1.5
billion Slovak crowns (dlrs 47 million), said Anna Majkutova, a
flood commission spokeswoman.
	   Slovak state radio said France and the Czech Republic offered
humanitarian aid.
	   Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar's leading party donated 100,000
crowns (dlrs 3,000) to the victims in the affected areas, after
spending three times that amount on the first pre-election
campaign.

Mother Teresa's charity flays fundraising to observe nun's death
</HEADLINE>
anniversary &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CALCUTTA, India (AP) _ Mother Teresa's Missionaries of Charity
on Wednesday objected to people raising funds in her name, saying
the late nun would have disapproved.
	   Some residents of Calcutta, for decades the home of Mother
Teresa, have formed a committee to raise funds to institute an
award, rename a road in Calcutta and install a statue of the nun
who worked tirelessly with the dying and the destitute here.
	   ``I wish to make a public appeal to all organizations and
individuals contemplating such fundraising activities to respect
Mother's wish and not undertake such endeavors,'' Sister Nirmala,
Mother Teresa's successor as the superior-general of the
Missionaries of Charity, told a news conference in this eastern
Indian city.
	   ``We do not authorize anyone to solicit funds or goods for us
for any cause. ... We ourselves do not raise funds nor do we allow
others to do so,'' Sister Nirmala said.
	   The committee, however, said it would go ahead with its plans
and would even go to court if necessary.
	   Sister Nirmala said the Missionaries of Charity planned a simple
mass and prayer on the Sep. 5 anniversary Mother Teresa's death.

Saint Laurent's pared-down perfection
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SUZY PATTERSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Fashion Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Yves Saint Laurent's show of winter couture
Wednesday showcased terrific low-key clothes, masterpieces from the
acknowledged master of fashion.
	   The crowd of celebrities and admirers at the Intercontinental
Hotel practically sighed collectively over the marvelous straight
reefer jacket and the simple gray pants leading off the show.
	   It was all so well cut, from classic trouser suits to cashmere
jersey dresses with their three-quarter jackets, that you couldn't
mistake the hand of Saint Laurent himself.
	   He got a standing ovation for the perfect simplicity of it all,
from flared skirts just to the knee with perfect princess fitted
coats to a tweed pantsuit with graceful tulip front on the jacket.
Or a V-necked satin evening gown with a huge white ostrich-feather
puff at the neck.
	   It all looked wearable and graceful.
	   There were no theatrics like the 1988 sequined Van Gogh Iris
jacket, supposedly ordered in duplicate by a Saudi princess.
	   Fluid, longer and flared skirts in velvet or jersey also took
this collection into very wearable chic for day or night.
	   Rumors are flying about who might one day replace this great
creator as head of YSL couture. Could it be Jean-Paul Gaultier?
	   Not yet, according to Pierre Berge, president of Yves Saint
Laurent.
	   ``Cannot talk of that yet,'' he said after the show. ``Nothing
is decided, and we are simply admirers of Gaultier.''
	   But Gaultier was in the front row, just beside Saint Laurent
muse Catherine Deneuve.
	   Already, Saint Laurent is giving up his ready-to-wear designing
to American Alber Elbaz, poached recently from Guy Laroche.
	   And Gaultier described the Saint Laurent show as ``sublime,
perfection.''
	   With those pure and perfect velvet gowns at the end of the show,
the fuchsia crepe bustier dress, or a vermilion festive satin skirt
and stole with a black velvet V-shaped top, this pared-down
collection could not be faulted.
	   Daring it was not, but that doesn't matter to his admirers _
like American fashion leader Nan Kempner and one of France's
richest women, Liliane Bettencourt, who love the glamour and
subtlety.
	   At Balmain, Oscar de la Renta showed wearable clothes for a chic
elite based on romantic ideas like a trip to St. Petersburg.
	   Balmain is now famous for de la Renta's smart, luxurious outfits
for the likes of ``American ladies who lunch'' _ and he does them
very well.
	   Try a long alpaca beige coat, or ottoman jersey gray pants and a
caramel jacket with sable collar. Nothing is shocking, but well
made in the couture vein, every stitch invisible.
	   Of course, we're talking tens of thousands of dollars, but the
couture does give ideas to those who know how to put clothes
together.
	   De la Renta showed fabulous black velvet gowns, bustier dresses,
lace outfits, and brocade suits with little britches under puffy
skirts.
	   Next on the agenda at Balmain: Gilles Dufour will take over the
semi-couture ready-to-wear. Dufour is an old hand at sophisticated
styles, having working as Karl Lagerfeld's right-hand man at Chanel
for many years.
	   Paco Rabanne had his usual shiny take on fashion. Like de la
Renta at Balmain, he liked Russian court ideas to inspire his
runway.
	   Cossack figures came out in much fake fur, like red jackets with
sequins, plus huge toque hats.
	   To vary the micro-skirted mirror effects, there were coppery
gold jumpsuits, Charleston-style flapper dresses with plenty of
metal, and some metallic hard-blue taffeta puffy coats over lean
pants.

Jane's: Myanmar starts manufacturing small arms
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Myanmar has started manufacturing small arms in a
prefabricated factory built by a Singapore company in conjunction
with Israeli consultants, Jane's Defense Weekly reported Wednesday.
	   The first item being produced in the factory is thought to be
the EMERK-1, designed in 1995 by the army's Electrical and
Mechanical Enginering Corps and available as either an assault
rifle or light machine gun, the respected military magazine said.
	   The military regime in Myanmar, formerly Burma, came to power in
1988 after gunning down 3,000 democracy demonstrators. It refused
to recognize a 1990 election in which the party of democracy
movement leader and 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi
scored a landslide victory.
	   According to Jane's, Chartered Industries of Singapore produced
the factory last year and dismantled it after testing.
	   The components, packed in 36 containers that weighed 413,341
kilograms (909,350 pounds), were then shipped from Singapore to
Yangon, formerly Rangoon, in mid-February, Jane's said, quoting
shipping documents it obtained.
	   The cargo was described in the documents as a ``pre-engineered
building system'' and the consignee was listed as the Directorate
of Defense Industries, Ministry of Defense, which is Myanmar's
state-owned arms and ordnance manufacturer, the magazine said.
	   Jane's said the factory may have been assembled within weeks,
``perhaps at Magway, around 400 kilometers (250 miles) north of
Yangon on the east bank of the Irrawaddy River.''
	   The modular design factory, which can be expanded, is intended
to produce small arms and weapons up to 37 mm in caliber, it said.
	   ``Israeli consultants who worked on the project are linked with
Israeli Military Industries, although it is unclear whether they
are current or former employees,'' Jane's said.

 &UR; Israeli defense minister asks for U.S. help in negotiations

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ The first direct talks in months between
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators on the Mideast peace process,
ended without agreement and both sides urged the United States
Wednesday to resume its role as mediator.
	   The American administration had arranged the talks after
announcing earlier this month that it had exhausted its efforts to
win agreement for its peace plan which calls for an Israeli troop
pullback of 13 percent in the West Bank.
	   The talks were widely seen as the last chance for Israel and the
Palestinians to reach such an agreement for some time.
	   ``The meetings ended yesterday with out any progress because the
Israeli side did not present any thing new and continues to reject
the U.S. initiative,'' said Nabil Abourdeneh, a senior advisor to
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
	   An Israeli official, who spoke on condition of anonymity said
the Palestinians cut off talks after three days as a negotiating
tactic. ``They've done this before, they want even more concessions
and no demands,'' the official said.
	   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said American
involvement could help bring about a much-needed summit between
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Arafat to try and
resolve the disputes.
	   ``What is also needed now is high-level American involvement,
with the (U.S. Mideast) envoy, Dennis Ross and Secretary Madeleine
Albright helping us to reach an agreement,'' Mordechai said.
	   When asked what he thought of Mordechai's call for U.S. help,
Arafat said: ``We are not against it.'' His aide, Abourdeneh said
the Palestinians would ``present the American administration with a
report on the talks. We will inform the Americans that it is the
Israeli government that refuses to deal with their initiative,'' he
said.
	   It was not immediately clear how the United States would respond
to the new request for intervention.
	   The Clinton administration has been trying since January to win
support for a land-for-security plan in which Israel's troop
withdrawal would be met by greater Palestinian efforts to crack
down on Islamic militants.
	   The Palestinians have accepted the U.S. initiative, but
Netanyahu has balked at the scope of the withdrawal and said he
needed stronger guarantees that the Palestinians will live up to
their security obligations.
	   The Israeli-Palestinian contacts began with a Sunday meeting
between Mordechai and Arafat's deputy, Mahmoud Abbas, followed by
contacts between lower-level negotiators on Monday and Tuesday.
	   Netanyahu has said he did not want to focus only on the troop
pullback, but also wanted to raise several other issues such as the
extradition of Palestinians suspected of killing Israelis.
	   Under previous accords the two sides are to work out remaining
differences and reach a final agreement on issues of Jerusalem,
Palestinian statehood and settlements by May 1999.
	   Wednesday, the Israeli architect of the original accords
suggested that the May deadline by pushed back two years, to 2001,
to avert an inevitable collision between the two sides.
	   Labor Party legislator Yossi Beilin said in order to avoid
violent confrontation between the two sides in the absence of a
peace deal, Israel should accept a Palestinian state which would be
demilitarized, a concession Arafat would have to make as well.

<TEXT>
	   PLATEAU DE BEILLE, France (AP) - A quick look at Wednesday's
stage of the 85th Tour de France.
	   STAGE - The 11th stage from Luchon to Plateau de Beille, 170
kilometers (105 miles) with five climbs before an off day on
Thursday.
	   WINNER - Marco Pantani of Italy, catching Roland Meier of
Switzerland of the final climb.
	   YELLOW JERSEY - Defending champion Jan Ullrich lost a little of
his overall lead but still has a margin of 1 minute 11 seconds over
Bobby Julich of the United States.
	   HOW THE OTHERS FARED - Laurent Jalabert, who replaced Richad
Virenque as the French hope, is third now with Pantani fourth, both
3:01 behind Ullrich.
	   The 1996 winner, Bjarne Riis of Denmark and Ullrich's teammate
on the Telekom team, is now 15th, 7:00. He lost a little on the
final climb while trying to stay with the Ullrich group.
	   TOUR TIDBIT - Pantani has won five stages in the Tour de France,
all finishing up with a final climb up a mountain, such as twice at
l'Alpe d'Huez. On the three days in the Alps coming up, only one
day ends with a short climb.
	   QUOTE OF THE DAY - ``I got to lay it on the line in the Alps one
or two days to see if I can win this thing,'' Bobby Julich of
United States, second in the overall standings to Jan Ullrich.
	   NEXT STAGE - There is a rest day on Thursday before a relatively
flat 12th stage on Friday from Tarascon-sur-Ariege to Cap d'Agde,
222 kilometers (137 miles).

Fighting rages on outskirts of capital despite cease-fire
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHE NKURUNZIZA &QC;

<TEXT>
	   BUJUMBURA, Burundi (AP) _ Fighting between the army and Hutu
rebels raged Wednesday just south of the capital despite a declared
cease-fire as peace talks to end the Burundi conflict went into
their second day in neighboring Tanzania.
	   Residents said 20 people have been killed in Mutambu commune, 15
kilometers (10 miles) southeast of the capital in Rural Bujumbura
province since the fighting between Hutu rebels and Tutsi soldiers
erupted earlier this week.
	   Fighting was also reported Wednesday in the southern regions of
Makamba and Bururi.
	   The battles coincided with the second round of all-party peace
talks in the northern Tanzania town of Arusha in an effort to end
the conflict that has left 200,000 people dead in the last five
years.
	   A cease-fire agreed upon in the first round of talks in June was
to have gone into effect July 20.
	   ``There are those trying to destabilize who want to make their
presence known while the negotiations are being conducted in
Arusha,'' said Stanislas Ntahobari, governor of Rural Bujumbura
province said. ``It was the same thing during the first round of
negotiations.''
	   Ntahobari said the Hutu rebels belonged to the National Front
for Liberation, the armed wing of the Palipehutu political party
that is one of 19 groups participating in the Arusha talks.
	   The governor said 3,000 people have left their homes on the
orders of the military after the fighting broke out. They have
gathered in government-protected areas in the same region.
	   He said rebels had also killed a local official in Mubone, 5
kilometers (3 miles) west of Mutambu on Monday. The rebels blamed
the local chief, Egide Kizoviyo, for cooperating with the Tutsi
army, Ntahobari said.
	   Kizoviyo's death brought to 60 the number of local officials
killed in Burundi since the assassination of the country's first
Hutu president by Tutsi paratroopers in 1993 set off reprisal
killings.
	   President Pierre Buyoya, a retired army general and former
president, overthrew a Hutu-led coalition government in bloodless
coup in July 1996, saying he was the only one who could end the
violence.
	   But several groups of Hutu rebels, including the NFL and the
armed wing of the National Council for the Defense Democracy
(CNDD), have continued an insurgency in which most of the victims
are civilians. They seek to set up a majority Hutu government.
	   The Palipehutu and CNDD are among those taking part in the
talks. Government representatives, members of the National Assembly
are also participating, along with more than a dozen political
parties.
	   Military sources said Tuesday that despite the cease-fire they
would continue fighting the rebels because the rebels were
``killing innocent people.''
	   The Arusha talks opened Tuesday and were expected to last
several weeks.

World Cup pride lingers; Tour de France scandal troubles few
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DEBORAH SEWARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The decorations are down, but pride in France's
World Cup victory runs deep. As for the doping scandal that has
imperiled the Tour de France _ a treasured national institution _
not a soul in Paris seems troubled about that.
	   It's been a rough time for the Tour ever since its July 11
start, which organizers moved to Ireland and delayed by a week to
avoid a collision with the World Cup final.
	   The doping scandal broke out even before riders reached French
shores, and the 75-year-old race hasn't recovered the elan that has
made it the country's premier summer sports event.
	   French politicians, including President Jacques Chirac, have
lashed out against doping, a practice cycling organizers concede is
extremely difficult to detect.
	   However, French people seem to have no illusions that athletes _
from cyclists to soccer players _ may use drugs to enhance their
performances.
	   ``Corruption. Doping. The Tour de France has always been like
that,'' said Sean Marie Veldeman, a construction worker. ``Frankly,
it doesn't interest me a bit.''
	   Yves Olariat, a motorcycle delivery man, felt the same way. ``I
could not care less about the Tour,'' he said.
	   A poll in Monday's edition of the France-Soir newspaper showed
72 percent of those queried said doping could not be justified, and
84 percent said the practice should be banned because it tarnishes
sports in the eyes of young people.
	   But only 51 percent were shocked to learn that some cyclists on
the Tour used stimulants, and 47 percent weren't surprised at all.
	   The poll was conducted July 17-18 by the well-known IFOP polling
agency among 1,001 people. Polls of this magnitude in France
usually have an error margin of plus or minus 2-3 percent.
	   The lucrative Tour does interest businesses, the primary
sponsors of the teams, and French newspapers, which have kept the
scandal on the front pages for a week already.
	   France 2/3 television, which broadcasts daily about five hours
of the Tour, much of it live, was unable Wednesday to say whether
viewership had fallen as a result of the scandal.
	   Tour organizers also said they didn't know yet whether
attendance was off.
	   ``The Tour doesn't matter to me at all. It happens every year,''
said Jad Matjoub, a French student of Tunisian origin. ``It's the
same thing over and over again.''
	   But Matjoub couldn't stop talking about France's soccer triumph
and the team's multi-ethnic composition in a country where 15
percent of the electorate regularly vote for the xenophobic
National Front.
	   ``It gives us a lot of pride,'' Matjoub said. ``You still feel
the excitement. It was so unexpected.''
	   Tour fans will have a chance to see the race again next year,
but it will be a long time before France experiences a thrill like
the World Cup again.
	   ``It was a month of excitement,'' said Veldeman, the
construction worker. ``Now, it's just the same old routine.''

	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ Citizens of Belarus and Russia will no
longer be able to travel to Poland without visas, a Polish diplomat
told a news conference Wednesday.
	   Waldemar Mendzelewski, head of the Polish Embassy's consular
department, said the change is unconnected to an ongoing diplomatic
dispute that lead Poland's ambassador to Belarus in protest.
	   ``This is connected only to a law on foreigners, which was
passed in Poland at the end of last year,'' Mendzelewski said.
``This step is not a form of discrimination against citizens of
Belarus or Russia.''
	   Under the new rules, Belarusian and Russian nationals can be
issued visas when they arrive in Poland, Mendzelewski said.
	   Poland's ambassador is one of nine who have left Belarus to
protest orders from the Belarusian government to vacate their
residences in a diplomatic compound in the suburb of Drozdy.
	   Belarus has said it needs to repair the plumbing and sewage
system in the compound. The ambassadors say that under the Vienna
Convention on diplomatic relations, Belarus has no right to force
them out for any reason.
	   Diplomats from the United States, Britain, Germany, France,
Greece, Italy, Japan, Bulgaria and Poland have all left Minsk in
protest.

Parliament raised minimum wage
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's parliament on Wednesday approved
an increase in the minimum wage from 10 hryvna (dlrs 5) a month to
55 hryvna (dlrs 27.50).
	   Although most people already earn more than the minimum wage,
the figure is used to calculate various payments throughout the
country.
	   President Leonid Kuchma imposed the higher wage by decree last
month, but it still required approval from parliament.
	   The increase will cost the government an additional 10 million
hryvna (dlrs 5 million) this year, Labor and Social Policies
Minister Ivan Sakhan told parliament.
	   Ukraine's leftist-dominated legislature is often opposed to
Kuchma's reforms, but has favored extra spending for social needs.
	   Last year parliament approved a law under which the minimum wage
is to be raised every three months to reach the official poverty
level, which was set by lawmakers at 73.9 hryvna a month (dlrs 37).
	   The average monthly wage in Ukraine was about 170 hryvna (dlrs
85) in the first half of 1998.

World Cup pride lingers; Tour de France scandal troubles few
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: also moved on sports wires. &QL; 
 &UR; By DEBORAH SEWARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The decorations are down, but pride in France's
World Cup victory runs deep. As for the doping scandal that has
imperiled the Tour de France _ a treasured national institution _
not a soul in Paris seems troubled about that.
	   It's been a rough time for the Tour ever since its July 11
start, which organizers moved to Ireland and delayed by a week to
avoid a collision with the World Cup final.
	   The doping scandal broke out even before riders reached French
shores, and the 75-year-old race hasn't recovered the elan that has
made it the country's premier summer sports event.
	   French politicians, including President Jacques Chirac, have
lashed out against doping, a practice cycling organizers concede is
extremely difficult to detect.
	   However, French people seem to have no illusions that athletes _
from cyclists to soccer players _ may use drugs to enhance their
performances.
	   ``Corruption. Doping. The Tour de France has always been like
that,'' said Sean Marie Veldeman, a construction worker. ``Frankly,
it doesn't interest me a bit.''
	   Yves Olariat, a motorcycle delivery man, felt the same way. ``I
could not care less about the Tour,'' he said.
	   A poll in Monday's edition of the France-Soir newspaper showed
72 percent of those queried said doping could not be justified, and
84 percent said the practice should be banned because it tarnishes
sports in the eyes of young people.
	   But only 51 percent were shocked to learn that some cyclists on
the Tour used stimulants, and 47 percent weren't surprised at all.
	   The poll was conducted July 17-18 by the well-known IFOP polling
agency among 1,001 people. Polls of this magnitude in France
usually have an error margin of plus or minus 2-3 percent.
	   The lucrative Tour does interest businesses, the primary
sponsors of the teams, and French newspapers, which have kept the
scandal on the front pages for a week already.
	   France 2/3 television, which broadcasts daily about five hours
of the Tour, much of it live, was unable Wednesday to say whether
viewership had fallen as a result of the scandal.
	   Tour organizers also said they didn't know yet whether
attendance was off.
	   ``The Tour doesn't matter to me at all. It happens every year,''
said Jad Matjoub, a French student of Tunisian origin. ``It's the
same thing over and over again.''
	   But Matjoub couldn't stop talking about France's soccer triumph
and the team's multi-ethnic composition in a country where 15
percent of the electorate regularly vote for the xenophobic
National Front.
	   ``It gives us a lot of pride,'' Matjoub said. ``You still feel
the excitement. It was so unexpected.''
	   Tour fans will have a chance to see the race again next year,
but it will be a long time before France experiences a thrill like
the World Cup again.
	   ``It was a month of excitement,'' said Veldeman, the
construction worker. ``Now, it's just the same old routine.''

 &UR; Israeli defense minister asks for U.S. help in negotiations
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to UPDATE with fresh quotes; Changes byline &QL; 
 &UR; By DAFNA LINZER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ The first direct talks in months between
Israeli and Palestinian peace negotiators ended without agreement
and both sides urged the United States Wednesday to resume its role
as mediator.
	   The United States had pressed for the direct talks after
announcing earlier this month that it had exhausted its efforts to
win agreement for for an Israeli troop pullback from 13 percent in
the West Bank.
	   ``The meetings ended yesterday with out any progress because the
Israeli side did not present anything new and continues to reject
the U.S. initiative,'' said Nabil Abourdeneh, a senior advisor to
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
	   Israeli officials would not comment on the record about why the
talks broke down, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said he
did not want to focus only on the troop pullback, but also wanted
to raise several other issues such as the extradition of
Palestinians suspected of killing Israelis.
	   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said U.S. involvement
could help bring about a much-needed summit between Netanyahu and
Arafat to try and resolve the disputes.
	   ``What is also needed now is high-level American involvement,
with the (U.S. Mideast) envoy, Dennis Ross and Secretary Madeleine
Albright helping us to reach an agreement,'' Mordechai said.
	   When asked what he thought of Mordechai's call for U.S. help,
Arafat said: ``We are not against it.'' His aide Abourdeneh said
the Palestinians would ``present the American administration with a
report on the talks. We will inform the Americans that it is the
Israeli government that refuses to deal with their initiative,'' he
said.
	   It was not immediately clear how the United States would respond
to the new request for intervention.
	   The Clinton administration has been trying since January to win
support for a land-for-security plan in which Israel's troop
withdrawal would be met by greater Palestinian efforts to crack
down on Islamic militants.
	   The Palestinians have accepted the U.S. initiative, but
Netanyahu has balked at the scope of the withdrawal and said he
needed stronger guarantees that the Palestinians will live up to
their security obligations.
	   The Israeli-Palestinian contacts began with a Sunday meeting
between Mordechai and Arafat's deputy, Mahmoud Abbas, followed by
contacts between lower-level negotiators on Monday and Tuesday.
	   Under previous accords the two sides are to work out remaining
differences and reach a final agreement on issues of Jerusalem,
Palestinian statehood and settlements by May 1999.
	   Also Wednesday, the Israeli architect of the original accords
suggested that the May deadline by pushed back two years, to 2001,
to avert an inevitable collision between the two sides.
	   Labor Party legislator Yossi Beilin said in order to avoid
violent confrontation between the two sides in the absence of a
peace deal, Israel should accept a Palestinian state which would be
demilitarized, a concession Arafat would have to make as well.

Ullrich holds onto lead but Julich threatens
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with details, quotes, For AMS &QL; 
 &UR; BY SALVATORE ZANCA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PLATEAU DE BEILLE, France (AP) - Jan Ullrich may have the lead
in the Tour de France but American Bobby Julich sounded a warning.
	   Julich trailed the German defending champion by 1 minute 11
seconds following Wednesday's 11th stage. He cut seven seconds from
the margin after Ullrich relaxed a little at the end of a hard day
that included five major clubs.
	   The 26-year-old Julich from Glenwood Springs, Colorado said he
is looking ahead to next week's three days in the Alps.
	   ``I got lay it on the line in the Alps one or two days to see if
I can win this thing,'' Julich said.
	   He was 17th in his first Tour last year. He showed he has
improved by taking third in the time trial and fourth in the
prologue as well as staying with Ullrich in the two stages in the
Pyrenees.
	   ``I felt very very comfortable today,'' Julich said. ``I felt
stronger at the top. On a climb like today you have to be a little
cautious and that's what I did today.''
	   Italian Marco Pantani took the 11th stage, once again breaking
away from the Ullrich group up the final climb up 1,750 meters
(5,720 feet) in the Pyrenees.
	   Roland Meier of Switzerland, who had bulit up a lead of more
than five minutes during the day, was second, 1:26 behind Pantani
with Julich coming in third, 1:33 behind with Ulrich in eighth,
1:40 back.
	   Ullrich had a flat with about 20 kilometers (12.5 miles) left in
the stage and was helped back to the pack with his teammates.
	   Pantani said he held off, honoring an unwritten rule not to take
advantage of a situation like that.
	   ``I wanted to attack earlier but waited for Ullrich to come
back,'' Pantani said.
	   Once back, Ullrich worked his way through and then started
increasing the pace to catch Meier.
	   As in Tuesday's stage, Ullrich had to do the work while the
others followed.
	   Also as in Tuesday, Pantani took off in an attempt to gain
ground. Ullrich let him go, knowing that Pantani trailed by nearly
five minutes in the overall standings.
	   Pantani caught Meier with about six kilometers (4.5 miles) left
and won his fifth stage of the Tour de France, all in mountain
stages including two in l'Alpe d'Huez.
	   ``The Tour is like a game of chess,'' Pantani said. ``Right now
the race is wide open and there are still spectacular things to
come.''
	   Pantani won the Tour of Italy but said he needed a break.
	   ``After the Giro I had a lot of stress. I was tired, training
didn't go well and I went into this Tour not 100 per cent,''
Pantani said. ``Now everything is possible.''
	   After pacing the small group of chasing up the final climb,
Ullrich relaxed a little and came in eighth on the day 1 minute, 40
seconds behind Pantani. Ullrich lost seven seconds to a handful of
others, Julich.
	   Julich is second, 1:11 behind in the overall standings. Pantani
and Laurent Jalabert of France are 3:01 behind.
	   After a cool and foggy day on the first day in the mountains
Tuesday, the hot temperatures returned with the heat well above 30
C (86 F) on the route.
	   The heat took away one of the favorites when Abraham Olano of
Spain, the world road champion in 1995, dropped out with about 75
kilometers (46 miles) remaining in the 170-kilometer (105-mile) leg
from Luchon to Plataeu de Beille.
	   Olano was sixth in the overall standings and second in the
opening prologue. Once branded as five-time champion Miguel
Indurain's successor, Olano just missed the podium last year but
lost more than a minute in Tuesday's mountain stage.
	   There is a rest day on Thursday before the Tour resumes with a
222-kilometer (137-mile) leg from Tarascon-sur-Ariege to Cap d'Agde
as the Tour slowly makes its way across southern France before
hitting the Alps on Monday.
	   It was the second day in the mountains but the top climber of
the last four years, Richard Virenque, and his Festina teammates
are expected to be heard soon in a court in Lyon to explain their
involvment in the doping scandal.
	   Festina's director Bruno Roussel admitted a practice of
supplying illegal drugs with medical supervision to improve
performances which prompted Tour officials to exclude the
top-ranked Festina team the rest of the way.
	   The doctor for the banned Festina team, Erik Ryckaert, contended
that his riders were ordered by their manager to pay for
performance-enhancing drugs.
	   And now the Dutch TVM team is under suspicion. It was reported
that the same drug used by the Festina team was found in the car of
TVM officials in March.

	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ The first direct talks in months between
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators on the Mideast peace process,
ended without agreement and both sides urged the United States
Wednesday to resume its role as mediator.
	   The American administration had arranged the talks after
announcing earlier this month that it had exhausted its efforts to
win agreement for its peace plan which calls for an Israeli troop

<TEXT>
	   ORAHOVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian rebels withdrew
under cover of darkness early Wednesday from their last positions
in this strategic Kosovo town as international monitors visited the
site of one of the biggest battles in weeks.
	   Serb police, shielded beneath large umbrellas from the
blistering summer sun, stared toward the wooded hills for signs of
snipers. But Serb officials said the Kosovo Liberation Army, which
is fighting for independence from Serbia, had pulled back several
miles to the north.
	   Convoys of Serb police waving large Serbian flags rumbled along
the road from the provincial capital of Pristina, 30 miles (50
kilometers) to the east.
	   In Pristina, the Kosovo Information Center, which is close to
ethnic Albanian politicians, claimed 15,000 people had fled
Orahovac to escape the fighting, which began Friday with a strong
attack by the KLA.
	   The Albanian center said Serb police dragged civilians from
their homes and shot them. It quoted witnesses as saying police
also shot civilians who took refuge in the town mosque.
	   The reports could not be independently confirmed.
	   Earlier Wednesday, the U.N. refugee agency cast doubt on claims
that the town of 20,000 inhabitants was completely in Serb hands,
saying the area resounded with gunfire and occasional explosions
when its staff visited late Tuesday.
	   By Wednesday morning, however, Orahovac was quiet. The streets
were empty except for Serb police behind sandbagged abutments. A
dead horse lay on the pavement.
	   The fighting around Orahovac cast doubt on the possibility of a
negotiated settlement between Serbia, the dominant republic of
Yugoslavia, and ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of
Kosovo's population.
	   Kosovo Albanians said at least 36 ethnic Albanians had been
killed in the fighting.
	   The capture of Orahovac would have expanded the nearly 40
percent of Kosovo the KLA is said to control _ and given the rebels
command of a key road.
	   Germany's foreign minister said NATO would likely have to get
involved to end the violence.
	   ``On both sides, there is a lack of serious effort to contain
the armed violence and resume negotiations,'' Foreign Minister
Klaus Kinkel said in Bonn, Germany.
	   Also Wednesday, a group of Russian diplomats, part of an
international observer group in Kosovo, arrived for their first
visit since the fighting began. The observers issued no statement.
	   The Kosovo Information Center claimed Serb forces, which moved
into the town Saturday, were still shelling KLA positions in
Orahovac on Tuesday and that fighting was also raging in outlying
villages.
	   In Pristina, the self-styled Kosovo Albanian parliament,
controlled by moderate Ibrahim Rugova, issued a statement
acknowledging the ``growth of the liberation struggle in Kosovo.''
The reference was seen as an overture to the KLA in hopes of
winning agreement to join Rugova in talks with the government.
	   The fighting led the U.N. Security Council to vote Tuesday to
expand the peacekeeping force in Macedonia by about 300 troops,
mostly to strengthen security along borders with Kosovo and
Albania. U.S. troops will make up about one-third of the 1,000-plus
force.
	   Ending a visit to Kosovo, the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe issued a report Wednesay noting an influx of
armed fighters from neighboring Albania, increased abductions by
both sides and growing shortages of food and medicines.

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ The mandate for Russian peacekeepers in
Georgia runs out this month, but the government said it had not yet
decided whether it wants to keep the troops to monitor a breakaway
region.
	   U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott is scheduled to
visit Georgia on Thursday, and Georgia's conflict with the
separatist region of Abkhazia is expected to be a top topic.
	   Georgia has accused Russian peacekeepers of being too
sympathetic to the separatists during fighting in May between the
separatists and militia groups that support Georgian central
government.
	   Georgia's Security Council is expected to review the May clashes
at a July 30 meeting, and afterward a decision will be made about
whether the peacekeepers should stay or leave, said Georgian
Foreign Minister Irakly Menagarishvili.
	   The Georgians have often said that they want the Russian
peacekeepers to advance into a larger area of Abkhazia _ or pull
out of Georgia altogether.
	   ``Our position will be determined after the Security Council
gives an assessment of the latest events in the conflict zone,''
the foreign minister said.
	   The separatists support extending the peacekeepers' mandate.
	   ``The peacekeepers undoubtedly contribute to a non-violent
settlement of the conflict,'' Abkhazian leader Vladislav Ardzinba
told the Interfax news agency.
	   Hostilities continued Wednesday. Dali Dzhodzhua, a spokeswoman
for exiled Abkhazians, said a group of separatists took five
Georgians captive Wednesday and demanded ransom for their release.
She gave no additional details and her information could not be
immediately confirmed.
	   Abkhazia, a Black Sea province in northwest Georgia, declared
independence in 1992. The separatists drove out Georgian troops and
ethnic Georgian civilians in a 13-month war.
	   Violence breaks out repeatedly in the region despite the
presence of Russian peacekeepers.

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Moderate President Mohammad Khatami won a
major victory Wednesday when Iran's hard-line parliament approved
his nominee for interior minister.
	   The vote was widely seen as an attempt by hard-line deputies,
who dominate parliament, to avoid a confrontation with the popular
Khatami.
	   Abdolvahed Mousavi-Lari, a moderate cleric, won a 177-67 vote.
There were 22 abstentions and four members of the 270-member Majlis
did not attend the session.
	   ``We ... decided not to oppose Mousavi-Lari in an attempt to
reduce tension,'' said hard-line legislator Mohammed Reza Bahonar.
	   Just before the vote, Mousavi-Lari, 44, called for tolerance.
	   ``We believe in political development, which means a government
that is based on the vote of the people,'' he said in a speech.
``The government should increase its tolerance to accept the ideas
and opinions of its opponents.''
	   Mousavi-Lari was named to the post earlier this month after the
Majlis impeached Interior Minister Abdollah Nouri for allowing
political demonstrations that rocked the country.
	   The hard-liners had hoped to pressure Khatami into replacing
Nouri with one of their own but apparently backed down, fearing it
would anger the millions of Iranians who voted for Khatami last
year.
	   Bahonar, one of the main forces behind Nouri's impeachment,
warned that Mousavi-Lari like his predecessor, can be impeached.
	   Hard-liners control the armed forces, the Intelligence Ministry,
and the state-run radio and television.
	   In a speech to the Majlis before the vote, Khatami, said ``real
security'' could only be achieved if the public feels it is
participating in its future.
	   ``It is our responsibility to prepare the ground for people's
participation in all the economic, political and cultural affairs
of the society,'' he said.
	   This task must be accomplished by the Interior Ministry, he
said.
	   Mousavi-Lari was deputy minister of culture and Islamic guidance
from 1982 to 1992 when Khatami served as minister. He quit the
ministry when Khatami was ousted by hard-liners who objected to his
giving the press more freedom, liberalizing state-run television,
and permitting filmmakers to pursue non-Islamic themes.
	   Khatami has won wide support for his moves to ease social
restrictions, encourage political freedom, and end nearly 20 years
of hostility with the United States.
	   Also Wednesday, Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi, a close ally of
Khatami, said the United States must change its attitude and
policies if it is sincere about improving relations with Iran.
	   ``If this attitude is changing, we will respond if necessary,''
Kharrazi told a news conference.
	   His remarks were in contrast with comments made by supreme
leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei earlier this month. Khamenei
described conciliatory statements by the United States as a
``hypocritical political undertaking.''

King Hussein suspected to be suffering from cancer

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with statement from doctors &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ King Hussein is suspected to be suffering
from cancer of the lymph cells and will begin chemotherapy next
week if tests confirm the condition.
	   King Hussein, who is being treated at the Mayo Clinic, disclosed
the diagnosis in a letter to his brother, Crown Prince Hassan. The
letter was read on Jordanian television Tuesday night.
	   The king asked that the letter be read on television to inform
Jordanians of his condition, Prime Minister Abdul-Salam Majali said
Wednesday.
	   The king wrote that an ``excised lymph node and symptoms all
seem to point to lymphoma,'' or cancer of the lymphatic tissue. At
the same time there could be other reasons for the infection and
related symptoms, the letter said.
	   Doctors at the hospital in Rochester, Minnesota, are waiting for
full details of tests done on Friday.
	   If the cancer is ``confirmed next Tuesday, (the) physicians will
begin chemotherapy,'' Hussein wrote. He also noted that early
chemotherapy treatment might harm neutrophil and platelet, two
vital components of blood.
	   Hussein's private physician, Samir Farraj, said in a brief
statement released by the Mayo Clinic Wednesday that the king was
expected to remain at the clinic for three more weeks. The
statement gave no new information about results of the tests or the
Jordanian leader's condition.

Former homeland president found guilty of theft
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MAFIKENG, South Africa (AP) _ Former Bophuthatswana President
Lucas Mangope, who allied himself with white extremists to keep
control of his homeland, was found guilty Wednesday of 102 charges
of theft.
	   The court found that Mangope had stolen 5 million rand (dlrs
800,000) in foreign exchange funds and other money, and more than 2
million rand (dlrs 322,000) in mining royalties from a tribal
organization.
	   The thefts occurred before the enforced tribal homeland system
was dissolved by South Africa's first all-race elections in 1994.
	   In the month before the vote, Mangope invited 3,000 armed
members of the Afrikaner Volksfront, a coalition of white extremist
groups, to keep his power in this former homeland.
	   The extremists fired on a crowd of black civilians and soldiers
in Mafikeng, killing 20 people.

Report: At least 19 killed in fighting in northern Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ At least 19 people were killed in northern
Iraq in fierce fighting between an Iraqi Kurdish group and
autonomy-seeking Turkish Kurdish rebels, a pro-Kurdish news agency
said Wednesday.
	   The Germany-based DEM agency said 19 members of the Iraqi
Kurdistan Democratic Party, or KDP, were killed in clashes on
Monday in the Hakurk area, where the borders of Iraq, Turkey and
Iran meet.
	   Four Turkish soldiers, apparently coming to the aid of the
Ankara-allied KDP, were also killed.
	   A U.S. State Department delegation, led by Deputy Assistant
Secretary of State David Welsh, just returned from the region where
it found encouraging signs of reconciliation between the KDP and
its rival Iraqi faction, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, a U.S.
official said Wednesday.
	   The two rival Iraqi factions, long fighting to gain control of
northern Iraq, have been holding peace talks. Officially there has
been a cease-fire since May 1997.
	   Turkish Kurdish rebels use the region as a base to stage attack
against Turkey and have fallen out with the KDP, which controls
areas along the Turkish border.
	   The Kurdish zone was set up in 1991 by Western allies after
Iraqi forces crushed a Kurdish rebellion that broke out at the end
of the Persian Gulf War. Iraq considers the zone a violation of its
sovereignty.

Netherlands upsets U.S. 3-1, South Korea routs Russia 11-1
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: will be updated with late games. &QL; 
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ No major leaguers, no chance.
	   Rob Cordemans pitched a four-hitter and Ken Brauckmiller had
three hits and RBIs Wednesday as the Netherlands beat a United
States team of college players 3-1 in the preliminary round of the
Baseball World Championships.
	   The Netherlands has never finished higher than sixth in the
world and was ninth in 1994.
	   But the Americans, without the benefit of major leaguers, have
not won these championships since 1974, the last time the country
hosted the event. The United States was sixth four years ago.
	   The tournament is open to professionals for the first time, and
some minor league players are participating for Canada, the
Dominican Republic and other countries.
	   In one other early game Wednesday, South Korea routed Russia
11-1 in Palermo. The game was halted in the seventh inning because
of the 10-run mercy rule. South Korea and Netherlands (both 1-0)
share the lead in Pool B, with the U.S. and Russia (both 0-1) tied
for last.
	   The top four teams from each of the two eight-team groups will
advance to next week's quarterfinals.
	   Later Wednesday, five-time defending champion Cuba put its
31-game winning streak on the line against Spain in a Pool A game.
Other A games were Japan vs. Panama and South Africa vs. the
Dominican Republic. Pool B had Nicaragua vs. Taiwan and Australia
vs. Canada.
	   At Palermo, after University of Nevada-Las Vegas outfielder Ryan
Ludwick put the U.S. team up 1-0 with a solo homer in the second
inning, Brauckmiller tied the game with a sacrifice fly in the
third and drove in the go-ahead run with single in the fifth.
	   The Dutch added an insurance run in the top of the ninth when
outfielder Rikkert Faneyte, a long-time minor leaguer who had brief
stints with the Texas Rangers and San Francisco Giants, singled
home Jeffrey Cranston.
	   Cordemans went the full nine innings, allowing four hits and
four walks, while striking out five.
	   U.S. starter Alex Santos, an All-American for the University of
Miami last season, lasted 8 2-3 innings and gave up nine hits. Two
of the three runs he allowed were unearned.

World Cup pride lingers; Tour de France scandal troubles few
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to add `sports' in slug
 &UR; By DEBORAH SEWARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The decorations are down, but pride in France's
World Cup victory runs deep. As for the doping scandal that has
imperiled the Tour de France _ a treasured national institution _
not a soul in Paris seems troubled about that.
	   It's been a rough time for the Tour ever since its July 11
start, which organizers moved to Ireland and delayed by a week to
avoid a collision with the World Cup final.
	   The doping scandal broke out even before riders reached French
shores, and the 75-year-old race hasn't recovered the elan that has
made it the country's premier summer sports event.
	   French politicians, including President Jacques Chirac, have
lashed out against doping, a practice cycling organizers concede is
extremely difficult to detect.
	   However, French people seem to have no illusions that athletes _
from cyclists to soccer players _ may use drugs to enhance their
performances.
	   ``Corruption. Doping. The Tour de France has always been like
that,'' said Sean Marie Veldeman, a construction worker. ``Frankly,
it doesn't interest me a bit.''
	   Yves Olariat, a motorcycle delivery man, felt the same way. ``I
could not care less about the Tour,'' he said.
	   A poll in Monday's edition of the France-Soir newspaper showed
72 percent of those queried said doping could not be justified, and
84 percent said the practice should be banned because it tarnishes
sports in the eyes of young people.
	   But only 51 percent were shocked to learn that some cyclists on
the Tour used stimulants, and 47 percent weren't surprised at all.
	   The poll was conducted July 17-18 by the well-known IFOP polling
agency among 1,001 people. Polls of this magnitude in France
usually have an error margin of plus or minus 2-3 percent.
	   The lucrative Tour does interest businesses, the primary
sponsors of the teams, and French newspapers, which have kept the
scandal on the front pages for a week already.
	   France 2/3 television, which broadcasts daily about five hours
of the Tour, much of it live, was unable Wednesday to say whether
viewership had fallen as a result of the scandal.
	   Tour organizers also said they didn't know yet whether
attendance was off.
	   ``The Tour doesn't matter to me at all. It happens every year,''
said Jad Matjoub, a French student of Tunisian origin. ``It's the
same thing over and over again.''
	   But Matjoub couldn't stop talking about France's soccer triumph
and the team's multi-ethnic composition in a country where 15
percent of the electorate regularly vote for the xenophobic
National Front.
	   ``It gives us a lot of pride,'' Matjoub said. ``You still feel
the excitement. It was so unexpected.''
	   Tour fans will have a chance to see the race again next year,
but it will be a long time before France experiences a thrill like
the World Cup again.
	   ``It was a month of excitement,'' said Veldeman, the
construction worker. ``Now, it's just the same old routine.''

Three bodies found near where lawmaker was killed

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Three burnt bodies have been found in the woods
near the country home where Russian lawmaker Lev Rokhlin was
killed, but they are not connected to his shooting, a news agency
said Wednesday.
	   Forensic tests show the three people died two weeks before
Rokhlin was killed on July 3, ITAR-Tass said, quoting a senior aide
to the prosecutor general, Alexander Zvyagintsev.
	   Rokhlin's wife, Tamara, has confessed to shooting the former
general and outspoken critic of President Boris Yeltsin after a
quarrel and has been charged with murder. Police say her
fingerprints were found on the gun.
	   However, Rokhlin's relatives, opposition leaders and the media
have speculated that unidentified assailants told Mrs. Rokhlin to
make a false confession, or they would attack other family members.
Several alternative scenarios have been put forth, but none have
included evidence to contradict the authorities.
	   ``There are no grounds whatsoever to link one crime with the
other,'' Zvyagintsev said of the three corpses found with cuts on
their heads.
	   Investigators initially thought they could have been people
hired to kill Rokhlin, but had been killed themselves. However,
police later arrested two men who confessed to the killings and
were charged with murder, Zvyagintsev said.
	   The suspects said the three men had killed a member of their
criminal group and they had to ``settle the old score and take
revenge,'' Zvyagintsev said
	   Alexander Morozov, deputy head of the executive committee of the
Movement in Support of the Army, which Rokhlin founded with the
goal of ousting Yeltsin, said he doubted Mrs. Rokhlin could have
shot her husband with the Makarov pistol investigators said she
used.
	   ``Tamara Pavlovna never possessed that pistol,'' he said,
according to ITAR-Tass. ``The fact that Tamara Rokhlina's
fingerprints were found on the pistol does not prove that she fired
it. It could have been done by a person wearing gloves.''
	   Morozov said two shots were fired in the home, one in Rokhlin's
head and the other into a wall. Since no one heard two shots, the
killer must have used a silencer, which has not been found, he
said.
	   Morozov also questioned how three bodies could have remained in
the woods so close to the Rokhlin home without being found for more
than two weeks.
	   Rokhlin was a career soldier who won nationwide acclaim for his
performance during the 1994-96 war in Chechnya. He was elected to
parliament as a member of a pro-government faction, but later broke
away and became a fierce opponent of Yeltsin.

13 dead as bus plunges into canal in southern Egypt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A bus plunged into a canal in southern Egypt
Wednesday, killing 13 passengers, including a woman and a
three-year-old boy, a police official said.
	   The bus fell into the canal after a truck driver trying to pass
the vehicle swerved to the right, forcing the bus off the road, the
official said, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Nearby villagers rescued 36 passengers, who were hospitalized
for cuts and bruises, the official said.
	   The accident took place near the town of Minya, 220 kilometers
(135 miles) south of Cairo.
	   Villagers chased and caught the truck driver and handed him over
to police.

Jane's: India will launch nuclear submarine around 2006
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ India will launch its first nuclear-powered
submarine around 2006 or 2007, Jane's Defense Weekly reported
Wednesday.
	   Following nuclear tests in May by India and its rival neighbor,
Pakistan, New Delhi is now pressing ahead with the submarine
program which was started in the late 1970s, so it can deliver
nuclear weapons.
	   The nuclear reactor for the submarine, built by the Department
of Atomic Energy at the Bhaba Atomic Research Center in Trombay,
will begin tests at the Kalapakkam atomic research center near
Madras in southern India within 12 months, Jane's said.
	   Quoting official sources, the respected military magazine said
the submarine's keel will be laid by 2002, two years after the
completion of land tests on the nuclear reactor.
	   The first nuclear-powered submarine will be launched in 2006 or
2007 and commissioned a year later, Jane's quoted the sources as
saying.
	   The submarine will serve as a platform for nuclear-armed
missiles like the Sagarika, a cruise missile which is in an
advanced stage of development, official sources were quoted as
saying.
	   Rahul Roy-Chaudhury, a naval analyst at the Institute for
Defense Studies and Analyses in New Delhi, was quoted as saying the
submarine's capabilities will outstrip those of Pakistan's navy.
	   Pakistan will soon bring into service three French-designed
Agosta 90B submarines equipped with independent propulsion systems
for enhanced submerged endurance, he was quoted as saying.
	   The emerging strategic challenge from China will give the new
Indian submarine ``a crucial role in surveillance and deterrent
operations off the eastern straits of Malacca and Singapore by
2010,'' Jane's quoted Roy-Chaudhury as saying.
	   The Indian project is based on Russia's Charlie class
nuclear-powered submarine, but India must modify the design to
ensure compatibility with its locally produced reactor, Jane's
said.
	   The Indian navy leased the Chakra, a Charlie class
nuclear-powered sub, from the former Soviet Union in 1988 and
returned it in 1991. India had planned to acquire four to six
nuclear-powered submarines but the disintegration of the Soviet
Union put an end to the plans and the government decided to
accelerate its own program, Jane's said.
	   Indian navy sources were quoted by the magazine as saying that
the main problems facing the program were funding, miniaturization
of the nuclear reactor and providing suitable containment.
	   According to Jane's, Russia has not given India the blueprints
for the reactor as that would violate the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty.

French president to visit Moldova
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KISHINEV, Moldova (AP) _ French President Jacques Chirac will
make a one-day visit to Moldova on Sept. 4, the government said
Wednesday.
	   Chirac is expected to hold talks with President Petru Lucinschi
and other Moldovan leaders, and meet French-speaking students and
teachers, the presidential press service said.
	   It will be the first visit by a French president to Moldova,
which became independent with the 1991 collapse of the Soviet
Union. Chirac will travel to Moldova after visiting Ukraine.
	   France has some economic interests in Moldova. France Telecom
wants to buy the majority stake in the national communications
company, Moldtelecom, and the Lafarge cement company is interested
in buying a cement factory in the breakaway region of
Trans-Dniester.

Turkey to build four submarines with German shipyard
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ The Turkish navy and Germany's largest
shipyard on Wednesday signed a dlrs 556 million deal to jointly
build four submarines.
	   At the signing ceremony, Turkish Deputy Prime Minister and
Defense Minister Ismet Sezgin said the building of the first
submarine will begin 1999.
	   Germany's HDW shipyards, based in Kiel, will build the four
conventional submarines jointly with the navy in the Turkish
shipyard of Golcuk near Istanbul.
	   Turkey and Germany have undertaken dlrs 3.4 billion worth of
navy ventures since 1973, including building 10 submarines and
eight frigates.

Israel to beef up security in Jerusalem's Old City
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ After a series of stabbings inside Jerusalem's
walled Old City, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
announced Wednesday that his government would beef up police and
security in the area.
	   A statement from Netanyahu's office said the government has
allocated 20 million shekels (approx. dlrs 5.5 million) to meet the
security needs of the Old City's residents and the thousands of
tourists who visit the area each year.
	   The Old City is home to the Western Wall, Judaism's holiest
shrine, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, where Jesus is said to
have been crucified, buried and resurrected, and the al-Aqsa
Mosque, holy to Islam.
	   Israel captured the Old City and the rest of traditionally Arab
east Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war and later
annexed it. The Palestinians, who are the majority inside the Old
City, want the area to serve as the capital of a future Palestinian
state.
	   Israel, which claims control over the entire city, has
encouraged Jews to move into Arab neighborhoods and the two groups
often clash.
	   Two Jewish men have been fatally stabbed in the city's Muslim
quarter over the past 12 months where incidents of violence are
common.

Report: At least 19 killed in fighting in northern Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING TO delete writethru reference &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ At least 19 people were killed in northern
Iraq in fierce fighting between an Iraqi Kurdish group and
autonomy-seeking Turkish Kurdish rebels, a pro-Kurdish news agency
said Wednesday.
	   The Germany-based DEM agency said 19 members of the Iraqi
Kurdistan Democratic Party, or KDP, were killed in clashes on
Monday in the Hakurk area, where the borders of Iraq, Turkey and
Iran meet.
	   Four Turkish soldiers, apparently coming to the aid of the
Ankara-allied KDP, were also killed.
	   A U.S. State Department delegation, led by Deputy Assistant
Secretary of State David Welsh, just returned from the region where
it found encouraging signs of reconciliation between the KDP and
its rival Iraqi faction, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, a U.S.
official said Wednesday.
	   The two rival Iraqi factions, long fighting to gain control of
northern Iraq, have been holding peace talks. Officially there has
been a cease-fire since May 1997.
	   Turkish Kurdish rebels use the region as a base to stage attack
against Turkey and have fallen out with the KDP, which controls
areas along the Turkish border.
	   The Kurdish zone was set up in 1991 by Western allies after
Iraqi forces crushed a Kurdish rebellion that broke out at the end
of the Persian Gulf War. Iraq considers the zone a violation of its
sovereignty.

British company may bank on old song royalties
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A British company might soon borrow money by
putting up a novel bit of collateral: Future royalties from old
songs recorded by the heavy metal groups Black Sabbath and Iron
Maiden.
	   Rutland Trust recently paid dlrs 28.5 million for the music
catalog company Castle Communications and has since been approached
by Wall Street groups interested in setting up bonds to be repaid
from the music royalty payments, Dow Jones Newswires reported
Wednesday.
	   Investors would, in effect, be betting on the continued
popularity of recordings such as Black Sabbath's ``Sabbath Bloody
Sabbath'' and ``Live Evil,'' Dow Jones said.
	   Castle Communications has rights to many more hits, including
titles from REO Speedwagon and Roy Orbison.
	   Music royalties have been used in the past to secure loans.
	   Rock star David Bowie raised dlrs 55 million in February 1997
when he issued bonds secured by future royalty payments from his
hits. Singer Rod Stewart and Motown legends Edward and Brian
Holland have also cashed in.
	   CAK Universal Credit Corp., a New York joint venture between
Prudential Securities and music publishing executive Charles A.
Koppelman, said it might be able to raise dlrs 30 million for
Rutland by issuing bonds backed by the royalties.
	   Rutland hasn't accepted any such offers but said it's open to
the idea.
	   ``There's definitely something that can be done with it,''
predicted Dorian Klein, managing director of European structured
finance for Merrill Lynch. Klein said the Castle Communications
catalog, with about 50,000 to 60,000 song titles, is ``nicely
diversified.''
	   Other experts had their doubts, however, about investing in
groups that appear to be past their prime. Iron Maiden, famous for
such hits as ``Run to the Hills'' and ``Flight of Icarus'' now
performs in small venues without its longtime lead singer, Bruce
Dickinson. Black Sabbath's famous frontman Ozzy Osbourne recently
returned to the band after an eight-year absence, but it is unclear
whether the group can recapture its early form.
	   ``This is based on aged music, which I would assume would have
more volatile cash flows than the David Bowie deal, and wouldn't be
as easy to predict,'' said Harlan Simon, portfolio manager at the
Clinton Group, a New York-based hedge fund. ``I would assume that
without some sort of guarantee this would be hard to sell.''

	   ``We must give this country what it needs most: (political)
stability and long-term planning,'' Prodi told the Chamber.
	   But Refoundation's party leader, Fausto Bertinotti, said the
party's continued support depended on whether the next budget met
the Communist demands for more job creation and investment in the
depressed south.
	   In exchange for their backing Wednesday, Prodi promised to
invest 36 trillion lire (dlrs 20 billion) over the next three years
in the south, where the unemployment rate runs twice the national
average of 12.5 percent. He also pledged to give businesses tax
breaks and implement within a year the 35-hour work week that
Bertinotti has demanded.
	   On Tuesday, Prodi easily won a vote of confidence in the Senate,
where he has a majority without Refoundation's votes.
	   Prodi's government has already lasted longer than all but two of
the other 54 Italian governments since World War II.
	   Parliament's term ends in 2001.

Israeli archeologists: pre-Jewish Jerusalem was not backwater
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Ancient Jerusalem is traditionally described as
a backwater until its conquest by King David some 3,000 years ago.
	   But Israeli archaeologists said Wednesday they have unearthed a
sophisticated water system guarded by two massive towers, leading
them to believe that the Canaanite city in the pre-David era was
much larger and more advanced than commonly believed.
	   The Canaanite city lay on a steep slope that begins just outside
the present-day walls of Jerusalem's Old City and descends through
the Arab neighborhood of Silwan into a deep valley.
	   The ancient city was also ringed by a wall. The Canaanite
residents, also know as Jebusites, lived close to one another in a
small area, but little else is known about daily life there because
the site has not been excavated extensively.
	   Wrapping up the summer digging season, archaeologist Roni Reich
from the Israel Antiquities Authority on Wednesday gave a tour to
journalists.
	   Reich said his team has uncovered the foundations of two towers
that were part of a fortification system used to protect the city's
only water source, a spring outside the walls, at times when the
city was under siege.
	   Standing on sloping bedrock, Reich pointed to the foundations'
massive stones, about 1.5 meters (five feet) wide and 60
centimeters (two feet) high. Weighing as much as three tons each,
the stones were much larger than the ones used later by the
Israelites during the period of the early kings, Reich said.
	   Reich also led reporters through a narrow tunnel that connected
the Canaanite city to the pool. The last stretch of the underground
passage, blocked with stones and rubble, was cleared recently by
Reich's team.
	   The pool was fed by an underground aqueduct that initially was
believed to have been built during the reign of the Israelite
kings, David and Solomon. However, Reich said he now believed the
Canaanites built the aqueduct and that it dates to about 1,800 B.C.
	   Reich said the finds suggested that Jerusalem at the time of the
Canaanites was not the backwater of some historical descriptions.
	   ``The sophistication of the water system and the fortifications
built to protect it show that the Canaanite city was more
technologically advanced than was previously known,'' Reich said.
	   One of Reich's colleagues, Alon de Groot, said dating the tunnel
to 1,800 B.C. was hasty. However, he said the two tower foundations
undoubtedly were built by the Canaanites.
	   Also uncovered was part of a Canaanite rampart located several
meters away from the remains of the Canaanite city wall. ``This
proves that the Canaanite city was several times as big as we
thought,'' said Gideon Avni, the Jerusalem district archeologist.
	   He estimated that the Canaanite city had about 3,000 residents,
though other archaeologists said there was not enough evidence to
sustain such a guess.
	   Another surprise awaited the archeologists as they excavated the
last section of the tunnel, when they found two rusty buckets,
propped on a ledge. They belonged to Montague Parker, an English
adventurer who came to the Holy Land in 1909 looking for the Ark of
the Covenant.
	   Parker had to run for his life when Arab residents of Jerusalem
heard an unfounded rumor that he was trying to dig a tunnel under
the Al Aqsa Mosque compound, one of Islam's holiest sites. Angry
Muslims chased him all the way to Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
	   Reich said that when he told Bible scholars about the discovery
of the water system in a recent lecture, one jumped up with
excitement, saying this shored up a biblical passage describing
David's conquest of Jerusalem.
	   According to the second Book of Samuel, David told his soldiers
before the assault on the city:``Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites
and toucheth the `tsinor' ... shall be chief and captain.''
	   In modern Hebrew, ``tsinor'' means a pipe, as in plumbing, but
Reich said that that nobody knows what it meant in the Scriptures,
so theoretically it could mean any passageway or opening.
	   Rival claims to today's Jerusalem are rooted largely in the
city's past. However, Reich and Avni were evasive when asked
whether the finds could have political implications, except to say
the dig underscored that Jerusalem's history began well before the
Jewish conquest.
	   Silwan, the site of the dig, is one of the most contested areas
of Jerusalem. Jewish settlers, supported by U.S. donors, have
purchased and moved into about 60 homes in order to cement Israel's
claim over the area.

Rwandan rebels attack church mission, abduct two Belgians
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Hutu rebels abducted two Belgian
missionaries in an attack in northwestern Rwanda, officials said
Wednesday.
	   Details were sketchy, but officials, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the rebels looted medical supplies from a health
clinic before abducting two Belgians from a Roman Catholic mission
at Rwaza, about 90 kilometers (55 miles) northwest of Kigali.
	   The incident took place on Tuesday. The Belgian Embassy in
Kigali could not confirm the report.
	   Military sources said the army was pursuing the rebels and
trying to locate the abducted Belgians.
	   Also on Wednesday, the army clashed with a group of about 200
rebels outside Rwaza, officials said, but gave no details.
	   Thousands of people have been killed in rebel attacks in Rwanda
since the return in November 1996 of former Hutu soldiers and
militiamen who were responsible for a 1994 slaughter of more than
500,000 minority Tutsis and politically moderate Hutus. The rebels
hid among the refugees returning from exile.
	   Tutsi-led rebels won power in July 1994 and stopped the killing.
The rebels, based in the traditional Hutu stronghold of
northwestern Rwanda, have since attacked schools, road traffic,
Tutsi genocide survivors and those Hutus suspected of collaborating
with the authorities.
	   Last week, the rebels abducted a Canadian nun and released her
unharmed after three days in captivity. Some officials suspect the
rebels may want to publicize their cause using foreign
missionaries.

Sugar producers release latest figures
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Sugar production by the six members of
the Sugar Association of the Caribbean to the end of June 1998,
with two months left in the crop year, stands at 689,388 metric
tons (758,326 short tons), the association reported Wednesday.
	   Export of sugar to Europe totals 413,003 metric tons (454,303
short tons), with another 58,711 metric tons (64,582 short tons)
going to the European market under special trade arrangements.
Exports of sugar to the United States total 37,850 metric tons
(41,635 short tons).
	   Drought and bad weather hurt harvests during much of the year,
the association said. Because of low yield, Barbados has been able
to meet only its European quota.
	   ``In spite of this, all outstanding commitments, with the
exception of Barbados's U.S. quota, will be met before the year is
over,'' said Carl James, chairman of the association.
	   Up to June 30, 1998, production figures for the six member
countries of the SAC were: Barbados, 46,473 metric tons (51,120
short tons); Belize, 108,674 (119,541 short tons); Guyana, 264,026
(290,428 short tons); Jamaica, 167,575 (184,332 short tons); St.
Kitts, 24,331 (26,764 short tons), and Trinidad and Tobago, 78,309
(86,139 short tons).

Fire guts Bahrain apartment building
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ A fire gutted a clothing storehouse in
the capital of Manama Wednesday, sending about a dozen residents of
the apartments above the warehouse fleeing.
	   At least one elderly woman received slight burns in the fire.
	   Three hours after the fire began, thick black clouds of smoke
could still be seen pouring from the two-story building.
	   The building is located in a Shiite neighborhood of Manama.
	   Government officials said it was too early to say whether the
fire was arson.
	   Shiite Muslim activists campaigning for political and social
reforms have been blamed for numerous arson attacks in the capital.
	   More than 40 people have been killed in the violent campaign
since it began in December 1994.
	   Shiites form a slight majority of Bahrain's 400,000 citizens but
the Gulf state is ruled by the Al Khalifa family, which belongs to
the mainstream Sunni sect of Islam.

Mixed reactions as Inuit hunters kill bowhead whale
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PANGNIRTUNG, Northwest Territories (AP) _ A band of Inuit
hunters in canoes has killed a bowhead whale in the Canadian
Arctic, sparking celebrations in their home town but dismaying
conservationists.
	   It was the first whale hunt in the small Baffin Island community
of Pangnirtung in more than 50 years.
	   ``People are very, very happy about it,'' said Annie Keenainak
after learning of Tuesday's kill. Her father, Simeonie, led the
two-day hunt.
	   The hunt had political and cultural significance to the Inuit,
formerly known as Eskimos, as they prepare for self-government next
April when the new territory of Nunavut is created out of the
eastern portion of the Northwest Territories.
	   ``Our ancestors used to do it,'' Keenainak said. ``This is our
chance to do it, it's an opportunity to celebrate our culture.''
	   News of the successful hunt of a 13-meter (43-foot) whale spread
quickly through the region. The whale was butchered Tuesday at the
hunters' base camp, with meat and portions of its blubbery outer
layer to be shipped to communities throughout Nunavut.
	   Canada's Department of Fisheries and Oceans sent experts on the
hunting mission and issued Wednesday issued a statement praising
the hunt as ``very well planned and very well executed.''
	   The hunt was criticized by many animal rights activists and
marine biologists because the bowhead whale is included on both
Canadian and international lists of endangered species.
	   Canadian fisheries department experts have estimated there are
at least 700 bowhead in the Nunavut region. But Annelise Sorg of
the Canadian Marine Environment Protection Society said there are
no more than 500.
	   ``This is not a population that can withstand any kind of
hunting,'' Sorg said.
	   The Canadian government issued a license for the hunt as part of
a land claims deal with the Inuit. The government resisted pressure
from the International Whaling Commission, which voted 20-6 in May
to oppose the hunt.
	   Sorg and other animal rights activists have depicted the hunt as
part of a campaign by countries such as Japan and Norway to loosen
tight international restrictions on whaling.
	   ``It has been over 70 years since the Inuit hunted bowhead
whales,'' Sorg said. ``We believe this is a part of a larger
movement by countries that are trying to implement coastal whaling
around the world again and they are using the natives to bring this
about.''
	   Bowhead whales were killed by the thousands during the heyday of
commercial whaling, but the industry fizzled as whale products lost
value.
	   Few of the whales have been killed by the Inuit in the last five
decades as Ottawa imposed tight restrictions.
	   The Arctic's first licensed hunt in a generation took place in
1996 near the mouth of Hudson Bay, where hunters killed a 16-meter
(52-foot) bowhead.

Prodi wins confidence vote in Chamber but faces another test

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Hardline Communists helped Premier Romano Prodi win
a confidence vote Wednesday evening in the Chamber of Deputies but
made clear they might withdraw support over a looming battle for
the 1999 budget.
	   The vote was 324 in favor of the center-left government and 269
against.
	   Prodi called the vote of confidence to demonstrate his majority
was still viable after the Communists nearly caused the government
to fall last month by refusing to vote for NATO's eastward
expansion. Although Communist Refoundation is not part of the
coalition government, Prodi counts on its votes for a majority in
the Chamber.
	   On Tuesday, Prodi easily won a vote of confidence in the Senate,
where he has a majority without Refoundation's votes.
	   Before the vote, Prodi had urged his far-left allies to join his
center-left coalition government in a long-term alliance.
	   ``We must give this country what it needs most: (political)
stability and long-term planning,'' Prodi told the Chamber.
	   But Refoundation's party leader, Fausto Bertinotti, said the
party's continued support depended on whether the next budget
provided enough funds for more job creation and investment in the
depressed south.
	   In exchange for the Communists backing Wednesday, Prodi promised
to invest 36 trillion lire (dlrs 20 billion) over the next three
years in the south, where the unemployment rate runs twice the
national average of 12.5 percent. He also pledged to give
businesses tax breaks and implement within a year the 35-hour work
week that Bertinotti has demanded.

<TEXT>
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ Chile's Marcelo Rios, making his
latest run at No. 1, won in straight sets Wednesday to avoid the
rash of upsets that swept the Mercedes Cup.
	   Rios, who would pass Pete Sampras at the top of the ATP world
rankings if he reaches the final, blew past Germany's error-prone
Jens Knippschild, 7-6 (7-5), 6-2.
	   He reached the third round of the dlrs 1.04 million tournament,
along with Boris Becker. The German beat France's Cedric Pioline,
7-6 (7-5), 6-1 in his latest bid to claim a clay court title.
	   Becker, easing into retirement, came close two weeks ago at the
Swiss Open. But for the sixth time, the three-time Wimbledon winner
came up short in a clay final.
	   ``It's the same old song,'' said Becker, 30. ``I can't reach the
same level as on hard courts or grass. I always come up one match
short.''
	   Becker proved he's still has the impressive form he displayed at
the Swiss Open against Pioline, ranked 20th. After slamming an ace
to decide the first set, he rolled to victory in one hour, 21
minutes.
	   As upsets swept the seeds, former French Open winners Yevgeny
Kafelnikov of Russia and Thomas Muster were among the victimes. But
Carlos Moya, the current champion at Roland Garros, advanced
against fellow Spaniard Julian Alonso, 7-6 (8-6), 7-5.
	   Czech player Bohdan Ulihrach ousted the No. 4 seeded Kafelnikov,
6-3, 3-6, 6-3 while France's Fernando Vicente downed No. 10 Muster,
6-3, 6-7 (7-5), 7-5.
	   Rios, briefly the world No. 1 this spring, survived an early
break in the first set as the German charged the net and slammed
winners all over the court.
	   But Rios took control of the match after Knippschild let a 4-1
lead slip away in the tiebreak, then capped a string of errors by
hitting a double fault at 5-5.
	   Rios also had a chance to pass Sampras for the top ranking at
Wimbledon but was ousted in the first round.
	   France's Guillaume Raoux swept past No. 8 seed Alberto
Berasategui of Spain, 6-1, 6-2, Spain's Albert Portas edged No. 12
Fabrice Santoro of France, 1-6, 6-2, 7-6 (9-7) and Germany's
Hendrik Dreekmann upset No. 15 Magnus Larsson of Sweden, 6-4, 7-5.
	   Albert Costa of Spain, the No. 6 seed, also advanced by rolling
past Argentina's Franco Squillari, 6-3, 6-4.

	   ORAHOVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Red-faced with outrage, the Serb
mayor of this battle-wrecked town condemned his Albanian neighbors
Wednesday for secretly aiding the bloody weekend attack by
separatist Albanian rebel fighters.
	   Both sides accused each other of atrocities in the five-day
battle for this central Kosovo town, which ended before dawn
Wednesday when the last of the Kosovo Liberation Army fighters
withdrew.
	   Thousands of Albanian refugees from the town of 20,000 fled over
northern hills to KLA controlled territory, and hundreds of Serbs
sought refuge in nearby rural villages. Many people hid in
basements, emerging to find Serb police in control.
	   ``We were trying to maintain peace,'' said Mayor Andjelko
Kolasinac, standing on the steps of the town hall. ``But they were
planning all along. And it happened in a split second.''
	   By late Tuesday, Serb police had fought their way to the center
of the hillside town, followed by refugee and aid agencies
searching for victims of the ugliest fighting in five months of
ethnic conflict between Serb forces and the ethnic Albanian rebels.
	   Reporters who ventured away from a Serb-led tour of the town
Wednesday found a few dozen Albanians still hiding in their houses.
Two men said they had ventured upstairs just hours before
journalists arrived and looked out the window to see 10 tractors
being loaded with bodies.
	   The claim could not be independently confirmed. But the Kosovo
Information Center, close to the province's Albanian leaders,
claimed 52 Albanian civilians had been killed, including civilians
dragged from their homes and shot.
	   The ethnic Albanian Committee for the Defense of Human Rights
asked Wednesday for an international investigation on the situation
in Orahovac.
	   ``Eyewitnesses talk of huge massacres conducted by the army, the
police and paramilitary units... the situation in Orahovac is
catastrophic,'' the committee said in a statement.
	   In Orahovac, nervous-looking Serb police guarded dusty streets
covered with broken glass from shop windows. Under umbrellas
shielding them from the blistering sun, a few police kept rifles
pointed at KLA snipers believed to be lurking in the northern
hills.
	   Several of the Albanian-style red brick house were charred and
smoking, their roofs blown off by mortar fire. Shoes and plastic
bags sticky with blood lay in an alley near a mosque, evidence of
people injured or killed while trying to flee.
	   ``We never expected this. We were in good relations till the
second it started,'' said the mayor, who claimed his Albanian
neighbors had kept sandbags in their houses in preparation for the
attack.
	   Kosovo, a southern province in Serb-led Yugoslavia, has a
population of 2 million people _ 9-in-1 of them ethnic Albanians
who want independence from the oppressive regime of Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   Despite its Albanian majority, Orahovac has a Serb mayor because
Albanians have boycotted elections since Milosevic stripped the
province of its autonomy in 1989.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed since Milosevic cracked down
on Albanian militants in late February.
	   Serb police Capt. Milan Sipka estimated that dozens of KLA
fighters died in the Orahovac battle, as well as four Serb
civilians and two police officers. KLA fighters raped a 48-year-old
woman, he said.
	   Serb police also accused the KLA of kidnapping 51 people,
Albanians, Serbs and gypsies. On Wednesday, the KLA turned over 35
Serbs to the Red Cross, seven of them Orthodox monks from
monasteries near Orahovac, said Beatrice Weber, head of the Red
Cross delegation in the provincial capital Pristina.
	   Ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova condemned the intervention
of Serb forces in Orahovac and what he described as the massacres
of civilians.
	   The unauthorized Albanian parliament, of which Rugova is the
president, issued a declaration Wednesday seeking accord among
independence-seeking Albanian military and political factions.
	   It was Rugova's most direct acknowledgment of the KLA, which
opposes his renunciation of violence in the struggle for an
independent Kosovo.
	   Orahovac saw the first major KLA attack on a large town, a
departure from the rebels' usual guerrilla-style raids on villages
and police posts. But the rebels were unable to hold the town
against a strong Serb counterattack, raising questions about their
military capability.
	   Serb police controlled the southern rim of the town by Monday
afternoon, but KLA fighters held the center until Tuesday night,
hiding in the maternity ward of the local hospital, police said.
	   While police said they had secured some of the surrounding
hills, they ALSO said KLA forces had taken three villages to the
north and were currently attacking two other villages. Capt. Sipka
said that the KLA had seized an unknown number of male villagers.

Head of UN relief operations for Iraq leaving
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS spelling of Falt in graf 2; recasts last graf. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Denis J. Halliday, the U.N. relief
coordinator for Iraq who had criticized U.N. sanctions and had
pushed to get more humanitarian aid for Iraqis, is leaving his post
at the end of September.
	   Halliday's spokesman, Eric Falt, said Wednesday that Halliday's
dissatisfaction with the relief effort and the sanctions program
was probably among his reasons for leaving. Nevertheless, he was
the longest-serving U.N. relief coordinator in Baghdad, a spokesman
noted.
	   A statement said he was leaving Baghdad for personal reasons. A
successor hasn't been named.
	   Halliday, of Ireland, took over as the humanitarian coordinator
in Iraq in September of last year, trying to balance the needs of
the Iraqi people with the harsh sanctions imposed on Iraq by the
Security Council.
	   He replaced Staffan de Mistura, a Swede, in handling the
distribution network of the unique U.N. oil-for-food program, which
allows Iraq to sell limited amounts of oil to buy food, medicine
and other humanitarian goods.
	   Iraq has been barred from selling oil on the open market since
U.N. sanctions were imposed following Baghdad's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.
	   Halliday was one of the strongest U.N. advocates of increasing
the amount of aid Iraqis got, sometimes citing malnutrition reports
in his dealings with reporters.
	   His lobbying helped result in the Security Council increasing
the amount of oil Iraq can sell over six months to dlrs 5.2
billion, up from about dlrs 2 billion.
	   He told reporters in Baghdad in February that he opposed the
U.N. sanctions because of their ``devastating impact on the small
people.''
	   ``None of the (U.N.) member states intended that the sanctions
program would be so harsh on individual Iraqis,'' he said.
	   He repeatedly expressed concern about delays in New York in
approving Iraqi oil contracts because it delayed the delivery of
needed food, medicine and other goods.
	   John Mills, a spokesman for the Iraq program, said Halliday was
the longest-serving relief coordinator since the oil-for-food
program was launched. He said U.N. officials had known for some
time that Halliday had intended to leave in September, completing
12 months of what he said was a very difficult and demanding job.

Saint Laurent's pared-down perfection
</HEADLINE>

Cyd Charisse; Jerry Hall and daughter; TRIMS &QL; 
 &UR; By SUZY PATTERSON &QC;

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Yves Saint Laurent's show of winter couture
Wednesday showcased terrific low-key clothes, masterpieces from the
acknowledged master of fashion.
	   The crowd of celebrities and admirers at the Intercontinental
Hotel practically sighed collectively over the marvelous straight
reefer jacket and the simple gray pants leading off the show.
	   It was all so well cut, from classic trouser suits to cashmere
jersey dresses with their three-quarter jackets, that you couldn't
mistake the hand of Saint Laurent himself.
	   He got a standing ovation for the perfect simplicity of it all,
from flared skirts just to the knee with perfect princess fitted
coats to a tweed pantsuit with graceful tulip front on the jacket.
Or a V-necked satin evening gown with a huge white ostrich-feather
puff at the neck.
	   It all looked wearable and graceful.
	   There were no theatrics like the 1988 sequined Van Gogh Iris
jacket, supposedly ordered in duplicate by a Saudi princess.
	   Fluid, longer and flared skirts in velvet or jersey also took
this collection into very wearable chic for day or night.
	   Rumors are flying about who might one day replace this great
creator as head of YSL couture. Could it be Jean-Paul Gaultier?
	   Not yet, according to Pierre Berge, president of Yves Saint
Laurent.
	   ``Cannot talk of that yet,'' he said after the show. ``Nothing
is decided, and we are simply admirers of Gaultier.''
	   But Gaultier was in the front row, just beside Saint Laurent
muse Catherine Deneuve.
	   Already, Saint Laurent is giving up his ready-to-wear designing
to American Alber Elbaz, poached recently from Guy Laroche.
	   And Gaultier described the Saint Laurent show as ``sublime,
perfection.''
	   With those pure and perfect velvet gowns at the end of the show,
the fuchsia crepe bustier dress, or a vermilion festive satin skirt
and stole with a black velvet V-shaped top, this pared-down
collection could not be faulted.
	   Daring it was not, but that doesn't matter to his admirers _
like American fashion leader Nan Kempner and one of France's
richest women, Liliane Bettencourt, who love the glamour and
subtlety.
	   At Thierry Mugler's show, among the attractions were 77-year-old
screen star and dancer Cyd Charisse, looking smashing as she walked
down the runway in a black silk trench, and, in an homage to her
famous legs, a satiny dress slit way, way up.
	   Also on the runway: Jerry Hall and daughter Elizabeth, dressed
in matching black monkey-fur outfits.
	   At Balmain, Oscar de la Renta showed wearable clothes for a chic
elite based on romantic ideas like a trip to St. Petersburg.
	   Balmain is now famous for de la Renta's smart, luxurious outfits
for the likes of ``American ladies who lunch'' _ and he does them
very well.
	   Try a long alpaca beige coat, or ottoman jersey gray pants and a
caramel jacket with sable collar. Nothing is shocking, but well
made in the couture vein, every stitch invisible.
	   Of course, we're talking tens of thousands of dollars, but the
couture does give ideas to those who know how to put clothes
together.
	   De la Renta showed fabulous black velvet gowns, bustier dresses,
lace outfits, and brocade suits with little britches under puffy
skirts.
	   Paco Rabanne had his usual shiny take on fashion. Like de la
Renta at Balmain, he liked Russian court ideas to inspire his
runway.
	   Cossack figures came out in much fake fur, like red jackets with
sequins, and huge toque hats.

Daimler-Benz chairman inaugurates Ontario truck plant
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ST. THOMAS, Ontario (AP) _ The chairman of German automaker
Daimler-Benz attended ceremonies Wednesday celebrating the launch
of a new heavy-duty truck at the company's Freightliner plant in
southwestern Ontario.
	   Juergen Schrempp said the Sterling truck, which went into
production earlier this year, will help consolidate Daimler-Benz'
position as one of the leading truck producers in North America.
	   The newly founded Sterling Truck Corp., based in Willoughby,
Ohio, is the result of Daimler-Benz's takeover last year of Ford
Motor Co.'s heavy-duty truck unit. The new Sterling trucks will be
sold by former Ford dealers in Canada and the United States.
	   Freightliner, based in Portland, Oregon, was bought by
Daimler-Benz in 1981.
	   The St. Thomas plant, which employs 1,200 people, is building
two Sterling models: the A-Line series, a long-distance,
diesel-powered transport truck, and the smaller L-Line series
distribution trucks.
	   About 12,000 trucks are expected to be produced this year, and
20,000 next year.

Policy out as 49ers president
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DENNIS GEORGATOS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ Carmen Policy is out as the San Francisco
49ers' president, a stunning move that could signal Eddie DeBartolo
is about to regain control of the club he co-owns with his sister.
	   Policy said Wednesday he resigned in order to pursue other
unspecified opportunities. He is expected to seek an executive
position with the expansion Cleveland Browns, who will begin play
in 1999.
	   Larry Thrailkill, chief operating officer of the Edward J.
DeBartolo Corporation, will take over as the team's interim chief
executive.
	   Former coach Bill Walsh, who led the 49ers to three Super Bowl
titles, had been mentioned as a likely candidate to replace Policy
on at least an interim basis. But Walsh was not included in the
interim management team announced Wednesday, and Thrailkill would
not comment on a possible job for Walsh in the future.
	   In his eight years as club president, Policy was lauded as a
master of the salary cap and free agent recruitment _ talents
praised as key factors in San Francisco's 1994 Super Bowl campaign,
the most recent of the team's five Super Bowl titles.
	   ``Stepping aside is very difficult, it's awkward. But it's not
impossible. I'm looking forward to the opportunities ahead of me,''
Policy said Wednesday at a news conference. ``I feel good about the
job I've done. I feel great about the way I've done it. I feel
reasonably comfortable about the results.''
	   Policy said he had planned to meet with Thrailkill this summer
to discuss a contract extension. Instead, he turned in his
resignation.
	   ``There are some excellent opportunities that are available to
me individually, to me as part of a group, that are very
exciting,'' he said. ``I see these opportunities as being golden,
but I see these opportunities as fleeting.''
	   Thrailkill, a lawyer who joked that his only football experience
was as a high school quarterback in Atlanta, planned to meet with
49ers coach Steve Mariucci and other team officials later
Wednesday.
	   The team's new interim CEO said Mariucci will remain the coach
and that the 49ers are committed to moving forward with plans for a
new stadium in San Francisco.
	   Thrailkill, who met with Policy on Tuesday at the DeBartolo
Corp. headquarters in Youngstown, Ohio, will be the spokesman for
the 49ers on league matters.
	   ``We were shocked, we were surprised, we were disappointed,'' he
said of Policy's resignation. ``Twenty-four hours ago I was minding
my own business in Youngstown. I've had little sleep since then.''
	   Current team vice presidents Dwight Clark and Bill Duffy will be
responsible for day-to-day operations of the club and will report
to Thrailkill.
	   Policy's stay with the club had become tenuous since his
relationship with Eddie DeBartolo soured earlier this year. The
two, friends for 30 years and once described as being as close as
brothers, have not spoken to each other since a heated meeting in
January.

Nigerian politicians meet to create new parties
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ Given their political freedom by Nigeria's
military ruler, politicians from across the country were gathering
Wednesday to discuss the formation of parties.
	   At least three groups were meeting in Abuja, the capital, to map
out platforms and strategy, and hotel foyers and restaurants were
crowded with huddling politicians.
	   ``All we are doing is positioning ourselves for the task of
forming a political party as soon as we are given the green
light,'' said former Oil Minister Don Etiebet, who leads the group
known as Vision For The Way Forward.
	   On Monday, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar announced his transition
program to bring democracy to Nigeria, which includes allowing the
free formation of political parties.
	   Under the system set up by Abubakar's predecessor, Gen. Sani
Abacha, the government had the final say on whether individual
parties could be registered officially.
	   The United Nigeria Congress Party, one of the five parties that
Abacha allowed to operate _ though largely under his control _ is
re-creating itself as Vision 99.
	   ``A crucial meeting is being convened in Abuja early next week
... to discuss the way forward,'' the group said in a statement.
	   Another group, known as Friends for the Way Forward, was also
meeting Wednesday in Abuja.
	   On Tuesday, former presidential candidate Tunji Braithwaite
declared he was setting up the Democratic Advanced Movement, whose
main platform would be ensuring that the rule of law is upheld in
Nigeria.
	   Not everyone is happy about the quick moves toward new parties,
however.
	   ``One would expect that they would wait for further details on
the political program before jumping into the fray,'' said Osita
Okeke, a well-known Abuja-based political commentator. ``But our
politicians do not ever seem to learn. Whenever the military beats
the drums they become excited and are ready to dance without even
knowing the intricacies involved.''
	   In his speech, Abubakar announced presidential elections for
early next year and promised a return to civilian government in May
1999. Among other things, he also dissolved the five
government-sanctioned parties and canceled the results of elections
conducted during the Abacha years.
	   Abacha's five-year dictatorship was marked by an abysmal human
rights record, corruption and neglect. He died early in June of a
heart attack.

 &UR; Solana arrives in Macedonia to discuss Kosovo violence
 &UR; By KONSTANTIN TESTORIDES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ NATO's secretary-general arrived
Wednesday in Macedonia for a new round of talks with Macedonian
leadersamid concern that fighting in neighboring Serbia's Kosovo
province could spill over into Macedonia.
	   Javier Solana was to meet Macedonia's foreign minister, Blagoj
Handzinski, late Wednesday and President Kiro Gligorov on Thursday.
A press conference has been scheduled for Thursday afternoon.
	   Apart from the Kosovo crisis, Macedonia's chances for joining
the North Atlantic Alliance will also be on the agenda.
	   ``Mr. Solana's visit was planned at the beginning of the year
and the talks will be mostly about bilateral relations between NATO
and Macedonia,'' Handzinski said.
	   He added that the situation in Kosovo will also be discussed.
	   Only a day ahead of Solana's arrival, three strong explosions
shook capital Skopje and two locations near the Yugoslav border.
Although no one was injured, the blasts caused considerable damage.
	   No group claimed responsibility. But the blasts raised fears of
unrest in Macedonia, which also has a sizeable Albanian community.
	   Last January, the Kosovo Liberation Army claimed responsibility
for a series of explosions in Kumanovo and two other Macedonian
towns populated by ethnic Albanians.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed in Kosovo since a Serb
crackdown began in February. Guns from Albania are widely believed
to have been smuggled over the border for the separatists and some
of them are thought to be finding their way across Macedonian
territory.
	   Macedonian leadership is also apprehensive about the prospects
of NATO launching an action in Kosovo from inside Macedonia.
	   Before departing from Brussels, Solana had told the private
Macedonian television A1 TV that ``NATO will not use Macedonian
territory for possible actions in Kosovo but will guarantee
Macedonia's security.''
	   The defense minister of this tiny Balkan country, Lazar
Kitanoski, said recently that although `` Macedonia is capable of
protecting its own borders... if the conflict in Kosovo escalates
and endangers Macedonia, it will not hesitate to ask its partners
for help.''
	   Fears of a broader Balkan conflict also prompted the U.N.
Security Council to authorize an additional 300 troops to the
750-strong U.N. peacekeeping force already in Macedonia. The
council also agreed to extend the force's mandate until Feb. 28.
	   In November 1995, Macedonia became a member of NATO's
Partnership for Peace Program and one of the largest joint NATO
exercises is due in September in Macedonia.

Israeli defense minister asks for U.S. help in negotiations
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with successful mediation efforts
by Jordan's Crown Prince Hassan, palace statement; fresh quotes,
talks to resume Thursday &QL; 
 &UR; By DAFNA LINZER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Hours after Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators indicated talks had failed and called for American
mediation, Jordan's Crown Prince Hassan successfully arranged a
resumption of Mideast peace talks Wednesday, his spokesman said.
	   The Palestinians ended the first direct talks in months between
the sides Wednesday, complaining that Israel had failed to bring
new ideas to the table and had refused to accept an American peace
initiative.
	   The American administration had arranged the talks after
announcing earlier this month that it had exhausted its efforts to
win agreement for its peace plan which calls for an Israeli troop
pullback of 13 percent in the West Bank.
	   The talks were widely seen as the last chance for Israel and the
Palestinians to reach such an agreement for some time.
	   Israel had contacted the Americans and Egyptian officials since
the talks began three days ago, looking for mediation.
	   But it was the Jordanians who managed to bring the sides back
together.
	   ``Crown Prince Hassan produced an acceptable solution to both
sides,'' his spokesman Ayman Safadi said in Amman, Jordan. Hassan
met earlier Wednesday with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's
deputy, Mahmoud Abbas.
	   ``Jordan is very glad that it succeeded in playing this role,''
Safadi said, adding that the negotiators would meet again Thursday.
	   Earlier, Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said
American involvement could help bring about a much-needed summit
between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Arafat to try
and resolve the disputes.
	   ``What is also needed now is high-level American involvement,
with the (U.S. Mideast) envoy, Dennis Ross and Secretary Madeleine
Albright helping us to reach an agreement,'' Mordechai said.
	   When asked what he thought of Mordechai's call for U.S. help,
Arafat said: ``We are not against it.'' His aide, Nabil Abourdeneh
said the meetings had ended ``because the Israeli side did not
present any thing new and continues to reject the U.S.
initiative,'' Abourdeneh said.
	   The Clinton administration has been trying since January to win
support for a land-for-security plan in which Israel's troop
withdrawal would be met by greater Palestinian efforts to crack
down on Islamic militants.
	   The Palestinians have accepted the U.S. initiative, but
Netanyahu has balked at the scope of the withdrawal and said he
needed stronger guarantees that the Palestinians will live up to
their security obligations.
	   It was not immediately clear how the United States would respond
to the new request for intervention.
	   The Israeli-Palestinian contacts began with a Sunday meeting
between Mordechai and Abbas, followed by contacts between
lower-level negotiators on Monday and Tuesday.
	   Netanyahu has said he did not want to focus only on the troop
pullback, but also wanted to raise several other issues such as the
extradition of Palestinians suspected of killing Israelis.
	   Under previous accords the two sides are to work out remaining
differences and reach a final agreement on issues of Jerusalem,
Palestinian statehood and settlements by May 1999.
	   Wednesday, the Israeli architect of the original accords
suggested that the May deadline by pushed back two years, to 2001,
to avert an inevitable collision between the two sides.
	   Labor Party legislator Yossi Beilin said in order to avoid
violent confrontation between the two sides in the absence of a
peace deal, Israel should accept a Palestinian state which would be
demilitarized, a concession Arafat would have to make as well.

Grains, soybeans sink as weather promises large harvests
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Grain and soybean futures prices retreated a
third day Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade as beneficial
weather increased chances farmers will harvest bumper crops this
fall at a time of slow world demand.
	   Cooler, wet weather was forecast to move into Midwest growing
regions on Thursday, and the National Weather Service and private
forecasters were predicting such conditions would linger in the
area through at least part of next week.
	   Analysts said chances of damage to corn and soybean crops are
dimming with each passing day.
	   Much of the American corn crop is well ahead of five-year
averages for pollination, the most crucial growing period where
kernels develop. With young plants escaping with no serious
damaging heat in the major growing states of Illinois, Iowa and
Indiana, yield estimates are high and the total harvest is on track
to be the second-largest ever.
	   Soybeans also are entering their flowering period with little
chance of damage as weather forecasts call for a cooler than normal
August.
	   Wheat futures were pressured by a large winter wheat crop, weak
export demand and reports that France's crop also will be large.
	   Corn for December delivery, representing prices after the fall
harvest, fell 1 3-4 cents to dlrs 2.32 1-4 a bushel; December wheat
fell 4 3-4 cents to dlrs 2.82 a bushel; December oats fell 2 3-4
cents to dlrs 1.23 1-4 a bushel; November soybeans fell 4 1-2 cents
to dlrs 5.71 1-4 a bushel.

<TEXT>
	   SAN VICENTE, El Salvador (AP) _ A third former national
guardsman convicted in the rapes and murders of three American nuns
walked free Wednesday, professing innocence but saying he would aid
probes into allegations that high-ranking officers ordered the
murders.
	   ``My country and the whole world have the right to know the
truth,'' said Daniel Canales as he left prison here under a new law
intended to ease prison overcrowding.
	   A five-man squad kidnapped, raped and killed Roman Catholic nuns
Ita Ford, Dorothy Kazel and Maura Clark and layworker Jean Donovan
on Dec. 2, 1980.
	   Two others convicted in the case were freed on Tuesday. Each had
served more than 17 years of a 30-year sentence.
	   Another two former guardsmen convicted in the case did not
qualify for release because one previously had been convicted on
weapons charges and the other had participated in a prison
disturbance.
	   The crimes caused outrage in the United States, which strongly
supported the Salvadoran government during the 1980-1992 civil war.
The women apparently were killed because military-backed death
squads suspected them of sympathizing with leftist guerrillas.
	   Canales insisted that he did not commit the killings, but
promised to cooperate with relatives of the victims who seek
further investigation of the case.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ After days of pitching their proposals to the
public, Japan's three top candidates for prime minister hunkered
down Wednesday to jockey for support among the only people voting
in this week's ballot: legislators of the ruling party.
	   Though the battle to replace resigning Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto has been an unusually public competition for Japan,
Friday's vote for Liberal Democratic Party president _ and most
likely prime minister _ is in the hands of 413 party members in
Parliament.
	   So instead of pressing the flesh in the streets and at shopping
malls, the candidates _ Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi, former Chief
Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama and Health Minister Junichiro
Koizumi _ were lobbying among their buddies in the legislature.

	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Hutu rebels abducted two Belgian
missionaries in an attack in northwestern Rwanda, officials said
Wednesday.
	   Details were sketchy, but officials, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the rebels looted medical supplies from a health
clinic before abducting two Belgians from a Roman Catholic mission
at Rwaza, about 90 kilometers (55 miles) northwest of Kigali.
	   The incident took place on Tuesday. The Belgian Embassy in
Kigali could not confirm the report.
	   The White Fathers, the oldest Christian order in Rwanda,
identified the two priests as Marc Francois and Jean Lefevre, both
of whom spent in the country more than 30 years.

<TEXT>
	   CATANIA, Sicily (AP) _ Two minor earthquakes on Wednesday shook
Mount Etna, sending rivers of lava running down the slopes of the
volcano, which has been active since January.
	   The quakes had preliminary magnitudes of 2.6 and 3.0, the
Italian news agency ANSA reported from this eastern Sicilian city.
	   A few hours later, the volcanic activity calmed down, the report
said.
	   On June 14, the area around the crater was declared off-limits
to tourists after the volcano belched chunks of lava.

Cox's song: Take him out of the ballgame
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL NEWBERRY &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   Bobby Cox is known for being overly loyal to his players. He
really has only two rules: Give 100 percent and be on time.
	   Rarely does the Atlanta Braves manager have a disparaging word
to say about one of his players, and it's downright startling when
Cox offers up someone for public embarrassment.
	   But that's just what he did Tuesday night, ordering Andruw Jones
off the field in the top of the eighth inning when the center
fielder loafed after a soft liner and allowed it to drop for a hit.
	   ``He's only 21,'' Cox said, sarcasm dripping from his voice
after the Braves lost to the Chicago Cubs 3-0. ``I have to remember
that, I suppose. But I didn't act that way when I was 21, nor did
Hank Aaron or Willie Mays.''
	   To remove a player from his defensive position in the midst of
an inning, making him leave the field in full view of the crowd, is
perhaps the most dramatic move any manager can make to show his
displeasure.
	   Billy Martin nearly came to blows with Reggie Jackson after a
similar episode during a 1977 game at Fenway Park. Gil Hodges shook
up the Miracle Mets in 1969 by going on the field himself after
Cleon Jones made a half-hearted effort on a ball hit to left. ``Are
you hurt?'' Hodges asked, before waving to the dugout for a
replacement and walking with his embarrassed star off the field.
	   ``You don't like to do stuff like that,'' Cox said. ``But to me,
it was obvious that Andruw didn't try for that ball.''
	   The scathing postgame commentary was totally out of character
for Cox, who after a pitcher gives up eight runs will say things
like, ``He was throwing well but they blooped in a few hits.''
	   For a team heading for its seventh straight postseason, the
episode revealed a new side to the relationship between the manager
and one of his most talented players.
	   ``Either go home or play,'' Cox said. ``Mistakes are nothing.
But it's a mistake not to try.''
	   Jones, a Curacao native who burst into national headlines as a
19-year-old when he hit two runs in the first game of 1996 World
Series at Yankee Stadium, seemed taken aback by Cox's comments.
	   ``He thinks I don't respect the game,'' Jones said, dressing at
his locker for the road trip to Philadelphia. ``I respect this
game. I love this game. I always give 100 percent, especially on
defense. I don't play around on defense. I just lost my
concentration.''
	   What did Jones think when he saw Gerald Williams trotting toward
him in center field to take his place?
	   ``Well, I couldn't do nothing about it,'' Jones replied
nonchalantly. ``You can't send him back and say, `I'm staying out
here.'''
	   Clearly, Jones is one of the top young players in baseball, a
rare mix of speed, power and defensive ability. In the minor
leagues, though, he also was known as a player who liked to show
off and didn't always give his best effort, traits that have not
totally disappeared even under Cox's no-nonsense tutelage.
	   When asked if he planned to fine Jones, Cox replied, ``I've
taken so much money from him it's a joke. ... I don't know what to
do. He's been sent home when he was in the minor leagues. We've
done a lot of things with him.''
	   Even before he was taken out Tuesday night, Jones already had
drawn Cox's ire for a bonehead play in the third inning.
	   Dancing around at second base with the Cubs leading 1-0, Jones
broke back toward the bag on Ozzie Guillen's single to center,
apparently unsure if the ball would be caught. He finally got
turned in the right direction but ran right through a clear stop
sign by coach Bobby Dews.
	   Jones was thrown out at the plate by 10 feet, and the Braves
missed a chance for a potentially big inning in a duel between
Kerry Wood and Greg Maddux. Afterward, Jones could be seen laughing
with a teammate in the dugout.
	   ``He's got to grow up,'' Cox said. ``It's a simple as that. No
one is bigger than the game.''

UN delegation arrives for unprecedented mission

 &UR; By RACHID KHIARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ A U.N. delegation arrived quietly in
Algeria Wednesday on an unprecedented mission to shed light on the
reasons for more than six years of massacres and bombings.
	   The two-week mission, led by former Portuguese President Mario
Soares, is a major breakthrough in international efforts to launch
an inquiry.
	   In the past, Algeria had resisted such a move, calling it
interference in its internal affairs.
	   The six-member team was greeted by Foreign Minister Ahmed Attaf,
and made no statements. Nor did the government, which has not
publicized the visit in Algeria.
	   The critical question is whether the group will have full
freedom of movement, and access to all parties in the drama that
has taken an estimated 75,000 lives since 1992.
	   More than 50 people were killed over three days last week,
including two sunbathers killed in a new form of violence: bombs
hidden under the sand on Mediterranean beaches.
	   On Tuesday, four members of a government-armed self-defense
group were killed and 16 wounded in an ambush by armed men dressed
as police on the road between Oran and Mascara, west of the
capital, newspapers reported Wednesday.
	   Authorities blame the bloodshed on Islamic insurgents waging a
terror campaign to topple the military-backed government.
	   But suspicions have been raised in the West that security forces
or government-armed militias may have had at least a passive role
in violence.
	   Key questions are whether the delegates can visit massacre sites
_ access denied a European parliamentary delegation last February _
and meet with leaders of the banned Islamic Salvation Front.
	   U.N. spokesman Juan Carlos Brandt said earlier this month that
delegates have been assured ``free and complete access to all
sources of information.''
	   But Algeria's Foreign Ministry spokesman, Abdelaziz Sbaa, made
clear Tuesday that members of the mission are not to contact those
``outside the law,'' an apparent reference to the Salvation Front.
	   Soares, in a telephone interview Monday with The Associated
Press in Lisbon, suggested that Algerian authorities may have a say
in setting the agenda.
	   ``When we get there, we'll discuss with the authorities what
they want and what we want and we'll take it from there,'' Soares
said.
	   The Salvation Front's imminent victory in January 1992
legislative elections led to a military coup. The army aborted the
voting, dismissed President Chadli Bendjedid and carried out a
brutal crackdown on Muslim fundamentalists.
	   That move triggered the insurgency and a self-perpetuating cycle
of violence.
	   Algeria has steadfastly rejected claims of serious human rights
problems despite reports by rights groups of torture,
disappearances, extrajudicial killings and other atrocities.
	   Accompanying Soares are: former Indian Prime Minister Inder
Kumar Gujral, former Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul-Karim Kabariti,
the attorney-general of Kenya, Amos Wako, the former American U.N.
ambassador Donald McHenry, and Simone Veil, France's former health
minister.

Egypt to build museum for legendary singer Umm Kalthoum
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt is planning to build a museum
dedicated to Umm Kalthoum, the legendary singer whose music is
still heard on radio stations and in cafes throughout the Arab
world nearly 23 years after her death.
	   Culture Minister Farouk Hosni said the museum will be located in
the Manastirli Pavilion, a scenic spot overlooking the Nile River,
Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported Wednesday. The pavilion
was built in the 1830s.
	   Critics have complained for years that the government was not
doing enough to commemorate the memory of the singer, known as the
``star of the orient,'' who was considered Egypt's unofficial
ambassador to the Arab world.
	   Umm Kalthoum, died in 1975 at the age of 71. Her cassettes still
sell briskly in Arab countries.
	   An Egyptian radio station named after her exclusively plays her
songs, some of which last for two hours.
	   Her voice, deep and powerful, can often be heard in smoky coffee
houses and taxis throughout the region.
	   Throughout most of the 1960s, life ground to a halt in almost
every Arab city as residents tuned to Egyptian radio to listen to
live broadcasts of Umm Kalthoum the first Thursday of every month.
	   Umm Kalthoum favored wearing huge diamond broaches and always
held a silk scarf while on stage. Some of her personal items,
photographs and a music library will be housed in the museum, the
agency reported.

Solana arrives in Macedonia to discuss Kosovo violence
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 
 &UR; By KONSTANTIN TESTORIDES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ NATO's secretary-general arrived
Wednesday for a new round of talks with Macedonian leaders amid
concern that fighting in neighboring Serbia's Kosovo province could
spill over into the country.
	   Javier Solana was to meet Macedonia's foreign minister, Blagoj
Handzinski, late Wednesday and President Kiro Gligorov on Thursday.
	   Macedonia's chances for joining NATO will also be on the agenda.
	   Only a day before Solana's arrival, three explosions shook
capital Skopje and two locations near the Yugoslav border. No one
was injured, but the blasts caused considerable damage.
	   No group claimed responsibility. But last January, the Kosovo
Liberation Army _ ethnic Albanian rebels in Kosovo fighting for
independence _ claimed responsibility for a series of explosions in
Kumanovo and two other Macedonian towns populated by ethnic
Albanians.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed in Kosovo since a Serb
crackdown began in February. Guns from Albania are widely believed
to have been smuggled over the border for the separatists and some
of them are thought to be finding their way across Macedonian
territory.
	   Fears of a broader Balkan conflict has prompted the U.N.
Security Council to authorize an additional 300 troops to the
750-strong U.N. peacekeeping force already in Macedonia. The
council also agreed to extend the force's mandate until Feb. 28.

 &UR; King Hussein of Jordan tested for cancer at Mayo Clinic &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROCHESTER, Minnesota (AP) _ King Hussein of Jordan is being
tested for lymphoma and is expected to remain at Mayo Clinic in the
United States for three more weeks, his physician said Wednesday.
	   Hussein disclosed the possibility of lymphoma in a letter to his
brother, Crown Prince Hassan, on Tuesday. The letter was read on
Jordanian television Tuesday night.
	   The king wrote that an ``excised lymph node and symptoms all
seem to point to lymphoma,'' or cancer of the lymphatic tissue. At
the same time there could be other reasons for the infection and
related symptoms, the letter said.
	   Mayo Clinic doctors were waiting for results of tests done
Friday, and planned to begin chemotherapy if lymphoma was found,
Hussein's letter said.
	   Though the letter said cancer might be confirmed on Tuesday,
Hussein's private physician, Dr. Samir Farraj, said nothing about
test results in his statement Wednesday.
	   Farraj did not return a telephone message left for him Wednesday
at the clinic.
	   Hussein was admitted to the Mayo Clinic on July 14 after
suffering from numerous spells of fever and cold sweats.
	   The fever now occurs only once every 24 hours, but a low
neutrophil and platelet count in his blood has not improved, the
king wrote. He said he was in high spirits.
	   Neutrophils are a type of white blood cell that help combat
disease, while platelets help blood clotting.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wished Hussein a quick
recovery. ``I hope he will overcome it (his illness) with his great
strength, a spiritual and physical strength he has gained over the
years,'' Netanyahu said in an interview with Israeli radio on
Wednesday.
	   The king underwent surgery to remove cancer from his ureter and
left kidney at the Mayo Clinic in 1992 and has had regular medical
checkups at the clinic since then.
	   He underwent an operation in November 1997 to remove an inflamed
lymph gland that was found to be benign. In April 1997, he had
surgery for an enlarged prostate that also was benign.

Israeli archaeologists: pre-Jewish Jerusalem was not a backwater
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Ancient Jerusalem is traditionally described as
a backwater until its conquest by King David some 3,000 years ago.
	   But Israeli archaeologists said Wednesday they have unearthed a
sophisticated water system guarded by two massive towers, leading
them to believe that the Canaanite city in the pre-David era was
much larger and more advanced than commonly believed.
	   The Canaanite city lay on a steep slope that begins just outside
the present-day walls of Jerusalem's Old City and descends through
the Arab neighborhood of Silwan into a deep valley.
	   The ancient city also was ringed by a wall. The Canaanite
residents, also know as Jebusites, lived close to one another in a
small area. But little else is known about daily life there because
the site has not been excavated extensively.
	   Wrapping up the summer digging season, archaeologist Roni Reich
from the Israel Antiquities Authority gave a tour to journalists
Wednesday.
	   Reich said his team has uncovered the foundations of two towers
that were part of a fortification system used to protect the city's
only water source, a spring outside the walls, during those times
when the city was under siege.
	   Rival claims to today's Jerusalem are rooted largely in the
city's past. However, Reich was evasive when asked whether the
finds could have political implications, except to say the dig
underscored that Jerusalem's history began well before the Jewish
conquest.
	   Silwan, the site of the dig, is one of the most contested areas
of Jerusalem. Jewish settlers, supported by U.S. donors, have
purchased and moved into about 60 homes in order to cement Israel's
claim over the area.
	   The pool was fed by an underground aqueduct that initially was
believed to have been built during the reign of the Israelite
kings, David and Solomon. However, Reich said he now believed the
Canaanites built the aqueduct and that it dates to about 1,800 B.C.
	   Reich said the finds suggested that Jerusalem at the time of the
Canaanites was not the backwater of some historical descriptions.
	   ``The sophistication of the water system and the fortifications
built to protect it show that the Canaanite city was more
technologically advanced than was previously known,'' Reich said.
	   One of Reich's colleagues, Alon de Groot, said dating the tunnel
to 1,800 B.C. was hasty. However, he said the two tower foundations
undoubtedly were built by the Canaanites.
	   A narrow tunnel connected the Canaanite city to the pool. The
last stretch of the underground passage, blocked with stones and
rubble, was cleared recently by Reich's team.
	   Archaeologists excavating the last section of the tunnel also
found two rusty buckets propped on a ledge. They belonged to
Montague Parker, an English adventurer who came to the Holy Land in
1909 looking for the Ark of the Covenant.
	   Parker had to run for his life when Arab residents of Jerusalem
heard an unfounded rumor that he was trying to dig a tunnel under
the Al Aqsa Mosque compound, one of Islam's holiest sites.
	   Reich said that when he told Bible scholars about the discovery
of the water system in a recent lecture, one said this shored up a
biblical passage describing David's conquest of Jerusalem.
	   According to the second Book of Samuel, David told his soldiers
before the assault on the city: ``Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites
and toucheth the `tsinor' ... shall be chief and captain.''
	   In modern Hebrew, ``tsinor'' means a pipe, as in plumbing. But
Reich said nobody knows what it meant in the Scriptures, so
theoretically it could mean any passageway or opening.

Aerospatiale to be privatized
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The government announced an accord Wednesday under
which Aerospatiale, the state-controlled aerospace group, will be
privatized.
	   In a late-evening statement, the office of Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin said that under the deal, Aerospatiale would acquire the
Lagardere group's Matra Hautes Technologies. Lagardere would get a
sizable stake in Aerospatiale.
	   The state's share of Aerospatiale would be less than 50 percent,
the statement said, giving no further figures.
	   Aerospatiale is a partner in the European aviation consortium
Airbus Industrie, and ranks as France's heaviest hitter in the
aerospace and defense sector.
	   The plan to open Aerospatiale's capital to the public is the
latest step in the French government's effort to restructure
France's scattered defense and aerospace industry ahead of a
larger-scale European restructuring.
	   In May, the French government transferred its 46-percent stake
in fighter plane maker Dassault Aviation to Aerospatiale.
	   The governments of France, Germany, Spain and Britain have been
pushing for the creation of a unified European civil and military
aerospace company to rival U.S. giants Lockheed Martin Corp. and
Boeing.
	   But the French government's reluctance to part with its majority
ownership in Aerospatiale was a sticking point in discussions.

Priest arrested in bishop's slaying

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ A priest and a church cook were arrested
Wednesday in the murder of a Guatemalan bishop, a crime that has
been widely blamed on death squads angered by the prelate's human
rights work.
	   Judge Isaias Figueroa Medina said Rev. Mario Leonel Orantes
Najera and Margarita Lopez were arrested by national police on
suspicion of involvement in the killing Roman Catholic Bishop Juan
Gerardi on April 26.
	   Gerardi was killed two days after presenting a report denouncing
human rights violations by the army and its paramilitaries during
Guatemala's 36-year civil war, which ended in December 1996.
	   The slaying created an international outcry and several
prominent human rights activists suggested the military or related
death squads might have killed Gerardi.
	   He was beaten to death with a cement block in the garage of his
home within the San Sebastian church. Ochaeta reported finding the
body.
	   There was no immediate church reaction to the arrests.
	   Earlier this month, church worker Ronalth Ochaeta, an associate
of Gerardi at the Archbishop's Office of Human Rights, said that
two military officers were apparently involved in the slaying.
	   The military had denounced that report.
	   Ochaeta did not give the names of the officers he said were
involved, nor did he specify how they were involved. He said only
that one of the officers once was a member of the Presidential
Guard.
	   The only man previously arrested in the case was Carlos Enrique
Vielman, 24. His attorney, Mario Alfonso Menchu, insisted that
Vielman was innocent and raised the suggestion that Orantes might
have been involved.

<TEXT>
	   ROCHESTER, Minnesota (AP) _ King Hussein of Jordan is being
tested for lymphoma and is expected to remain at Mayo Clinic in the
United States for three more weeks, his physician said Wednesday.
	   Hussein disclosed the possibility of lymphoma in a letter to his
brother, Crown Prince Hassan, on Tuesday. The letter was read on
Jordanian television Tuesday night.
	   The king wrote that an ``excised lymph node and symptoms all
seem to point to lymphoma,'' or cancer of the lymphatic tissue. At
the same time there could be other reasons for the infection and
related symptoms, the letter said.
	   Mayo Clinic doctors were waiting for results of tests done
Friday, and planned to begin chemotherapy if lymphoma was found,
Hussein's letter said.
	   Though the letter said cancer might be confirmed on Tuesday,
Hussein's private physician, Dr. Samir Farraj, said nothing about
test results in his statement Wednesday.
	   Farraj did not return a telephone message left for him Wednesday
at the clinic.
	   Hussein was admitted to the Mayo Clinic on July 14 after
suffering from numerous spells of fever and cold sweats.
	   The fever now occurs only once every 24 hours, but a low
neutrophil and platelet count in his blood has not improved, the
king wrote. He said he was in high spirits.
	   Neutrophils are a type of white blood cell that help combat
disease, while platelets help blood clotting.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wished Hussein a quick
recovery. ``I hope he will overcome it (his illness) with his great
strength, a spiritual and physical strength he has gained over the
years,'' Netanyahu said in an interview with Israeli radio on
Wednesday.
	   The king underwent surgery to remove cancer from his ureter and
left kidney at the Mayo Clinic in 1992 and has had regular medical
checkups at the clinic since then.
	   He underwent an operation in November 1997 to remove an inflamed
lymph gland that was found to be benign. In April 1997, he had
surgery for an enlarged prostate that also was benign.

 &UR; Guyanese, trying to solve racial division, turn to Northern
Ireland &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ Weary of racially charged riots,
firebombings and angry rhetoric, politicians in Guyana are looking
for answers in Northern Ireland.
	   A delegation of legislators, lawyers and Information Minister
Moses Nagamootoo left for Belfast on Monday on a 10-day trip to see
how British-controlled Northern Ireland is trying to heal decades
of Protestant-Catholic division.
	   In Guyana, a former British colony on the northeast shoulder of
South America, friction between people of African and East Indian
descent erupted into violence after Afro-Guyanese accused President
Janet Jagan's party of rigging the Dec. 15 election.
	   Leaders from other Caribbean countries brokered a shaky peace
last month. Politicians agreed to rewrite Guyana's constitution to
better balance power between the ethnic groups.
	   The Guyanese delegation will meet with Irish President Mary
McAleese, former Irish Prime Minister John Bruton and other
officials, said the Washington-based National Democratic Institute,
which is sponsoring the trip.
	   The Guyanese, worried that foreign investors have been scared
away by the ethnic violence, said they were looking for new
perspectives on such conflicts.
	   ``Internationalizing any issue is always good,'' said Malcolm
Parris, an elections commissioner for the opposition People's
National Congress. ``It might help us to realize how stupid we look
to the outside world.''

USOC says case closed on trashed rooms at Winter Games
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LARRY SIDDONS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The case is closed on who trashed dorm rooms
used by the U.S. men's hockey team at the Winter Olympics in Japan,
without the culprits being identified, the head of the U.S. Olympic
Committee said Wednesday.
	   USOC executive director Dick Schultz said he saw no chance of
finding out who did an estimated dlrs 3,000 damage to three Olympic
Village rooms in Nagano last February.
	   ``I think for all practical purposes it's over with,'' Schultz
said. ``We've done all we can do, and I don't see the NHL or the
players' association doing more.''
	   The league, the union, the USOC and USA Hockey all pledged to
smoke out the players who broke chairs, damaged walls and doors and
set off fire extinguishers in the early morning of Feb. 18, hours
after the U.S. team was eliminated from the first Olympics to
feature teams of professional stars.
	   In March, U.S. team captain Chris Chelios sent an apology and a
dlrs 3,000 check to Japanese Olympic officials to cover the
damages, which already had been paid by the USOC and National
Hockey League.
	   ``Certain conduct by a few members of our team ... was
inexcusable,'' said Chelios, who plays for the Chicago Blackhawks.
``I want to take this opportunity to apologize to the people of
Japan, the Japanese Olympic committee, the USOC, and to all hockey
fans throughout the world.''
	   Chelios denied causing any damage.
	   Schultz and USOC president Bill Hybl said at the time that
Chelios' actions were not enough and that they still expected the
cuplrits to be identified.
	   To underscore its stand, the USOC withheld invitations from the
hockey team when the full U.S. Olympic squad went to Washington for
a White House reception with President Clinton in April.
	   But Schultz said Wednesday that no further action was coming.
	   ``I guess the apology and the captain's payment is all we can
expect,'' he said.

	   ORAHOVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ His face red with outrage, the Serb
mayor of this battle-wrecked town condemned his Albanian neighbors
Wednesday for secretly aiding an attack by separatist Albanian
rebel fighters.
	   Both sides accused each other of atrocities in the five-day
battle for Orahovac in central Kosovo, which ended before dawn
Wednesday when the last of the Kosovo Liberation Army fighters
withdrew.
	   Thousands of Albanian refugees from the town of 20,000 fled over
northern hills to KLA-controlled territory, and hundreds of Serbs
sought refuge in nearby rural villages. Many people hid in
basements, emerging to find Serb police in control.
	   ``We were trying to maintain peace,'' said Mayor Andjelko
Kolasinac, standing on the steps of town hall. ``But they were
planning all along. And it happened in a split second.''
	   By late Tuesday, Serb police had fought their way to the center
of the hillside town, followed by refugee and aid agencies
searching for victims of the worst fighting in five months of
ethnic conflict between Serb forces and the ethnic Albanian rebels.
	   Reporters on a Serb-led tour of the town Wednesday found a few
dozen Albanians still hiding in their houses. Two men said only
hours earlier they had looked out a window to see 10 tractors being
loaded with bodies.
	   The claim could not be independently confirmed. But the Kosovo
Information Center, close to the province's Albanian leaders,
reported 52 Albanian civilians were killed, including civilians
dragged from their homes and shot.
	   The ethnic Albanian Committee for the Defense of Human Rights
called Wednesday for an international investigation.
	   ``Eyewitnesses talk of huge massacres conducted by the army, the
police and paramilitary units... The situation in Orahovac is
catastrophic,'' the group said.
	   In Orahovac, Serb police guarded dusty streets covered with
broken glass from shop windows. Under umbrellas shielding them from
the blistering sun, a few police kept rifles pointed at KLA snipers
believed to be lurking in the northern hills.
	   Several of the Albanian-style red brick houses were charred and
smoking, their roofs blown off by mortar fire. Shoes and plastic
bags sticky with blood lay in an alley near a mosque.
	   ``We never expected this. We were in good relations until the
second it started,'' said the mayor, who claimed his Albanian
neighbors had secretly kept sandbags in their houses in preparation
for the attack.
	   Kosovo, a southern province in Serb-led Yugoslavia, has a
population of 2 million people _ 90 percent of them ethnic
Albanians who want independence from the oppressive regime of
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   Despite its Albanian majority, Orahovac has a Serb mayor because
Albanians have boycotted elections since Milosevic stripped the
province of its autonomy in 1989.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed since Milosevic cracked down
on Albanian militants in late February.
	   Serb police Capt. Milan Sipka estimated that dozens of KLA
fighters died in the Orahovac battle, as well as four Serb
civilians and two police officers. KLA fighters raped a 48-year-old
woman, he said.
	   Serb police also accused the KLA of kidnapping 51 people,
including Albanians, Serbs and gypsies. On Wednesday, the KLA
turned over 35 Serbs to the Red Cross, seven of them Orthodox monks
from monasteries near Orahovac, said Beatrice Weber, head of the
Red Cross delegation in the provincial capital Pristina.
	   Ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova condemned the intervention
of Serb forces in Orahovac and what he described as the massacres
of civilians.
	   The unauthorized Albanian parliament, of which Rugova is the
president, issued a declaration Wednesday seeking an accord among
all independence-seeking Albanian military and political factions.
	   It was Rugova's most direct acknowledgment of the KLA, which
opposes his advocacy of nonviolence in the struggle for an
independent Kosovo.
	   Orahovac saw the first major KLA attack on a large town, a
departure from the rebels' usual guerrilla-style raids on villages
and police posts. But the rebels were unable to hold the town
against a strong Serb counterattack, raising questions about their
military capability.
	   Serb police controlled the southern rim of the town by Monday
afternoon, but KLA fighters held the center until Tuesday night,
hiding in the maternity ward of the local hospital, police said.

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Joao Francisco Lontra Jobim, the
son of the late Brazilian bossa nova composer Antonio Carlos Jobim,
was killed a car accident Wednesday. He was 19.
	   Police said the accident occurred in the early Wednesday when
Joao Francisco Lontra Jobim apparently lost control of his car as
he was going around curve in Rio's Flamengo neighborhood.
	   Witnesses said the car smashed into three trees and flipped
over.
	   Jobim died on the way to the hospital.
	   A passenger in the car was killed and two others suffered light
injuries, police said.
	   Survivors include his mother, Ana Lontra Jobim, and a sister.
	   Antonio Carlos Jobim _ who penned such bossa nova classics as,
``One Note Samba,'' and ``The Girl From Ipanema'' _ died in 1994 at
the age of 67.
	   The younger Jobim was buried Wednesday at the Sao Joao de
Batista cemetery.

Special suit helps boy avoid pain from sunlight
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to ADD feature tag &QL; 
 &UR; By ALIAH D. WRIGHT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BLAIN, Pennsylvania. (AP) _ William Robert ``Rob'' Lucas III is
a 10-year-old with dark, brown hair, blue-gray eyes and a killer
smile. He's bright, revels in teasing his two sisters, rides his
bike and plays soccer with his pals.
	   But until a few weeks ago, Rob could play outside only at night.
	   He was born with a rare metabolic disorder that causes his skin
to swell, blister and turn red whenever exposed to direct sunlight.
	   ``I just felt pain; like a thousand knives were going into me,''
he said in an interview recently at his home tucked high in this
mountain community 34 miles (54 kilometers) west of Harrisburg.
	   What changed Rob's life was a new set of clothes _ a pair of
special suits, designed and tested by a team of NASA engineers and
a private company in California. The suits protect him while he
enjoys normal daytime activities with his friends.
	   The outer layer of each suit is a tightly woven cotton-Lycra
blend that blocks out 99.9 percent of ultraviolet light. He wears a
jacket, pants, gloves, masks and a pair of goggles and a life
preserver-like garment filled with a frozen gel that keeps him
cool. In the full ensemble, Rob resembles a space man.
	   His family, and their neighbors in Blain _ population 270 _
helped raised nearly dlrs 6,000 to pay for two suits.
	   No one knows how many people worldwide have Rob's disease,
erythropoietic protoporphyria or EPP. But Dr. Micheline
Mathews-Roth, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical
School and an EPP expert, estimates that fewer than 20,000
Americans have the disorder.
	   Jane and Bill Lucas first noticed something was wrong with their
son when he was 3 years old. Thinking it was just a conventional
allergy, they changed his diet, laundry detergent and the soap they
bathed him in. But it was not until last year that he was diagnosed
with EPP.
	   Rob's story actually started more than a year ago, when a
British woman, Eleanor Richards, posed a simple question to NASA:
If it could develop clothing to protect astronauts from the extreme
temperatures of outer space, could it find a way to help her two
grandchildren lead normal lives?
	   The answer, after much research, was yes.
	   Employing the same technology designed to protect astronauts
working in space, a team of NASA engineers, a doctor and Robert
Dotts, assistant director of technology transfer at the Johnson
Space Center in Houston, helped make the pint-sized suits.
	   The team tested materials that came close to blocking out most
of the sun's rays, but found only one company willing and able to
develop a material sturdy enough to resist ultraviolet light: the
Solar Protective Factory in Carmichael, Calif.
	   The Richards had been covering their windows with blankets and
using 25-watt light bulbs because Kyle, 5, and Ryan, 3, have a
similar disorder _ polymorphic light eruption _ that made exposure
to any kind of light painful.
	   ``Before they never went out in daylight, they never played with
other kids, they never went shopping, they only played on the
swings in the winter in the dark,'' said Mrs. Richards said in a
telephone interview from her home in the county of Durham in
northern England.
	   SPF's president, Terry Breese and the Richards met in Orlando,
Fla., to deliver the suits last year. NASA also contracted with the
HED Foundation to test and evaluate both prototypes as the boys put
them through their paces. A boy in Virginia Beach, Virginia, also
received a prototype.
	   The result are the suits Rob now wears.
	   The HED Foundation, based in Hampton, Va., provides cooling gear
to children with hypochidrotic ectodrmal dysplasia, a medical
disorder characterized by a lack of sweat glands.
	   Sarah Moody, of the HED Foundation, said children with these
disorders are ``trapped in their bodies; they can't do what we can
do.'' With the suits, ``they can be more normal than what they were
before.''
	   Mrs. Richards calls the suits, ``brilliant, immensely''
brilliant. Before the boys got their suits, ``we couldn't let them
go out because they would break out in massive blisters,'' she
said.
	   Just like Rob.
	   Now, instead of surfing the Internet or whipping up dinner, he
can play outside with his buddies who have devised a special game
for their friend in the space-like type suit.
	   ``Star Wars,'' he says with a laugh.

TWA families hope experts' report will lead to legal action
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CONSTANCE POLLARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French relatives of TWA Flight 800 victims said
Wednesday they hope a new report by French experts will lead to a
formal investigation in France of Boeing, TWA and the U.S. Federal
Aviation Administration.
	   The families spoke at a news conference before meeting with
three experts appointed by a French investigating judge, Chantal
Perdrix, to discuss the July 1996 accident.
	   French law requires an experts' report in order to to go ahead
with a formal investigation _ which is a step short of formal
charges being filed. The French families have long been calling for
such an investigation.
	   At a news conference in Paris, ``Victims of Flight 800''
President Jose Cremades and other relatives said they want Boeing,
TWA and FAA authorities to be punished, because they said all three
were aware of a fuel tank problem in 747s which appears to have
provoked the crash.
	   ``The constructors knew that this could happen, and they knew it
for more than 20 years,'' said Michel Breistoff, father of victim
Michel Breistoff. ``They knew the risks and did nothing to correct
it.''
	   The Paris-bound jet blew up off the coast of Long Island shortly
after takeoff from Kennedy Airport, killing all 230 people aboard.
	   In public hearings in December, the National Transportation
Safety Board said it was sure an explosion had occurred in the
Boeing 747's center fuel tank, but didn't know what triggered it.
	   Breistoff said the relatives ``want punishment, but not in
money. We want these people to be punished legally and possibly
jailed.
	   ``This is the fundamental difference between the French way of
thinking and the American way of thinking,'' he said.
	   Cremades, whose 15-year-old son died in the explosion, also
denounced what he called ``the media's intoxication campaign''
regarding the causes of the accident.
	   During ceremonies for the second anniversary last week, he said,
the American press kept talking about ``the mystery of Flight 800''
and ``never finding out what exactly happened.''
	   ``This really angers us, since we do know the exact causes,''
Cremades said.

South African president say Brazil could be of help to Africa
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ South African President Nelson Mandela
said Wednesday that Brazil could be of great help to Africa in
resolving hunger and conflict affecting the region.
	   ``Brazil is the world's ninth-largest economy and has the
largest black population outside of Africa,'' Mandela said. ``I am
sure that Brazil is disposed to help with the problems of the
African continent. It has already been very active and present in
Mozambique and Angola.''
	   Mandela arrived here late Monday with his new wife Graca
Machael. They were wed on Saturday.
	   When asked if she liked Brasilia _ the nation's futuristic
capital _ as a place to pass the first days of her honeymoon,
Machael laughed and said: ``Is that a joke? We don't have time for
a honeymoon.''
	   The couple will head to Buenos Aires, Argentina, late Wednesday
to attend a business conference.

U.N. chief stresses dialogue as route to Chiapas resolution
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan urged
leftist Mexican rebels Wednesday to resume talks with the
government, saying it was the only way to end the 4-year-old
conflict in Chiapas.
	   The U.N. chief met with President Ernesto Zedillo and said he
was convinced the Mexican leader is committed to peacefully solving
the uprising in the poor, southern state.
	   ``This is why I urge the other side to work _ through a
sustained and persistent dialogue _ together to find a solution,''
Annan said afterward. ``It takes two to tango.''
	   Annan, on the last leg of a five-nation Latin American tour,
reiterated that he has no intention of having the United Nations
step in as mediator, as some non-governmental groups have
suggested.
	   ``The U.N. does not get involved in internal affairs of this
nature ... unless there's a request from the government. There has
been no such request and I have not offered to get involved,''
Annan said.
	   Talks between the government and the rebels have been stalemated
since August 1996 and there have been repeated clashes between
pro-rebel and pro-government groups, climaxing with the massacre of
45 rebel sympathizers in December.
	   Zapatista leader Subcommander Marcos issued a statement Monday
saying that Mexican or international mediators were needed because
the government had ``destroyed the only bridge for dialogue.''
	   Zedillo has rejected any mediation, especially by foreigners,
insisting on direct talks with the rebels.
	   Annan said Zedillo briefed him on the government's attempts to
improve the economic and political situations in Chiapas. He urged
all parties to have patience during the continuing effort to bring
peace.
	   The Zapatista uprising of January 1994, to demand greater Indian
rights and democracy, was quickly halted by a cease-fire.
	   The only agreement reached in talks since was for greater Indian
rights. Differences over how to enact it caused the breakdown in
talks.
	   In his statement Monday, Marcos suggested a national plebiscite
on a proposed constitutional amendment for Indian rights. Zedillo
already has rejected the proposal.
	   Interior Secretary Francisco Labastida said Wednesday in the
central state of Hidalgo that the government is working to improve
life in Chiapas by improving health services, schools, water
supplies and roads.
	   ``Neither Marcos nor anyone else will impede the federal
government from continuing with its policies to resolve the
underlying problems in Chiapas,'' he said.

Champions Cup: Celtic 0, St. Patricks 0
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) _ The part-timers of St. Patrick's
Athletic held Scottish titlist Glasgow Celtic 0-0 in the qualifying
round of the European Champions Cup Wednesday and Josef Venglos
star-studded Celtic team was jeered off the field.
	   Almost 57,000 fans showed up at Parkhead expecting to see
Celtic, who last season ended Rangers streak of nine titles in a
row, overwhelm the Irish team.
	   But the team that Slovak coach Venglos inherited last week
failed to hit the target and Celtic will go to Dublin in a week's
time hoping to make up for its poor performance by winning on the
road.

Aerospatiale to be privatized
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with details. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ In the latest of France's efforts to restructure
its defense and aerospace industry ahead of a larger European
restructuring, the government said Wednesday that Aerospatiale, the
state-controlled aerospace group, will be privatized.
	   In a late-evening statement, the office of Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin said that under an accord reached with the Lagardere group,
Aerospatiale would acquire Lagardere's Matra Hautes Technologies.
	   In return, Lagardere will get a sizable stake in Aerospatiale _
30 to 33 percent _ and will be the company's largest private
shareholder.
	   Matra Hautes Technologies is a holding company for all of
Lagardere's defense and space activities.
	   The state's share of Aerospatiale would be less than 50 percent,
the statement said.
	   Aerospatiale is a partner in the European aviation consortium
Airbus Industrie, and ranks as France's heaviest hitter in the
aerospace and defense sector.
	   The governments of France, Germany, Spain and Britain have been
pushing for the creation of a unified European civil and military
aerospace company to rival U.S. giants Lockheed Martin Corp. and
Boeing.
	   But the French government's reluctance to part with its majority
ownership in Aerospatiale was a sticking point in discussions.
	   In May, the French government transferred its 46-percent stake
in fighter plane maker Dassault Aviation to Aerospatiale.
	   In a joint statement issued Wednesday night, right after the
government's, Lagardere and Aerospatiale noted that the new defense
group will be the fourth largest defense company in the world, with
over 80 billion francs (about dlrs 13 billion) in annual sales.
	   They also said Aerospatiale's capital ``could later be opened to
other French or European private industrial companies, depending on
the European consolidation to come.''

Mexico to seek tenders for Guanajuato natural gas distribution
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ The Mexican government will seek bids this
week to distribute natural gas in the central state of Guanajuato,
the head of the Energy Regulatory Commission said Wednesday.
	   At an international natural gas symposium underway in Mexico
City, commission president Hector Olea said the call for tenders
will be published Thursday in the Official Gazette.
	   The Bajio zone, as the area is called, includes the cities of
Guanajuato, Celaya, Silao, Salamanca and Irapuato.
	   The commission expects investment of dlrs 53 million in the five
cities, which combined produce around 3 percent of the country's
gross domestic product. The process is part of the government's
ambitious plans to expand the use of natural gas in Mexico.
	   Olea said that since deregulation of natural gas transportation,
distribution and storage in 1995, the commission has issued five
permits for existing networks and seven for new networks.
	   Investment in the 12 projects is estimated at dlrs 1 billion.
	   Winners of bids to distribute natural gas in Mexico City and
adjacent areas in the state of Mexico will be announced Aug. 4.

UEFA Cup: Rangers hits back to win 5-3
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TRANMERE, England (AP) _ Trailing 3-0 to the Irish part-timers
of Shelbourne with 32 minutes to go, Glasgow Rangers hit back to
win 5-3 in the UEFA Cup qualifying round first leg Wednesday.
	   Star studded Rangers looked like the underdog when Sergio
Porrino scored in his own net in the seventh minute, Mark
Rutherford added a second for Shelbourne three minutes before half
time and Pat Morley added a third in the 58th.
	   German midfielder Jorg Albertz replied with a penalty in the
59th, Gabriel Amato and then new Dutch signing Giovanni van
Bronkhorst tied the scores with strikes in the 72nd and 74th
minutes. Amato added a fourth with eight minutes to go and then
Albertz netted another penalty in the 85th to give the Scottish
club the advantage when the two teams meet again in the second leg
next Wednesday.
	   The game was played at Tranmere's ground in Liverpool,
north-west England because of the fear of sectarian trouble.
Rangers are a predominantly Protestant team and Shelbourne is from
Dublin, which is mainly Catholic.
	   The neutral venue didn't prevent trouble, however, and police on
horseback had to use CS gas to quell violence after a large number
of Rangers fans were removed from a pub.

Suriname's supreme court rejects president's appointee
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARAMARIBO, Suriname (AP) _ Suriname's supreme court judges are
refusing to recognize the body's new chief justice, saying they
were not consulted about his appointment.
	   President Jules Wijdenbosch appointed judge Alfred Veldema to
the post last week, but he did not consult the judges as required
by Suriname's constitution.
	   The court's 11 judges have written to Wijdenbosch threatening to
boycott Veldema's inauguration, court officials confirmed Tuesday.
Veldema cannot be sworn in unless two judges are present at the
ceremony.
	   The justices are also opposing Wijdenbosch's choice for attorney
general, Heloise Rozenblad.
	   The justices said they would continue working under the high
court's acting president, judge John von Niesewand.

	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Hundreds of monkey have invaded a small
northeastern town looking for food and water following an
eight-month-long drought in the region, local officials said
Wednesday.
	   In Vila Serrana, a town of 3,000 in Paraiba state, 2,000
kilometers (1,240 miles) northeast of Sao Paulo, monkeys traveling
in groups of up to 200 have taken to entering peoples' homes in
search of food and water, according to Camilo Gomes an employee of
the local phone company.
	   The monkeys are the latest victims of a devastating drought that
has gripped Brazil's impoverished Northeast, where it hasn't rained
for more than eight months.
	   They descend from the once verdant hills that surround Vila
Serrana ``and go from house to house,'' said Gomes. ``The trees no
longer have leaves or fruits and the watering holes have all dried
up.''
	   When the monkeys are not scared away by barking dogs, residents
feed them sugar and corn and give them some water, he said.
	   ___
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Police clashed Wednesday with hundreds
of residents of a working class district built on illegally
occupied land outside of Sao Paulo.
	   The eviction of nearly 1,000 people was ordered by a Sao Paulo
state judge because their concrete houses were built on top of a
network of springs that supply one of Sao Paulo's principal water
reservoirs.
	   Residents refused to the leave the some 200 houses that sit on a
120,000-square-meter (144,000-square-yard) lot.
	   Police said the 700 riot troopers sent in to enforce the
eviction order resorted to tear gas and rubber bullets when they
were met by rocks and some Molotov cocktails hurled by angry
residents.
	   At least 11 people _ 10 residents and one police officer, bitten
by his own dog _ were reported injured, none seriously.
	   The homeowners unsuspectingly purchased their plots of land from
unscrupulous speculators who did not have title to the area.

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Colombia grounded a fleet of
U.S.-donated helicopters awaiting the findings of U.S. and
Colombian experts investigating a crash that killed seven anti-drug
policemen last weekend.
	   Defense Minister Gilberto Echeverri said Wednesday, the 36 Bell
UH-IH Huey helicopters would remain grounded until the aircraft's
safety can be assured. Technical experts from the U.S. company, the
National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Aviation
Administration were expected to arrive in Colombia Wednesday to
help investigate the crash.
	   The seven officers died when the decades-old helicopter went
down while on an anti-narcotics mission in war-torn Antioquia
province in northwestern Colombia, police reported. Foul weather
was originally blamed for the crash.
	   A U.S. State Department official who asked not to be identified
said the helicopter was searching for a drug lab protected by
right-wing paramilitary groups who, like leftist rebels, are
increasingly involved in the drug trade.
	   He said the U.S. investigation was routine and that there was no
indication that mechanical defects _ which grounded dozens of Hueys
for months earlier this year _ played a role in Saturday's
accident.
	   ___
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ A drug trafficker who caused a
national scandal when Venezuela's president accidentally granted
him a pardon has been released from prison for good.
	   Larry Tovar Acuna walked out of the San Juan de Los Morros
prison in central Venezuela late Tuesday after winning early
release for good conduct. He had served nine years of a 12-year
sentence.
	   Justice Minister Hilarion Cardozo said he was forced to release
Tovar because of a judge's ruling.
	   Tovar made headlines in 1993 when then-President Ramon J.
Velasquez accidentally signed papers granting him a pardon.
Velasquez said he did not read the documents, which his secretary
placed before him to be signed.
	   Tovar fled to Colombia, where he was captured and extradited a
year later.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A human rights center linked to the Roman
Catholic church has called on the Inter-American Human Rights
Commission to urge protection for a priest who has reported threats
from security forces in Chiapas state.
	   The appeal comes at a time of confusion over calls to restart
peace talks between the government and the Zapatista National
Liberation Army in Mexico's southernmost state.
	   Federal and state officials have repeatedly accused Catholic
Bishop Samuel Ruiz of bias toward the Zapatistas, prompting Ruiz to
quit as the conflict's chief mediator.
	   The bishop, who has been repeatedly threatened by local
pro-government groups, oversees the Fray Bartolome de las Casas
Human Rights Center.
	   Late Tuesday, the center said the priest for the town of
Tumbala, Jaime Rangel, reported that people believed to be linked
to the government had been monitoring and harassing him, as well as
threatening parishioners to make them give information about his
movements.

	   QUEZALTEPEQUE, El Salvador (AP) _ Flanked by his wife and a
clutch of reporters, a third national guardsman convicted of raping
and killing four American churchwomen strode from prison on
Wednesday as church leaders worried that the truth in the case may
never be known.
	   ``We lose a great opportunity to make progress in justice and to
know the historical truth,'' Gregorio Rosa Chavez, auxiliary bishop
of San Salvador, said of the release Tuesday and Wednesday of three
men who were serving time in the 1980 slayings.
	   ``It seems that the coverup has continued,'' Therese Howard, a
spokeswoman for the Maryknoll order in the United States, said by
telephone. Two of the victims were Maryknoll nuns.
	   The former guardsman, Daniel Canales, was driven from a prison
15 miles (25 kilometers) north of San Salvador Wednesday morning
after several dozen national and international journalists insisted
on an impromptu news conference.
	   In a prison patio surrounded by mango trees, Canales calmly
reiterated his innocence to before television cameras and
microphones.
	   Despite church fears that the releases mean that he and his
former fellow guardsmen cannot be compelled to testify more,
Canales promised to help any more investigations. The Roman
Catholic Church has long complained that past probes never revealed
who ordered the slayings.
	   ``My country and the whole world has the right to know the
truth,'' Canales said, wearing grey slacks and the light blue
striped cotton shirt his wife brought to him in the prison in a
small bag.
	   Canales said that the low-ranking guardsmen who committed the
1980 murders ``were executing orders of superiors.''
	   Five national guardsmen were convicted of kidnapping, raping and
killing Roman Catholic nuns Ita Ford, Maura Clark and Dorothy Kazel
and layworker Jean Donovan on Dec. 2, 1980, apparently because they
were suspect of sympathizing with leftist rebels in the 1980-1992
civil war.
	   Canales and another two freed Tuesday were released under a new
law to ease prison overcrowding after serving almost 18 years of
their 30-year sentences. A judge declared two others ineligible due
to misconduct in prison.
	   Canales and one other former guardsman have said that higher-ups
ordered the killings. While Canales has admitted that he was at the
murder scene, he has insisted he did not participate.
	   Canales said the masterminds of the crime ``were at the top and
they could not fall, so they had to make (a coverup) so that the
weakest would would pay for this crime.''
	   But the only one of the five believed to know of superiors who
might be involved was former Sgt. Luis Colindres, who maintained
his innocence when he left prison on Tuesday. Also released Tuesday
was former guardsman Jose Roberto Moreno Canjura.
	   ``I have always been innocent in the case,'' Colindres said. ``I
cannot tell you anything.''
	   Asked who had ordered the slayings, he replied, ``How do you
know they gave me that order?''
	   The crimes caused outrage in the United States, whose government
strongly supported the Salvadoran government during the 1980-1992
civil war in which some 70,000 people died, many at the hands of
military-backed death squads.
	   However, the prison releases have elicited very little attention
and virtually no protests here in El Salvador, where people are
anxious to put years of bloodshed behind. There were no angry
editorials in the national newspapers, no protesters outside the
prisons.
	   A 1993 United Nations report determined that the former national
guard director, Col. Eugenio Vides Casanova, and Defense Minister
Jose Guillermo Garcia, tried to cover up the killings and concluded
that Vides Casanova knew the guardsmen acted on the orders of
superiors.
	   Prosecutors earlier this year rejected appeals to reopen the
investigation, saying the 10-year statute of limitation for murder
had expired. Relatives have argued that there is no such limit on
political murders under international law.
	   William Ford, brother of Ita Ford, noted that Vides Casanova and
Garcia both live in the United States. He said both ``should
certainly be called to testify under oath in front of Congress
about what they know about the orders to murder the women and the
subsequent coverup.''
	   Vides Casanova has denied the accusations, saying ``my
conscience would never be able to rest if I knew their orders to
kill came from above.''

Kiev overpowers Barry 8-0; Rangers hits back for 5-3 win
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Dynamo Kiev showed why it reached the quarterfinal
of the Champions Cup last season by demolishing the part-timers of
Welsh titlist Barry Town 8-0 Wednesday with Serhiy Rebrov hitting
four goals.
	   It was a coincidental rematch of the two teams who also met at
the same qualifying stage last season. That time Kiev triumphed 2-0
and 4-0.
	   There was no such easy stroll for Scottish champion Glasgow
Celtic, however, which was held 0-0 at home by the semi-pro Irish
club, St. Patrick's Athletic. Coached by Slovakian Josef Venglos,
who took over last week, Celtic will have to improve in next
Wednesday's second leg in Dublin.
	   Another Irish-Scottish matchup in the UEFA Cup had plenty of
goals, a thrilling turnaround and, sadly, violence outside the
steadium.
	   Trailing 3-0 to Shelbourne with 32 minutes to go, Glasgow
Rangers hit back to win 5-3.
	   Star studded Rangers looked like the underdog when Sergio
Porrino scored in his own net in the seventh minute, Mark
Rutherford added a second for Shelbourne three minutes before half
time and Pat Morley added a third in the 58th.
	   German midfielder Jorg Albertz replied with a penalty in the
59th, Gabriel Amato and then new Dutch signing Giovanni van
Bronkhorst tied the scores with strikes in the 72nd and 74th
minutes. Amato added a fourth with eight minutes to go and then
Albertz netted another penalty in the 85th to give the Scottish
club the advantage when the two teams meet again in the second leg
next Wednesday.
	   The game was played at Tranmere's ground in Liverpool,
north-west England because of the fear of sectarian trouble.
Rangers are a predominantly Protestant team and Shelbourne is from
Dublin, which is mainly Catholic.
	   The neutral venue didn't prevent trouble, however, and police on
horseback had to use CS gas to quell violence after a large number
of Rangers fans were removed from a pub.

	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukrainian champions Dinamo Kiev delivered a
smashing 8-0 defeat to Barry Town of Wales on Wednesday in the
first leg of the Champions' Cup qualifying round.
	   Four of the goals were scored by top striker Serhiy Rebrov and
two others by forward Andriy Shevchenko. Barry Town managed only
three shots on Dinamo's goal during the entire game, watched by
14,000 fans at Kiev's downtown Dinamo stadium.
	   Dinamo's Oleksandr Khatskevich and Wales' goalie David Nurse
were both shown a yellow card during the game.

Israeli defense minister asks for U.S. help in negotiations

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ A last-minute mediation effort by
Jordan's crown prince kept Mideast peace talks alive Wednesday,
just hours after Israeli and Palestinian negotiators declared they
were at an impasse and appealed for American mediation.
	   The announcement by Crown Prince Hassan came after the
Palestinians ended the first direct talks in months, complaining
that Israel had failed to bring new ideas to the table and had
refused to accept an American peace initiative.
	   The United States arranged the talks after announcing earlier
this month that it had exhausted its efforts to win agreement for
its peace plan, which calls for an Israeli troop pullback of 13
percent in the West Bank.
	   The talks were widely seen as the last chance for Israel and the
Palestinians to reach such an agreement for some time.
	   ``Crown Prince Hassan produced an acceptable solution to both
sides,'' his spokesman Ayman Safadi said in Amman, Jordan. The
negotiators would meet again Thursday, Safadi said.
	   Earlier Wednesday, Hassan met with the deputy of Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat, Mahmoud Abbas.
	   Abbas had met Sunday with the Israeli defense minister, Yitzhak
Mordechai. Lower-level negotiators met Monday and Tuesday.
	   Nabil Abourdeneh, a senior advisor to Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat, indicated no progress, saying Israel ``did not present
anything new and continues to reject the U.S. initiative.''
	   The Palestinians have accepted the U.S. initiative, but Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has balked at the scope of the
withdrawal. He also seeks stronger guarantees that Palestinians
will live up to their security obligations.
	   The Israelis indicated the talks failed because the Palestinians
weren't willing to discuss other issues, such as the extradition of
Palestinians suspected of killing Israelis.
	   Mordechai said the time had come for a summit between Netanyahu
and Arafat.
	   ``What is also needed now is high-level American involvement,
with the (U.S. Mideast) envoy, Dennis Ross, and (U.S.) Secretary
Madeleine Albright helping us to reach an agreement,'' Mordechai
said.
	   When asked what he thought of Mordechai's call for U.S. help,
Arafat said: ``We are not against it.''
	   Under previous accords, the two sides are to work out remaining
differences and reach a final agreement on issues of Jerusalem,
Palestinian statehood and settlements by May 1999.
	   On Wednesday, the Israeli architect of the original accords,
Labor Party legislator Yossi Beilin, suggested the May deadline be
pushed back two years to avert an inevitable collision between the
two sides.

Chinese gymnast unlikely to walk again
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HAL BOCK &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ Chinese gymnast Sang Lan is unlikely
to walk again after damaging her spinal cord in a spill at the
Goodwill Games.
	   ``She has no ability to move her legs,'' Dr. Brock Schnebel,
chief medical officer of the games, said Wednesday.
	   The 17-year-old gymnast is in Nassau County Medical Center, and
Schnebel said her condition had not changed overnight.
	   ``She has some function in her upper extremities consistent with
the level of her injury,'' he said. ``It was a tragic injury with
an unpredictable prognosis.''
	   Goodwill Games officials were making arrangements for Sang's
parents to fly from China to join their daughter. They were
expected to arrive Friday or Saturday.
	   Sang was hurt while practicing the vault before the start of
Tuesday night's competition. She was attempting a routine forward
vault when she lost control in the air and crashed head-first on
the mat. Emergency workers rushed to her and she was taken by
ambulance to the hospital.
	   Schnebel diagnosed the injury as a fracture-dislocation of two
cervical spine vertebrae.
	   ``She was placed in traction and her spinal column realigned,''
he said. ``There is no pressure on the cord at this time but there
is swelling on the cord.''
	   Dr. Vincent Leone, an orthopedic spine surgeon who treated Sang,
was asked if she would walk again.
	   ``It's fair to say that it would be unlikely,'' he said, adding
certain parts of her spinal cord work.
	   ``That's better than a complete injury when you have permanent
paralysis. Her prognosis is still guarded. We expect some
improvement. The extent I cannot comment on. She's young with good
healing potential. It's too soon for a prognosis. ... It is a
devastating injury, a violent injury.''
	   Sang faces spinal fusion surgery with implants to stabilize her
spine and prevent the bones from sliding into each other.
	   Schnebel said Sang, a junior high school student who was the
Chinese national champion in the vault last year, helped doctors as
they treated her.
	   ``She was brave and courageous,'' he said. ``She answered all
our questions and never complained, although this is a painful
injury to go through.''
	   Chinese officials who spent the night with the gymnast said the
accident occurred on a maneuver Sang had done many times and she
did not know what went wrong.
	   Tu Mingde, secretary general of the Chinese Olympic Committee,
said other gymnasts from his country would remain in the Goodwill
competition.
	   Peter Kormann, coordinator of the U.S. men's team, was across
the floor at the Nassau Coliseum and saw the accident.
	   ``It was a warmup vault, not a high-level, difficult vault,'' he
said. ``She got a little too much rotation, a little too much
spring. It was not a difficult maneuver. It was a mistake. ''
	   When executed properly, the vault would have ended with Sang
landing on her feet. Kormann said she was caught in between and had
to make a split-second decision to fall on her back or try and
recover and get to her feet. She wound up in the middle.
	   ``In that situation, your body is in space and you don't feel
quite right,'' Kormann said. ``You feel there's something wrong.
It's just a feeling that a gymnast understands.''
	   Kathy Scanlan said there have been no catastrophic injuries in
competition during the four years she has been president of USA
Gymnastics.
	   ``We've had three serious ones in training, but none on the
vault,'' she said.
	   Scanlan did not question the safety of the arena or equipment.
	   ``Accidents do occur,'' she said. ``This was simply an accident,
not the result of unsafe conditions. What's terrible is that it
happened on something as simple as this. This was the simplest
thing she could be doing.''

Courier advances in Legg Mason Classic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Jim Courier beat the heat and Marcos Ondruska
of South Africa in the second round of the Legg Mason Classic
tennis tournament on Wednesday.
	   The seventh-seeded Courier beat Ondruska 7-6 (7-3), 7-6 (8-6) in
an afternoon match played in muggy conditions with a heat index of
100 degrees.
	   ``It becomes a survival test more than anything else,'' Courier
said. ``Both of us were trying to keep the points short.''
	   Courier, who helped the U.S. Davis Cup team defeat Belgium last
weekend, managed the conditions better than Wade McGuire.
	   McGuire was scheduled to resume his first-round match against
Jimmy Arias Wednesday morning, but was unable to play after being
hospitalized for six hours Tuesday night because of heat
exhaustion.
	   McGuire dropped the first set to Arias 6-4 Tuesday, but was
leading 5-2 in the second when a storm knocked out the power at the
FitzGerald Tennis Center.
	   Battling severe dehydration after the postponement, McGuire had
to be taken by ambulance to the hospital where he was given
intravenous fluids.
	   ``It was really a frightening experience for me,'' McGuire said.
	   In other second-round action Wednesday, sixth-seed Vincent
Spadea beat David Nainkin of South Africa 6-4, 6-7 (4-7), 6-1 and
No. 5 Filip DeWulf of Belgium beat Sargis Sargsian of Armenia 7-6
(7-4), 6-1.
	   Also Wednesday, NCAA singles champion Bob Bryan lost his tour
debut. Bryan, who teamed with twin Mike to win the NCAA doubles and
helped Stanford to the team title in May, lost to Michael Sell 7-6
(7-4), 6-0.
	   The 20-year-old had won two minor tournaments and was 13-1 since
turning professional.
	   Tuesday night's storm created a full slate Wednesday that
included a stadium court evening doubleheader featuring top-seed
Michael Chang and second-seed Andre Agassi.

<TEXT>
	   LIVERPOOL, England (AP) _ Drunken Glasgow Rangers fans clashed
with police at Wednesday's UEFA Cup game against Irish club
Shelbourne Wednesday although the trouble was not believed to be
sectarian.
	   The game was moved from Dublin to Liverpool in north-east
England to avoid clashes between the Rangers fans, almost entirely
Protestant, and followers of the Irish team, who are Catholics.
	   But the Merseyside police reported several flareups involving
Rangers fans, many of whom were drunk.
	   Police on horseback and others using CS gas had to quell
violence which started when a large number of Rangers fans were
ejected from a pub.
	   One man was seriously ill in hospital after plunging from the
roof of a stand at the ground on to the ground outside. Police said
it was thought he could have been trying to climb into the
all-ticket game at Tranmere's Prenton Park.
	   A number of arrests were made but police said it was believed no
one else had been injured during the series of incidents.

Netherlands upsets U.S. 3-1
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with U.S. coach quotes, late results &QL; 
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ No major leaguers, no chance.
	   Rob Cordemans pitched a four-hitter and Ken Brauckmiller went
3-for-4 with two RBIs Wednesday as the Netherlands beat a United
States team of college players 3-1 in the preliminary round of the
Baseball World Championships.
	   The Netherlands has never finished higher than sixth in the
world and was ninth in 1994.
	   But the Americans, without the benefit of major leaguers, have
not won these championships since 1974, the last time the country
hosted the event. The United States was sixth four years ago.
	   The tournament is open to professionals for the first time, and
some minor league players are participating for Canada, the
Dominican Republic and other countries.
	   South Korea routed Russia 11-1 at Palermo in a game halted in
the seventh inning because of the 10-run mercy rule. South Korea
and Netherlands (both 1-0) share the lead in Pool B, with the U.S.
and Russia (both 0-1) tied for last. The U.S. and South Korea play
Thursday.
	   ``All the clubs in our bracket are tough and in all cases they
are more experienced and older than our ball club,'' U.S. coach Ron
Polk said. ``Our kids all are 19 and 20 years old.''
	   The top four teams from each of the two eight-team groups will
advance to next week's quarterfinals.
	   Elsewhere Wednesday in Pool B, Grant McDonald's two-run blast in
the ninth inning lifted Australia past Canada 6-5 at Messina and
Nicaragua edged Taiwan 4-3.
	   In Pool A, five-time defending champion Cuba routed Spain 14-2,
the Dominican Republic beat South Africa by the same score and
Japan defeated Panama 6-1.
	   At Palermo, the Americans were undone by sloppy defense, with
errors leading to two unearned runs.
	   ``Those mistakes are not reflective of the ball club,'' Polk
said. ``But the whole key to the ball game was their pitcher. He
just didn't give us a chance to get started at all.''
	   Cordemans went the full nine innings, allowing four hits and
four walks, while striking out five.
	   After University of Nevada-Las Vegas outfielder Ryan Ludwick put
the U.S. team up 1-0 with a solo homer in the second inning,
Brauckmiller tied the game with a sacrifice fly in the third and
drove in the go-ahead run with single in the fifth.
	   The Dutch added an insurance run in the top of the ninth when
outfielder Rikkert Faneyte, a long-time minor leaguer who had brief
stints in the majors with the Texas Rangers and San Francisco
Giants, singled home Jeffrey Cranston.
	   U.S. starter Alex Santos, an All-American for the University of
Miami last season, lasted 8 2-3 innings and gave up nine hits.

Israeli defense minister asks for U.S. help in negotiations
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with grafs 2-3, 11 with Mordechai's office announcing
meeting tomorrow, Palestinian officials refusing to confirm &QL; 
 &UR; By DAFNA LINZER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Hours after Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators indicated talks had failed and called for American
mediation, Jordan's Crown Prince Hassan successfully arranged a
resumption of Mideast peace talks Wednesday, his spokesman said.
	   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai was to meet Thursday
with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat or his deputy, Mordechai's
office said.
	   But the Palestinians were not confirming the meeting. Leaving
Arafat's Gaza office, Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat would not
answer reporters when asked about a Thursday meeting and Israeli
media reports quoted Arafat's deputy denying a meeting had been
set.
	   The Palestinians ended the first direct talks in months between
the sides Wednesday, complaining that Israel had failed to bring
new ideas to the table and had refused to accept an American peace
initiative.
	   The American administration had arranged the talks after
announcing earlier this month that it had exhausted its efforts to
win agreement for its peace plan which calls for an Israeli troop
pullback of 13 percent in the West Bank.
	   The talks were widely seen as the last chance for Israel and the
Palestinians to reach such an agreement for some time.
	   Israel had contacted the Americans and Egyptian officials since
the talks began three days ago, looking for mediation.
	   But it was the Jordanians who managed to bring the sides back
together.
	   ``Crown Prince Hassan produced an acceptable solution to both
sides,'' his spokesman Ayman Safadi said in Amman, Jordan. Hassan
met earlier Wednesday with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's
deputy, Mahmoud Abbas.
	   ``Jordan is very glad that it succeeded in playing this role,''
Safadi said, adding that the negotiators would meet again Thursday.
	   Mordechai's spokesman, Avi Beniahu, said that the minister had
``received a message that the Palestinians are interested in
renewing contacts. We expect that there will be a meeting
tomorrow.''
	   Earlier, Mordechai said American involvement could help bring
about a much-needed summit between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and Arafat to try and resolve the disputes.

Child porn found on computer of man who admitted killing daughter
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Recasts summary line to remove reference to images of man's
daughter being found in computer; authorities will not comment on
whose images were found. Note contents. &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHN MacDONALD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FARGO, North Dakota (AP) _ A man who confessed on the Internet
to killing his 5-year-old daughter by setting the house on fire
also claimed online that he molested the girl, The Associated Press
has learned.
	   The evidence raises the possibility that authorities could
charge Larry Froistad Jr. with sexual exploitation of a minor
ending in the victim's death _ a charge that could lead to the
death penalty.
	   In documents obtained by the AP, an FBI agent said the computer
seized from Froistad's San Diego home in March contained e-mail
messages and transcripts of chat room conversations in which he
admitted to a sexual relationship with his daughter, Amanda.
	   The affidavit from FBI agent Carl Florez also indicates
investigators discovered hundreds of images of child pornography
during an examination of Froistad's computer.
	   They also found evidence that Froistad routinely visited
Internet chat rooms frequented by pedophiles and that he had traded
child pornography over the Internet, the affidavit said.
	   U.S. Attorney John Schneider said Wednesday he could not discuss
the case or say if any of the images found were of Froistad's
daughter. ``It is our policy to never disclose the identify of
juvenile victims,'' he said.
	   Froistad's attorneys did not return repeated calls seeking
comment.
	   Froistad, 29, was charged in March with the 1995 death of Amanda
in a house fire in Bowman, North Dakota. He pleaded innocent to the
state murder charge last week and remains in jail. The murder
charge carries a maximum sentence of life in prison.
	   His attorneys have said the Internet messages could have been
sent by someone else and are not admissible. They also said he was
confused and had serious mental problems.
	   Authorities say the San Diego computer programmer confessed in
an Internet chat group to setting the fire, which was initially
ruled an accident.
	   In an online support group for problem drinkers, Froistad posted
a 562-word message detailing a bitter custody fight with his
ex-wife over Amanda. He said he got ``wickedly drunk,'' set the
house on fire and left his daughter inside to burn.
	   Fellow members of the group turned in Froistad.
	   The FBI said it found an e-mail message Froistad wrote to a
member of the online support group in which Froistad admitted
molesting his daughter.
	   In that message, a copy of which was contained in Florez's
affidavit, Froistad wrote: ``The fact is, I had too close a
relationship with her; it was sexual and I know that's wrong. But
she loved me, and I loved her, and I don't know what to do now.''
	   And while Froistad and his ex-wife had been involved in a bitter
custody battle, he noted that it had been settled prior to the
fire.
	   ``Even though her mother gave her up to me in late May,''
Froistad wrote, ``something got into me while I was drunk ... and I
decided to burn our house down. I made quite a show of it. I killed
my daughter and somehow managed to gather a whole town's sympathy.
What an actor I am.''

Maradona says he wants to coach Argentina's national team
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Diego Maradona on Wednesday said
he wants to return to Argentina's national team, this time as
coach.
	   ``I feel I have the experience and know-how to coach the
national team,'' said the former Argentine captain.
	   ``The truth is, I'm dying to coach the team but it's a question
of the directors,'' he said, referring to the Argentine Football
Association (AFA).
	   However, it appears unlikely the association's brass would
consider the four-time World Cup star. Maradona and AFA's president
Julio Grondona reportedly do not see eye-to-eye.
	   Maradona said he ``would have taken the job minutes after
Argentina's loss to Holland'' in the tournament's quarterfinals.
	   Daniel Passarella, Argentina's coach during the World Cup,
resigned just after the tournament and local media reports indicate
Jose Pekerman is the leading candidate. Pekerman is in charge of
Argentina's youth national teams.
	   ``Although I have a great respect for him,'' Maradona said. ``I
have my doubts because Jose has a strong personality for young
people but not for professionals.''
	   Since he retired from football last year, Maradona has
considered a number of ways to get back into the game, but so far
has been unsuccessful.
	   Earlier this year, he explored the possibility of serving as
player/coach for an Argentine 2nd division team.
	   As he headed off to the World Cup some months later, reports
circulated that he was discussing a similar position with an
English club team.

UN humanitarian coordinator says UN considers deadline for Taliban
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The United Nations is considering issuing
a deadline for Afghanistan's Taliban authorities to improve the
humanitarian situation in the country or face the withdrawal of
U.N. aid, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator for Afghanistan said
Wednesday.
	   Sergio Vieira de Mello briefed reporters on the U.N. Afghan
policy following the expulsion Monday of international aid groups
from the capital, Kabul. About 200 international aid workers left
rather than obey a Taliban order to move into a run-down dormitory.
	   The United Nations and the Red Cross weren't covered by the
edict and are still working in Kabul.
	   But the United Nations, which relied on the international groups
to implement its programs, has reduced its work to only life-saving
assistance and has suspended rehabilitation programs such as
rebuilding schools, hospitals and other buildings. U.N. programs
that provide food, health care and safe drinking water are
continuing, he said.
	   ``U.N. aid may have to be further restricted if there is no
progress within a reasonable timeframe on the range of differences
that we now have with the authorities,'' he said.
	   He said the United Nations and donors to the Afghan relief
effort were considering a deadline and didn't dispute that U.N.
officials would review the situation again next month.
	   When asked when the United Nations would draw the line, de Mello
said he couldn't give a precise date. But he assured ``it is much
earlier than Christmas.''
	   The differences between the two sides include the relocation
edict, another edict forcing foreign Muslim women to be accompanied
by a male, lack of access to health care and education for women
and girls, and the ``satisfactory outcome'' of an investigation
into the killings this week of two U.N. staffers in the eastern
city of Jalalbad, he said.
	   De Mello acknowledged criticism from some aid groups that the
United Nations had been too conciliatory toward the Taliban
regarding the relocation edict.
	   But he said U.N. agencies were grappling with whether it was
better to withdraw and condemn or ``remain engaged and active and
try and make a small difference on the ground and to pursuse
dialogue however tenuous the chances of success might be.''
	   He denied that the United Nations was in part responsible for
the eviction of the aid groups for having agreed with the Taliban
in a May accord to the idea of relocating international U.N. staff.
	   The accord stipulates that the Taliban may move international
U.N. workers within the city with the understanding of U.N.
authorities and taking into account U.N. security requirements.
	   ``That does not mean that by agreeing to that, we agreed to the
forcible relocation of NGO staff, both residences and offices to
the Polytechnic'' dormitory, de Mello said.
	   In a statement, Secretary-General Kofi Annan said he was deeply
disturbed about the expulsion of the aid groups and appealed to the
Taliban to reconsider their decision.

	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
held a secret late-night meeting with an Israeli negotiator and
reaffirmed his decision to hold off further talks until Israel
accepts an American peace proposal, a Palestinian official said.
	   In the meeting at his Gaza City headquarters, Arafat told
Israeli negotiator Yitzhak Molcho that he welcomed American
mediation to solve the impasse, said the senior Palestinian
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   In Washington, White House spokesman Mike McCurry said the
Clinton administration was not about to intervene again. The sides
``ought to try harder,'' to solve their differences, McCurry said.
	   Wednesday's secret meeting was arranged by Jordan's Crown Prince
Hassan, the Palestinian official said, but he added that talks
announced by Israel for Thursday would not take place.
	   A spokesman for Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said
the minister had ``received a message that the Palestinians are
interested in renewing contacts.'' Avi Beniahu said Mordechai would
meet with either Arafat or his deputy Thursday.
	   But following the Arafat-Molcho meeting, a senior Palestinian
official told The Associated Press in Gaza, ``There will be no
meeting Thursday and the Palestinian position remains the same. We
want the Israelis to commit to the American proposal.'' Mordechai's
aide was not immediately available for comment.
	   The Palestinians ended the first direct talks in months between
the sides Wednesday, complaining that Israel had failed to bring
new ideas to the table and had refused to accept an American peace
initiative.
	   The American administration had arranged the talks after
announcing it had exhausted its efforts to win agreement for its
plan which calls for an Israeli troop pullback of 13 percent in the
West Bank.
	   The talks were widely seen as the last chance for Israel and the
Palestinians to reach such an agreement for some time.
	   Israel had contacted American and Egyptian officials since the
talks began three days ago, looking for mediation. And in Jordan, a
spokesman for Crown Prince Hassan said a deal had been brokered to
renew talks.
	   ``Crown Prince Hassan produced an acceptable solution to both
sides,'' his spokesman Ayman Safadi said in Amman, Jordan. Hassan
met earlier Wednesday with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's
deputy, Mahmoud Abbas.
	   Earlier, Mordechai said American involvement could help bring
about a much-needed summit between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and Arafat to try and resolve the disputes.
	   ``What is also needed now is high-level American involvement,
with the (U.S. Mideast) envoy, Dennis Ross and Secretary Madeleine
Albright helping us to reach an agreement,'' Mordechai said.
	   When asked what he thought of Mordechai's call for U.S. help,
Arafat said: ``We are not against it.'' His aide, Nabil Abourdeneh
said the meetings had ended ``because the Israeli side did not
present any thing new and continues to reject the U.S.
initiative,'' Abourdeneh said.
	   The Clinton administration has been trying since January to win
support for a land-for-security plan in which Israel's troop
withdrawal would be met by greater Palestinian efforts to crack
down on Islamic militants.
	   The Palestinians have accepted the U.S. initiative, but
Netanyahu has balked at the scope of the withdrawal and said he
needed stronger guarantees that the Palestinians will live up to
their security obligations.
	   It was not immediately clear how the United States would respond
to the new request for intervention.
	   The Israeli-Palestinian contacts began with a Sunday meeting
between Mordechai and Abbas, followed by contacts between
lower-level negotiators on Monday and Tuesday.
	   Netanyahu has said he did not want to focus only on the troop
pullback, but also wanted to raise several other issues such as the
extradition of Palestinians suspected of killing Israelis.
	   Under previous accords the two sides are to work out remaining
differences and reach a final agreement on issues of Jerusalem,
Palestinian statehood and settlements by May 1999.
	   Wednesday, the Israeli architect of the original accords
suggested that the May deadline by pushed back two years, to 2001,
to avert an inevitable collision between the two sides.
	   Labor Party legislator Yossi Beilin said in order to avoid
violent confrontation between the two sides in the absence of a
peace deal, Israel should accept a Palestinian state which would be
demilitarized, a concession Arafat would have to make as well.

Boxer sued by barmaid
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KAREN TESTA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WEST PALM BEACH, Florida (AP) _ A barmaid accuses former
heavyweight champion Michael Moorer of threatening her with a
broken beer bottle during an obscenity-laden tirade at a popular
bar.
	   Laura Vandierendonk, who sells beer from an ice-filled tub at
Sloppy Joe's Restaurant in Boca Raton, is seeking more than dlrs
15,000 for the alleged April 12 incident in a lawsuit filed
Wednesday in Palm Beach County.
	   Moorer ``smashed beer bottles against a beer tub ... causing
(Vandierendonk) great fright and mental anguish when shattered
shards of glass flew upon her,'' according to the lawsuit, which
charges Moorer with assault and battery and intentional infliction
of emotional distress.
	   ``He started waving the broken beer bottle at her,'' said her
attorney, Neal Hirschfeld. ``She took her tip money and ran for the
kitchen.''
	   The broken glass did not cut Vandierendonk, but it did
``impact'' her face and body, Hirschfeld said. Legally, that's
sufficient grounds for a lawsuit, he said.
	   The 6-foot-2 (1.84-meter), 230-pound (103-kilogram) Moorer left
the bar after being tackled by bouncers as he chased the 5-foot-3
(1.58-meter) 115-pound (52-kg) barmaid, Hirschfeld said.
	   Moorer's attorney, Henry Latimer, flatly denied there was ever a
direct confrontation between Moorer and the barmaid.
	   ``Michael didn't do anything to cause anybody any harm,''
Latimer said.
	   However, there was ``some kind of contact between either Michael
and a friend or Michael and a bouncer ... in the process of saying,
`Hey, let's leave this place.'''
	   Palm Beach County sheriff's deputies were called to the bar
twice that night, but did not write a report for either visit. No
criminal charges were filed.
	   Moorer, 30, has a long history of police-involved scuffles.
	   In July 1996, Moorer agreed to plead guilty to disorderly
conduct and pay a dlrs 1,000 fine for a fight at a Monessen,
Pennsylvania bar. Police say he became belligerent and began
throwing glasses and breaking whiskey bottles at an Elks Club. A
charge of threatening a police officer was dropped.
	   Moorer also punched a Monessen patrolman in the jaw in 1991
during a pickup basketball game and punched another man during a
street fight in 1989.
	   Moorer won the IBF and WBA titles by defeating Evander Holyfield
in April 1994, but lost them when he was knocked out by George
Foreman in November of that year to George Foreman. He later
regained the IBF title but lost it last November to Holyfield. He
has a 39-2 record.

Morgan shoots for another victory in Los Angeles area
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN NADEL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Gil Morgan loves L.A, and it's easy to
understand why.
	   Morgan, who has won four tournaments in the Los Angeles area in
the last 20 years, and Senior Tour earnings leader Hale Irwin are
the players to beat in the 19th U.S. Senior Open, which begins
Thursday at the Riviera Country Club.
	   A field of 156 is entered in the 72-hole event, being played in
the state of California for the first time, and if Morgan chalks up
another victory here, he would accomplish something very special.
	   The Senior Open is the fourth and final major on the Senior
Tour. Morgan won two of the first three _ The Tradition, which
finished on April 5, and the Ford Senior Players Championship,
which was completed July 12.
	   He also finished third in the PGA Seniors Championship on April
19 _ behind Irwin and Larry Nelson.
	   Morgan, a 51-year-old licensed optometrist who has never
practiced in that profession due to his success as a golfer, is
trying to become the first senior to win three majors in one year
since Jack Nicklaus accomplished the feat seven years ago.
	   The last player on the PGA Tour to win three majors in one year
was Ben Hogan, who did so in 1953.
	   ``I always anticipated being fairly successful on the Senior
Tour,'' said Morgan, who became eligible on Sept. 25, 1996 when he
turned 50. ``I think I've exceeded somewhat my expectations. I've
won more tournaments and more money than I anticipated.
	   ``It is amazing, isn't it? I only had seven wins on the regular
tour, but I had something like 21 seconds and 23 thirds. I think my
ability to score is a lot better today than it ever was. My short
game and putting are probably better than ever. They'd better be
around here.''
	   Two of Morgan's seven PGA Tour victories came in the Los Angeles
Open _ at Riviera in 1978, and at Rancho Park five years later.
	   His first victory on the Senior Tour came in the Ralphs Senior
Classic at the nearby Wilshire Country Club in the fall of 1996,
and he repeated that victory last year.
	   ``The area has been very good to me,'' he said. ``I hope that
continues.''
	   Morgan has recorded four of his 11 wins on the Senior Tour this
year, and has finished in the top 10 in 10 of the 15 tournaments in
which he's played.
	   He has earned dlrs 1,325,793, and is averaging 69.80 strokes per
round _ second in both categories behind the 53-year-old Irwin, who
has also won four tournaments and has earned dlrs 1,735,250 while
averaging 68.58 strokes per round.
	   Irwin has played in 13 tournaments this year and never finished
lower than a tie for fifth.
	   Both Morgan nor Irwin believe several players could win this
week over the 6,906-yard (6,284-meter), par-71 Riviera Country Club
course.
	   ``Oh, I don't know about that,'' Morgan said when asked if he
thought it was a two-man race. ``I think both of us have played
this golf course very well in the past, but I think there are a lot
of players who could win.''
	   With that, Morgan mentioned Nelson, Raymond Floyd and Jack
Nicklaus as possible contenders.
	   When Irwin was asked if he thought he was the favorite, he
replied, ``I don't like to ever consider myself in that vein. I
simply like to think that I have been playing very well, as these
statistics indicate, but those are numbers.''
	   Morgan, Irwin and Dave Stockton are the only three players in
the field who have ever won tournaments at Riviera.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in graf 4 that Halliday has Quaker background &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Denis J. Halliday, the U.N. relief
coordinator for Iraq who had criticized U.N. sanctions and had
pushed to get more humanitarian aid for Iraqis, is leaving his post
at the end of September.
	   Halliday's spokesman, Eric Falt, said in an interview Wednesday
that Halliday's dissatisfaction with the relief effort and the
sanctions program was probably among his reasons for leaving.
Nevertheless, he was the longest-serving U.N. relief coordinator in
Baghdad, a spokesman noted.
	   A statement said he was leaving Baghdad for personal reasons. A
successor hasn't been named.
	   Halliday, an Irish national with a Quaker background, took over
as the humanitarian coordinator in Iraq in September of last year,
trying to balance the needs of the Iraqi people with the harsh
sanctions imposed on Iraq by the Security Council.

New Vancouver radio station: all-whale, all the time
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) _ After years of preparation,
the world's first all-whale radio station made its public debut
Wednesday.
	   Dozens of spectators gathered at the Vancouver Aquarium to hear
the noises of killer whales tapped by a microphone on the seabed
200 kilometers (120 miles) northwest of Vancouver.
	   Though the initial broadcast was marred by the sound of a boat's
motor, project organizers predicted better things to come.
	   They are hailing ORCA FM _ formally known as CJKW 88.5 _ as a
scientific milestone that will teach scientists and the public
about the giant whales off British Columbia's shores.
	   There are thought to be about 750 killer whales in various
groups along the British Columbia coast.
	   The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission
approved the project, which isn't expected to compete with
commercial stations.
	   Instead, ORCA FM will be audible around Robson Bight on
Vancouver Island's northeastern coast. The area is considered one
of the world's best locations for finding whales.
	   It will also be transmitted by landline to the Vancouver
Aquarium. There people will hear the sounds of whales detected
within a 15-kilometer (9-mile) radius of a microphone planted 50
meters (165 feet) below the ocean surface.
	   Eventually, the aquarium hopes to make the noises available on
the Internet.
	   ``This is live, real-time. If it's a whale, it's a whale,'' said
aquarium executive director John Nightingale. ``There's nothing
artificial about it.''
	   Wednesday's launch culminates 10 years of work for whale
researcher John Ford.
	   ``We went through all the same steps as if we were starting a
rock station,'' says Ford. ``It was a lot of fun fitting the forms
we had to fill out into a whale category.''
	   Ford can't speak orca yet, but can broadly decipher whale
sounds.
	   ``If they're happily foraging _ getting food _ they make excited
versions of their dialect calls,'' he said.
	   ``When they're socializing, mating, they make all kinds of
squeaks and squawks.
	   ``When they are resting, they make funny little vocal
snoring-type sounds.''

Dolphins guard paralyzed following car crash
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MIAMI (AP) _ Miami Dolphins guard Randy Wheeler faces surgery
Thursday to stabilize spinal injuries suffered when he was
paralyzed in a car crash.
	   Wheeler is being treated by Dr. Barth Green, co-founder of the
Miami Project to Cure Paralysis and a world-renowned expert on
spinal injuries. Green said Wednesday that Wheeler is a
quadriplegic but has some movement and sensation in his right arm
and hand.
	   Wheeler, 23, remained in serious condition at Jackson Memorial
Hospital. More will be known about his prognosis after surgery, a
hospital spokeswoman said.
	   The operation will allow Green to sit up and begin
rehabilitation. He has agreed to participate in paralysis research
programs.
	   Wheeler was driving in the rain Monday from his home in
Hartsville, South Carolina for the start of training camp when his
sport-utility vehicle slid off Interstate 95, overturned and hit a
tree near Palm City.
	   He was wearing a seat belt, but suffered cervical and thoracic
spinal fractures. His mother, aunt and uncle flew from South
Carolina to be with him at the hospital. The 315-pound (142-kg)
Wheeler played at South Carolina and was on the Dolphins' practice
squad last season.

Shepard's historic 6-iron was out of this world
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   Somewhere among the craters on the moon, two pieces of history
are waiting to be found. Alan Shepard hit the only golf shots in
outer space, but he never bothered to find them.
	   Along with his legacy as the first American in space and the
fifth to set foot on the moon, Shepard will forever be remembered
as the astronaut who used a 6-iron to hit a golf ball so far that
it would have made Tiger Woods proud.
	   Shepard, who died Tuesday at age 74, attached the head of a
Spalding 6-iron to a tool used to scoop up lunar soil during the
Apollo 14 mission in 1971.
	   As if a man on the moon wasn't captivating enough, Shepard
delighted America during the televised exploration when he took out
what he called a ``little white pellet,'' plopped the ball onto the
sandy surface, and gave it a whack.
	   ``A little sand trap shot,'' he said.
	   On Wednesday, President Bill Clinton paid tribute to Shepard's
shot.
	   ``He lived every golfer's dream, taking his 6-iron and hitting
the ball, in his words, for `miles and miles,''' Clinton said.
	   No one is really sure how far it traveled. Shepard was only
trying to demonstrate the moon's gravity, which is one-sixth that
of Earth.
	   ``Being a golfer, I thought if I could just get a club up there
and get it going through the ball at the same speed, that it would
go six times as far as it would have gone here on Earth,'' Shepard
said in 1991.
	   He actually hit two balls on the moon.
	   The first ball was not struck as purely as Ben Hogan's 1-iron
into the 18th green at Merion in the final round of the 1950 U.S.
Open, golf's most memorable snapshot.
	   In fact, Shepard's first out-of-this-world shot resembled more
of a duff.
	   ``It got more dirt than ball,'' Shepard told Mission Control.
	   ``That looked like a slice to me, Al,'' replied a flight
controller.
	   Shepard said later that the first ball landed in a small crater,
referring to it as a rather unique hole-in-one. He then played
another one and called it a day.
	   The shot was not entirely spontaneous. Shepard recalled how he
practiced in a space suit before Apollo 14 blasted off to make sure
there would be no safety problems.
	   ``The deal I made with the boss was that if things were messed
up on the surface, I wouldn't play with it, because we would be
accused of being too frivolous,'' Shepard recalled.
	   ``But if things had gone well, which they did, then the last
thing I was going to do, before climbing up the ladder to come
home, was to whack these two golf balls _ which I did, and I folded
up the collapsible golf club and brought it back with me.''
	   The golf club is on display at the U.S. Golf Association
headquarters in Far Hills, New Jersey.
	   ``The balls are still up there,'' Shepard said in the 1991
interview. ``Perhaps the youngsters of today will go up and play
golf with them some time, 25 or 30 years from now.''
	   Shepard added in 1996:
	   ``Probably, I'm a hell of a lot more famous for being the guy
who hit the golf ball on the moon than the first guy in space.''

 &UR; Eds: Contains items on beach volleyball heat, Walder arrested,

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The city is gripped by a heat wave, and when
beach volleyball opened its Goodwill Games' run Wednesday the
players knew the only thing cool would be their sunglasses.
	   The temperature at the side of the sand court in Central Park
was 110 degrees as the No. 1 U.S. team of Karch Kiraly and Adam
Johnson defeated Canada's John Child and Marke Heese 15-8.
	   ``The sand was extra hot and my feet were burning,'' Heese said.
``I couldn't stand still to start my approach.''
	   Kiraly, a 38-year-old from Southern California who had played in
all kinds of weather, said the conditions were not too severe.
	   ``It's definitely hot out there, but it's nothing that we're not
used to,'' he said.
	   The volleyball beach, in what is usually an ice-skating rink,
features some of the best scenery at the Goodwill Games, set
against a backdrop of trees and skyscrapers.
	   ``It's a beautiful setting,'' said Martin Conde of Argentina,
who teamed with Esteban Martinez to defeate Paul and Mark Laciga of
Switzerland 15-6. ``I never thought I would play in Central Park in
my life.''

year-round, is 57-3, and on Wednesday it met another group that's
used to winning _ the U.S. women's national soccer team.
	   ``The girls are absolutely thrilled,'' Wyckoff coach Bill Reed
said. ``These are their heroines. They have their posters up on the
wall. Some of the players on the team could aspire to be at this
level if they continue to work.''
	   The Torpedoes were on hand at Giants Stadium for a workout by
the national team, which is preparing for the Goodwill Games soccer
tournament that begins Saturday.
	   The young players collected autographs from many members of the
national squad, including star forward Mia Hamm.
	   Hamm, who led the U.S. women to an Olympic gold medal in 1996
and will be at center stage when the Women's World Cup comes to the
United States next year, said the chances of a U.S. women's
professional league remained uncertain.
	   ``We're told different things all the time,'' she said. ``One of
the things is let's see how successful this World Cup is. We're all
planning on it being a success. After that, I think it's vital to
ensure the level of play on the national team and the level of play
in the country.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; MEDALIST ARRESTED: &LR;  Erick Walder won the long-jump silver medal
at the Goodwill Games in New York. The next day, he was booked on
the misdemeanor charges stemming from an argument at the University
of Arkansas.
	   Walder was arrested Tuesday on charges of assault and
terroristic threatening for allegedly pushing traffic warden Robert
A. Gilbride twice in an argument June 12, police said.
	   Gilbride was trying to put a vehicle boot jack on Walder's car
when the athlete pushed him, according to university police
reports.
	   Walder apparently surrendered to the Fayetteville, Arkansas
Police Department after a warrant for his arrest was issued by the
city prosecutor's office.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Chuck Knoblauch, Darryl Strawberry and Jorge
Posada each homered and Orlando Hernandez won for the fifth time in
nine major league starts as the New York Yankees routed the Detroit
Tigers 13-2 Wednesday.
	   Hernandez (5-2) was staked to a 5-0 lead after two innings and
when the Tigers narrowed the gap to 5-2, Knoblauch hit a three-run
homer in the Yankees' third to make it 8-2.
	   Hernandez allowed seven hits in six innings, walking two and
striking out seven and also balked in the second run in the Tigers'
two-run third.
	   Tino Martinez drove in four runs with a double, single and an
RBI groundout.
	   Tony Clark's RBI double drove in Detroit's first run and sent
Bobby Higginson, who had singled, to third before Hernandez was
called for a balk with Luis Gonzalez at bat, scoring Higginson.
	   Hernandez then retired 11 of the last 14 Tigers he faced before
Darren Holmes worked the final three innings for his first save.

Twelve bombs explode outside banks in Medellin, one killed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 3-4 with rebel group claiming responsibility;
RAISES reference of warning call. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Twelve bombs went off outside banks in
Medellin early Wednesday, shattering windows, ripping into
automated teller machines and blowing off doors, police said.
	   A man suspected of setting at least one of the blasts was
killed, police said. The bombs went off at about 4:30 a.m. There
were no other reports of injuries.
	   A little-known group calling itself the Popular Liberation
Forces sent a statement to radio stations claiming responsibility.
``The poor cannot always be the victims of war and its tough
consequences,'' read the missive received by RCN, Caracol and
Radionet radio stations in Medellin.
	   The group said it acted with urban guerrillas of the National
Liberation Army, or ELN, Colombia's second-largest leftist rebel
group. Separately, a man claiming to be an ELN member called a
Medellin radio station Wednesday to claim responsibility for the
attacks.
	   Such bombings are common in Medellin, which hosted the world's
most powerful drug cartel in the 1980s and where violence has
become a feature of daily life.
	   The National Liberation Army took part in discussions with
Colombian civic leaders July 12-15 in Wuerzburg, Germany.
Authorities are hoping those contacts will lead to permanent peace
talks.
	   Colombia is home to leftist rebels, right wing paramilitary
fighters, and drug traffickers, and has one of the world's highest
crime rates.

Carlos says Ronaldo suffered epileptic fit before World Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Ronaldo suffered an epileptic fit hours
before the World Cup final, said Roberto Carlos, the striker's
roommate in France.
	   ``When I heard that it was just a convulsion, I thought it was
strange, since I had already heard from others, including doctors,
that it was an epileptic fit,'' Carlos said at a press conference.
The defender who plays for Real Madrid did not elaborate on the
difference between a convulsion and an epileptic fit.
	   Carlos said he had been waiting for an official announcement of
Ronaldo's condition before commenting on the subject. The cause of
the 30 to 40 second fit Ronaldo suffered just hours before the
World Cup final has been the subject of intense speculation here
even now, 10 days after Brazil lost 3-0 to France.
	   Doctors for both the national team and representatives of Inter
Milan, where Ronaldo plays professionally, have said exams, first
in France and then in Rio, show the 21-year-old striker to be in
perfect health.
	   ``The horrible way Ronaldo reacted, with his body all tense and
saliva in the corner of his mouth, leaves me unconvinced that it
was just a convulsion,'' said Carlos.
	   Carlos said that Fiorentina striker Edmundo also believed that
Ronaldo had suffered an epileptic fit. According to some reports,
defender Cesar Sampio had to pull Ronaldo's tongue from his throat
during the fit.

Eggen back as Rosenborg coach
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ After a one-year leave, Rosenborg's
successful coach Nils Arne Eggen signed a new three-year contract
with the club on Wednesday.
	   Eggen has led Rosenborg to victories over Real Madrid, Porto,
Olympiakos in addition to a 2-1 away victory against AC Milan in
the Champions League.
	   Since Eggen went on leave Jan. 1 1997, many clubs and national
teams have sought him as coach. Together with former Norwegian
national team coach Egil Olsen, he was wanted as the new coach for
Scottish Celtic.
	   ``I've been thinking a lot, and after assessing offers from
Norwegian and international clubs, I have ended up with Rosenborg.
That's probably where I belong,'' Eggen told Norwegian news agency
NTB.
	   Assistant coach under Eggen, Trond Sollied, has been the head
coach in Rosenborg while Eggen has been away, and he has previously
said that he it is not an option to be a new assistant coach under
Eggen.
	   Players welcomed Eggen's return.
	   ``Nils Arne Eggen is and has been the best coach in Norway for
the last ten years. The players want him back so that we can take
another step in our development. However, we still want Sollied as
a part of the team,'' said Rosenborg captain Jahn Ivar ``Mini''
Jakobsen.

South African president says Brazil could be of help to Africa
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS last graf with 3 grafs on Mandela being in Argentina &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ South African President Nelson Mandela
said Wednesday that Brazil could be of great help to Africa in
resolving hunger and conflict affecting the region.
	   ``Brazil is the world's ninth-largest economy and has the
largest black population outside of Africa,'' Mandela said. ``I am
sure that Brazil is disposed to help with the problems of the
African continent. It has already been very active and present in
Mozambique and Angola.''
	   Mandela arrived here late Monday with his new wife Graca
Machael. They were wed on Saturday.
	   When asked if she liked Brasilia _ the nation's futuristic
capital _ as a place to pass the first days of her honeymoon,
Machael laughed and said: ``Is that a joke? We don't have time for
a honeymoon.''
	   Late Wednesday, the couple headed to Buenos Aires, Argentina, to
attend a summit meeting of the four-nation South American Common
Market, or Mercosur.
	   The meeting will be held Thursday and Friday in Ushuaia, 1,945
miles (3,300 kilometers) south of Buenos Aires.
	   Mandela is scheduled to address the Congress on Thursday before
he flies to Ushuaia.

UN Environment chief calls for emmissions limit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ With scientific reports saying that 1998
is shaping up to be the hottest year on record, the U.N.
Environment Program urged world policymakers Wednesday to take
action to limit emissions of carbon dioxide and greenhouse gases.
	   Policymakers can cut carbon dioxide emissions while saving money
by encouraging energy producers and consumers to use the most
efficient technologies available, the program said in a statement
said.
	   Developed countries are responsible for the bulk of past and
present emmissions and must take the lead in limiting them, the
statement said. Developing countries, it urged, should adopt
cleaner energy technologies.
	   ``Record warming and severe summer heat waves in the U.S.,
India, China and elsewhere are a wake-up call,'' said Klaus Toefer,
UNEP's executive director. ``We cannot afford to wait several years
for the Kyoto Protocol to enter into force before making
significant emissions cuts.''

have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   ORAHOVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The Serb mayor of this
battle-wrecked town condemned his Albanian neighbors Wednesday for
secretly aiding an attack by separatist Albanian rebel fighters.
Both sides accused each other of atrocities in the five-day battle
for Orahovac in central Kosovo, which ended before dawn Wednesday
when the last of the Kosovo Liberation Army fighters withdrew.
Thousands of Albanian refugees from the town of 20,000 fled over
northern hills to KLA-controlled territory, and hundreds of Serbs
sought refuge in nearby rural villages. Many people hid in
basements, emerging to find Serb police in control. ``We were
trying to maintain peace,'' said Mayor Andjelko Kolasinac, standing
on the steps of town hall. ``But they were planning all along. And
it happened in a split second.'' (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ A U.N. delegation arrived quietly
Wednesday in Algeria on an unprecedented mission to shed light on
the years of massacres and bombings. Led by former Portuguese
President Mario Soares, the two-week inquiry is a major
breakthrough since Algeria had resisted international efforts to
investigate its internal affairs. Neither the six-member team nor
the government made any comment. The critical question is whether
the group will have full freedom of movement, and access to all
parties in the drama that has taken an estimated 75,000 lives since
1992. More than 50 people were killed over three days last week.
(ALGERIA-UN MISSION)
	   QUEZALTEPEQUE, El Salvador (AP) _ A third national guardsman
convicted of raping and killing four American churchwomen in 1980
strode from prison on Wednesday as church leaders worried that the
truth in the case may never be known. ``We lose a great opportunity
to make progress in justice and to know the historical truth,''
Gregorio Rosa Chavez, auxiliary bishop of San Salvador. The former
guardsman, Daniel Canales, left the prison north of San Salvador on
Wednesday morning. Outside the prison, Canales said that the
low-ranking guardsmen who committed the murders ``were executing
orders of superiors.'' Five national guardsmen were convicted of
kidnapping, raping and killing Roman Catholic nuns Ita Ford, Maura
Clark and Dorothy Kazel and layworker Jean Donovan on Dec. 2, 1980.
Three of those convicted have been released to ease prison
overcrowding. A judge declared two others ineligible due to
misconduct in prison. (EL SALVADOR-NUNS)
	   ROCHESTER, Minnesota (AP) _ King Hussein of Jordan is being
tested for lymphoma and is expected to remain at Mayo Clinic in the
United States for three more weeks, his physician said Wednesday.
Hussein disclosed the possibility of lymphoma in a letter to his
brother, Crown Prince Hassan, on Tuesday. The king wrote that an
``excised lymph node and symptoms all seem to point to lymphoma,''
or cancer of the lymphatic tissue. At the same time there could be
other reasons for the infection and related symptoms, the letter
said. Mayo Clinic doctors were waiting for results of tests done
Friday, and planned to begin chemotherapy if lymphoma was found.
Hussein was admitted to the Mayo Clinic on July 14 after suffering
from numerous spells of fever and cold sweats. (JORDAN-KING
HUSSEIN)
	   DENVER (AP) _ Scientists in Hawaii have turned out more than 50
carbon-copy mice using what is believed to be a more reliable
cloning technique than that used to create Dolly the sheep. The
scientific potential could be broad because mice are the
best-understood and most commonly used animals in biomedical
experiments. Having genetically identical copies of the same animal
could speed research in fundamental biology and virtually every
branch of medicine and drug development. The University of Hawaii
scientists, reporting in Thursday's issue of the journal Nature,
describe their work as ``the first reproducible cloning of a mammal
from adult cells'' extending at least three generations. They said
it is a marked improvement over the method used to make Dolly,
which other laboratories so far have failed to duplicate. (US-MOUSE

Upper Chamber votes to overturn lowering of age of consent for gay
</HEADLINE>
sex

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Gay campaigners jeered and shouted abuse at
members of the House of Lords after Britain's upper chamber voted
against lowering the age of consent for homosexuals from 18 to 16.
	   Members of the unelected chamber voted Wednesday 290 to 122 in
favor of an amendment overturning the more powerful House of
Commons, which last week voted by 333 to 129 to make 16 the age of
consent for homosexuality as well as heterosexuality, three decades
after gay sex between adults ceased to be a crime in Britain.
	   The House of Lords cannot veto legislation and its powers are
restricted to delaying legislation passed by the elected House of
Commons, although by detailed criticism of government bills, it can
damage the government's legislative agenda.
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair and leaders of opposition parties
support lowering the age of gay consent, which brings Britain in
line with most other European Union nations. Polls suggest that the
majority of Britons oppose the measure.
	   A combination of independent peers, Conservatives and religious
leaders argued that the government's plans posed a health risk to
young people, and could result in the age of consent lowered to 14
and pave the way for gay and lesbian marriages, as some homosexual
campaigners want.
	   ``Do we really want to open the floodgates of suffering even
further than they are already?'' said Britain's chief rabbi, Lord
Jakobovits, speaking in the debate about the threat of AIDS to
young people.
	   Gay lobby groups and Labor lawmakers said they believed
parliament would eventually lower the age of consent for gays to
16.
	   ``There comes a point where if the Commons is representing the
will of the people, the Lords ... has to accept it,'' said Baroness
Mallalieu.
	   After the vote, the government said it was ``considering its
position,'' although it may decide to accept the Lords' rejection
rather than threaten its legislative timetable by scheduling a
Commons' vote to overrule it.
	   Gay activists demonstrated outside parliament and chained
themselves to railings outside the House of Lords. Police freed
them with bolt cutters.

New movie changes Nasser's image to seeker of peace with Israel
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo NY199 &QL; 
 &UR; By SALAH NASRAWI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ To the West, the late Egyptian President
Gamel Abdel Nasser was a dangerous radical. To most Arabs, he was a
hero who fought three wars with Israel and would never accept the
existence of the Jewish state.
	   But a new film in Egypt presents Nasser in a different image: a
man who actively sought peace with Israel but whose good intentions
were rejected by Israeli leaders.
	   That view may mesh with Egypt's later peace treaty with Israel,
but Egyptian film critics are scoffing at the revisionist image.
The film ``Gamel Abdel Nasser,'' which opened last week, was still
being denounced Wednesday by Cairo newspapers.
	   In the state-run daily Al-Gumhouriya, critic Samir Farid called
the movie ``a hasty film by a reckless director (who) has not done
his homework'' about Nasser's life.
	   Ali Abu Shadi, Egypt's top film critic, complained in the weekly
Al-Ahram Al-Arabi about the movie's ``many historical faults.''
	   ``You cannot make the drama superior to the facts of history,''
he said.
	   The film has even been criticized by Nasser's family members,
who say it misrepresents his political beliefs.
	   But Syrian director Anwar Kawadri insists he has made an honest
film that goes beyond the popular image of the Egyptian leader, who
was a hero to the Arab masses until his death of a heart attack in
1970.
	   ``People did not understand Nasser. Deep in his heart he was a
man of peace, and in my film I try to explain how we have misjudged
him,'' Kawadri said.
	   In the 90-minute film, Kawadri presents the view that it was
Israel that missed the chance for early peace with the Arabs
through its hesitation and mistrust of Nasser.
	   In one shot, Nasser cordially chats with an Israeli officer
during cease-fire talks after the 1948 Middle East war. Nasser says
he does not hate Jews but rejects Israel's expulsion of
Palestinians from their land.
	   Kawadri also presents Nasser _ whom British newspapers compared
to Hitler after his 1956 seizure of the Suez Canal _ as a subtle
statesman whose decisions to make war on Israel were forced on him
by hard-line colleagues.
	   ``We could have spared a lot of blood, tears and miseries if the
Israelis and the Western leaders would have listened to Nasser, who
wanted a just and honorable peace,'' Kawadri said.
	   While Kawadri's Nasser runs counter to the popular image, others
also have argued that the Egyptian leader was less hard-line than
generally believed.
	   A U.S. Quaker, Elmore Jackson, has written of being the
middleman in an Egyptian peace overture to Israel during Nasser's
days in the 1950s. Jackson wrote that after months of secret
contacts, Israel's David Ben-Gurion rejected the peace move just
before Israel, France and Britain invaded Egypt in the 1956 Mideast
war.
	   Likewise, Jordan's King Hussein has said that Nasser urged him
to negotiate peace with Israel after the Arabs' disastrous defeat
in the 1967 war. Nasser gave a pragmatic reason for negotiating _
to get back the West Bank and east Jerusalem, which remain at the
heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
	   Kawadri's film is the second about Nasser in two years, but it
is not drawing the large audiences that the highly nationalistic
``Nasser 56'' did on the 40th anniversary of Egypt's takeover of
the Suez Canal.
	   Some critics say this is because the new film is too pedantic.
Others charge that Kawadri's movie smacks too much of a political
agenda _ to draw an analogy between Nasser and Syrian President
Hafez Assad as misunderstood men of peace.

	   PAILIN, Cambodia (AP) _ Chan Youran isn't running for office in
Cambodia's parliamentary vote Sunday, but he intends to cast a
ballot. The irony is that he was a leading member of the ousted
Khmer Rouge, which didn't permit free elections during its
five-year reign of terror.
	   ``I'd like to say I am not a communist, not at all,'' Chan
Youran said in a pre-election interview. ``I am 100 percent
nationalist.''
	   Chan Youran served as the Khmer Rouge ambassador to many
countries, including China, where the creed of cultural revolution
originated. As many as 2 million Cambodians were executed or died
from starvation, forced labor and illness before a Vietnamese
invasion toppled the Khmer Rouge in 1979.
	   Chan Youran disavows any responsibility for one of this
century's worst genocides. He portrays himself as a human-rights
advocate who ``never condoned the class struggle and violation of
human rights'' after the Khmer Rouge came to power in 1975.
	   He and other so-called revolutionaries will avail themselves of
the vote in Pailin, the Khmer Rouge bastion that became one of the
first major outposts to end years of guerrilla warfare and make
peace with the Cambodian government in 1996.
	   With no other choice, they're trying on the clothing of
moderates.
	   Chan Youran and four colleagues _ Thiounn Thieounn, In Sopheap,
Mak Ben and Kor Bun Heng _ defected last month from the last
hard-line faction still fighting. Their defections came after the
Khmer Rouge stronghold in Anlong Veng was overrun by government
troops in April and they advocated ending the war.
	   The defeat was accompanied by the death of Pol Pot, infamous
leader of the Khmer Rouge regime, of a purported heart attack,
after he was ousted in a bloody purge last year by Tak Mok, known
as ``the butcher.''
	   The defectors were greeted with open arms by the government of
strongman Hun Sen, who has spent years denouncing the Khmer Rouge
but found that the best way of beating them was to let them join.
They were invited to Phnom Penh and received hugs and dinner at his
home.
	   At a press conference, Chan Youran quoted Hun Sen as saying,
``Let bygones be bygones.''
	   While many Cambodians may have been dismayed by the welcome, the
defectors appear to be living a peaceful life, as does Pol Pot's
foreign minister, Ieng Sary.
	   They live at the heavily guarded home of Ee Chhean, Pailin's
governor, and are driven in a pickup truck to a customs office for
interviews.
	   They are registered to vote and ready to enjoy the fruits of
citizenship _ they've already applied for passports.
	   ``We are happy to take part in the elections,'' said Kor Bun
Heng, the former senior spokesman for the Khmer Rouge. ``Ballot is
better than bullet.''
	   The Khmer Rouge agreed to, then boycotted, U.N.-sponsored
elections five years ago. Kor Bun Heng, one of the group's
representatives in the capital at the time, said the decision was
made by Pol Pot.
	   ``There was historic mistake from the leaders of the resistance
movement,'' Chan Youran said. ``We, intellectuals, regret that. The
leaders have betrayed the movement.''
	   When asked why it took so long to come around, Chan Youran asked
the age of his Cambodian interviewer.
	   ``I am 35,'' answered the journalist.
	   ``I am 65. See the difference?'' Chan Youran said, with
laughter.
	   The defectors _ who had medical and legal degrees from European
universities _ clearly see a future for themselves in Cambodian
political life. They strongly hint that someday, they'll be back in
Phnom Penh at the center of things.
	   ``We are ordinary citizens. But, I cannot rule out any political
activities in the future,'' Kor Bun Heng said. ``I still believe in
my patriotic ideals, I haven't abandoned them yet. But we have to
be in the mainstream like the Cambodian people in the whole
country.''

Julich posing threat to Ullrich
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous; Note Thursday is rest day in Tour de France &QL; 
 &UR; BY SALVATORE ZANCA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PLATEAU DE BEILLE, France (AP) _ The rest day in the Tour de
France is coming up at the right time for Bobby Julich.
	   After all, he is challenging defending champion Jan Ullrich on
all fronts, beating him in the last three stages.
	   ``For now I am really empty,'' the 26-year-old Julich from
Glenwood Springs, Colorado said. ``This rest day is really welcome.
	   After 11 stages of the Tour, Julich is trailing Ullrich by just
71 seconds in the overall standings.
	   More impressive has been Julich's showing since losing to a
heavily favored Ullrich in Saturday's time trial.
	   In Sunday's stage Julich was 25th to Ullrich's 28th.
	   Then came the two stages in the Pyrenees - Julich was fourth
Tuesday and third Wednesday with Ullrich coming in eighth both
times.
	   Ullrich did most of the work and Julich was along for the rider
until the final stretch and Ullrich relaxed a little at the end,
giving up seven seconds of his overall lead.
	   Julich didn't mind.
	   ``I was really happy. To come in like that with the big
favorites was unhoped for,'' Julich said. ``But I regret not taking
the chance to attack.''
	   Thursday is a rest day before the Tour starts up again with a
222-kilometer (137-mile)n Monday.
	   Julich may try something there.
	   ``I got to lay it on the line in the Alps one or two days to see
if I can win this thing,'' Julich said.
	   He was 17th in his first Tour last year. He showed he has
improved by taking third in the time trial and fourth in the
prologue as well as staying with Ullrich in the two stages in the
Pyrenees.
	   ``I felt very very comfortable today,'' Julich said. ``I felt
stronger at the top. On a climb like today you have to be a little
cautious and that's what I did today.''
	   Italian Marco Pantani took the 11th stage, once again breaking
away from the Ullrich group up the final climb up 1,750 meters
(5,720 feet) in the Pyrenees.
	   Roland Meier of Switzerland, who had built up a lead of more
than five minutes during the day, was second, 1:26 behind Pantani
with Julich coming in third, 1:33 behind with Ullrich in eighth,
1:40 back.
	   Ullrich had a flat with about 20 kilometers (12.5 miles) left in
the stage and was helped back to the pack with his teammates.
	   Pantani said he held off, honoring an unwritten rule not to take
advantage of a situation like that.
	   ``I wanted to attack earlier but waited for Ullrich to come
back,'' Pantani said.
	   Once back, Ullrich worked his way through and then started
increasing the pace to catch Meier.
	   As in Tuesday's stage, Ullrich had to do the work while the
others followed.
	   Also as in Tuesday, Pantani took off in an attempt to gain
ground. Ullrich let him go, knowing that Pantani trailed by nearly
five minutes in the overall standings.
	   Pantani caught Meier with about six kilometers (4.5 miles) left
and won his fifth stage of the Tour de France, all in mountain
stages including two in l'Alpe d'Hueow the race is wide open and
there are still spectacular things to come.''
	   Pantani and Laurent Jalabert of France are 3:01 behind Ullrich
and trail Julich too.
	   After a cool and foggy day on the first day in the mountains
Tuesday, the hot temperatures returned with the heat well above 30
C (86 F) on the route.
	   The heat took away one of the favorites when Abraham Olano of
Spain, the world road champion in 1995, dropped out with about 75
kilometers (46 miles) remaining in the 170-kilometer (105-mile) leg
from Luchon to Plateau de Beille.
	   Olano was sixth in the overall standings and second in the
opening prologue.
	   It was the second day in the mountains but the top climber of
the last four years, Richard Virenque, and his Festina teammates
are expected to be heard soon in a court in Lyon to explain their
involvement in the doping scandal.
	   Festina's director Bruno Roussel admitted a practice of
supplying illegal drugs with medical supervision to improve
performances which prompted Tour officials to exclude the
top-ranked Festina team the rest of the way.
	   The doctor for the banned Festina team, Erik Ryckaert, contended
that his riders were ordered by their manager to pay for
performance-enhancing drugs.

Official: Tsunami-hit area may be abandoned so bodies can rot away
</HEADLINE>

saying Sissano area may have to be sealed off and abandoned &QL; 
 &UR; By ROHAN SULLIVAN &QC;

<TEXT>
	   SISSANO LAGOON, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ The threat of disease
from thousands of rotting corpses is so dangerous that the
government may have to evacuate the survivors of the deadly
tsunami, a senior official said Thursday.
	   More than 1,200 people are officially confirmed dead after a
tsunami smashed villages on the north coast last Friday, but
another 6,000 villagers are missing and feared dead, their bodies
hidden in the impenetrable mangrove swamps.
	   Crocodiles, dogs, pigs and sharks are feasting on the rotting
corpses.
	   Prime Minister Bill Skate told The Associated Press on Tuesday
that the government was considering sealing off the Sissano lagoon
area and evacuating all survivors.
	   Only 2,500 to 3,500 people have been found alive out of a total
population in this part of West Sepik province estimated at 8,000
to 10,000 before the disaster.
	   ``I think the government will have to go with that decision and
just abandon the area completely and allow the bodies to decay,
allow the bodies to just rot off,'' Andrew Kumbako, the local
member of Parliament who is also the vice finance minister, said
Thursday.
	   After letting nature take its course, he said, Australian
engineers could enter the area and determine if water supplies will
be safe enough to ever allow resettlement.
	   The area may have to be sealed off and resettlement banned, he
told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio.
	   Makeshift villages are already springing up on higher ground
around Sissano lagoon.
	   That is the area that bore the brunt of the force of the three
23-foot (7-meter) tsunami waves that crashed ashore last Friday
evening. The waves _ triggered by a magnitude-7 undersea earthquake
_ arrived within minutes, making it impossible to warn coastal
villages.
	   Australian military doctors who have set up a military hospital
at Vanimo, a nearby administrative town that was not hit by the
waves, are already facing a second wave of infections among
survivors whose wounds were untreated for days.
	   Doctors performed four amputations of gangrenous limbs Wednesday
night on villagers who only emerged from the jungle after being
driven to seek help for their festering wounds.
	   ``I just don't know when it's going to end,'' said Australian
medical officer Les Robert-Thompson.
	   Medical teams from Australia, New Zealand and Japan are working
to save survivors brought into Vanimo by relays of helicopters.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will make a brief
stop in Papua New Guinea next Wednesday to discuss how the United
States can help the relief effort.
	   She will stop over en route from a meeting of Southeast Asian
and Pacific foreign ministers in Manila, the Philippines, to talks
in Sydney, Australia with her counterpart there.
	   Pacific leaders meeting in Fiji, members of the Melanesian
Spearhead Group, will discuss Thursday how they can offer help to
Papua New Guinea. Fiji has already offered to send 50 medics to the
disaster site.

Rising female violence not cut and dried
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Dollar amounts are in Canadian dollars
 &UR; By The Associated Press

<TEXT>
	   OTTAWA (AP) _ A gang of girls swarmed into a Nanaimo British
Columbia home and severely beat up a teenager.
	   Three months later, two girls were injured in a brawl with
knives in Winnipeg.
	   A month before, Victoria teen Reena Virk died after being beaten
by a swarm of mostly girls.
	   All this within the last eight months.
	   Crime statistics released Wednesday by Statistics Canada show
that violent crime by females was on the upswing in 1997, bucking a
downward trend in virtually every type of crime in Canada.
	   But experts say the significance of the trend is debatable.
	   On the one hand, Statistics Canada says while the rate of
violent crime among youth in general dropped in 1997 by two per
cent, the rate among females went up by five. The number of females
charged with violent crime has been increasing twice as fast over
the last decade as the number of males, the agency reports.
	   Young girls actually account for less than four per cent of
total charges for violent crime, or about one per cent more than
they did five years ago _ hardly a big jump, said Sibylle Artz of
the University of Victoria.

 &UR; Landmark treaty cost more than $300 million
	   VANCOUVER (AP) _ Final cost for settling the first modern-day
treaty in British Columbia history will total more than $300
million, the province's chief negotiator said Wednesday.
	   Details of the 500-page agreement between the Nisga'a Tribal
Council and the British Columbia and federal governments were
released at a news conference.
	   The details were disclosed two weeks ahead of the planned Aug. 4
initialling ceremony, because the provincial Liberal Opposition
tabled portions of the agreement in the legislature Tuesday.
	   Provincial negotiator Jack Ebbels said the total cash cost of
the treaty will be $311 million.
	   But it doesn't include the estimated cost of the land given to
the Nisga'a in the Nass Valley in northwestern British Columbia,
estimated at $109 million.
	   Also not included is the cost of ``foregone revenues,'' which is
compensation for companies who have resource interests in the
designated treaty area. Those costs have not been calculated but
will be split 50-50 between the British Columbia and federal
governments.
	   The agreement must be ratified by the three parties and Nisga'a
president Joe Gosnell conceded there are no certainties with his
people.

 &UR; Court strikes down parts of Ontario school law
	   TORONTO (AP) _ A judge threw Ontario's education funding system
into disarray Wednesday by striking down parts of a sweeping school
law as unconstitutional.
	   The law _ known as Bill 160 _ gives the province complete
control over financing of schools, and that strips away the right
of Roman Catholic boards to levy taxes, said Justice Peter Cumming.
	   But he added a twist by saying public boards have no similar
rights under the Constitution and aren't protected from the impact
of the law, raising the bizarre prospect of the minority separate
school boards being permitted to tax, but the majority public
system unable to do so.
	   Education Minister Dave Johnson announced almost immediately the
government will appeal the ruling and will ask the judge to suspend
the decision pending the appeal.
	   While the impact of the ruling is unclear, the 104-page judgment
also puts into question a $6-billion swap of service costs with
municipalities that hinged on the province taking over a bigger
chunk of education spending.
	   ---
 &UR; Bare breasts OK in Saskatchewan, judge rules
	   REGINA (AP) _ Women in Saskatchewan now have the freedom to go
topless like their sisters in Ontario, thanks to a court ruling
Wednesday.
	   Provincial court Judge Eugene Lewchuk acquitted Kathleen Rice,
42, and Evangeline Godron, 64, of creating an indecent exhibition
by baring their breasts in public.
	   In a brief decision, the judge said the women didn't violate
community standards when they sunbathed topless in a downtown
Regina park on hot afternoon last August.
	   Lewchuk accepted a 1996 ruling by the Ontario Court of Appeal
that affirmed the right of women in that province to doff their
tops.
	   However, the judge warned that the acquittal doesn't mean women
can bare their breasts in all circumstances.
	   Anyone who offends community standards, for example by acting in
an erotic manner or going topless in the presence of children,
could still be charged, he said.

 &UR; Pocklington says he'll leave Edmonton for greener pastures
	   EDMONTON (AP) _ Peter Pocklington says he's had it with Edmonton
and the way he's been treated for years, especially since a bitter
Gainer's strike in 1986.
	   The former owner of the Edmonton Oilers said he is planning to
sell off his remaining assets in the city and head for ``greener
pastures.''
	   His abrupt announcement came in the wake of a Court of Queen's
Bench ruling that effectively ordered the financier to turn his
holdings in two companies over to receivers KPMG.
	   The receivers were called in by the Alberta Treasury Branches
after Pocklington defaulted on a deal to pay off more than $55
million he owes the provincially owned bank.

	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
held a secret late-night meeting with an Israeli negotiator and
insisted he would hold off further talks until Israel accepts an
American peace proposal, a Palestinian official said.
	   In the meeting at his Gaza City headquarters late Wednesday,
Arafat told Israeli negotiator Yitzhak Molcho that he welcomed
American mediation to solve the impasse, said the senior
Palestinian official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   In Washington, however, White House spokesman Mike McCurry said
the United States was not about to intervene again. The sides
``ought to try harder'' to solve their differences.
	   The secret meeting was arranged by Jordan's Crown Prince Hassan,
said the Palestinian official, who added that talks announced by
Israel for Thursday would not take place.
	   Avi Beniahu, spokesman for Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai, had said Mordechai would meet with either Arafat or his
deputy Thursday.
	   Following the Arafat-Molcho meeting, however, a senior
Palestinian official told The Associated Press in Gaza that there
would be no meeting.
	   ``The Palestinian position remains the same. We want the
Israelis to commit to the American proposal,'' the official said.
	   The Palestinians ended the first direct talks in months between
the sides Wednesday, complaining that Israel had failed to bring
new ideas to the table and had refused to accept an American peace
initiative.
	   The United States had arranged the talks after announcing it had
exhausted efforts to win agreement for its plan, which calls for an
Israeli troop pullback of 13 percent in the West Bank.
	   The talks were widely seen as the last chance for Israel and the
Palestinians to reach such an agreement for some time.
	   Israel had contacted American and Egyptian officials since the
talks began three days ago, looking for mediation. And in Jordan, a
spokesman for Crown Prince Hassan said a deal had been brokered to
renew talks.
	   ``Crown Prince Hassan produced an acceptable solution to both
sides,'' his spokesman Ayman Safadi said in Amman, Jordan. Hassan
met earlier Wednesday with Arafat's deputy, Mahmoud Abbas.
	   Earlier, Mordechai said American involvement could help bring
about a much-needed summit between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and Arafat to try and resolve the disputes.

Cuban president to visit Barbados July 31 to Aug. 2
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRIDGETOWN, Barbados (AP) _ Fidel Castro will visit Barbados as
part of a Caribbean tour next week, the Barbadian government
confirmed Wednesday.
	   The Cuban president and his foreign minister, Roberto Gonzalez,
will lead a delegation that will visit from July 31 to Aug. 2, the
Barbados Government Information Service said.
	   Castro will join Guyanese and North Korean officials in
dedicating a memorial to 73 people killed in the 1976 bombing of a
Cubana airliner near Barbados. The airplane was carrying Cubans,
North Koreans and Guyanese.
	   The government said Castro had scheduled meetings with Prime
Minister Owen Arthur, a Barbados-Cuba friendship association and a
group of business leaders. On Aug. 1 he will participate in a
celebration commemorating the abolition of slavery in Barbados.
	   Governor-General Sir Clifford Husbands, who represents Britain's
Queen Elizabeth II in Barbados, will also host a reception for
Castro, the statement said.
	   Castro will visit Grenada and Jamaica during the same trip. He
is to visit the Dominican Republic Aug. 21.
	   Cuba has been moving to strengthen ties with its Caribbean
neighbors and has struck new economic development deals with
several countries in the last year. It is lobbying for membership
in the Caribbean Community and Cariforum trade groups.

Researchers strive to make everyday life easier for Alzheimer's
</HEADLINE>
patients &QL; 
 &UR; By JENIFER CHAO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ With no cure for Alzheimer's
disease in sight, researchers are striving to find new ways to
improve the lives of patients and the people caring for them.
	   Some 2,500 experts have gathered at an international conference
in Amsterdam this week to discuss Alzheimer's disease, which is
characterized by the degeneration of brain cells. It is the most
common form of dementia.
	   Dutch and Japanese researchers are testing nonpharmacological
strategies like bright light therapy and electrostimulation to help
alleviate sleep disorders like agitation and restlessness at night.
	   Sleep disorders can hit Alzheimer's patients and their families
particularly hard since a family member often must provide care
during the night, when the patient cannot sleep.
	   ``We are not aiming for a cure ... (but) we can improve the
quality of life for both the patient and the caregiver,'' said Eus
van Someren, one of the experts investigating the experimental
treatments.
	   Studies by Van Someren and others focus on the so-called
circadian rhythm, or the body's internal daily clock, which is
controlled by a part of the brain's hypothalamus known as the
syperachiasmatic nucleus.
	   Van Someren and other researchers believe that Alzheimer's may
affect SCN cells, disrupting a patient's internal clock and
trigging erratic sleeping patterns.
	   But the clock can be ``reactivated and stimulated'' by light and
electrical stimulation, Van Someren said.
	   In Dutch and Japanese trials, patients suffering from
Alzheimer's disease and dementia showed a more stabilized circadian
rhythm and improved sleep after artificial light was added to their
environment for one month.
	   But researchers acknowledged that experiments conducted so far
have been short-term and small in scale, with only dozens of
patients.
	   Dr. Linda Teri from the University of Washington School of
Medicine in Seattle said the research needs work but shows promise.
She said the research provides ``another avenue of intervention and
gives people options to treat these problems.''
	   Other presentations at the conference were devoted to developing
drug therapies to treat the disease, although most are far from
trials using human patients.
	   Researchers at the University of South Florida reported that
estrogen hormone replacement therapy might offer some protection
against the disease.
	   ``This is very promising for the increasing number of aging
women who are at risk for Alzheimer's,'' said Dr. Tom Thomas of the
University of South Florida School of Medicine in Tampa, Fla.
	   In the United States, Alzheimer's disease affects around 4
million adults, most of them over 65. Experts say more than 100,000
deaths are attributed to the disease each year, making it the
fourth-leading cause of death in the United States.

	   AHIHUD, Israel (AP) _ In the cool twilight of a cave once home
to prehistoric humans, biologist Stephen Weiner ran a sediment
sample the size of a pinhead through an infrared spectrometer.
	   Numbers flashed on the screen of his computer _ protected
against bird droppings by thick plastic sheets _ and within seconds
a printer spewed out a spectrum with the sample's mineral
composition.
	   Weiner, a professor at Israel's Weizman Institute, is a pioneer
in on-site analysis. His method examines the decay of wood ash in
sediment to reveal the conditions for preservation of bone and
other matter. The technique helps guide American, French and
Israeli archaeologists digging in the Hayonim Cave, or Cave of the
Doves, in northern Israel.
	   ``This is probably the only excavation in the world where we
monitor in real time what is coming out of the ground,'' said
Weiner, who also has participated in digs in China and Greece.
	   The scientists were searching for remains that would shed light
on the lifestyle of the Mousterians, humans who lived some 200,000
years ago in caves in the area in groups of no more than two dozen.
	   The dig has already yielded one of the Middle East's largest
collection of animal bones, including gazelle tarsals and the
scorched shells of tortoises the Mousterians roasted on an open
fire.
	   While biblical digs usually yield a large number of artifacts,
from pottery to coins to ancient ruins, those studying the dawn of
mankind have only little to work with; a human skeleton, if they
are very lucky, stone tools, bones.
	   Hayonim Cave, located near the village of Ahihud, five miles
(eight kilometers) east of the Israeli port city of Acre, is the
size of a three-story apartment building. It sits in limestone
hills covered by Mediterranean scrub vegetation and olive groves.
	   During a recent visit, two archaeology students braving the
blistering noon sun stood at the mouth of the cave, shaking large
sieves to separate soil from rocks. Inside the cave, an iron
gangway traversed the floor from front to back.
	   To the left, a steep ladder descended into a large hole, the
Mousterian dig. Students sitting on foam pads loosened the soil
inch by inch, using hammers, chisels and small brushes.
	   To the right, remains of the more recent Natufian period, dating
back 13,000 years, were uncovered, including stone hearths and
shelters with stone walls arranged in a circle.
	   Weiner's laboratory stood in the back of the cave, next to a
large work table where archaeo-zoologist Mary Stiner from the
University of Arizona at Tucson examined tiny bone fragments.
	   Stiner said the Mousterians lived by gathering wild plants and
hunting boar, gazelles, fallow deer and tortoises.
	   The Mousterians used every part of the animals, skinning them
with flint tools and scraping the marrow out of the bones. Stiner
said she found hammerstone marks and fractures on the bones,
indicating they were broken to get at the marrow.
	   Like other peoples living in the middle Paleolithic era, the
Mousterians did not have pots or pans. Blackened bits of tortoise
shell in Stiner's collection are evidence that the catch of the day
was roasted on the open fire.
	   The head of the dig, Harvard University anthropologist Ofer
Bar-Yosef, said Hayonim Cave, like several others in the area, was
inhabited off and on, with the Mousterians often on the move in
search of food.
	   Bar-Yosef first looked at the cave in 1964 and returned in 1992
in hopes of finding evidence for the widely accepted assumption
that modern humans evolved in Africa about 300,000 years ago and
spread from there across the world.
	   On their way to Asia and Europe, the migrants would have had to
pass through the narrow corridor of what is now Israel.
	   ``We need to know what happened between 100,000 and 300,000
years ago. No one has found any modern fossils from this period in
this part of the Middle East,'' said Bar-Yosef, whose project is
sponsored by the National Science Foundation in the United States,
the Weizman Institute and the French Foreign Ministry.
	   Earlier this month, the probability of finding a human skeleton
appeared very low. After analyzing nearly 100 sediment samples from
the dig's floor, about 16 feet below the original surface of the
cave, Weiner was pessimistic about the chances of finding any
bones, either animal or human.
	   Unable to bear the suspense whether the poor conditions would
persist, the team drilled one foot farther down, skipping thousands
of years of human evolution.
	   Weiner then analyzed the new samples and came up with good news;
conditions were more favorable for finding bone remnants.
	   Where once archaeologists would have had to forge ahead on faith
alone, they now had a much clearer idea of where the project was
going.
	   ``It's like skipping a chapter ahead in a book,'' Weiner said.

Tongue scraping the latest rage

<TEXT>
	   BROOKLINE, Massachusetts (AP) _ Forget the mouthwash and mints
to get rid of bad breath. More and more people seem to be gaga over
the tongue scraper, a plastic implement with plenty of gag
potential.
	   The scraper is sort of a cleaning tool for the tongue, mucking
up icky bacteria. That's good, though what gets scraped out isn't
pretty.
	   ``It's startling,'' Dr. Marc Ehrlich says. ``You think your
mouth is fairly clean and you kind of wipe this off and it looks
like something you cough up when you've got a cold.''
	   Tongue scrapers are not new. Dentists will tell you people in
ancient Egypt, China and India were scraping their tongues long
before someone coined the term halitosis, the clinical word for bad
breath.
	   Somehow, the concept never really took off in the United States.
But a public increasingly concerned about banishing bacteria and
more vigilance over oral hygiene are giving the scraper a boost.
	   Tongue scraping, in fact, has become the rage among Hollywood's
elite.
	   ``We're doing one right now,'' said Dr. Douglas Hauck, a Beverly
Hills dentist who wouldn't divulge the client's name. He did say
the patient can be seen on TV every Monday night.
	   The idea behind tongue scraping is simple. The bulk of oral
bacteria _ and especially the bad-smelling sulfur compounds that
can cause chronic bad breath _ reside on the tongue. In particular,
on the hard-to-reach back of the tongue.
	   ``The tongue's like a shag carpet. It's got all these pits and
fissures,'' said Brian Murray, a brand manager for BreathRx, a
tongue scraper kit made by Discus Dental Inc. in Los Angeles.
	   Dentists have long encouraged patients to brush their tongues to
reduce bacteria. Problem is, many people gag when they try to get
the toothbrush way back there _ if they can reach back there at
all.
	   Long and thin, the tongue scrapers have plastic serrated edges
that are designed to slide along the tongue, raking bacteria away.
A few quick scrapes, in long motions from the back forward once or
twice a day, is enough to keep bacteria in check.
	   The result, dentists say, is better breath. And maybe better
overall health.
	   Studies are now beginning to show that the health of the mouth
can be related to the health of the rest of the body, said Dr.
Matthew Messina, president-elect of the Cleveland Dental Society.
	   Some dentists have begun peddling the products to their
patients.
	   Ehrlich began dispensing scrapers to his Brookline clients a few
weeks ago, complete with a demonstration from a hygienist. He sells
a ``tongue conditioning'' gel that's promoted as a lubricant and
bacteria-fighter for dlrs 6.
	   Some of the products are available only through dentists. Others
can be bought for a few dollars in drug stores.
	   But is tongue scraping _ ``tongue deplaquing'' in industry terms
_ really necessary? Opinions among dentists are varied.
	   Some see it as purely cosmetic, a boost for freshening breath.
After all, Americans already spend an estimated dlrs 1 billion on
over-the-counter breath products.
	   Others said they would like to see scraping become a daily
ritual, an addition to the one-two punch of brushing and flossing.
	   ``I really feel we're just raising oral hygiene to another
level,'' said Dr. Richard Price, a Newton dentist, professor at
Boston University's dental school and spokesman for the American
Dental Association. ``And what the heck? Why not? It takes just a
second.''

	   BAINBRIDGE ISLAND, Washington (AP) _ Like any 19-year-old, Todd
Stabelfeldt dreams big. Someday, he wants to own a 1972 Dodge
Charger and host a morning radio show, fixing people's problems
with deft advice between songs.
	   But Stabelfeldt faces far more serious obstacles than other teen
dreamers. He is paralyzed from the shoulders down, the victim of an
accidental gunshot wound 11 years ago.
	   As he got used to life in a motorized wheelchair he operates by
nudging a joystick with his chin, Stabelfeldt flirted with the idea
of studying to become a psychiatrist. But he wasn't sure how he
could achieve his goal, since options are limited for
quadriplegics.
	   Then he discovered DO-IT, an award-winning University of
Washington program that links high-school students interested in
math and science with the computer technology that helps them
overcome their disabilities.
	   Stabelfeldt credits DO-IT _ Disabilities, Opportunities,
Internetworking and Technology _ with changing his life. His
computer-aided independence helped him obtain a degree in computer
programming, move out of his parents' house and land a job with a
Bainbridge Island company that writes medical software.
	   ``People just do not understand. They have no comprehension of
disability,'' he said in a recent interview in his office. ``For
disabled people, DO-IT is a wonderful, wonderful asset. It gives
you resources. It gives you friends.''
	   By this fall, 136 students from 30 states and Canada will have
participated in DO-IT's summer scholars programs at the University
of Washington. More than half have gone on to college or technical
schools, and at least 40 have found work, according to a program
survey.
	   In addition, more than 1,000 students have learned Internet and
college preparation skills during DO-IT presentations at disability
camps for youths in Washington, Minnesota and Colorado.
	   However, the program's primary funding source _ a dlrs 1 million
grant from the National Science Foundation _ expires this year and
cannot be renewed. The legislature kicked in dlrs 500,000 this
summer, but that money was earmarked only for disabled students in
Washington state.
	   Sheryl Burgstahler, the program's director at the university,
said she's talking to Microsoft and other computer-related
companies in hopes of landing a national sponsor that will help
DO-IT expand, perhaps internationally.
	   ``It would make sense for a company like that to adopt us.
Technology really does provide opportunities for people that aren't
there without it,'' she said.
	   Stabelfeldt is just one of a number of the program's success
stories.
	   A blind student received a bachelor of science degree and got a
job at Weyerhaeuser Co. Another blind student received a NASA space
grant scholarship and is finishing her studies at the UW. A student
with a debilitating skin disease also is studying at the UW and
figures to find work in the computer field.
	   Founded in 1992, DO-IT recruits high school students with
disabilities into science, engineering and mathematics programs and
careers, with an emphasis on recruiting to the UW.
	   Students come with a variety of disabilities, including
blindness, hearing impairment, mobility impairments, learning
disorders, brain injuries and other health impairments.
	   Participants in the scholars program are loaned computers
equipped with ``adaptive technology'' _ special hardware and
software that makes cyberspace accessible to the disabled. The
computers can be operated using the head, finger, knee or mouth,
and can provide information through Morse code or Braille.
	   Participants spend two weeks at the university attending labs
and lectures to get a feel for college life. They also meet with
faculty and students, many with disabilities themselves, to learn
how technology is making it easier for them to pursue degrees and
careers.
	   The program received a 1997 Presidential Award for Excellence in
Science, Mathematics and Engineering Mentoring.
	   Stabelfeldt learned about the program while he was in
rehabilitation at Children's Hospital in Tacoma after the shooting
that paralyzed him.
	   He applied for one of 20 positions in the DO-IT scholars program
and was accepted. Over the next few years, DO-IT loaned him about
dlrs 10,000 worth of computer equipment. He says the program staff
also helped him come to grips with his disability and build his
self-esteem.
	   Since he doesn't have the use of his hands, Stabelfeldt
maneuvers a long, hollow tube called a mouthwand across an
electronic pad. He types by pointing the wand at letters on the
computer screen, and blows into the wand to make it click like a
computer mouse _ one breath for a single click, two breaths for a
double-click.
	   The hardest part, he said, wasn't learning how to use the new
technology. It was changing his attitude about being disabled.
	   ``I didn't want to be paralyzed. There was one other disabled
guy in town. He was a quad. But I didn't want to be associated with
that,'' said Stabelfeldt, who grew up in a small town north of
Olympia.
	   ``When I attended DO-IT, that all changed. I met 40 other gimps
_ that's what I call them. I realized, hey, man, they're cool.
They're real people, too.
	   ``They were fun. When you get together, you become sort of a
team.''
	   Stabelfeldt recently filmed a commercial for Microsoft, which
wants to promote ``universal'' software that helps make cyberspace
more accessible to the disabled. He joked about moonlighting as an
actor. ``I could be on `Friends,''' he said with a chuckle. ``They
need more disabled people.''
	   Still, he hasn't given up on his ultimate dreams. He keeps a
picture of a 1972 Dodge Charger on his computer's screen-saver. And
he still wants that morning radio show.
	   ``I want to be a success, a big success. You know, so people
say, `You met Todd Stabelfeldt,''' he said. ``And I will be there
someday.''

Study: Much of antidepressants' effect just psychological boost
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Some 75 percent of the benefit a typical patient
gets from antidepressants is just the psychological boost of
getting treatment, a controversial analysis of drug studies
concludes.
	   The rest may be from the pharmacological effects of the pills,
or represent still more of the psychological boost, called the
placebo effect, the study says.
	   The idea of a placebo effect is well accepted, but its reported
strength ``will be surprising to many people,'' said psychologist
Irving Kirsch of the University of Connecticut at Storrs. He and
another psychologist present their analysis in the online journal
Prevention and Treatment, published by the American Psychological
Association.
	   A note from the editors said the study used ``clearly arguable''
statistical methods to compare how well antidepressants worked
versus placebo pills in 19 studies, but that several reviewers
thought the analysis had ``considerable merit.''
	   Kirsch said the results shouldn't make people stop taking
antidepressants if the pills help. Researchers should study the
psychological mechanism behind the placebo effect and try to use it
for treatment, he said.
	   Dr. Donald F. Klein, a Columbia University psychiatry professor,
disagreed with the analysis and conclusions in a commentary. He
also said that while an antidepressant might not perform much
better than a placebo in mildly depressed people, the difference
can be large in severely depressed patients.

 &UR; Study: Seals use whiskers to sense other animals
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Seals can detect fish in murky water by using
their whiskers to sense tiny water movements, according to
researchers who studied a harbor seal that was blindfolded and
wearing earphones.
	   With its vision and hearing blocked, the seal sensed waterborne
signals from a vibrating ball. But when the scientists also applied
a wire mesh muzzle that impaired whisker movements, the seal lost
that ability.
	   While other aquatic animals have been known to have such
motion-sensing systems, the new report is the first to describe it
in marine mammals, the researchers from the University of Bonn in
Germany said.
	   The seal indicated that it sensed the water movement from the
ball by removing its head from an underwater loop. It then got a
fish reward.
	   It was able to sense extremely weak water movements, much less
than the disturbance caused by a nine-inch swimming fish, the
scientists said. They reported the work in the July 16 issue of the
journal Nature.
	    &UR; ___
 &UR; Marijuana-like substance in body may lead to new painkiller
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ A substance in the body that mimics marijuana
can quench pain when it acts outside the brain, suggesting a new
class of painkillers, a mouse study suggests.
	   Anandamide is produced in the body, and it pushes the same
chemical buttons in the brain that marijuana does to produce the
drug's effects. The new work shows that anandamide, and a chemical
cousin called PEA, can suppress pain by pushing other chemical
buttons in tissues outside the brain.
	   So drugs that push these buttons might suppress pain without
causing the side effects of drugs that act in the brain and spinal
cord, like morphine, researchers said. The work is reported in the
July 16 issue of the journal Nature by Daniele Piomelli of the
University of California at Irvine, and others
	   It's not yet clear what kind of pain such drugs might target,
Piomelli said in an interview.
	   The work shows that mammals have a way to reduce pain at its
very origin, he said. The study found that anandamide and PEA are
naturally present in rat paw skin.
	   Each suppresses pain by binding to structures called receptors
on the surface of cells, with each substance binding to a
particular kind of receptor, the researchers found. A drug that
simultaneously binds to both kinds of receptor might be a useful
painkiller, the researchers said.
	   ___
 &UR; `Electronic ink' shows promise for changeable signs
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Scientists have developed an ink that alternates
between white and black in response to an electric field, which may
allow for signs that change their message.
	   Eventually, the technique might lead to disposable television
screens, electronic wallpaper and even books that can be changed
electronically, one expert said.
	   The ink consists of clear microscopic spheres filled with a dark
dye and tiny white particles. The particles move in response to an
electric field, and when they cluster on the side of the sphere
that faces the viewer, that sphere appears white. Otherwise, it
appears dark.
	   By laying out a field of these particles and turning each the
appropriate color, images can be produced. In the July 16 issue of
the journal Nature, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology's Media Laboratory show what the letter ``K'' looks like
when made with the ink.
	   The approach seems cheaper and more mechanically flexible than
competing technologies, Robert Wisnieff of the IBM-Thomas J. Watson
Research Center in Yorktown Heights, New York, says in an
accompanying commentary. While it might be useful in things like
street signs in the near future, it could eventually move into more
demanding applications like disposable TV screens, he said.

Researchers strive to make everyday life easier for Alzheimer's

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ With no cure for Alzheimer's
disease in sight, researchers are striving to find new ways to
improve the lives of patients and the people caring for them.
	   Some 2,500 experts have gathered at an international conference
in Amsterdam this week to discuss Alzheimer's disease, which is
characterized by the degeneration of brain cells. It is the most
common form of dementia.
	   Dutch and Japanese researchers are testing nonpharmacological
strategies like bright light therapy and electrostimulation to help
alleviate sleep disorders like agitation and restlessness at night.
	   Sleep disorders can hit Alzheimer's patients and their families
particularly hard since a family member often must provide care
during the night, when the patient cannot sleep.
	   ``We are not aiming for a cure ... (but) we can improve the
quality of life for both the patient and the caregiver,'' said Eus
van Someren, one of the experts investigating the experimental
treatments.
	   Studies by Van Someren and others focus on the so-called
circadian rhythm, or the body's internal daily clock, which is
controlled by a part of the brain's hypothalamus known as the
syperachiasmatic nucleus.
	   Van Someren and other researchers believe that Alzheimer's may
affect SCN cells, disrupting a patient's internal clock and
trigging erratic sleeping patterns.
	   But the clock can be ``reactivated and stimulated'' by light and
electrical stimulation, Van Someren said.
	   In Dutch and Japanese trials, patients suffering from
Alzheimer's disease and dementia showed a more stabilized circadian
rhythm and improved sleep after artificial light was added to their
environment for one month.
	   But researchers acknowledged that experiments conducted so far
have been short-term and small in scale, with only dozens of
patients.
	   Dr. Linda Teri from the University of Washington School of
Medicine in Seattle said the research needs work but shows promise.
She said the research provides ``another avenue of intervention and
gives people options to treat these problems.''
	   Other presentations at the conference were devoted to developing
drug therapies to treat the disease, although most are far from
trials using human patients.
	   Researchers at the University of South Florida reported that
estrogen hormone replacement therapy might offer some protection
against the disease.
	   ``This is very promising for the increasing number of aging
women who are at risk for Alzheimer's,'' said Dr. Tom Thomas of the
University of South Florida School of Medicine in Tampa, Fla.
	   In the United States, Alzheimer's disease affects around 4
million adults, most of them over 65. Experts say more than 100,000
deaths are attributed to the disease each year, making it the
fourth-leading cause of death in the United States.

	   ORAHOVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb and ethnic Albanian officials
have each accused the other side of atrocities in the five-day
battle for Orahovac in central Kosovo that ended with a rebel
retreat.
	   Thousands of Albanian refugees from the town of 20,000 fled over
northern hills to KLA-controlled territory, and hundreds of Serbs
sought refuge in nearby rural villages. Many people hid in
basements, emerging to find Serb police in control and several
red-brick houses charred and smoking, their roofs blown off by
mortar fire.
	   ``We were trying to maintain peace,'' said Mayor Andjelko
Kolasinac, standing on the town hall steps. ``But they were
planning all along. And it happened in a split second.''
	   By late Tuesday, Serb police had fought their way to the center
of the hillside town, followed by refugee and aid agencies
searching for victims of the worst fighting in five months of
ethnic conflict between Serb forces and the Albanian rebels.
	   Reporters on a Serb-led tour of the town Wednesday found a few
dozen Albanians still hiding in their houses. Two men said only
hours earlier they had looked out a window to see 10 tractors being
loaded with bodies.
	   The claim could not be independently confirmed. But the Kosovo
Information Center, close to the province's ethnic Albanian
leaders, reported 52 Albanian civilians were killed, including some
dragged from their homes and shot.
	   The ethnic Albanian Committee for the Defense of Human Rights
called Wednesday for an international investigation.
	   ``Eyewitnesses talk of huge massacres conducted by the army, the
police and paramilitary units... The situation in Orahovac is
catastrophic,'' the group said.
	   ``We never expected this. We were in good relations until the
second it started,'' said the mayor, who claimed his Albanian
neighbors had secretly kept sandbags in their houses in preparation
for the attack.
	   Kosovo, a southern province in Serb-led Yugoslavia, has a
population of 2 million people _ 90 percent of them ethnic
Albanians who want independence from the oppressive regime of
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   Despite its Albanian majority, Orahovac has a Serb mayor because
Albanians have boycotted elections since Milosevic stripped the
province of its autonomy in 1989.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed since Milosevic cracked down
on Albanian militants in late February.

Dollar higher in Tokyo, Japanese stocks lower
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar rose against the yen in early
trading Thursday amid concern about the outcome of a race to choose
Japan's next prime minister. Tokyo stocks retreated.
	   The dollar bought 140.97 yen in early morning trading, up 0.31
yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo, but below its late New York rate
of 141.24 yen.
	   The yen came under pressure overnight in New York on indications
that Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi was likely to succeed outgoing
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, traders said.
	   Obuchi is seen as less aggressive on economic reforms than other
candidates in a ruling party race which will conclude in a vote on
Friday. Last week, Hashimoto announced his intention to resign.
	   The dollar was also buoyed by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan's remarks in congressional testimony Wednesday that the
U.S. economy can withstand the effects of the Asian financial
crisis.
	   In Tokyo trading early Thursday, however, the dollar's rise was
stemmed by profit-taking, traders said.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei
Stock Average fell 110.14 points, or 0.68 percent, to 16,182.92 in
the first 30 minutes of trading. On Wednesday, the average had lost
263.63 points, or 1.6 percent.
	   Stocks followed the dollar lower amid concern over an Obuchi-led
administration, traders said.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section declined 7.56 points, or 0.60 percent, to 1,250.29.
It fell 19.32 points, or 1.15 percent, the previous day.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond sank to 1.360 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.385 percent,
driving its price up to 110.68 yen from 110.50 yen.

Sainz, McRae have personal battle in world rally
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ Two of the favorites _ Carlos Sainz
of Spain and Scotland's Colin McRae _ will have a battle of their
own when the Rally of New Zealand starts Friday in Auckland.
	   Both Sainz and McRae have won New Zealand's round of the world
rally championship three times each, and a fourth win for either
would give the driver a record number of New Zealand victories.
	   Sainz and co-driver Luis Moya won the 1,500-kilometer (940-mile)
event between 1990 and 1992, while McRae and co-driver Derek Ringer
won the next three years.
	   McRae and his Subaru Impreza has been seeded first with Sainz
right behind in his Toyota Corolla.
	   They are followed by Finland's Tommi Makinen and co-driver
Riston Minnisenmaki in the Mitsubishi Lancer Evo V and the first of
the Ford Escort cars in the hands of Juha Kankkunen and co-driver
Juha Repo.
	   Despite arriving into totally opposite conditions from the
northern hemisphere summer after a six-week break, Sainz and McRae,
along with all the leading contenders, are familiar with New
Zealand conditions from previous visits.
	   In addition to the world championship, the rally also represents
the third round of the Asia-Pacific Championship.
	   There are drivers from Australia, Austria, Belgium, Finland,
France, Britain, Italy, Japan, Oman, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Turkey
and Uruguay vying with the 29 local entries in the four-day event.
	   The rally starts at Manukau City in South Auckland on Friday
with the Super Special Stage and is followed by three days and
nearly 400 kilometers (250 miles) daily of special stages through
the Maramarua Forest.
	   The rally ends at Clevedon, South Auckland on Monday. (djp)

Source: Floyd coming to Chicago Bulls
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NANCY ARMOUR &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ The Chicago Bulls are calling Michael Jordan's
bluff, hiring the coach he said he wouldn't play for: Tim Floyd.
	   The next move is up to Jordan.
	   Floyd will join the Bulls for a news conference Thursday. A
source told The Associated Press he is coming as coach, and ESPN
also reported that, according to an National Basketball Association
source, Floyd would become coach. WMAQ radio reported that Floyd
will be named director of basketball operations, with the coach to
be determined later.
	   Floyd arrived in Chicago on Wednesday morning, a few hours after
resigning at Iowa State.
	   ``I really can't comment any further right now,'' Floyd said.
The Bulls also refused to confirm Floyd's hiring.
	   Iowa State athletic director Gene Smith said Floyd was leaving
``to pursue another opportunity with the Chicago Bulls.'' Asked if
Floyd would be the coach, Smith said: ``You're going to have to ask
the Chicago Bulls about that.''
	   Floyd met with three players Wednesday morning, speaking with
the others by phone.
	   ``He just said I'm resigning to take another job, it's the
opportunity of a lifetime and I can't pass it up,'' said Tony
Rampton, a redshirt junior center and one of the players whom Floyd
met with personally.
	   As the Bulls' coach-in-waiting the past two years, Floyd's
hiring hardly comes as a surprise. But Jordan's dislike of Floyd is
no secret, either, saying just last week that he wouldn't play for
him.
	   ``I don't know Tim. I don't have anything against Tim Floyd,''
Jordan said July 16. ``To (play for him) is like starting all over
again and that's what I don't want to do. He may want to do that,
but I don't.
	   ``I don't condemn him. I don't condemn (the Bulls) for hiring
him,'' Jordan added. ``But I just don't feel that I want to start
with someone who doesn't really know me and doesn't know the way I
play the game of basketball.''
	   Jordan won't make an official announcement about his future
until the NBA lockout ends, and Floyd's hiring won't change that,
said David Falk, Jordan's agent. The NBA lockout bars the Bulls _
and their new coach _ from having any direct contact with Jordan.
	   Jordan did not react publicly to news of Floyd's hiring.
	   ``Michael needs to take his time to see how all of the pieces
fall into place,'' Falk said. ``We only have one piece of the
picture. It may be that piece is of sufficient weight to outweigh
everything else. Only time will tell.''

Lamorte, Maloney win Goodwill gymnastics golds

<TEXT>
	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ Americans Chris Lamorte and Kristin
Maloney captured Goodwill Games gold medals in the rings and
balance beam Wednesday night, giving the United States four
gymnastics golds.
	   Lamorte, from Lake Ronkonkoma, New York, about 50 miles (80
kilometers) from the Nassau Coliseum where the competition was
held, posted a 9.700 as the second competitor on the rings.
	   His score stood up through six more gymnasts, threatened but not
topped by all-around winner Ivan Ivankov of Belarus and Alexei
Bondarenko of Russia, who both posted 9.675 to share the silver
medals.
	   The result continued the Goodwill frustration for Bondarenko,
who now has won three silver and a bronze in this competition, but
continues to yearn for a gold.
	   ``It's the biggest win ever in my career,'' said Lamorte, who
celebrated his 24th birthday on Sunday, opening day of the games.
He had not competed since the 1996 world championships in Puerto
Rico.
	   ``I felt I was done after that,'' he said. ``Then the Goodwill
Games coming to New York gave me inspiration to come back. I never
thought I'd win. I can't describe how thrilled I am.''
	   Maloney, 17, was the last competitor on the balanced beam and
scored a 9.775 to overtake Olga Teslenko of Ukraine, who had 9.725.
The bronze went to Corina Ungureanu of Romania with 9.700.
	   ``Going last was nerve-wracking,'' Maloney said, ``especially
with everyone hitting so well in the beginning. I tried to stay
calm and not worry about the others.
	   ``When I finished, I didn't think I had won. I was surprised.''

	   GUAn widely blamed on death squads angered by his human rights
work.
	   The investigating judge, Isaias Figueroa Medina, said the Rev.
Mario Leonel Orantes Najera and Margarita Lopez were arrested
Wednesday at the San Sebastian church where they and Bishop Juan
Gerardi worked.
	   Gerardi was found dead April 26 in the garage of his home within
the church. He had been beaten to death with a cement block.
	   Gerardi was killed two days after he presented a report
denouncing human rights violations by the army and its
paramilitaries during Guatemala's 36-year civil war, which ended in
December 1996.
	   The slaying created an international outcry, and several
prominent human rights activists suggested the military or related
death squads might have killed Gerardi. The military has denied
involvement.
	   The spokesman for Guatemala's conference of bishops, Archbishop
Victor Hugo Martinez, expressed surprise at the arrest but said he
wanted to hear evidence before commenting.
	   Orantes, brought for questioning before a judge on Wednesday,
told a crowd of reporters that he was confused by the arrest.
``What I had least expected has happened,'' he said.
	   Earlier this month, church worker Ronalth Ochaeta, an associate
of Gerardi at the Archbishop's Office of Human Rights, said two
military officers were apparently involved in the killing.
	   Ochaeta did not give the names of the officers he said were
involved, nor did he specify how they were involved. He said only
that one of the officers once was a member of the Presidential
Guard.
	   The only man previously arrested in the case was Carlos Enrique
Vielman, 24. His attorney, Mario Alfonso Menchu, insisted that
Vielman was innocent and raised the suggestion that Orantes might
have been involved.

Prime minister adds to political instability with election comment
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAY LILLEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said
Thursday she had considered calling a snap general election because
of instability caused by Maori legislators threatening to break
away from her coalition government.
	   But New Zealand's leader immediately stressed her government was
now stable, and that no snap election was contemplated.
	   Shipley's comments came at a news conference where a governing
National Party legislator announced she would seek the mayor's job
in Auckland, the country's largest city, but would also remain in
Parliament.
	   The prime minister's coalition government retains power with a
one-vote majority.
	   Asked if she would be happy fighting a by-election if she had
needed to, Shipley surprised reporters with her reply: ``I've
seriously contemplated a general election in the last week, so it's
not a matter that is new to me in any particular way.
	   ``Since I contemplated it, this government is stable ... I can
still repeat to you that this government is stable.
	   ``The majority is quite clear and that the number of parties
that wish to continue to support us on confidence and supply are
also quite clear, and I think that constitutes political
stability.''
	   The five New Zealand First Maori legislators spent nearly a week
deciding whether to remain in the party and government after Maori
Affairs minister Tau Henare was dumped as the party's deputy
leader.
	   Shipley said it should not be a surprise that she considered a
snap election under those circumstances.
	   ``I don't think anybody will be surprised to know that last week
there were matters that led me to review whether or not an election
would be preferable.''
	   Political observers noted that the National Party, which Shipley
heads, is now lagging behind the opposition Labor Party in the
polls. An election at this point would see a center-left coalition
gain power in the country.
	   One observer described the prime minister's comments as a faux
pas since such talk often further destabilizes a government.

Cruises, concerts _ even the circus! _ all in a bid for a council
</HEADLINE>
seat &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Cruises, concerts, even a trip to the
circus! Such is the campaign this year for the coveted nonpermanent
Security Council seat.
	   The General Assembly in October will chose five new countries to
be represented on the 15-member council, the most important
decision-making body at the United Nations.
	   The five will replace Kenya, Portugal, Sweden, Costa Rica and
Japan, whose rotating two-year stints end.
	   The battle this year is fiercest within the regional group that
encompasses western Europe and North America, among others. That
group has two seats to fill but three candidates: Canada, the
Netherlands and Greece.
	   The other three seats were expected to go to the single
candidates put forth by other regional groups: Malaysia
representing Asia, Namibia for Africa and Argentina for Latin
America.
	   The campaign for the contested seats caught some attention after
Greece invited U.N. delegates for a weeklong visit for what some
diplomats here have dubbed a ``blue water pitch'' to get votes.
	   Greece's U.N. ambassador, Christos Zacharakis, denied the trip
was related to its council bid but was intended to promote an
``Olympic Truce'' under which warring nations would cease
hostilities during the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens.
	   Greece isn't the only one wining and dining the delegates,
though.
	   The Netherlands organized a moonlit cruise down the East River
last month and invited delegates to a performance in New York of
the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra of Amsterdam.
	   Canada also went the cultural route, offering tickets to
Canada's biggest attraction in New York this summer, the
Fellini-esque rock and roll circus Cirque du Soleil.
	   Despite the fun and games, the campaign is serious. Ambassadors,
foreign ministers, even heads of state get involved in lobbying.
	   Canada's pitch is that it plays a significant role in peace and
security around the world, and contributes to U.N. development,
human rights, social, economic and environmental programs, said
Andras Vamos-Goldman, a political affairs official in the Canadian
mission. Since the early 1960s, Canada has given dlrs 30.3 billion
in overseas development assistance, he said.
	   The Netherlands also touts its contributions to peacekeeping and
development, citing its spot as the second-largest donor for
development programs such as the World Food Program and UNICEF.
``We think we've got a good track record for all the things the
U.N. stands for,'' said spokesman Rob Zaagman.
	   Greece outlined it's pitch in the latest issue of Thesis, a
quarterly journal from the foreign affairs ministry. It cited its
participation in U.N. peacekeeping missions as well as its concern
about disarmament, the environment and human rights.
	   Greece has only been on the council once before, in 1952-53.
Canada has held the seat five times, most recently in 1989-90. The
Netherlands has been on four times, most recently in 1983-84.
	   Some believe Canada and the Netherlands have the greatest chance
of getting the two seats because of the dispute over Cyprus, the
Mediterranean island divided between Greek and Turkish Cypriots.
Having Greece on the council could further politicize the issue at
the United Nations.
	   Others cite the prominent Dutch and Canadian presence on
peacekeeping forces as well as the continued Dutch influence over
its former colonies.
	   There are 10 non-permanent seats on the council and five
permanent ones _ the United States, Britain, China, France and
Russia. Every year, five of the nonpermanent seats comes up for
election to a two-year term.

Japan's trade ministry to monitor Asian crisis from Singapore
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Ministry of International Trade and
Industry has set up a new post in Singapore to better collect
information on the ongoing regional economic crisis, a MITI
official said Thursday.
	   The activity will be carried out by a single trade ministry
staffer working out of the Singapore office of the Japan External
Trade Organization, a semi-governmental body under MITI's
supervision.
	   Kyoji Yoshino, an official with MITI's International Trade and
Administration Bureau, said the move was in line with JETRO's
recent steps to focus more attention on Asia.
	   Ministry monitoring activities were previously weighted in favor
of the United States and major European countries, he said.
	   In January, JETRO opened its first office in Myanmar to promote
trade with Japan.
	   JETRO maintains offices in major cities around the world and in
Asia.

Polls show front-runner widening lead in Japanese prime minister
</HEADLINE>
race
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to RAISE Kyodo poll &QL; 
 &UR; By JOJI SAKURAI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi stood far ahead of
his rivals Thursday in the race to replace Japan's outgoing prime
minister, with two major media polls showing him closing in on the
number of votes needed to win the ruling party's nomination.
	   A total of 413 ruling Liberal Democratic Party members will vote
Friday for a new party president, who is virtually assured of
becoming prime minister in a Parliament vote next week because the
LDP controls the powerful lower house.
	   The vote comes as a poll in a leading paper showed Thursday that
the LDP's approval rating is at an all-time low _ indicating the
winner of Friday's race will have to struggle to win public support
for his policies.
	   A survey of party members by Kyodo News released late Wednesday
showed Obuchi with almost 200 votes _ far away from his two rivials
and within striking distance of the 207 needed to sweep the
election in a first ballot.
	   The Nihon Keizai newspaper on Thursday showed Obuchi with a more
modest 180 votes. About 40 LDP members are still undecided, the
paper said, apparently giving Obuchi a chance to grab victory in
one round of voting.
	   If none of the candidates gains a majority in the first ballot,
a run-off will be held immediately between the two top finishers.
	   The Nihon Keizai followed surveys of LDP members released on
Wednesday by two major papers and a TV network showed the foreign
minister with around 170 votes.
	   The chances of Obuchi's challengers were looking increasingly
grim.
	   The Nihon Keizai survey indicated that Obuchi has already
secured twice as many votes as his nearest rival, maverick Health
and Welfare Minister Junichiro Koizumi who has about 90 committed
votes.
	   Former Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama, a favorite of the
financial markets, has captured the support of only about 60
eligible voters, the survey said.
	   The three are battling to succeed Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto, who announced last week he would resign to take
responsibility for the LDP's disastrous showing in July 12
elections for the upper house of Parliament.
	   The election was widely considered a rejection of the LDP's
handing of Japan's economy, which has fallen into its worst
recession in 50 years.
	   The mass-circulation Yomiuri newspaper reported Thursday that as
the three candidates lobby publicly for support, the approval
rating of the ruling party has sunk to an all-time low of 20.8
percent. That was down from 28.7 percent in June.
	   The support rating for the main opposition Democratic Party rose
sharply to its highest-ever 18.4 percent from 12.9 percent in June,
the Yomiuri said.
	   The Yomiuri's nationwide survey was conducted over the weekend
and included 1,990 responses from 3,000 polled. As is customary
with Japanese media polls, no margin of error was given.
	   Reflecting the sad state of the economy, a white collar jobs
fair held Wednesday in Tokyo featuring 31 small enterprises with
positions available was crowded with job seekers.
	   Hideo Sato, an official with the Tokyo Human Resources Data
Bank, a body set up by the Labor Ministry, said 447 unemployed
workers showed up. While many of the job seekers were middle-aged,
only half of the participating firms accepted interviews with those
aged 45 or older, he said.

Ruling party to fire Suharto's relatives from legislature
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's ruling Golkar party has
decided to fire seven of former president Suharto's relatives from
the nation's top legislative body, local newspapers reported
Thursday.
	   The daily Kompas said four of the ex-leader's children, along
with his half-brother, cousin and a daughter-in-law, would be
dropped from the People's Consultative Assembly.
	   The seven along with hundreds of others in the body were
appointed by Suharto before he quit as president in May. He
resigned following a wave of riots and protests against his 32-year
rule and his mishandling of a deep economic crisis.
	   Kompas said the decision was made at a meeting of Golkar
officials Wednesday night.
	   Reform of the assembly _ made up of 500 lawmakers and 500
government appointees _ is part of an agenda for democratic change
put in place by Suharto's successor President B.J. Habibie.
	   Habibie is a longtime friend of Suharto. Nevertheless he has
promised to wipe out corruption and nepotism that flourished under
his predecessor's reign.
	   Dozens of other assembly appointees accused of being chosen
because of family or business connections resigned earlier at the
party's request. However, the seven Suharto family members had
stated that they would not quit.
	   The assembly's main task is to elect a president and vice
president. It is scheduled to hold an extraordinary meeting in
November to prepare new political laws for parliamentary elections
in 1999. This will be followed by the selection of a new head of
state by another meeting of the assembly.
	   The decision to end the political activities of the Suharto
family follows a major reform push by Habibie within Golkar, which
has dominated Indonesia's tightly controlled political system since
the early 1970s.
	   Earlier this month, the party took a major step by electing a
new pro-reform chairman. It also severed ties with Suharto himself,
by dissolving its board of patrons, headed by the former president.
The body had been instrumental in deciding Golkar policy where
Suharto had a veto right.
	   In its latest decision, Golkar decided to replace Suharto's
children _ Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana, Bambang Trihatmodjo, Titiek
Prabowo, and Hutomo Mandala Putra _ as its representatives in the
assembly.
	   Golkar will also remove Bambang's wife, Halimah Bambang
Trihatmodjo, Suharto's half-brother Probosutedjo, and Suharto's
cousin, Sudwikatmono.
	   Rukmana, known as ``Tutut'' and once named by Suharto as social
affairs minister, and Bambang, had already been ousted from
Golkar's executive board.
	   Critics of Suharto say the former leader showered his family and
friends with privileges that allowed them to become super-rich and
influential.

Voice of boxing dead at 90
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Don Dunphy, a Hall of Fame announcer who for
decades was the voice of boxing, died Wednesday following heart
surgery. He was 90.
	   In a career of more than 50 years, Dunphy broadcast almost every
major sport, but it was boxing in which he made his biggest impact.
He broadcast over 2,000 fights and more than 200 title bouts,
including 50 for the heavyweight championship.
	   His first championship fight was the Joe Louis-Billy Conn fight
on June 18, 1941, a radio broadcast which drew a 56.2 rating.
	   He got the job when he won an audition conducted May 22, 1941 by
Gillette, the sponsor. Several would-be announcers were taped as
they called the Gus Lesnevich-Anton Christoforidis light
heavyweight title fight. In his 1988 book, ``Don Dunphy at
Ringside,'' he joked that he got the job because he was the only
one who could pronounce the fighters' names.
	   The Louis-Conn fight was the first of Gillette's weekly boxing
series that ran into 1960 and included fights featuring Rocky
Marciano, Jersey Joe Wolcott, Sugar Ray Robinson, Jake LaMotta,
Carmen Basilio, Rocky Graziano and Tony Zale.
	   Beginning in 1960, the fights were televised by ABC, with Dunphy
providing the voice.
	   He broadcast Muhammad Ali's first TV bout in 1961 and his last
one in 1981, and in the intervening years called the three epic
Ali-Joe Frazier bouts. His last major title fight was the Ray
Leonard-Thomas Hearns welterweight title bout in 1981.
	   Dunphy appeared in six movies _ as a boxing announcer, of course
_ including the 1981 Academy Award-winning ``Raging Bull.''
	   Dunphy was a member of the National Broadcasters Hall of Fame
and the World Boxing Hall of Fame, among the 10 such halls which
honored him. The International Boxing Hall of Fame made him a
member in 1993. In 1971, he received the James J. Walker Award for
Meritorious Service to Boxing.
	   Dunphy, a 1930 graduate of Manhattan College, is survived by his
wife of 56 years, Muriel, and two sons, Don Jr., a vice president
with ABC News, and Bob, an independent TV sports producer and
director.

Agassi, Courier advance at Legg Mason Classic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Andre Agassi continued his success against
David Wheaton on Wednesday night with a 6-4, 6-2 second-round
victory in the Legg Mason Tennis Classic.
	   Agassi has won five straight and is 6-3 lifetime against
Wheaton.
	   ``We've grown up together. ... There is no guesswork at what's
going to take place out there. Just go out and see who executes,''
Agassi said.
	   Agassi, a three-time Legg Mason champion, feasted on Wheaton's
second serve, winning 17 of 30 points.
	   Fresh from helping the U.S. Davis Cup team defeat Belgium over
the weekend, Agassi heads into the summer hardcourt season with
confidence.
	   ``I feel great about my game,'' Agassi said.
	   Agassi's Davis Cup teammate, Jim Courier, beat the heat and
Marcos Ondruska of South Africa.
	   The seventh-seeded Courier beat Ondruska 7-6 (7-3), 7-6 (8-6) in
an afternoon match played in muggy conditions with a heat index of
110 degrees.
	   ``It becomes a survival test more than anything else,'' Courier
said. ``Both of us were trying to keep the points short.''
	   Courier managed the conditions better than Wade McGuire.
	   McGuire was scheduled to resume his first-round match against
Jimmy Arias on Wednesday morning, but was unable to after being
hospitalized for six hours Tuesday night because of heat
exhaustion.
	   McGuire dropped the first set to Arias 6-4 Tuesday, but was
leading 5-2 in the second when a storm knocked out the power at the
FitzGerald Tennis Center.
	   Battling severe dehydration after the postponement, McGuire had
to be taken by ambulance to the hospital where he was given
intravenous fluids.
	   ``It was really a frightening experience for me,'' McGuire said.
	   Arias, who turns 34 next month, was playing his first tour event
in four years. Third-seed Wayne Ferreira cut Arias' comeback bid
short with a 6-1, 6-2 win Wednesday night.
	   ``I'm better at hitting the ball now, but physically I'm
worse,'' said Arias.
	   Arias, bothered by sore neck and ribs, wouldn't mind playing
another tournament this summer but his next stop is likely the
senior circuit.
	   The fans appreciated Arias' on-the-court friendly demeanor. The
same couldn't be said for ninth-seed Jeff Tarango, who lost to
Canadian Sebastien Lareau 7-6 (7-4), 6-2.
	   Tarango had a racquet-throwing temper tantrum in the second set
over line calls and directed a John McEnroe-like verbal assault on
the chair umpire just prior to set point.
	   Other seeds bounced Wednesday included eighth-seed Sjeng
Schalken of the Netherlands, who was beaten by qualifier Maurice
Ruah of Venezuela, and 10th-seed Andrew Ilie of Australia, who fell
to rising U.S. star Justin Gimelstob.
	   Defending tournament champion Michael Chang was scheduled to
play in the second round late Wednesday night.

Chinese gymnast unlikely to walk again
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous to UPDATE with experimental drug to be used in
treatment &QL; 
 &UR; By HAL BOCK &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ An experimental drug has been
approved to treat paralyzed Chinese gymnast Sang Lan, who suffered
a spinal cord injury at the Goodwill Games.
	   Dr. Vincent Leone, attending physician at the Nassau County
Medical Center, who treated Sang and expressed concern that she
might not walk again, said Wednesday that the drug Sygen was
approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat the
gymnast.
	   The drug is a synthetic protein designed for nerve damage and
structual repair in paralysis cases and has not received complete
clearance for use in the United States by the FDA. The Nassau
County Medical Center made an emergency application to obtain the
drug on a compassionate basis.
	   ``It has yet to prove completely successful,'' Leone said, ``so
I have an obligation to the patient to remain skeptical. But we're
willing to look at any kind of treatment to help Sang Lan walk
again.''
	   Earlier, Leone, an orthopedic spine surgeon, was asked if the
17-year-old would walk again.
	   ``It's fair to say that it would be unlikely,'' he said, adding
only certain parts of her spinal cord work.
	   ``That's better than a complete injury when you have permanent
paralysis. Her prognosis is still guarded. We expect some
improvement. The extent I cannot comment on. She's young with good
healing potential. It's too soon for a prognosis. ... It is a
devastating injury, a violent injury.''
	   Sang's condition remained unchanged on Wednesday.
	   ``She has no ability to move her legs,'' Dr. Brock Schnebel,
chief medical officer of the games, said Wednesday.
	   ``She has some function in her upper extremities consistent with
the level of her injury,'' he said. ``It was a tragic injury with
an unpredictable prognosis.''
	   Goodwill Games officials were making arrangements for Sang's
parents to fly from China to join their daughter. They were
expected to arrive Friday or Saturday.
	   Sang was hurt while practicing the vault before the start of
Tuesday night's competition. She was attempting a routine forward
vault when she lost control in the air and crashed head-first on
the mat. Emergency workers rushed to her and she was taken by
ambulance to the hospital.
	   Schnebel diagnosed the injury as a fracture-dislocation of two
cervical spine vertebrae.
	   ``She was placed in traction and her spinal column realigned,''
he said. ``There is no pressure on the cord at this time but there
is swelling on the cord.''
	   Sang faces spinal fusion surgery with implants to stabilize her
spine and prevent the bones from sliding into each other.
	   Schnebel said Sang, a junior high school student who was the
Chinese national champion in the vault last year, helped doctors as
they treated her.
	   ``She was brave and courageous,'' he said. ``She answered all
our questions and never complained, although this is a painful
injury to go through.''
	   Chinese officials who spent the night with the gymnast said the
accident occurred on a maneuver Sang had done many times and she
did not know what went wrong.
	   Tu Mingde, secretary general of the Chinese Olympic Committee,
said other gymnasts from his country would remain in the Goodwill
competition.
	   Peter Kormann, coordinator of the U.S. men's team, was across
the floor at the Nassau Colisum and saw the accident.
	   ``It was a warmup vault, not a high-level, difficult vault,'' he
said. ``She got a little too much rotation, a little too much
spring. It was not a difficult maneuver. It was a mistake. ''
	   When executed properly, the vault would have ended with Sang
landing on her feet. Kormann said she was caught in between and had
to make a split-second decision to fall on her back or try and
recover and get to her feet. She wound up in the middle.
	   ``In that situation, your body is in space and you don't feel
quite right,'' Kormann said. ``You feel there's something wrong.
It's just a feeling that a gymnast understands.''
	   Kathy Scanlan said there have been no catastrophic injuries in
competition during the four years she has been president of USA
Gymnastics.
	   ``We've had three serious ones in training, but none on the
vault,'' she said.
	   Scanlan did not question the safety of the arena or equipment.
	   ``Accidents do occur,'' she said. ``This was simply an accident,
not the result of unsafe conditions. What's terrible is that it
happened on something as simple as this. This was the simplest
thing she could be doing.''

Atler wins second Goodwill gymnastics golds
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with last two events &QL; 
 &UR; By HAL BOCK &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ American Vanessa Atler won her second
Goodwill Games gymnastics gold medal Wednesday night, capturing the
floor exercise after Americans Chris Lamorte and Kristin Maloney
finished first in the rings and balance beam.
	   That gave United States gymnasts five gold medals in the
competition, the country's best Goodwill performance ever.
Americans had won just three golds combined in the first three
Goodwill Games.
	   Atler, next to last in the floor rotation, scored 9.775 to
overtake Simona Amanar of Romania, who had 9.725. The bronze went
to Corina Ungureanu of Romania with 9.650. Atler, 16, won the vault
on Tuesday.
	   ``I'm excited, overwhelmed,'' she said. ``It's a great feeling
to win not just one but two golds.''
	   Atler used a new routine in the floor exercise, one coaches
plotted for her just one month ago. ``I loved it,'' she said.
``It's the first time I've enjoyed the floor.''
	   Lamorte, from Lake Ronkonkoma, New York about 50 miles (80
kilometers) from the Nassau Coliseum where 2,868 watched the
competition, posted a 9.700 as the second competitor on the rings.
	   His score stood up through six more gymnasts, threatened but not
topped by all-around winner Ivan Ivankov of Belarus and Alexei
Bondarenko of Russia, who both posted 9.675 to share the silver
medals.
	   The result continued the Goodwill frustration for Bondarenko,
who now has won three silver and a bronze in this competition, but
continues to yearn for a gold.
	   ``It's the biggest win ever in my career,'' said Lamorte, who
celebrated his 24th birthday on Sunday, opening day of the games.
He had not competed since the 1996 world championships in Puerto
Rico.
	   ``I felt I was done after that,'' he said. ``Then the Goodwill
Games coming to New York gave me inspiration to come back. I never
thought I'd win. I can't describe how thrilled I am.''
	   Maloney, 17, was the last competitor on the balance beam and
scored a 9.775 to overtake Olga Teslenko of Ukraine, who had 9.725.
The bronze went to Ungureanu of Romania with 9.700.
	   ``Going last was nerve-wracking,'' Maloney said, ``especially
with everyone hitting so well in the beginning. I tried to stay
calm and not worry about the others.
	   ``When I finished, I didn't think I had won. I was surprised.''
	   In the vault, Sergei Fedorchenko of Kazakhstan won the gold with
9.650. The silver went to Nikolay Krukov of Russia with 9.600, and
the bronze was won by Eric Lopez Rios of Cuba with 9.575.

Dollar higher in Tokyo, Japanese stocks edge up
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Nikkei's morning close, midday dollar and bond
prices &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar inched higher against the yen in
late morning trading Thursday amid concern about the outcome of a
race to choose Japan's next prime minister. Tokyo stocks bounced
back slightly.
	   The dollar bought 140.73 yen, up 0.07 yen from late Wednesday in
Tokyo but below its late New York rate of 141.24 yen overnight.
	   The yen came under pressure overnight in New York on indications
that Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi was likely to succeed resigning
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, traders said.
	   Obuchi is seen as less aggressive on economic reforms than other
candidates in a ruling party race which will conclude in a vote on
Friday. Last week, Hashimoto announced his resignation to take
responsibility for his party's setback in the July 12 elections for
the upper house of Parliament.
	   The dollar was also buoyed by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan's remarks in congressional testimony Wednesday that the
U.S. economy can withstand the effects of the Asian financial
crisis.
	   In Tokyo trading early Thursday, however, the dollar's rise was
stemmed by profit-taking, traders said.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, share prices opened on declines in
the yen and an overnight fall on Wall Street, in which the Dow
Jones industrial average closed at 9,128.91 on Wednesday, down
61.28.
	   But the market turned mixed by midday in quiet trading on active
short-covering. Many investors held back to await the outcome of
the LDP presidential election. The party head will become Japan's
prime minister because the ruling party has a comfortable majority
in the more powerful lower house.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 3.39 points,
or 0.02 percent, to 16,296.45 at the end of the morning session. On
Wednesday, the average had lost 263.63 points, or 1.6 percent.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section fell 1.14 points, or 0.09 percent, to 1,256.71. The
TOPIX closed down 19.32 points, or 1.15 percent, the previous day.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 1.350 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.385
percent, driving its price up to 110.75 yen from 110.50 yen.

Moody's says some Japan government debt could be downgraded
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RESTORES dropped overline &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Credit rating agency Moody's Investors Service Inc.
said Thursday that it has placed some Japanese government debt on
review for a possible downgrade.
	   The move could lead to a lower credit rating for Japan's
triple-A sovereign ceiling ratings for foreign currency-denominated
debt and yen-denominated debt.
	   ``The review is prompted by deep, structural problems in Japan's
economy that have defied conventional policy remedies and an
apparent lack of consensus among policy makers on a medium-term
strategy for implementing structural reform and for managing the
economy,'' Moody's said.
	   In April, the U.S.-based ratings agency changed its ``stable''
outlook for Japan's economy to ``negative,'' signaling that it
might lower its appraisal of Japan's ability to repay its debts.

Joyner-Kersee wins final heptathlon; U.S. sets relay record
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BERT ROSENTHAL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Track Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ All hail the Queen.
	   A tearful and relieved Jackie Joyner-Kersee, considered by many
the greatest female athlete ever, put on the most courageous
performance of her celebrated career Wednesday night, winning the
heptathlon at the Goodwill Games.
	   Crying before her final event and afterward, Joyner-Kersee ran a
gutsy 800 meters to win the two-day, seven-event competition with
6,502 points, the highest score in the world this year.
	   Not only was Joyner-Kersee in tears, so was her husband and
coach, Bob Kersee. When Kersee regained his composure, he came down
from the stands onto the field, sneaked up behind Jackie and poured
water over her, then warmly embraced his wife.
	   ``I can't believe I won,'' Joyner-Kersee said.
	   ``I can't believe it, either,'' said her husband.
	   The heptathlon title came down to the final event. Joyner-Kersee
was leading DeDee Nathan by 46 points, but the 800 is one of
Joyner-Kersee's least favorite events.
	   With the heptathlon points system, Nathan had to beat
Joyner-Kersee by about 3 1/2 seconds to wrest the gold medal from
Joyner-Kersee. But Nathan won by less than two seconds, and the
victory was Joyner-Kersee's by 23 points.
	   She won gold medals in the Olympics in the heptathlon in 1988
and 1992 and in the long jump in 1988, a silver medal in the
heptathlon in 1984, and bronze medals in the long jump in 1992 and
1996.
	   Cuba's Javier Sotomayor, the world record-holder, 1992 Olympic
gold medalist and two-time world champion in the high jump,
outdueled 1996 Olympic champion Charles Austin to win at 7-7 3/4
(2.33 meters). Both cleared that height, but Sotomayor, competing
despite a tender left ankle, had fewer misses.
	   Kenya's Tegla Loroupe, the world record-holder in the marathon
and two-time New York City Marathon champion, was a popular winner
in the women's 10,000. In defending her title, Loroupe was timed in
32;15.44, beating compatriot Sally Barsosio, the world champion, by
180 meters.
	   Joyner-Kersee's heartwarming victory overshadowed a world record
of 2 minutes, 54.20 seconds by the United States men's 1,600-meter
relay team, anchored by Michael Johnson.
	   Jerome Young led off the relay with a 44.4 leg, and was followed
by his coach, Antonio Pettigrew in 43.2 and Tyree Washington in
43.5, before Johnson finished off the record run with the fastest
leg, 43.1. It broke by .09 seconds the previous mark of 2:54.29 by
the U.S. team, also anchored by Johnson, at the 1993 World
Chmpionships at Stuttgart, Germany.
	   For the second straight day, Maurice Greene ran away from
Donovan Bailey down the stretch, this time in the men's 400-meter
relay, as the U.S. team beat rival Canada in 37.90, the fastest
time in the world this year and a Goodwill record.
	   Carlette Guidry overtook the Bahamas' Pauline Davis in the final
10 meters, giving the U.S. women's 400-meter relay team its fourth
straight victory in the Games. The team of Cheryl Taplin, Chryste
Gaines, Angie Vaughn and Guidry was timed in 42.06, the fastest in
the world this year and a meet record.
	   Jamaica's 1,600-meter women's relay team, anchored by Deon
Hemmings, beat the U.S. team by a stride in 3:24.76, the fastest in
the world this year. On the final leg, Hemmings held off a powerful
stretch run by Kim Graham, as the Americans finished in 3:24.81.
	   Elsewhere, an experimental drug was approved Wednesday to treat
paralyzed Chinese gymnast Sang Lan, who suffered a spinal cord
injury Tuesday night.
	   Dr. Vincent Leone, attending physician at the Nassau County
Medical Center, who treated Sang and expressed concern that she
might not walk again, said that the drug Sygen was approved by the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat the gymnast.
	   American gymnasts won three more gold medals Wednesday night,
giving them five in the competition, by far the best peformance by
the United States in Goodwill Games history. Americans had won just
three golds combined in the first three Goodwill Games.
	   Vanessa Atler won her second gold medal in two days, capturing
the floor exercise after Chris Lamorte and Kristin Maloney finished
first in the rings and balance beam.
	   Atler, next to last in the floor rotation, scored 9.775 to
overtake Simona Amanar of Romania, who had 9.725. The bronze went
to Corina Ungureanu of Romania with 9.650. Atler, 16, won the vault
on Tuesday.
	   Lamorte posted a 9.700 as the second competitor on the rings.
His score stood up through six more gymnasts.
	   All-around winner Ivan Ivankov of Belarus and Alexei Bondarenko
of Russia, who both posted 9.675 to share the silver medals.
	   Maloney, 17, was the last competitor on the balance beam and
scored a 9.775 to overtake Olga Teslenko of Ukraine, who had 9.725.
The bronze went to Ungureanu with 9.700.
	   Russia won the water polo gold medal with an 11-5 victory over
Spain. Italy edged the United States 8-7 in the bronze medal game.

Japan watchdog to order laggard banks to submit Y2K plans: report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's new financial watchdog agency will order
banks found to be lagging behind in efforts to combat the Year 2000
problem to submit progress reports, a major Japanese newspaper said
Thursday.
	   The Financial Supervisory Agency plans to review banks' plans
for dealing with the so-called millennium bug issue as part of its
inspections of financial institutions, the Yomiuri, Japan's largest
daily, reported.
	   Shortly after being set up last month, the agency announced it
would carry out a broad-based probe of Japan's bad loan-burdened
banks.
	   Credit unions, brokers and insurance companies will also face
inquiries about their preparations to adjust computer systems for
the date change at the turn of the century, the paper said.
	   A spokesman for the agency said he was unable to confirm the
report.
	   Experts have warned for years that many computers originally
programmed to recognize only the last two digits of a year will
fail on Jan. 1, 2000, when machines will assume it is 1900.

61 arrested for election fraud after Japan's upper house polls
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Police have arrested 61 people on charges of vote
buying and other campaign violations since Japan's elections for
the upper house of Parliament on July 12, the national police
agency said Thursday.
	   The number of electioneering arrests was almost double that of
the previous upper house ballot three years ago, after which 32
people were arrested for campaign fraud, said police spokesman
Hirokazu Ban.
	   ``We haven't been able to analyze the cause of the rise,'' said
Ban. ``But the police have generally become tougher on
politics-related corruption.''
	   Of the 61 arrested in the first ten days since the election, 39
were suspected of bribing constituents and 18 of making private
visits to drum up votes. Four were arrested for other violations.
	   The arrested included political party officials, company
executives and shopkeepers trying to bolster backing for their
preferred candidates or parties, said Ban.
	   The ruling Liberal Democratic Party suffered devastating losses
in this month's upper house poll, forcing Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto to announce his resignation.
	   The LDP will vote Friday for a new party president, who is
almost certain to replace Hashimoto because the ruling party
controls the more powerful lower house.
	   Ban did not say which political party had the most supporters
arrested for illegal canvassing.
	   Japan has been rocked recently by a series of scandals involving
cozy ties between government officials and businesses.
	   In February, a ruling party lawmaker, Shokei Arai, committed
suicide apparently to avoid being charged of accepting bribes from
Nikko Securities Co., one of Japan's biggest brokerages.

 &UR; Yankees rout Tigers 13-2; Blue Jays shut out White Sox &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Chuck Knoblauch, Darryl Strawberry and Jorge
Posada each homered to back Orlando Hernandez as the New York
Yankees routed the Detroit Tigers 13-2 Wednesday.
	   Hernandez (5-2) was staked to a 5-0 lead after two innings and
when the Tigers closed to 5-2, Knoblauch hit a three-run homer _
his 10th of the season and sixth since the All-Star break _ in the
third.
	   Hernandez allowed seven hits in six innings. Darren Holmes
pitched three innings for his first save.
	   Tino Martinez had four RBIs as the Yankees won their 71st game
and improved to 36-7 at home.
	   Brian Powell (1-2) threw 100 pitches in the first four innings,
allowing seven hits and 10 runs _ nine earned.
 &UR; Blue Jays 4, White Sox 0 &QC; 
	   In Toronto, Roger Clemens pitched eight shutout innings to win
his seventh straight decision and Jose Canseco hit his 27th homer
for the Blue Jays.
	   Clemens (12-6) allowed three hits, struck out four and walked
two. Paul Quantrill gave up one hit in the ninth.
	   After allowing a leadoff double to Ray Durham in the first,
Clemens didn't give up another hit until Magglio Ordonez's infield
single with two outs in the seventh.
	   Clemens, a four-time Cy Young Award winner, has allowed seven or
fewer hits in 11 of his last 12 starts.
 &UR; Devil Rays 7, Mariners 5 &QC; 
	   In St. Petersburg, Florida, Bobby Smith's two-run single capped
a four-run seventh-inning rally against Randy Johnson.
	   Randy Winn and Miguel Cairo also singled to drive in runs in the
seventh as the Devil Rays won for just the third time in 18 games
this month.
	   Five of Tampa Bay's seven runs off Johnson (9-9) were unearned,
including all four in the winning rally. Johnson allowed 10 hits,
struck out five and walked none before departing after the seventh.
	   Alex Rodriguez and John Marzano each hit two-run homers for the
Mariners. Albie Lopez (6-2) pitched two shutout innings for the
victory, and Roberto Hernandez worked the ninth to get his 18th
save.
 &UR; Royals 7, Rangers 4 &QC; 
	   In Kansas City, Missouri, Dean Palmer's three-run homer helped
the Royals overcome three more RBIs by Juan Gonzalez.
	   Palmer's fifth-inning shot off Aaron Sele (12-7) made a winner
of Pat Rapp (9-9), who retired 13 consecutive batters before being
ejected by first base umpire Eric Cooper for arguing.
	   Gonzalez hit a three-run homer, his 30th, in the first inning.
The shot landed in the water fountain in left field and increased
his major-league leading RBI total to 113.
	   Gonzalez has four homers and 10 RBIs in his last three games
after going nine games without an RBI. He is chasing Hack Wilson's
record of 190 RBIs.
 &UR; Orioles 5, Athletics 4 &QC; 
	   In Baltimore, Rafael Palmeiro homered with two outs in the
bottom of the ninth inning to give the Orioles their 12th win in 13
games.
	   Palmeiro hit a 2-2 pitch from Mike Fetters (1-4) over the
center-field wall, his 31st homer of the season and second in two
games.
	   Chris Hoiles and Jeff Reboulet also homered for the Orioles, who
moved within a game of .500 (50-51) for the first time since May
16. Baltimore has won nine straight at home.
	   Armando Benitez (3-2), the fifth Oriole pitcher, worked a
perfect ninth inning.
	   Matt Stairs and Ryan Christenson homered for the Athletics, who
have lost four of five.
 &UR; Indians 4, Red Sox 3 &QC; 
	   In Cleveland, Jim Thome's 27th homer capped a three-run rally in
the seventh and gave Charles Nagy his first win since May 31.
	   The Indians closed out the season series against Boston with two
wins but still dropped 8 of 11 to their possible first-round
playoff opponent.
	   Nagy (8-6) was 0-4 with four no-decisions since beating Toronto
8-3 on May 31. The major-league leader in homers allowed did not
yield one in his second straight strong outing, allowing three runs
and six hits in seven innings.
	   Paul Assenmacher and Mike Jackson combined on a perfect eighth,
and Jackson got out of a none-out jam for his 24th save.
 &UR; Angels 5, Twins 3 &QC; 
	   In Minneapolis, Garret Anderson's two-run double in the ninth
inning gave the Anaheim Angels just their fifth win in July.
	   Anderson, who earlier in the game extended his career-best
hitting streak to 19 games, lined reliever Greg Swindell's first
pitch just inside the right-field line to snap a 3-3 tie.
	   Troy Percival pitched the ninth for his league-leading 28th
save, pulling the Angels within a half-game of Texas in the AL
West. Shigetoshi Hasegawa (5-1) got two outs in the eighth inning
for Anaheim, which is 5-13 in July.

South Korea's militant labor group suspends strike plans

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A militant labor group suspended plans
to call a nationwide strike Thursday, reporting ``significant
progress'' in talks with the government to limit rising layoffs.
	   But Hyundai Motor Co. workers, who began an indefinite strike on
Monday, said they will continue their walkout until management
cancels mass layoff plans.
	   In response to a call by the maverick Confederation of Korean
Trade Unions, subway, telephone and hospital workers were to have
joined a strike that was begun earlier in the week by union members
in the auto, shipbuilding and other heavy industries.
	   But the umbrella labor group abruptly suspended plans to expand
the strike to all of its 500,000 members, saying it was making
progress in overnight talks with the government, which continued
into late Thursday morning.
	   ``We have suspended our full strike plans because of significant
progress and to give impetus to efforts by both sides to forge an
agreement,'' said Oh Dong-jin, a spokesman for the confederation.
	   Oh said, however, that the decision was not binding on workers
at Hyundai Motor Co. and other individual work sites who have
``special reasons'' to continue their protest.
	   In overnight talks, the government promised to try to limit
layoffs in the country's large auto plants, banks and a dozen
state-run companies ordered to slim down to cut costs and improve
efficiency.
	   The government also promised to reconsider its decision to
arrest about 100 union leaders charged with instigating illegal
strikes.
	   ``We have heard such promises before. This time we want more
concrete commitments from the government,'' Oh said.
	   In Ulsan, 280 kilometers (175 miles) southeast of Seoul, Hyundai
workers said they will continue to protest the company's plan to
lay off 2,678 workers next week. The nation's largest auto firm
earlier shed 5,000 workers.
	   But workers of Daewoo Motor Co., the nation's second largest
auto company, returned to work Thursday when the company reopened
its main plant outside Seoul after a three-day shutdown.
	   Since May, the labor confederation has called several
short-lived strikes to protest layoffs by manufacturers seeking to
cut costs in the face of plummeting sales.
	   The government called the strikes illegal and threatened to
arrest some 100 union leaders. It fears labor unrest will scare
away needed foreign investment.
	   Layoffs are spreading as South Korea struggles to overcome its
worst economic crisis ever. A flexible labor market aimed at
restructuring South Korea's bloated industries is a key condition
of a dlrs 58 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund.
	   Thousands of financially shaky companies have collapsed in the
past six months as part of the IMF-set conditions. The number of
jobless people has doubled to 1.5 million and is expected to reach
2 million by year's end.
	   One of the hardest hit sectors is the automobile industry, which
has seen sales drop by more than 50 percent. Hyundai, for example,
is operating at 40 percent of its capacity of 1.25 million vehicles
a year.

Philippine Airlines to proceed with scheduled flights despite
</HEADLINE>
strike
 &UR; By CLARO CORTES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine Airlines Inc. said
Thursday it plans to fly all of its scheduled flights despite a
strike by its ground personnel.
	   PAL said about 85 percent of its 9,000 remaining employees went
to work Wednesday even after the ground crew union launched its
strike. All 19 domestic and six international flights eventually
took off, although some after substantial delays, it said.
	   President Joseph Estrada met with union leaders for about six
hours Wednesday night while other senior officials talked with
airline executives to try to forge a compromise.
	   The striking ground personnel are demanding the reinstatement of
5,000 workers who were laid off by the airline under a massive
retrenchment program triggered by a 22-day pilots' strike last
month.
	   Avelino Zapanta, senior vice president of the airline, said it
expects operations to return to normal Thursday. ``There shouldn't
be any more confusion on the part of ticket-holders,'' he said.
	   Zapanta said a dialogue between the union and airline is
continuing.
	   ``Management has drafted a proposal to settle the problem and
it's now in the hands of the union,'' he said. The proposal
includes an indefinite suspension of the layoffs, he said.
	   Union president Alex Barrientos, who threatened Wednesday to
shut down the airline, was considerably more conciliatory Thursday.
	   ``We have to exchange blows with management to send our message
across,'' he said. ``Like a fight between brothers, we exchange
blows not to kill but to let off steam and then later reconcile.''
	   PAL has branded the ground crew strike illegal because it was
prohibited by labor authorities who assumed jurisdiction over the
dispute on July 10, five says after the start of the pilots'
strike.
	   The pilots' walkout was a devastating blow to the already
deteriorating financial condition of the 57-year-old airline,
Asia's oldest.
	   PAL says it is unable to make payments on about dlrs 2 billion
of debt and is discussing a rehabilitation program with Manila's
Securities and Exchange Commission.
	   The plan includes layoffs, the disposal of most of the airline's
planes, and a sharp reduction of flights.
	   SEC chairman Perfecto Yasay expressed pessimism Wednesday over
whether that plan would be viable with the strike by ground
personnel.
