<HEADLINE> Worldwide Outsourcing Spending to Grow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Worldwide corporate spending on
outsourcing corporate desktops and networks is expected to more
than double within four years, according to a report released
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Driving by the information technology staff shortage and
potential budget savings, network and desktop outsourcing services
will reach 30.7 billion U.S. dollars worldwide by 2003, said
International Data Corporation (IDC), a U.S. market research firm.
The worldwide outsourcing spending grew almost 2 billion dollars
between 1997 and 1998 to reach 14.3 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Outsourcing usually refers to contracting with outside
consultants, software houses or service bureaux to perform systems
analysis, programming and datacenter operations. IDC said that the
challenges of managing servers, network environments and desktops
are fueling demands for outsourcing, one of the fatest-growing
markets in the information technology industry.
</P>
<P>
Under a desktop outsourcing deal a company typically hires a
firm to procure its PCs, provide software licenses and systems
upgrades, and supply help desk services from a call center.
</P>
<P>
According to IDC, factors driving desktop and networking
outsourcing growth are declining PC prices which have increased
computer use, rapid growing employee Internet access, increasing
portable device use and difficulty hiring and keeping information
technology staffers.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, IDC said, the United States accounted for nearly half
of worldwide spending on network and desktop outsourcing services,
with the banking spending the most. Latin America, as well as
Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Africa and parts of Asia are
other fast-growing areas.
</P>
<P>
In an earlier report, IDC said that a growing number of
companies worldwide are outsourcing their information technology
training programs to help keep up with Internet commerce and new
Web-based business applications. The overall training market
including tools, content and services grew to 16.5 billion dollars
in 1998 worldwide and is expected to reach 22.9 billions dollars
in 2001.

<HEADLINE> Mozambicans' Life Improved: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Prime Minister Pascoal
Mocumbi said here Saturday that the living standard of the
Mozambican people has improved thanks to the continuous economic
development in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
"No doubt we are living a better life," the prime minister told
a rally in capital Maputo marking May Day, the International Labor
Day.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican government's policy is bearing fruits, Mocumbi
said, adding that the gross domestic product (GDP) last year grew
by over 10 percent, one of the highest in the southern African
region.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate in 1998 was only one percent while it was
between 60 percent to 65 percent during 1994 and 1995, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Because of the lowering inflation these years, he pointed out,
aggregatively, the minimum real income has increased by 38
percent, which means the buying power of the workers could become
better.
</P>
<P>
The minimum income has increased from 353,000 meticais (one
U.S. dollar equals to 12,500 meticais) to 450,000 meticais at
present while pension has gone up from 212,000 meticais to 270,000
meticais, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the prime minister admitted that two-thirds of the
16.5 million Mozambicans are still living under the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
Mocumbi said that one of the great challenges facing the
government, employers and the working people is poverty.
</P>
<P>
He urged the whole society to mobilize all capacity to enable
more people to live a better life.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the same function, Mozambican President
Joaquim Chissano also called upon his fellow Mozambicans to exert
their efforts to eradicate hunger and poverty and build up a
fairer society.
</P>
<P>
As long as poverty is not eliminated, there will be no fair
society in the country, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
General Secretary of the Mozambican Labor's Organization,
Joaquim Fanheiro complained that privatization has created a lot
of unemployed workers, saying that some 116,000 workers have been
unemployed since Mozambique introduced the structural reforms in
1987 and only a small part of them found job again.
</P>
<P>
The labor leader urged the government and the society to pay
more attention to the issue of unemployment and help to resolve
the practical problems for those unemployed.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of workers participated in the rally and parade
celebrating the Labor Day.

<HEADLINE> French PM Stresses French-Egyptian Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 1 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin,
who arrived in Egypt Saturday for a two-day visit, stressed the
importance of strengthening relations between the two countries
and their peoples.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters upon his arrival at Cairo International
Airport, Jospin hailed "the distinguished relations" between the
two countries and their leaders.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and his French counterpart
Jacques Chirac "are playing a key role in" resolving international
and regional disputes, he said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and France maintain close ties and coordinate regularly
stances on international issues, especially the Middle East peace
process, in which Paris has been wanting to play a key role.
</P>
<P>
The visit to Egypt by Jospin, who took office in 1997, is the
first by a French prime minister since 1992.
</P>
<P>
Jospin is leading a delegation consisting of the ministers of
economy, education and scientific research, the minister of state
for foreign trade and several businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Jospin said that he will discuss with Egyptian leaders on
boosting bilateral political and economic relations and inaugurate
the France Expo '99 Sunday on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
The French prime minister is expected to hold talks with his
Egyptian counterpart Kamal El-Ganzouri and Mubarak on enhancing
bilateral cooperation in the economic and trade fields.
</P>
<P>
France is the fifth largest importer of Egypt's goods in the
15-nation European Union and the third largest exporter to Egypt,
according to figures in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Over 30 Percent Marriages End up in Divorce in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 1 (Xinhua) -- One of every three marriages in
Kuwait ends up with a divorce, Kuwaiti Minister of Social Affairs
and Labor Jassem Al-Oun said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Al-Oun made the remark at the opening session of a three-day
conference called " What After Divorce...," the Kuwait News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Al-Oun did not give reasons for the high divorce rate, but he
stressed that the problem should be solved through the extension
of assistance to families to either avoid the breakup or to deal
with it when it occurs.
</P>
<P>
He called on the conference to shed light on the social
repercussions of divorce and the strategies related to the
conditions of women.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest statistics issued by the Justice
Ministry, there were 1,861 divorce cases in Kuwait in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Prominent Kuwaiti lawyer Sarah Al-Du'Aij attributed the high
divorce rate partly to the rapid development of technology, which
has created psychological pressures despite making lives much
easier.
</P>
<P>
"Lack of patience among the majority of people, which could be
witnessed, for example, in the way people drive their cars,
indicates that the rise in divorce cases resulted from the lack of
patience in solving their personal problems," Sarah said.
</P>
<P>
She said that when a problem arises between a married couple
under the pressure of life, worry begins to come over them, and
then instead of seeking a solution, they begin to waste their
efforts.
</P>
<P>
Other reasons for divorce, she said, include a wrong choice
before marriage, a short engagement period, marriage for interest,
a growing independence of women and a big difference in age.
</P>
<P>
Sarah said "in our modern life the working women feel that they
no longer need the financial support of their husbands and could
depend on themselves."
</P>
<P>
Marriage based on material interests usually ends when money
runs out or if the wealthy spouse is stingy, she said.
</P>
<P>
Sarah also underlined that the difference in culture and
environment between the married couple could cause many problems.
</P>
<P>
Marriages between Kuwaitis and non-Kuwaitis usually finish up
in divorce because they have difficulties in understanding their
spouse's different backgrounds or in adjusting to a new life, she
said.

<HEADLINE> Ugandans Urged to Promote Labor Standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- President Yoweri Museveni has urged
the general public to promote fundamental labor standards, social
justice and the dignity of labor as mutually reinforcing
components of sustainable development in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Museveni made the appeal at a function marking the
International Labor Day in western Uganda Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release from the President's Office, the
president called on employers to promote labor standards as
integral parts of their enterprises' strategy and growth.
</P>
<P>
He advised workers to use the opportunities the government has
put in place through legislation to expose violation and denounce
violators of labor standards.
</P>
<P>
The president also said that the government is ready to pursue
programs that promote employment to ensure intensive economic
growth especially through accelerated industrialization.
</P>
<P>
This will be achieved mainly by attracting investors into the
country as well as preparing the work force for employment through
vocational training, Museveni added.
</P>
<P>
He urged young and educated Ugandans to have a positive
attitude toward employment in the agricultural sector, the core of
the east African country' s economy.
</P>
<P>
Workers were commended for their continuous efforts aimed at
eradicating poverty across the country.
</P>
<P>
Despite the government's efforts to recover the national
economy, the government still needs to create about 300,000 jobs
each year to ably absorb all the unemployed, he noted.
</P>
<P>
On the minimum wage, Museveni said that the statutory minimum
wage is one of the tools the government will employ to ensure
social justice and peace at the work place.
</P>
<P>
The 55-year-old president also talked about issues concerning
child labor and security at the function attended by district
leaders and senior ministers.

<HEADLINE> More UAE Relief Flied to Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Another plane loaded with relief
materials for Kosovo refugees left here Saturday for Albania,
bringing the number of relief planes sent by the United Arab
Emirates (UAE) to 25.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the UAE has set up a camp in Kukes, Albania, which
will accommodate about 10,000 refugees, with a 200-bed hospital run
by a medical team of 12 doctors who can carry out 10 major
operations a day, the official WAM news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanians in Yugoslav Kosovo
province have fled into neighboring Macedonia and Albania since
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) launched air strikes
against Serb targets on March 24.
</P>
<P>
The relentless blitz began after the Serb-led government
refused to accept a peace agreement to grant autonomy to the
independence-seeking ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
All the work is being done "in line with the instructions of
President Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan to extend all kinds of
assistance to Kosovo refugees," the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Faris Al Mazroui, the head of the UAE relief team in Albania,
said that the UAE armed forces had named the UAE relief campaign
the "Operation White Hand," which he said was a symbol of Zayed's
"generosity and his open hands for the help of the needy."
</P>
<P>
He added that relief operation includes the establishment of an
air bridge that demands the deployment of four helicopters to
transport supplies and sick people.
</P>
<P>
"The UAE unit was cooperating with NATO forces, particularly
the French air force, in transporting relief supplies and media
men to and from the border areas of Albania," said Brigadier salem
al Zahimi, commander of the UAE military unit.
</P>
<P>
The UAE stands by NATO in its ongoing air strikes against
Yugoslavia.

<P>
KAMPALA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
Saturday discussed security matters with leaders from the western
part of the country, promising to do more to ensure security
there.
</P>
<P>
Their discussions were held at the presidential lodge in the
western district of Kabarole, a press release from the President's
Office said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to Kabarole district councilors, area members of
parliament, religious and opinion leaders, Museveni assured them
that the government is doing everything possible to contain the
problem of insecurity in Kabarole, Kasese and Bundibugyo
districts.
</P>
<P>
Plans are under way for the government forces to have permanent
control of the mountains that harbor the rebels of the Allied
Democratic Forces (ADF), he noted.
</P>
<P>
On the occasion, district leaders expressed concern over the
continued attacks and killings of innocent people by ADF rebels in
these districts.
</P>
<P>
Following rebel attacks, many local people have been displaced
and are living under very difficult conditions with a threat of
epidemics such as cholera and other diseases.
</P>
<P>
Museveni disclosed that the government will soon deploy more
infantry soldiers in the area who are familiar with the terrain of
the area, especially the Rwenzori Mountains.
</P>
<P>
ADF rebels, who mount raids from the forested mountains in the
region, intensified their attacks on civilians recently, forcing
all aid agencies to pull out of the area.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Seek Debt Relief at Paris Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania will request aid and
debt relief from donor countries and multilateral institutions at
a meeting in Paris next week.
</P>
<P>
The Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Finance, Raphael
Mollel, said this Friday evening before his departure for Paris to
attend a two-day Consultative Group Meeting (CGM) which starts
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is very vital because the decision made during the
session is crucial to the country's budget frame, among other
things, media reports Saturday quoted Mollel as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Paris meeting is a forum where major donor countries and
multilateral institutions jointly meet individual countries to
review funded projects and agree on future terms of cooperation,
he explained.
</P>
<P>
The permanent secretary is going to Paris along with Minister
of Finance Daniel Yona and Minister of State in the President's
Office Wilson Masilingi.
</P>
<P>
The delegation also includes officials from the Planning
Commission, the Presidential Parastatal Sector Reform Commission
(PSRC), Bank of Tanzania, the Zanzibar government, as well as
people from the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Mollel was optimistic that "representatives from donor
countries and multilateral institutions will respond positively to
our request in the light of the major reforms being undertaken by
the government plus adherence to several agreed benchmarks
including those of the World Bank. "
</P>
<P>
Burdened with a heavy debt of some eight billion U.S. dollars,
this east African country's health and education services have
been deteriorating as 30 percent of the revenue has been used for
debt servicing.
</P>
<P>
He said that the main theme of the meeting is macro-economic
prospects and public expenditure.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's policy and framework papers and the World Bank report
on support of the government's anti-corruption programs would be
presented on the first day.
</P>
<P>
A paper on public expenditure management in Tanzania and the
country's external financing requirements will be presented on
Tuesday, he added.
</P>
<P>
He further said that participants at the meeting will look
into real terms surrounding the underlying and headline inflation
and the performance of inflation, gross domestic product (GDP),
money supply and the exchange rate regime.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the issue of liberalization of petroleum industry
will also be discussed at the meeting, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the last Consultative Group Meeting in 1997, donors pledged
about one billion dollars to assist Tanzania to meet its
development needs.

CAIRO, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs from
Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- Foreign trade volume of Dubai of the United Arab
Emirates (UAE) reached 24 billion U.S. dollars in 1998 from 11
billion in 1990 and is expected to amount to 30 billion by 2005.
</P>
<P>
Deputy director of Dubai Chamber of Trade and Industry
disclosed the figures Friday following a meeting with a Austrian
trade delegation, which, grouping 30 representatives of industrial
and services companies, came to explore potential investment
opportunities in the Gulf emirate.
</P>
<P>
The official said his chamber receives more than 200 trade
delegations and missions annually, which come to seek possible
investment opportunities in and establish economic ties with Dubai.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The horses of Arab origin raised in Egypt is facing a
bitter competition from the American horse breeders in the global
market.
</P>
<P>
The American breeders sell Arab horses at no more than 20,000
dollars compared with the Egyptian selling price of 30,000 to
50,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the lack of veterinary stations has put the 170
Egyptian stables that breed such horses at a disadvantage. Clinics
and insurance companies refrain from covering the horses against
different perils.
</P>
<P>
Sayed Nasr Marie, owner of a large stable that raises
Arab-hybrid horses, said the Egyptian Arab horses have a high
demand in the world, but the American breeders undersell 8,000
horses of such hybrid.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Lebanon and Indonesia signed here Friday a draft deal
for economic and technical cooperation, the Daily Star reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Such agreements help promote Lebanon's economic role in the
region," Lebanese Minister of Trade and Economy Nasser Saidi said
after the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
He called on businessmen and industrialists from both
countries to intensify exchange of visits and explore ways of
setting up joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- The National Bank of Canada (NBC), Canada's sixth
largest bank, officially inaugurated its branch here Thursday, its
only outlet in the Middle East, the Daily Star reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Outside of the U.S. and Canada, the Beirut branch will be
NBC's third most important branch after Hong Kong and Seoul.
</P>
<P>
Having invested about 1 million dollars to start up operations
in Beirut, NBC expects to break even by the end of this
year.

<P>
ATHENS, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Greeks Saturday celebrated the last
Labor Day of the century by staging rallies around the country in
protest against the ongoing NATO bombing in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
In the Greek capital of Athens, the Labor Center of Athens,
with the support of the General Confederation of Workers of Greece
(GSEE) and the Civil Servants' Supreme Administrative Council
(ADEDY), organized a rally outside the U.S. embassy to show their
opposition to NATO's bombardments.
</P>
<P>
Demonstrators shouted slogans such as "stop the war now, give
peace to the Balkans."
</P>
<P>
GSEE President Cristos Polyzogopoulos said at the rally that
this last Labor Day of the century was marked by war and demanded
an immediate end of the bombing raids.

The Communist Party of Greece (KKE) Saturday organized a

BELGRADE, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic on Saturday ordered the release of three American

Gonzales, belong to a reconnaissance troop of a U.S. division
based in Germany, it was reported.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Minister Rules Out Cabinet Reshuffle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti First Deputy Prime
Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah
Saturday ruled out any cabinet reshuffle despite an on-going
standoff between the government and parliament.
</P>
<P>
"The government has not tendered its resignation and there are
no plans for any reshuffle," Sabah told reporters when leaving the
parliament building.
</P>
<P>
Sabah's remark came after media reports on crisis between the
government and the legislature frequently hit front pages of local
newspapers over the past week.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that lawmakers are planning a grilling motion
against Justice and Islamic Affairs Minister Ahmad Al-Kulaib over
some 120,000 misprinted copies of the holy Quran.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Sheikh Ali Al-Salem is also under fire for
the cancellation of a six-month share sale which opposition
legislators blamed cost the state some 60 million U.S. dollars of
public funds.
</P>
<P>
The parliament has also been refraining from giving green
light to the cabinet's oil project.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti government is seeking technical assistance from
international oil companies in developing the country's oil
fields and is reportedly ready to sign deals with world oil
giants.
</P>
<P>
However, many legislators fear the government will confer the
ownership of the oil fields on foreign companies, which is banned
by Kuwait's constitution.
</P>
<P>
The parliament decided to discuss related government proposals
on the oil project at its Tuesday session.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports speculated that the intensified friction
between the government and the legislature might result in
resignation of the cabinet and dissolution of the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Parliament sources were also quoted as saying that a "cabinet
reshuffle is necessary in order to avoid the forthcoming
questioning of Al-Kulaib."
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti cabinet usually submits a resignation to the emir
when its friction with the parliament reachs a dead end. Grilling
a minister usually leaves negative effects on him or even forces
him out of office.
</P>
<P>
The present government was appointed by Emir Sheikh Jaber
Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah in March, 1998 following the last cabinet
resigned over a parliamentary grilling against the then
information minister.

TEHRAN -- Iran's moderate Minister of Culture and Islamic
Guidance Ataollah Mohajerani on Saturday won a vote of confidence
from the Majlis (Parliament) after the conservatives accused him
of failing to uphold Islamic values.
</P>
<P>
Out of the 263 votes cast by the Majlis deputies, only 121
votes supported the impeachment motion against Mohajerani, while
135 against the motion and seven others were abstentions.
</P>
<P>
A group of 31 conservative Majlis deputies on April 21 tabled a
motion against Mohajerani with five-point charges which accused
him of failing to uphold Islamic and revolutionary values by
adopting a liberal policy on the press, book publishing and the
arts, and misappropriating public funds for minor Hajj rituals.
</P>
<P>
Local observers see Mohajerani's vote of confidence as a
success for the political reforms of President Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Khatami's policies have won more and more support from the
people and the conservatives are losing their influence, even in

Washington of being the main supporter of state terrorism in the

The U.S. State Department said in a report Friday that Iran was
among countries which persisted in their direct and indirect state

He urged the U.S. administration "to correct its double

Terming Iran as one of the biggest victims of terrorism in the
world, Asefi noted that Tehran condemns terrorism on the basis of
human and Islamic value and calls for all-out efforts of the
international communities to deal with the evil phenomenon of
terrorism. (Iran-U.S.-Terrorism)

BRUSSELS -- NATO on Saturday launched its second-day intensive
air-strikes against Yugoslavia after rejecting a seven-point peace
offer presented by Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
During a 24-hour period, he said, NATO aircraft flew more than
600 sorties, hitting transmission towers and control buildings
forming part of the Yugoslav radio relay network in several
locations.
</P>
<P>
NATO warplanes also bombed seven bridges providing key
communication lines between the Serb forces in the field in Kosovo
and the rest of the Yugoslav military.

<P>
NATO stepped up its air-strikes Friday by launching over 600
sorties to bomb various targets in Yugoslavia while Russian peace
envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin was seeking a solution to the current
war crisis in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
The Belgrade government put forward a seven-point peace plan,
but NATO rejected it, saying the proposal fell far short of NATO's
five-point demand and that an unarmed United Nations force going
into Kosovo was not worthy of serious consideration. The West
insists that an armed force go into Kosovo with NATO at its core

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Develop Conference Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The Tourism Authority of Thailand
(TAT) is to spend more than 85 million baht (2.3 million U.S.
dollars) this year on hosting a number of travel and tourism
related international conferences, a TAT press release available
here Saturday said.
</P>
<P>
These conferences, including the ecotourism conference in
northern Thai city of Chiang Mai, the Diving Equipment and
Marketing Association Meeting, the Thai Food Conference and
others, will yield at least five times their value in long-term
benefits to the national economy.
</P>
<P>
"We are very proud and honored that these prestigious events
will be held in Thailand. It is a boost for our MICE (Meeting,
Incentive, Convention and Exhibition) industry," TAT Deputy
Governor Juthamas Siriwan was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Normal conference delegates are known to spend about five times
more than the average tourists and delegates, Juthamas said.
</P>
<P>
She also noted that all these conferences were in line with
specific target niche-markets that Thailand was focusing on as
part of the Amazing Thailand 1998-1999 campaign, and would pave
the way for a significant diversification of the Thai tourism
industry in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
"For example, the adventure travel and ecotourism conference
and the student and youth travel conference will help us better
tailor our products towards the very specialized needs of these
markets," she said.

<HEADLINE> London Police Seize Explosives after Blasts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 1 (Xinhua) -- British police seized explosives at
the home of a suspect on Saturday after a blast rocked central
London Friday night which killed two and injured more than 70
people.
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman said the explosives were found in an early
morning swoop at Cove in southern England.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 officers have sealed off a residential street and
the search for clues is expected to take several days.
</P>
<P>
The Queen has sent her sympathies to those injured -- mostly
men in their 20s and 30s. Some had limbs blown off and others were
seriously burned when the bomb blasted in London's entertainment
area Soho.
</P>
<P>
Home Secretary Jack Straw said the bombs were not just attacks
on blacks, Asians and gays, "but on the whole of British society,
and they will not succeed".
</P>
<P>
Right-wing terror group, the White Wolves, has claimed
responsibility for the bomb. They also claimed to have carried out
the earlier attacks in Brixton and Brick Lane, both in London in
the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
A senior officer from Scotland Yard's Anti-Terrorist Branch
said the Cove man was arrested as a result of information prompted
by a Closed-Circuit television video still.
</P>
<P>
"He is a male in his early 20s and he has been taken to a
central London police station in connection with the Brick Lane
and Brixton bombs," he said. "He is a good likeness for the video
still."
</P>
<P>
Detectives arrested four other people in connection with the
bombings, but they have been freed on police bail.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Bus Drivers Hold Strikes on Labor Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

TEHRAN, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Some bus drivers in the Iranian
capital Tehran held strike Saturday on the accasion of the Labor
Day, the first of its kind since the Islamic revolution in 1979.
</P>
<P>
The hard-line evening newspaper Resalat reported that thousands
of passengers were strapped in downtown Tehran because of the
stoppage. But it did not say how many drivers took to the street.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Tehran Bus Company denied any strikes,
saying that drivers and workers of his company went to attend
ceremonies marking the Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
Resalat noted that Tehran bus drivers have never refused to
transport passengers during the past two decades at the pretext of
the Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another evening newspaper Kayhan reported that tens
of thousands of workers from Tehran's factories and workshops
held rallies Saturday to mark the Labor Day under the sponsorship
of the Iranian Labor House.
</P>
<P>
Secretary General of the Labor House Ali Reza Mahjoub at the
ceremony slammed the recent bill raised by some Majlis
(parliament) members to exclude small workshops from the country's
labor law.
</P>
<P>
Mahjoub also called for full implementation of the labor law
and protect workers' rights in the country.
</P>
<P>
Some Iranian lawmakers recently submitted a bill to the
Majlis, calling for exemption of small workshops that employ three
workers or less from the labor law.

<HEADLINE> Expo Gardens Should be Made Classroom for Education in Environmental Protection, Says President Jiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The whole garden of the China '99
Kunming International Horticulture Exposition should be made not
only a place for tourists but also a classroom for enhancing the
people's awareness of environmental protection and a base for
education in the love for nature and for the motherland, said
Chinese President Jiang Zemin while touring the garden show here
today.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang toured the gardens built by various
participating countries after cutting the ribbon for the opening
of the garden show. He also planted a tree in memory of the event.
</P>
<P>
Asked about his impression of the garden, Jiang said loudly: "
very good."
</P>
<P>
At the Medicinal Herb Garden, President Jiang said that "our
ancestors created the extensive and profound traditional medicine
and pharmacology and we should not only carry forward the
traditions but also make greater efforts to explore and develop it.
"
</P>
<P>
Located in the central part of the Exposition venue, the
Medicinal Herb Garden gathers more than 500 species of herb.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin was full of praises for the work done by
Chinese builders of the Exposition venue, saying "it is
magnificent, exquisite. It is really something. It has boosted the
morale of the Chinese people," adding that "it shows that the
socialist system can do something big."
</P>
<P>
When a reporter from Taiwan asked President Jiang to pose for a
picture, the President promised immediately and asked the battery
trolley driver to slow down so that the reporter can do it more
easily.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Minister Gains Vote of Confidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 1 (Xinhua) -- An Iran's moderate minister Saturday
won a vote of confidence in the conservative Majlis (parliament),
shattering an impeachment motion raised by hard-line lawmakers who
accused him of failing to uphold Islamic values.
</P>
<P>
In secret balloting, 121 lawmakers supported the impeachment
motion against Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance Ataollah
Mohajerani while 135 voted against it.
</P>
<P>
Seven deputies abstained and seven were absent from the
270-member Majlis.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-one conservative Majlis deputies presented the
impeachment motion on April 21 with a five-point charge, which
accused him of failing to uphold Islamic and revolutionary values
by adopting a liberal policy on the press, book publishing and the
arts, and misappropriating public funds for minor Hajj rituals.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Majlis started debates on the impeachment Saturday
morning with the presence of senior government officials including
First Vice President Hassan Habibi, Vice President for Legal and
Parliamentary Affairs Mohammad Ali Sadouqi and six cabinet
ministers.
</P>
<P>
The impeachment move is part of wider power struggle between
moderates and hard-liners who want to stall President Mohammad
Khatami's democratic and social reforms.
</P>
<P>
Mohajerani, a strong supporter of Khatami, defended his
policies on the country's press and cultural affairs with a smooth
and confident tone at the Majlis.
</P>
<P>
He warned his critics not to mistake an exchange of views and
opinions for anti-Islamic or revolutionary activities. "Tolerance
does not mean the weakening of values," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the problems of culture in the country do not
revolve around the minister.
</P>
<P>
"Do you think that if I go away, the problem of culture in this
country will be resolved? If it is so, then there was no need for
such a session and I would go away with a slight signal of the
leader of the Islamic Revolution, president or Majlis speaker,"
the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Mohajerani is the second minister of Khatami's cabinet
targeted by the powerful conservatives, who still dominate the
country's most important organs, such as the judiciary, the
Majlis and armed forces.
</P>
<P>
After his close friend, former Interior Minister Abdollah
Nouri was impeached by the Majlis last June, Mohajerani became
the main target of the Iranian conservatives.
</P>
<P>
Before the Majlis debate, Mohajerani stated that the
impeachment motion against him was politically motivated, but
would backfire.
</P>
<P>
"I consider the motion to impeach me to be a totally political
move," he said, adding that "experience has shown that such moves
will backfire and only add to the popularity of the person put
under pressure."
</P>
<P>
Local observers see Mohajerani's victory in the impeachment as
a success for the political reforms of President Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Khatami's policies have won more and more support from the
people and the conservatives are losing their influence, even in
the conservative-dominated Majlis, they noted.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The first mummified human
remains in South Africa have been unearthed in the Eastern Cape,
South African state television, the SABC, reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The body, believed to be that of a San adult, was found still
with its skin intact despite being buried thousands of years ago,
said the television.
</P>
<P>
The San people were the early inhabitants of southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
The mummy was found buried under a painted stone and covered
with two layers of bushes and sticks. Plants with antiseptic
qualities had been used to prevent decay.
</P>
<P>
The find was made by Stone Age archaeologist Johan Binneman
when he was doing routine work in the mountains of Kouga.
</P>
<P>
Although proper tests have to be done, Binneman said the mummy
is believed to be about 2,000 years old. The gender of the body
has yet to be determined by experts.
</P>
<P>
The SABC said the exact location of the mummy remains secret as
Binneman must return with more equipment to remove the remains.
</P>

The television did not say exactly when the find was made.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Increase Minimum Monthly Wage by 7 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has decided to
increase the minimum monthly wage by seven percent and the lowest
paid people will get 2,140 shillings (around 33 U.S. dollars) up
from the currently 2,000 shillings.
</P>
<P>
Labor Minister Joseph Ngutu told the Labor day parade in
Nairobi that the Kenyan government, in setting this wage hike,
considered several factors, among them the need for increased
earnings and the employers' ability to pay.
</P>
<P>
The minister said other factors considered included the need to
increase employment opportunities "through keeping wage rates in
line with productivity and the need to increase income
distribution."
</P>
<P>
Ngutu noted that the pay increase will benefit about 80 percent
of the work force, mostly in the agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
He urged employers in the country to constantly improve terms
and conditions of employment and to safeguard against
exploitation.
</P>
<P>
The minister also said that the members of the National Social
Security Fund (NSSF) would get free treatment in public hospitals,
although the membership to the fund rose from 2.5 million in 1997
to 2.6 million last year.
</P>
<P>
Despite this growth in membership, the benefit payment
registered a sharp increase from 1.5 billion shillings to two
billion shillings over the same period, Ngutu noted.
</P>
<P>
It is learnt that the current inflation in Kenya stands at
eight to 10 percent.

<HEADLINE> Water Level Rising in Pearl River Delta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists are paying
close attention to the rising water level in the Pearl River Delta
in south China.
</P>
<P>
Covering 11,000 sq km, the delta is one of the areas with the
fastest rates of economic growth in China, as it covers the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region, the Shenzhen Special Economic
Zone and the Zhuhai Special Economic Zone.
</P>
<P>
Hydrometeorologists in Guangdong Province have noticed that the
water level is rising together with a surging sea level, which is
expected to go up about five millimeters a year where the river
meets the South China Sea.
</P>
<P>
The scientists with the provincial water conservation
department noted that the filling of marshes to expand farmland,
together with global warming, has contributed to the rising water
level in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The scientists estimate that the sea level will surge by 20 to
30 cm a year by 2050.

<HEADLINE> Guangzhou to Host Int'l Civil Engineering Exposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, May 2 (Xinhua) -- This capital of south China's
Guangdong Province is to host an international civil engineering
equipment and materials exposition from September 28 to 30 this
year.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first time for China's mainland to host this
kind of exposition, according to Shen Bo, secretary-general of the
China Civil Engineering Association. He said that China's urban
construction will witness a boom in the next century, and will
need equipment from international suppliers.
</P>
<P>
The country plans to extend the length of urban roads to 380,
000 km by the year 2010, from 140,000 km at the end of 1998; it
will also inject a huge amount of investment into improving other
facilities, such as subways and sewage treatment plants.
</P>
<P>
For example, Guangzhou alone has earmarked 17 billion yuan for
this purpose this year, and 60 billion yuan over the next three
years.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, domestic engineering companies need advanced
testing devices for road and bridge facilities, better sewage
treatment equipment and improved automatic toll-collecting
machines, Shen said.
</P>
<P>
Experts from both at home and abroad will be invited to advise
Chinese cities on urban planning, and a number of rounds of trade
talks will be held during the exposition period, according to Shen.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Blasts NATO Killing of Innocent Civilians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia said Sunday that NATO
bombing of a passenger bus and an ambulance aiding the victims
represented a new crime of "unspeakable proportions."
</P>
<P>
Showing graphic footage of the tragic scene, where body parts
and debris were strewn on, Yugoslav Foreign Ministry spokesman
Nebojsa Vujovic told a press conference that the air raid Saturday
in broad daylight was another evidence of "atrocities committed by
NATO aggressors."
</P>
<P>
The bus, traveling from Nis to Pristina, capital of the
province of Kosovo, was cut into two parts, the skeleton of one
part remaining on the damaged bridge, and the other landed in the
river ravine under the bridge.
</P>
<P>
Forty-seven people, most of them ethnic Albanians, were
confirmed dead and 16 people, including four ethnic Albanian
children, were burned heavily injured. Four of the wounded were in
a critical condition, said Serbian Health Minister Leposava
Milocevic.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the bombing of the passenger bus, an ambulance
rushing to the scene to assist the victims was also hit. One
doctor got wound in the head.
</P>
<P>
"This is an unspeakable crime. This is not collateral damage,"
Vujovic said.
</P>
<P>
He accused the "PR NATO machine" of "inventing a list of most
terrible lies."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman denied the alleged rape of ethnic Albanian women
by Serb security forces.
</P>
<P>
"I checked and double-checked. The crime of rape is the lowest
rate of crime committed in Kosovo since the creation of the
Socialist Republic of Yugoslavia after the Second World War,"
Vujovic said.
</P>
<P>
"Notions of Serbs raping Albanians do not exist anywhere but...
in the heads of those who were committing these atrocities," he
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 2 (Xinhua) -- A last minute goal from striker Qu
Shengqing salvaged a 1-1 tie for Liaoning Fushun on Sunday and
powered the newly-promoted side to take over the top spot on the
Chinese professional soccer league table.
</P>
<P>
Qu, the leading scorer in the league, capitalised the sloppy
defence of the opposing side Tianjin Taida and shot from the close
range in the 89th minute, stretching his club's unbeaten home
streak to five games.
</P>
<P>
The victory left the top flight new comers replacing Sichuan
Longxing, who crashed to a 1-2 home defeat to Shandong Luneng in
the league's eighth round, as the first division pace setters with
a 4-3-1 record.
</P>
<P>
In Sunday's other actiona, Beijing Guo'an snapped its third
straight losing run by forcing a 1-1 away tie at Jilin Aodong;
Qingdao Hainiu beat bottom club Wuhan Heart K 2-1 at home; the
ties between Guangzhou Songri against Shenyang Haishi and Shanghai
Shenghua against Shenzhen Ping'an both ended up with goalless
draws.
</P>
<P>
Defending champions Dalian Wanda's match with Chongqing
Longxing was postponed because of Wanda's involvement in mid-
week's Asian Club Championship.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing municipal government has
issued a decree restricting the sale and use of plastic bags and
styrofoam containers, in a bid to improve environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
No plastic bag less than 0.025 mm thick is allowed to be sold
or used anywhere in the city from May 1. Instead, bags made of
cloth, paper and other reusable materials are encouraged to be
produced and used.
</P>
<P>
Styrofoam containers are barred from railway stations, bus
stations, airports, hotels, restaurants and tourism spots in the
Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
Pedlars in farm-produce markets are not allowed to sell or use
plastic bags. Offenders will be fined from 20 yuan to 30,000 yuan,
depending on the seriousness of the case.
</P>
<P>
According to local officials, if every Beijing resident used
one plastic bag a day, about 2.3 billion plastic bags, weighing a
total of 140,000 tons, would be consumed in the city every year.
</P>
<P>
Plastic bags, which do not decompose easily, pose serious
threat to the environment, experts say.

<HEADLINE> Little Expected in Mideast Peace Before Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Egypt expects little progress in the
Middle East peace process before Israel's May 17 election,
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The world is waiting for the results of Israel's parliamentary
elections, Moussa told reporters after the talks among Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and
French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin.
</P>
<P>
"We have to wait and see who will lead Israel" in the coming
years, Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that Egypt will work with the Palestinians in the
upcoming months to push the Middle East peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks have had little progress
since Israeli hardline Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu became the
country's prime minister in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The leaders also discussed a vote last week by the Palestine
Liberation Organization's Central Council to delay a decision on
Palestinian statehood until after the Israeli elections, Moussa
said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat had originally announced to declare statehood on May 4
when the five-year Palestinian self-rule period expires. But he
delayed after it became clear that declaration of statehood that
day would play into the hands of Israeli hard-line parties.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader, a frequent visitor to Egypt, arrived
here in the day to consult and coordinate stance with Mubarak on
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Jospin arrived in the Egyptian capital on Saturday for a
two-day visit in a bid to seek closer ties in the economic and
trade areas between France and Egypt.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Investment Doubles in Tibet in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, May 2 (Xinhua) -- In 1998, despite the lingering impact
of the financial turmoil in other parts of Asia, overseas
investment in China's Tibet Autonomous Region soared by 100
percent over the previous year, to reach 24.63 million U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 100 overseas investors from a dozen countries and
regions invested in Tibet last year, according to local officials.
</P>
<P>
This was the result of local government efforts to boost
Tibet's economy by attracting more funds, technology and
managerial expertise.
</P>
<P>
In tandem with such efforts, favorable policies and simplified
procedures were introduced for the setting-up of overseas
companies in the region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, overseas investment has expanded from the
traditional sectors such as catering, tourism, carpet-making and
fine arts, to mining, electronics and pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
The majority of overseas investment pours into this regional
capital, and Shannan and Shigaze prefectures, which form the
locally known as the "golden triangle" of economic development.

<HEADLINE> Sharon Requests to Finish Bribing Case Before </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel
Sharon Sunday called on prosecutors to wind up their review over a
bribing case against him before the coming general elections.
</P>
<P>
At the start of a routine cabinet meeting in Jerusalem, Sharon
stressed that he would be available any time to help bring the
inquiry to a close before the elections.
</P>
<P>
According to a report leaked to local media last Thursday,
police have recommended to charge Sharon with allegedly bribing a
former general in return for his giving favorable testimony in
Sharon's libel suit against local daily Haaretz.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu blamed the leak
of the police report and expressed his "full confidence in
Sharon."
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Moshe Arens also noted that the leak was
aimed at harming the ruling Likud party and Netanyahu in the
elections of May 17.
</P>
<P>
Sharon had sued Haaretz and its journalist Uzi Benziman over a
1991 article in the newspaper stating that, as defense minister in
1982, Sharon led Israel into a full-scale war in Lebanon without
the consent of then prime minister Menachem Begin.
</P>
<P>
After Tel Aviv District Court ruled against Sharon in early
1997, Sharon appealed to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
Defending its report, Haaretz requested testimony from Ben
Gal, who fought in Lebanon and was on record as saying during a
1987 lecture that Sharon had acted without Begin's knowledge and
had imposed a secret plan to expand the war on the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Ben Gal at first refused to testify, but changed his mind
after returning home from a trip to Russia with Sharon, then
national infrastructure minister, in June 1997.
</P>
<P>
He then said in court that he had erred in the lecture and that
Sharon had not deceived Begin. He also signed a statement
declaring that he and Sharon had not discussed the case.
</P>
<P>
There were reports that Ben Gal, who went into private business
after leaving the army, would get part of a lucrative natural-gas
deal with Russia as a result of the trip.
</P>
<P>
In July 1998, Haaretz filed a complaint with police over the
possible bribing in the case.

and making investments, he said, adding that security and
tranquility were essential for production, investment and
workforce in the society.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that increased production will help the
government solve the problem of unemployment.

<HEADLINE> Environmental Protection: Common Task of Mankind </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, May 2 (Xinhua) -- "The environment on which we depend
for survival is not a private property," said Austrian Ambassador
to China Erich Buttenhauser. "It is the common task of the people
of all countries in the world to solve the problems of our
environment, whose destruction has never been as serious as today.
"
</P>
<P>
The ambassador made the remarks at a seminar here today at the
Kunming Horti-Expo, which highlighted the issue of environmental
protection, the most critical issue related to "Man and Nature",
the theme of the ongoing Exposition.
</P>
<P>
The Austrian Seminar on Environmental Protection and the
Production of Electricity with Wastes was jointly sponsored by the
Austrian Trade Commissioner in Hong Kong and the Secretariat of
the Expo '99 Organizing Committee.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said that "there are no boundaries for
environment and environmental protection. We are facing the common
cause of protecting our environment."
</P>
<P>
Representatives from some enterprises engaged in the production
of environmental protection equipment and technology, and Chinese
environmental protection personnel attended the seminar. They
discussed such issues as city garbage treatment and obtaining
electricity and fertilizer from wastewater and organic waste.
</P>
<P>
It was learned from the seminar that garbage is classified and
collected in Austria and many other European countries. The
practice has made it possible for economical recycling of
resources and for avoiding secondary pollution. Austrian schools
teach students to put their different garbage into different
containers.
</P>
<P>
It is possible for China to treat garbage by burning as the
garbage contains a lot of plant matters, said an Austrian
representative. But classification of garbage should be the best
option. To arouse public to the awareness of environmental
protection is, too, an effective measure of protecting the
environmental.
</P>
<P>
It is a common practice to purify urban sewage, mud and solid
wastes by exploiting bacteria's anaerobic or aerobic properties.
Austrian has adopted such practice and the by-products include
biogas which can turn into electricity, fertilizer and thermal
energy.
</P>
<P>
Participants agreed that the development of science and
technology should result not only in new products but also
effective solutions to pollution problems so that a better and
cleaner environment would be passed on to future generations.
</P>
<P>
Today also marked the "Austrian Day" of the Horticultural
Exhibition. A flag-raising ceremony was held in front of the
International Hall within the Expo Garden amidst the playing of
the national anthem.
</P>
<P>
The '99 Kunming International Horticultural Exposition opened
on May 1 and will last until the end of October.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Seven countries have informed the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) that they are prepared to
upgrade the Palestinian mission status in their countries, said a
senior Palestinian official on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Nabil Sha'ath, PNA Minister of Planning and International
Cooperation, told the Voice of Palestine that six south American
countries and Ireland have informed the PNA recently that they are
prepared to upgrade the Palestinian representative offices in their
countries to embassies.
</P>
<P>
Sha'ath did not say whether these countries will take the steps
before or after the PNA's declaration of an independent
Palestinian state, but he said their announcement will help
strengthen the PNA's position in future peace talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Palestine Liberation Organization Central Council decided
in Gaza Thursday to postpone making decision on statehood
declaration until after Israel's upcoming general elections on May
17, pending the election results and who will be elected as
Israel's new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Council declared an independent
Palestinian state in Algeria in 1988. Many countries have already
recognized it and the Palestinians have opened foreign missions in
those countries, with some called embassies and some
representative offices.

<HEADLINE> World Record Holder Upset in China's National Athletics GP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JI'NAN, May 2 (Xinhua) -- China's women's 5,000 meters world
record holder Jiang Bo suffered a further humiliation at the
fourth stage of this year's National Athletics Grand Prix Series
here on Sunday, finishing an upset 16th in her speciality event.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, a member from the training camp of legendary coach Ma
Junren, was never in contention for the title in the race and had
been left far behind after the 2000-meter mark in the 25-lap event.
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old, who set a new world record of 14 minutes 28.09
seconds in the Eighth National Games in 1997, clocked a pedestrian
time of 16:38.83 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In Saturday's 1,500m competition, Jiang only managed sixth with
a modest time of 4:21.70.
</P>
<P>
Local favorite Sun Guixia, runner-up in Saturday's 10,000m
event, took a solo lead in the final three laps for a comfortable
victory in 15:26:32.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's teammate Dong Yanmei trailed Sun for most of the time,
but faded away in the last stage, having to settle for the second
place in 15:45.84.
</P>
<P>
The third place went to Zhou Chunji from Henan Province, who
clocked 15:45.89.
</P>
<P>
Yang Jian, director of coach Ma's training camp, said their
runners' goal at this meet was to qualify for the National Inter-
city Games in northwestern city of Xi'an in September.
</P>
<P>
"Ninety-eight percent of the runners have achieved the goal,"
Yang said.
</P>
<P>
Ma, who failed to show up in this meet, has not trained the
runners for a long time, Yang said. "He has been kept busy
establishing a new training center."
</P>
<P>
Yang said Ma was still upset about failing to have his runners
in the Asian Games last December in Bangkok. "He's still unhappy
about that. But he hopes to lead his athletes up to the world
stardom again and win more honors for our country."

<HEADLINE> 520 Yugoslav Civilians Dead in NATO Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Health Ministry of the Serbian
Republic said that 520 civilians have been killed in NATO air
raids, which entered its 40th day Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The figure was far from final as experts were continuing their
efforts to identify the mutilated bodies of innocent civilian
victims.
</P>
<P>
The latest civilian casualties came Saturday afternoon when
NATO bombs hit a passenger bus on a bridge about 20 kilometers
north of Pristina, capital of the breakaway province of Kosovo.
Forty-seven were confirmed dead and 16 were heavily wounded with
severe burns.
</P>
<P>
Most of the victims were ethnic Albanians, said Leposava
Milicevic, the Serbian minister of health.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the bombing, an ambulance rushing to the scene to
aid the victims was also hit and the vehicle's driver was wounded
in the head.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that many medical facilities around the
countries were damaged in the air raids and the bombings of roads
and bridges had made it almost impossible to reach some of those
in need of medical attention.
</P>
<P>
"This has resulted in 70 percent more difficulties in giving
aid than before the NATO aggression started," she said.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to take this opportunity to make a public appeal
to all of my colleagues to raise a voice against the bombing of
ambulances and hospitals," Milicevic said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the air strikes, the country's medical workers were
continuing their professional work.
</P>
<P>
"Yesterday, I went to Pancevo to personally see the results of
the bombing," the minister said. "During the night of the attack,
seven babies were born."
</P>
<P>
Pancevo is a city some 20 kilometers northeast of Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
"To me, this means that life is stronger than NATO bombs,"
Milicevic said.

<HEADLINE> China Capable of Protecting Breeders of New Plant Species, AIPH President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, May 2 (Xinhua) -- China is fully capable of protecting
the interests of developers of new plant species displayed at the
China '99 Kunming International Horticultural Exposition, said
Otto Koch, president of the Association of International
Horticultural Producers(AIPH).
</P>
<P>
"Breeders of new plant varieties should feel rest assured to
introduce their novel plants into China and to the ongoing garden
show here in Kunming," Koch said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the great efforts China has made to protect new
plant species, Koch said both China and Yunnan province have had
related laws and regulations that will bring all new varieties of
plants under full protection.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the International Convention for the Protection of
New Varieties of Plants, Koch said the convention enables breeders
to have a chance of making profits for every new variety developed.
</P>
<P>
"Developing a new plant variety is very costly. It requires
technique, labor, funds, and time. It may take ten to 15 years to
develop a new variety," Koch said, adding that the breeder of a
new plant variety may lose the opportunity of making profits if
there is no adequate protection.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the impression of the Expo garden, Koch said that
the outdoor exhibition areas are the best and the China national,
regional and provincial gardens are of the supreme standards.

<HEADLINE> Mordechai Vows to Stay On in PM Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 2 (Xinhua) - Israel's Center Party leader
Yitzhak Mordechai reiterated his resolve Sunday to stay on in the
race for the prime ministership though he is sliding further in
opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
Flanked by other founding members of the newly formed party,
Mordechai told reporters in Tel Aviv that he believes he will be
able to "gain votes" in the next two weeks before the voting on
May 17.
</P>
<P>
His remarks effectively ruled out the possibility that the
former defense minister might join forces with another candidate,
One Israel leader Ehud Barak, before the voting.
</P>
<P>
Recent opinion polls show Mordechai is slipping further behind
incumbent Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Barak, giving him
no chance of entering a possible runoff.
</P>
<P>
A decisive runoff is likely to be held, scheduled on June 1,
as no candidates are expected to win at least 50 percent of the
votes in the first round.
</P>
<P>
Speculation has been mounting that Mordechai might quit the
race before the first round of voting as his declining
position in the polls will hinder his party's performance in
the elections for the next parliament.
</P>
<P>
In a televised debate last month, Netanyahu managed to
squeeze a promise from Mordechai that he will not drop out
of the prime ministerial race.
</P>
<P>
But Netanyahu claimed later that he had information proving
that Mordechai was considering joining forces with Barak.
</P>
<P>
Reports said Barak has been pressuring Mordechai to line up
with him before May 17 as opinion polls show that with
Mordechai's support, he might beat Netanyahu without entering a
runoff round.
</P>
<P>
Barak said a few days ago that he is seriously
considering holding the portfolio of defense minister himself as
well as the prime minister if he wins the elections.
</P>
<P>
Observers believe that Barak was sending a signal to Mordechai
that his hesitation might cost him the opportunities to negotiate
a favorable deal in a Barak-led coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai had been defense minister in the government of
Netanyahu till he was fired over allegations of disloyalty
several months ago.
</P>
<P>
For his part, however, Mordechai has insisted that more and
more supporters of Barak are likely to turn to him in the weeks
leading to May 17.
</P>
<P>
He also cited opinion polls which are consistently showing
that he will have a better chance than Barak to beat
Netanyahu in a one-to-one runoff, although the same polls show
he will have no chance to enter such a runoff.
</P>
<P>
Saturday night, Mordechai rejected the suggestion of three
former army comrades, who came to his home in Jerusalem and
appealed to him to quit the race and joined force with Barak.
</P>
<P>
Roni Milo, a founding member of the Center Party, said the
party is "united" and supports Mordechai's position, defusing
rumors that he and other party leaders might force Mordechai to
enter alliance with Barak.

<P>
CAIRO, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Center Party leader Yitzhak
Mordechai pledged on Sunday to revive the peace talks between
Israel and Syria if he is elected prime minister of the Jewish
state.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai, a former defense minister in Israel's Likud
coalition, is running for premiership, along with Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Labor Party leader Ehud Barak, in
the general elections due on May 17.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Egyptian TV, Mordechai expressed
readiness to realize what he termed as "the strategic peace with
Syria."
</P>
<P>
He said he will seek support from both Egypt and the United
States in this regard.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations between Syria and Israel were stalled in early
1996 due to disputes over the future of the Golan Heights Israel
captured from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is one of the co-sponsors of the peace talks between
Arab countries and Israel, and Egypt is a key mediator in the
peace process started in 1991 in Madrid, Spain.
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking forward to visiting Egypt and meeting with
(Egyptian) President (Hosni) Mubarak," Mordechai said. But he did
not specify the date of the proposed trip.
</P>
<P>
He said he would discuss with Mubarak, whom he described as "a
leader of peace" , ways of reactivating the stalled Mideast peace
process and promoting the implementation of the Wye peace accord
signed last October.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks came to a standstill last
December after Israel failed to carry out the Wye accord, under
which Israel should pull back from another 13 percent of the West
Bank.

<P>
BRUSSELS, May 2 (Xinhua) -- NATO on Sunday acknowledged loss of
two aircraft on the 39th-day of its airstrikes against Yugoslavia,
and damage to a civilian passenger bus during a pummeling over a
bridge in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Jamie Shea, a NATO spokesman, told reporters that a F-16 war
plane "went down" at about 2:20 local time early Sunday morning
and the pilot was rescued safely two hours later.
</P>
<P>
The NATO aircraft operating along the provisions of Operation
Allied Force crashed in the western part of Yugoslavia, Shea said
at a news briefing at NATO headquarters.
</P>
<P>
NATO needed to check whether or not the war plane was shot down
or caused by some "technical problem," he added.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also testified that a U.S. navy aircraft, AV-8B
Harrier, crashed into Adriatic Sea about 25 miles east of Brindisi,
Italy, during a training mission Saturday afternoon. The pilot was
also rescued safely after spending about five minutes in water, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The loss of two planes added the number of aircraft crashed in
the war to four, including an F-117 Stealth jet-fighter and an
Apache attacking helicopter.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, NATO acknowledged that its air-strike might cause
serious "collateral damage" Saturday when hitting a bridge in
Luzane, northern Kosovo, which Serbian media said at least 34
civilians including two children were killed when they traveled by
a passenger bus near Pristina. But NATO spokesmen at their news
briefings said the bridge was "a legitimate target" in the air-
strike against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Shea also expressed NATO's welcome to the release of three U.S.
prisoners of war, but said that NATO will not stop intensifying
airstrikes against Yugoslavia until the Balkan nation accepts its
demand.

<HEADLINE> Pak to Continue Positive Talks with India: Shamshad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan has always welcomed any
move for "positive talks" with India irrespective of the fact that
which party is in power in New Delhi, Foreign Secretary Shamshad
Ahmad said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"We are absolutely not concerned about which party is ruling
India," Shamshad told the News Network International, adding "this
is their internal matter."
</P>
<P>
However, he said: "we are concerned about how serious is the
(Indian) government in holding talks with Pakistan."
</P>
<P>
When asked if Pakistan would continue talks with the caretaker
government of Atal Behari Vajpayee, Shamshad said: "yes, we are
ready to continue talks for peace, security and other vital
issues."
</P>
<P>
"The Kashmir issue is a reality and Pakistan can not even think
of changing its stand on this," he also said, adding "We are ready
to continue talks on other issues as well, but the Kashmir issue
is our main point."
</P>
<P>
He noted that "no talks with India could succeed without the

<HEADLINE> Labor Body, Rights Group to Form Opposition in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The Nigeria Labor Congress (NLC) and
human rights groups will form an opposition if current discussions
on an all- inclusive government of national unity sail through, a
senior labor leader said.
</P>
<P>
NLC President Adams Oshiohmole said here Saturday at a May Day
rally that the implication of an inclusive government will be the
absence of an opposition, which will in turn behove workers and
their allies the task of nurturing a strong opposition, This Day
Reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He said the All People's Party (APP) and the Alliance for
Democracy (AD) are clamoring for a unity government before the
formation of the president- elect Olusegun Obasanjo administration
in the most populous African country.
</P>
<P>
The new developments indicate that "people are not in politics
because of conviction or ideas they want to canvass, but rather to
have access to appropriate wealth," the labor leader added.
</P>
<P>
The APP has asked for the ten percent proportional
representation in the in-coming government as contained in the
1995 draft constitution while the AD has advocated for a
government of national unity.
</P>
<P>
A decision was reportedly taken after a closed-door meeting
last week between Obasanjo and APP top leaders to give five
ministerial posts to APP and AD which lost the February 27
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
According to the decision, APP is expected to produce three
ministers and the remaining two to be given to AD, The Guardian
newspaper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Two out of the three ministerial slots for the APP have been
zoned to Olusola Saraki's faction of the party, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
During the presidential election, Saraki who is unhappy with
his party's leadership later asked his supporters to vote for
Obasanjo against Chief Olu Falae, joint presidential candidate of
APP and AD.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's President-elect Wants Low-key Hand-over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian president-elect Olusegun
Obasanjo wants week-long activities marking his swearing-in as the
president in capital Abuja to be low-keyed, according to a Sunday
Tribune report.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a source at the presidency as saying that "the
concern of Obasanjo is to begin hard work in earnest in order to
take the country off the ground again and reawaken it from its
slumber."
</P>
<P>
He told the paper that the president-elect is equally concerned
about what happens to the nation's economy, the Nigerian welfare
and putting in place an enduring democratic government rather than
flamboyant celebration.
</P>
<P>
Tunde Adeniran, chairman of the Presidential Inauguration
Committee set up by the People's Democratic Party (PDP) for the
swearing-in ceremony, said Obasanjo would prefer a moderate but
memorable celebration.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that state branches of PDP have been equally
informed about the modest way to celebrate the occasion on May 29
this year.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, a handing-over committee set up
recently by Nigerian Head of State General Abdulsalami Abubakar is
working round the clock to ensure befitting activities during the
ceremony.

<HEADLINE> 2 Pro-Israeli Militiamen Desert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Two militiamen of the pro-Israeli
South Lebanon Army (SLA) deserted Sunday in the face of decreasing
morale of the militia, the Voice of the People radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The two defectors manning the Barashit outpost in the western
sector of the Israeli occupied border zone in south Lebanon handed
themselves to local residents, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
Their defections followed desertation of at least 16 SLA
members in the past two months.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a SLA official charged with investigating cases of
prisoners in the Khiam Detention Center inside the border zone
resigned Sunday, the radio added, but without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
Most of the prisoners were held by Israeli forces or SLA on the
ground that they had conducted anti-Israeli activities.
</P>
<P>
There are currently nearly 2,500 SLA members, who are helping
Israeli forces patrol its occupied zone and handling the security
affairs in Jezzine, a predominantly Christian town facing the
enclave.
</P>
<P>
The militiamen were considered as traitors in Lebanon and its
commander Antonie Lahd has been sentenced to death in absentia by
a Lebanese military court.
</P>
<P>
Amid mounting speculation that Israeli forces may conduct a
unilateral partial withdrawal from south Lebanon, the SLA's morale
is sinking and more members are defecting to the Lebanese
government or seeking asylum in a bid to escape reprisals
afterwards.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-proclaimed security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been fighting to
oust Israeli occupation forces and its ally SLA out of the
country.

<HEADLINE> UK to Deploy Helicopter Carrier in Case of Need of NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The Royal Navy's newest and largest
warship, complete with a Royal Marine battle group, is to be
deployed close to the Mediterranean in case it is needed for the
Kosovo operation.
</P>
<P>
HMS Ocean, designed as a floating offshore platform for
launching helicopters, is to set off on a training exercise in the
eastern Atlantic on May 11, the Ministry of Defense confirmed
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Telegraph said the plan to send the helicopter
carrier Ocean to the area was a "sign that NATO commanders are
preparing for a land war" in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
However, a spokesman from the Ministry of Defense, stressed
that it did not imply that she was joining the Kosovo operation.
</P>
<P>
The decision to switch to the eastern seaboard, where the
warship will be well placed to sail for the seas off Yugoslavia,
was described by the Ministry as a "prudent contingency measure".
</P>
<P>
"The deployment comprises six ships, with the Royal Marine
commando group, helicopters and associated support elements," the
spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> NATO Reports Loss of Two Aircraft Within 24 Hours </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 2 (Xinhua) -- A NATO spokesman said here Sunday
that the alliance lost two aircraft within 24 hours on Saturday
and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Jamie Shea, the spokesman, told reporters that a F-16 aircraft
went down at about 2:20 a.m. local time Sunday and the pilot was
rescued two hours later.
</P>
<P>
The NATO aircraft operating along the provisions of Operation
Allied Force crashed in the western part of Yugoslavia, Shea told
a news briefing at NATO headquarters.
</P>
<P>
He also said NATO needs to check whether or not the war plane
was shot down or caused by some "technical problem".
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also told reporters that a U.S. navy aircraft, AV-
8B, crashed at Adriatic Sea during a training mission Saturday
afternoon. The pilot was also rescued safely, he said.
</P>
<P>
Shea said the loss of the two planes added the number of
aircraft lost in the war to four, including an F-117 and an Apache.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, NATO acknowledged that its air-strike caused serious
collateral damage Saturday when hitting a bridge in Luzane,
Yugoslavia, claiming the lives of at least 34 civilians in a bus.
But the NATO spokesman said the bridge "is a legitimate target" in
the air-strike operation. The operation has lasted 39 days.
</P>
<P>
Shea also acknowledged that Serb field forces still had very
good strength. He said the Serbs had a strong anti-aircraft force
against NATO, posing a big threat to NATO air force.

<HEADLINE> WTO Enters May Without Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The World Trade Organization (WTO)
entered May with no leader as its members were still divided over
who would succeed Renato Ruggiero whose four-year term of office
expired on April 30.
</P>
<P>
Heads of the delegations of the 134 WTO members met at the
Geneva headquarters on April 30 and May 1 in a last-minute attempt
to choose their new leader between Supachai Panitchpakdi of
Thailand and Michael Moore of New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
The atmosphere was "testy, tense, and not terribly pleasant",
said a trade official at the end of Saturday's meeting of the
WTO's ruling General Council.
</P>
<P>
According to Chairman of the General Council Ali Mchumo, Moore
caught up from behind and passed Supachai with 62 supporters, with
the United States playing a key role among them. So he proposed
that the General Council meeting discuss Moore's appointment.
</P>
<P>
Mchumo's proposal was rejected by backers of Supachai, who now
has support of 59 members, among whom there are big players like
Australia and Japan. Some of them have requested a vote as the
last resort if no consensus was reached.
</P>
<P>
Another 13 members have not yet made their decision.
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, Germany, speaking on behalf of the European Union,
said that the EU would accept Mchumo's proposal, although it
promised to support Supachai in early April.
</P>
<P>
Many members said that they are fed up with the manipulation of
the selection of the WTO's new leader by a certain leading member.
</P>
<P>
Observers believe that a consensus will not be reached within
this month if WTO members continue the selection process in the
same way, during which at least half a dozen deadlines have been
missed since last November.

<HEADLINE> French PM Praises Egypt's Economic Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Visiting French Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin on Sunday praised Egypt's economic reforms at the opening
ceremony of the largest French trade fair ever held in the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt is reaping good results which other countries may envy,"
Jospin said at the ceremony with his Egyptian counterpart Kamal
El-Ganzouri.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has been following a restructuring and privatization
program under the International Monetary Fund guidance since the
early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
A five-day fair staged in Cairo's international conference
center, Francexpo 99 has been designed as a showcase of advanced
technology. It has attracted 200 French and other European
companies in the energy, financial, agricultural, high-tech and
other sectors.
</P>
<P>
France was determined to boost its political, economic and
cultural ties with Egypt, Jospin told a banquet Saturday night
several hours after his arrival.
</P>
<P>
France is Egypt's third largest trading partner. In 1998, trade
volume between the two countries amounted to 5.7 billion Egyptian
pounds (1.7 billion billion U.S. dollars). Egypt imports some 6 to
8 percent of its goods and technology from France.
</P>
<P>
Jospin and El-Ganzouri signed several agreements on Saturday.
The deals involve building two electrical power plants,
computerizing a library, contributing to agricultural, social and
environmental projects, and writing off 50 million dollars of
Egyptian debt.
</P>
<P>
Jospin's two-day visit is the first by a French prime minister
since 1992..

<HEADLINE> Iran Denies Possible Cabinet Reshuffle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Head of the Iranian presidential
office Mohammad Ali Abtahi on Sunday forcefully denied a report
that President Mohammad Khatami would reshuffle his cabinet.
</P>
<P>
There will be no change of any minister or member of Khatami's
government, Abtahi said to the Islamic Republic News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian conservative daily Tehran Times reported on
Thursday that President Khatami would make major changes in his
cabinet on the second anniversary of his election victory.
</P>
<P>
An informed source told the daily that reshuffle would include
four ministers of economy, road and transport, construction Jihad,
industries as well as the governor of the Central Bank of Iran
(CBI).
</P>
<P>
The current CIB Governor Mohsen Nourbakhsh will be replaced
by Rajabali Mazrooi, the economic advisor to President Khatami,
the source said, adding the replacements for the four ministers
are yet to be determined by the president.
</P>
<P>
The report on cabinet reshuffle came when Iranian conservative
Majlis (Parliament) demanded to impeach the moderate Minister of
Culture and Islamic Guidance Ataollah Mohajerani.
</P>
<P>
Mohajerani on Sunday defeated the impeachment motion and won
a vote of confidence from the Majlis.
</P>
<P>
Some Iranian newspapers believed that the rumor on cabinet
reshuffle was created by the conservatives against the moderate
supporters of President Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Khatami won a landslide victory on May 23, 1997 by
defeating the conservatives with the support of a coalition
formed by the left-wing and pragmatist reformist factions.

<HEADLINE> Sudanese, Eritrean Leaders in Doha for Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir
arrived in Qatar Sunday to meet with his Eritrean counterpart
Isayas Afrewerki, the Sudanese daily "Al Rai Al Am" reported.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders will hold talks later Sunday on the settlement
of disputes between the two countries and the normalization of
bilateral ties in the near future.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, to be chaired by Emir of Qatar Sheikh Hamad
Bin Khalifa al-Thani, a date is expected to be set for a four-way
meeting of the foreign ministers of Sudan, Eritrea, Qatar and
Libya to formulate a mechanism that ensures continued
Sudanese-Eritrean peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Afrewerki arrived in Doha, capital of Qatar on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Sudan and Eritrea severed diplomatic relations in 1994, trading
accusations that each supported the other's opposition groups.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese government has accused Eritrea of aiding Sudanese
rebels in the south fighting for greater autonomy for the
Christians. Eritrea has denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the Eritrean government had accused Sudan of
aiding Ethiopia in their border war which broke out in May 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Qatari government started its mediating efforts in 1998
between Sudan and Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
Sudan and Eritrea signed a memorandum of understanding in Doha
last November, pledging to settle their disputes peacefully.

<HEADLINE> Tourists Overwhelmed by Charm of Horti-Expo Garden </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Xu Xiuping and his family walked out
of the Greenhouse, feeling reluctant to leave, each wearing a
facial expression reading: "I want to see more."
</P>
<P>
"It's gorgeous," exclaimed Xu, a tourist from Luzhou City of
southwest China's Sichuan Province who took his family to the Expo
'99 garden. "It's simply a space-time experience."
</P>
<P>
One of the five major exhibition halls in the Expo venue, the
Large Greenhouse is only some 1,200 sq m in floor space, yet it
houses plants that belong to three totally different climatic
zones, namely, tropical, temperate and Alpine.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first landscape featuring the co-existence of
plants from multiple climatic zones ever built in China," said a
manager of the greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
Officially open to the public at midday on May 1, the 218-
hectare Expo garden already looked a bit crowded with a continuous
influx of Chinese and foreign visitors. The garden received at
least 20,000 visitors yesterday, and some 50,000 are expected
today.
</P>
<P>
There is a long, long queue at the entrance to the Large
Greenhouse, waiting patiently for an opportunity to experience
three different climatic conditions all at one time and to see
plants from different ecological environments growing under the
same roof. However, each visitor is allowed only six to seven
minutes inside it in order to beat the long queue.
</P>
<P>
Some one million plants of more than 2,000 species, including
several dozen extremely rare ones, have been moved into the Expo
garden reputed as a small "kingdom of global plants".
</P>
<P>
Li Guhui, a female student of Yunnan University, showed special
interest in a spinulose tree-fern or Cyatheaceae spp.in Latin in
the garden, a tree said to be thriving in the age of dinosaurs
some 300 million years ago. Gazing at the tree, she seemed to have
lost in thought.
</P>
<P>
"I did not dig deep into such kind of tree species," said Li. "
But its far remote past is really thought-provoking."
</P>
<P>
The Tang Dynasty Garden of Shaanxi Province, one of the 31
gardens built by China's provinces, municipalities and autonomous
regions, is also a place that holds back the steps of visitors.
The exotic gardens inspired special interest in Chinese visitors,
who marveled at their charm and exotic flavor.
</P>
<P>
"The venue is really too large, but the changing scenes never
make people tired," said a visitor.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Visitors Marvel At Kunming Horti-Expo Garden </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, May 2 (Xinhua) -- "Bravo!", "Magnificent!", "Really
unthinkable!". These are some of the words uttered by foreign
visitors after viewing the gardens of the China '99 International
Horticultural Exposition, which opened Saturday morning in the
northeastern suburbs of Kunming, capital of southwest China's
Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
"The world has given China a chance and China has returned with
a great and pleasant surprise," commented a foreign tourist who
visited the Exposition, a 218-hectare Disneyland-sized large
garden, shortly after its official opening.
</P>
<P>
When Dr. Ahmed Shamakh visited the International Outdoor
Exhibition Area three months ago, he saw practically nothing in
the place designated to the Egyptian Garden.
</P>
<P>
"It is the great assistance by our Chinese friends that has
made it possible to build this beautiful garden within such a
short period of time," noted Shamakh, now chief manager of the
Egyptian Garden, which boasts plants and architecture with unique
characteristics of Arab nations.
</P>
<P>
After viewing the Expo garden, Carlos Mladinic, minister of
agriculture of Chile, described the Kunming garden show as "very
impressive" in terms of both scale and quality.
</P>
<P>
The minister was echoed by Prof. Klaus Jacobi, former secretary
of state of Switzerland when he said that he had never expected to
see such a large and magnificent garden show in China.
</P>
<P>
"The theme of this Expo is coordinated development between man
and nature, and I have felt such coordination here in the garden,"
said French Ambassador to China Pierre Morel, who led a 20-member
French government delegation to the show.
</P>
<P>
Luzmila Zanabria, Peruvian Ambassador to China said that
Kunming is a very beautiful city with flowers and clean streets
and its agreeable weather and rich plant resources have reminded
her of her lovely hometown back in Peru.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said that, as a member of the Kunming Expo
Steering Committee, Peru is willing to contribute to the success
of the horticultural show.
</P>
<P>
"The Kunming Expo '99 is a great opportunity for China to
increase its exchanges with the rest of the world, and we're very
glad to see our close neighbor Yunnan play host to the grand event,
" said Dr. Bounmy Pabphavong, secretary-general of the Prime
Minister's Office of Laos, which borders on Yunnan.

<HEADLINE> Hand Grenade Injures 5 in Ugandan Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 2 (Xinhua) -- At least five people were injured in
a hand grenade explosion which occurred in Ugandan capital Kampala
at about 8:45 p.m. Saturday, a police source told Xinhua Sunday
morning.
</P>
<P>
John Kimera, deputy spokesman of the Ugandan police, said in a
telephone interview that the grenade was hurled at people drinking
at Serena pub near Calendar Rest House in Makindye.
</P>
<P>
"Five people were injured and they were taken to Nsambya
hospital and Mulago hospital. One lady, who suffered minor
injuries, was discharged this morning," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"The conditions of the injured are stable and they are out of
danger. All of them are Ugandans drinking to celebrate the
weekend," he added.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the motive of the blast, he said
investigations are still under way, so it is too early for him to
comment on it.  But he said the police are to make some arrests.
</P>
<P>
This is the fourth bomb blast in the capital city within one
month. The other three went off near a stadium, killing at least
ten people and injuring dozens of others.
</P>
<P>
The increasing insecurity has sent waves of panic among the
public in Kampala. Bomb scares are also on the rise. More than 50
people have been killed and over 170 injured when bomb started
going off here three years ago.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan President Calls for Protection of Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi has
said his government will ensure that a comprehensive law
protecting the rights of children is in place in the country.
</P>
<P>
The president disclosed the government's intention to table a
bill in the parliament soon which will cater for the diverse needs
of children in Kenya, the weekly Herald newspaper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during a recent fund-raising function in aid of
destitute children in the capital Nairobi, the president pledged
tireless efforts in support of activities organized to address
children's plight.
</P>
<P>
"I will willingly spare more of my time and spend more nights
out for harambees (fund-raising) and other functions in aid of
children in the country," he said.
</P>
<P>
Noting the widespread of HIV/AIDS pandemic, the president said
part of the money collected should be used to conduct research on
the spread of the virus through breast feeding.
</P>
<P>
Moi lamented that the killer disease was causing more and more
orphaned children to move to the streets in search of their daily
bread, and that children endured worst effects of economic,
physical and violence-related situation that hampered their growth
and development.
</P>
<P>
It is said that Kenya spends over 100 million shillings (about
1.6 million U.S. dollars) annually in the treatment of
AIDS-related infections.

<HEADLINE> HK to Take New Anti-drug Initiatives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Narcotics Division
will take a series of new initiatives to further promote anti-drug
education and publicity so as to greet the new battle against drug
abuse in the next Millennium.
</P>
<P>
The initiatives cover the key areas of drug preventive
education for schools and workplaces, community participation in
anti-drug programs, and provision of information on drug abuse to
the public.
</P>
<P>
Clarie Lo, commissioner for Narcotics, said here Sunday it was
proposed to establish a Drug Information Resource Center, revamp
the Action Committee against Narcotics' Youth Volunteer Group
(YVG) and forge partnership with the community.
</P>
<P>
The proposed resource center, which will centralize all
information on drug abuse, will provide those working in the
anti-drug field with a one-stop service for obtaining such
information, assist them in implementing and coordinating
anti-drug programs, and provide a permanent display on drugs and
involvement of the community in anti-drug activities.
</P>
<P>
On the YVG, she said the Hong Kong Narcotics Division plans to
recruit people from various professions and sectors, such as
medical doctors, social and youth workers, housewives and
retirees, whose skills and expertise can be tapped and put to good
use for anti-drug programs.
</P>
<P>
Lo said it was important to seek out opportunities for
organizing partnership programs with advisory councils, statutory
bodies and commercial organizations.
</P>
<P>
"Fast food chains or convenience stores frequented by young
people will be suitable and good partners," she said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the drug education programs should also be
delivered to school teachers, parents, social workers and school
principals.
</P>
<P>
After being equipped with relevant knowledge and skills on drug
education, those trainers could join hands in educating youngsters
about drug abuse and steering them away from drugs, she said.

SEOUL, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Asian soccer chief Peter Velappan on

<HEADLINE> Final Battle for Eradicating Polio Commences: WHO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The final battle for global
eradication of polio has commenced, and it now needs a major push
in South Asia and Africa to achieve the global target of zero
polio cases by December 2000, the World Health Organization (WHO)
said here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Globally, the polio eradication initiative is now entering its
final phase, as three regions of the world have achieved, or are
close to, eliminate polio virus transmission -- the Americas, the
Western Pacific Region, and the European region, WHO officials
told a press conference before a four-day meeting of the WHO's
Regional Office for South East Asia on vaccine preventable
diseases.
</P>
<P>
To reach the global target of zero polio cases by the end of
the year 2000, a massive campaign in South Asia and Africa is
needed, they said.
</P>
<P>
"If we are to finally wipe the disease off the face of the
earth, then we will have to better the excellent record of 90
percent coverage, already achieved," said Dr. Hardjotanojo, WHO
country representative to Bangladesh, representing WHO Regional
Director for South East Asia Dr. Uton Muchtar Rafei.
</P>
<P>
"At this stage, it is vital that every single child is reached
with polio vaccine, so that all children are covered," he said.
</P>
<P>
WHO, which is leading the international efforts to eradicate
polio by the year 2000, is convening the sixth annual meeting of
the Technical Consultative Group of the South-East Asia Region on
vaccine preventable diseases in Dhaka from May 3 to 6, to review
progress of the initiative and make recommendations about what
needs to be done.
</P>
<P>
The major theme of the annual meeting is "Immunize every child
because every child counts."
</P>
<P>
"Polio is now loosing the battle. The vaccine is winning," said
Jon Andrus, polio expert from WHO's regional office.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh has achieved 98 percent coverage for polio
immunization, according to Minister for Health and Family Welfare
Salahuddin Yusuf.
</P>
<P>
To ensure that all children are covered, the ministry would
launch a nationwide "mop up" campaign next December and January,
and conduct a National Immunization Week and track all children
under five years of age, said M. Amanullah, the state minister for
health and family welfare.
</P>
<P>
WHO's South-East Asia Region consists of 10 member countries --
Bhutan, Bangladesh, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, India,
Indonesia, Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Thailand,
constituting more than 25 percent of the world's population.
</P>
<P>
The region reports more than half the world's cases of polio
each year, with most the cases from India, followed by Bangladesh.
In 1998, some 4,121 cases of polio were reported in South Asia,
with almost half of them from India, and 312 cases from
Bangladesh.

<HEADLINE> Plant Might Be Killer of Dinosaur   ` </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The mysterious deaths were discovered in the Sichuan Basin by
Chinese scientists since the beginning of the 1970s. In Zigong
alone, fossils of more than 100 dinosaurs were unearthed within a
radius of three square kilometers. Most of them were vegetarians.
The discovery has led to many suppositions.
</P>
<P>
A group of Chinese paleontologists have studied fossil bones of
50 dinosaurs of the different stages of the Jurassic period
unearthed in the central, northern and southern parts of the
Sichuan basin with the fossils of fish, turtles and plants of the
corresponding periods as the contrast group.
</P>
<P>
Neutron activation analysis shows abnormality in the contents
of trace elements in the fossil bones of the dinosaurs.
</P>
<P>
"The contents of arsenic, chrome and other trace elements in
the fossil bones are apparently higher," said Li Kui, Curator of
the Museum of the Chengdu College of Polytechnics. "It was most
likely that the dinosaurs took in too much plants containing the
lethal trace elements."
</P>
<P>
The study of the plant fossils unearthed in the same places as
the dinosaurs revealed that the lethal arsenic content in the
plant fossils is also very high.
</P>
<P>
This may explain the mysterious massive deaths of the
vegetarian dinosaurs discovered in the Sichuan Basin, according to
the scientists.
</P>
<P>
Li disclosed the findings prior to the on-going Kunming
Horticultural Exposition, the largest garden festival in the world.
</P>
<P>
"We guess that the dinosaurs suffered from chronic arsenic
poisoning for too much intake of plants containing such lethal
trace element," he said. "When the lethal element accumulated long
enough, it caused dinosaurs to die one after another during a span
of dozens of years or even one hundred years. As the dinosaurs had
the schooling propensity, a concentration of fossil bones were
discovered," he explained.
</P>
<P>
Another group of scientists from Beijing University and the
National Geologic Testing Center arrived at similar conclusion
after studying a large concentration of fossil bones of dinosaurs
unearthed in north China's Shanxi province by using such methods
as the inductive coupling plasma spectrometry, atomic absorption
spectrometry and inductive coupling plasma mass spectrometry. They
discovered abnormally high contents of chrome and lead in the
fossil bones, thus speculating that environmental pollution or
food poisoning was an important factor leading to the massive
deaths.
</P>
<P>
In addition, there is abnormality in the content of rare-earth
in the fossil bones, which might be the result of absorbing too
much poisonous elements through the food chain, according to the
scientists.
</P>
<P>
Chinese paleontologists have also discovered similar phenomenon
in fossil dinosaur eggs, which they deemed that it was also
associated with the food intake by dinosaurs.
</P>
<P>
But, the scientists pointed out that the conclusion should not
be applied universally to the extinction of dinosaurs in all
places and the extinction of the giant reptile 65 million years
ago still remains a supreme mystery.

<HEADLINE> Fierce Fighting Continues for Control of Somali </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, May 2 (Xinhua) -- A fierce fighting began early
Sunday morning at Modeh-Modeh Village, about 50 km south of Baidoa
Town, in southern Somalia, between the forces of the Rahanwein
Resistance Army (RRA) and those of faction leader Hussein Mohamed
Aidid in a new round for the control of the town.
</P>
<P>
Over 23 battle wagons, including mine technical vehicles
mounted with double barrel anti-aircraft heavy machine guns, and
hundreds of heavily- armed militiamen loyal to Hussein Aidid left
Mogadishu Saturday night for the battle zones toward the important
town of Baidoa.
</P>
<P>
The huge armed campaign by Hussein Aidid was launched after the
RRA forces gained control of Baidoa, the regional capital,
Saturday afternoon. The town had been occupied by Hussein Aidid's
men in the past three years.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the town indicated that over ten people were
killed and nearly 20 others were wounded during the fighting.
However, neither side has talked about its casualties.
</P>
<P>
RRA spokesman Mohamed Ali Aden Qalinleh told reporters here in
Mogadishu briefly that the victory is significant for the morale
of his men who were forced to stay in the bush for years.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that a fierce fighting is now continuing near
Baidoa Town.
</P>
<P>
There's no official word from Hussein Aidid's side over the
fighting as yet, but militiamen who escaped the fighting Saturday
afternoon in Baidoa said they had not been defeated by the RRA
men.
</P>
<P>
However, early reports from the militiamen of Hussein Aidid
said three of their fighters had died in the fighting which began
in the morning, while six others have sustained gunshot wounds.
Baidoa is important for Hussein Aidid since it is a buffer zone
for his Ballidogle Airport which gives him revenues.

<HEADLINE> Emerging of Famers'Co-operatives Encouraged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 2 (Xinhua) -- China needs to encourage the
emerging farmers' co-operatives in view of their potentials to
lubricate the country's agricultural produce distribution system,
according to the China Daily Business Weekly today.
</P>
<P>
"The healthy development of this burgeoning force needs
government guidance, and even a law, if the rural economy is to be
kickstarted and farmers' income is to rise substantially," said
Zhu Shaoping, deputy director of the Economic Law Office of the
National People's Congress' Finance and Economic Committee.
</P>
<P>
He said local governments should be encouraged to set aside
part of their available agricultural funds for the launch of such
cooperatives, and they should not be taxed as enterprises, since
they are non-profit organizations.
</P>
<P>
"A law giving accurate definitions of the function, status,
rights, allocation of profits and losses and every other aspect of
the co-operatives, could bring this new type of organizations into
the fast lane," he said.
</P>
<P>
They have emerged in the Chinese countryside in recent years
with functions varying from vegetable planting in east China's
Shandong Province to crop harvesting in some parts of the
northwestern Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Members enjoy equal status in the association and comparatively
specialized services including marketing of products an provision
of materials by the co-operative.
</P>
<P>
These cooperatives shorten the distance between production and
sales, demand and supply, and promoted the circulation of
commodities between the city and countryside.
</P>
<P>
"Such organizations could open regular outlets in the cities
and pressure their counterparts with much lower prices because
they bypass the swollen secondary distribution chain that has been
pushing up agricultural product prices and fettering the growth of
farmers' income," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Choked distribution channels for agricultural produce have long
plagued China's rural economy. And it has also resulted in higher
prices and monotonous variety of industrial products as well as
agricultural materials in the rural market, which has aggravated
the domestic consumption inertia, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Unable to market their products at favorable prices, farmers'
enthusiasm has been dampened, making them reluctant to invest more
in technical upgrading and product development.
</P>
<P>
The authorities have taken a raft of measures to change the
situation, including reform of the existing co-operatives,
financing the distribution firms and regulating the price of grain.

<HEADLINE> Public Tendering Law to Ensure Quality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 2 (Xinhua) -- China plans to draft a public
tendering law to safeguard the quality of government-financed
projects.
</P>
<P>
"The law will stipulate that all projects funded by the State
budget must use public tendering," Li Rongrong, vice-minister of
the commission, said.
</P>
<P>
Li was talking recently about risk control related to the
massive infrastructure construction drive launched last year by
the government.
</P>
<P>
He said the spending on infrastructure since last year was
definitely the right choice to invigorate the economy and pave the
way for China's growth in the next century.
</P>
<P>
But the government also faces a challenge in ensuring the
quality of the projects, he said.
</P>
<P>
The challenge was highlighted by the recent collapse of a
government-funded bridge in Chongqing in Southwest China, which
killed 40 people.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the bridge was not open to public tendering.
</P>
<P>
Experts said less than 20 percent of public projects used
public bidding. And the bidding was treated as a formality by many
of the project managers that do use public tendering.
</P>
<P>
Li said the central government attached great importance to the
quality of projects in the infrastructure construction program.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the State Council held a national conference
on this topic, at which a regulation was passed stipulating that
proprietors and managers of the infrastructure projects would bear
a lifetime responsibility for them.

<HEADLINE> Three Spectators Killed by Debris at IRL Race </HEADLINE>

<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Three spectators were killed and
eight injured Saturday night when debris flew into the stand after
two cars crashed in the VisionAire 500 Indy Racing League (IRL) in
North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
"Right now, between eight and 10 people have been hospitalized,
and three people are confirmed dead," speedway spokesman Jerry
Gappens said.
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred when John Paul Jr. and Stan Wattles
slammed hard into the fourth-turn retaining wall on lap 61 of the
208-lap event. A racing tire, wheel and other debris from Wattles'
car went into the spectator area.
</P>
<P>
Both cars burst into flames but neither driver was seriously
injured. Several more laps were run under a caution flag before
spectators were informed of the tragedy and the race was canceled
by speedway president Humpy Wheeler.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time spectators have been killed in the 40-
year history of the track in North Carolina. But the incident was
similar to one last July at Michigan Speedway in which three
spectators were killed by a wheel and debris.

After two days of negotiations, a union spokesman said the only

</P>
<P>
But WNBA spokesman Mark Pray said, "There are a number of

</P>
<P>
No formal talks were held Wednesday while the sides considered
their positions.
</P>
<P>
"This is an issue we shouldn't even be talking about," said Pam
Wheeler, executive director of the union. "Our position is that
part of the draw and success of the WNBA has been the women
participating and helping charitable events. The limit would
prevent them from supporting these efforts."
</P>
<P>
The WNBA season is scheduled to begin on June 10. The labor
dispute forced the postponement of the player draft, scheduled

Players are now required to make 22 appearances, eight of them
commercial sponsors spots for which they are paid, four unpaid

</P>
<P>
"This team knew that Portland was still ahead of us, so this
was a huge win," Spurs center David Robinson said. "We couldn't
think of Utah. Now we have a little time to celebrate, but we have
to play Utah in 24 hours."
</P>
<P>
"I don't have any concerns about tomorrow," Spurs coach Gregg
Popovich said. "If I did, they wouldn't matter anyway because we
still play tomorrow."
</P>
<P>
If San Antonio wins its remaining three games, it would secure
the best record in the NBA and home-court advantage throughout the
playoffs. The Spurs have won 12 straight home games since a loss
to Toronto on March 26.
</P>
<P>
"We control our own destiny and that's a great situation to be
in," Duncan said. "It's in our hands and that's what we like."
</P>
<P>
Portland gave this one away, then nearly took it back.
Stoudamire scored his team's last six points of the fourth quarter,
including a jumper over Avery Johnson as time expired, forging an
83-83 tie.
</P>
<P>
Robinson had 26 points and 12 rebounds and Duncan added 19 and
12 for the Spurs, who overcame a 12-point second-quarter deficit
and won for the ninth time in 10 games.
</P>
<P>
San Antonio trailed 61-52 midway through the third period but
used a 16-7 run fueled by six points from Duncan to pull into a 68-
68 tie late in the quarter.

<HEADLINE> Thai Stock Rally Indicates Better Economic Situation(2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The stock market in Thailand saw a
rally in the past week, with the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET)
index gaining 58.28 points, or 14.5 percent, from the previous
weekend to 459.35 points on the last day of April.
</P>
<P>
On April 30 only, the SET index was up 26.86 points, or 6.2
points, after a 9.27-point increase the previous day. Now, the SET
index is 121.56 percent higher than its lowest level of 207.31 on
August 31, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the sharp upturn indicated that the
crisis-hit country is undergoing a recovery after traumatized by
the financial crisis and its aftermath for 17 months.
</P>
<P>
Undoubtedly, the Thai stock rally was boosted by the bullish
performance of Wall Street. The Dow-Jones 30 Industrials index has
broken through the 10,000 barrier, pushing Asian stocks to new
highs in recent months.
</P>
<P>
But the reason lies deeper is the improving situation of
Thailand's economy.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Thailand (BOT) on Friday officially confirmed in
its latest key economic data that the economy has reached its
bottom with the manufacturing production index in March rising to
59.7 percent from 54.7 percent the previous month.
</P>
<P>
The index, which measures actual production against industry's
total production capacity, recorded its second consecutive monthly
rise after recording declines since the country plunged into
recession in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the trade surplus rose to 987 million U.S. dollars,
with monthly exports and imports showing growth in March.
</P>
<P>
The BOT figures showed that exports in March shot up 1.5
percent to an estimated 4.78 billion dollars compared to the same
period last year. March imports also increased 5.6 percent to 3.79
billion dollars, the highest level since January 1998.
</P>
<P>
The central bank also said that inflation in March continued to
fall to 1.6 percent, resulting from a significant deceleration in
prices on food items which rose just 0.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The bank's data also noted that the Thai government's cash
balance for the month posted a surplus of 3.9 billion baht (105.4
million dollars). Its revenue increased by 10 percent from the
same period last year mainly due to the increase in corporate
income tax collection.
</P>
<P>
International reserves of Thailand at the end of March also
grew to 29.9 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
And after facing a deficit of 447 million dollars in January
standing at 1.3 billion, which reflected an inflow of both
official and private funds into the economy. More

......and private funds into the economy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, with the fall of interest rates, local commercial
banks are resuming lending as the BOT's data indicated that their
credit extension in March accounted for 4.78 trillion baht (129
billion dollars), or a 2.7 percent rise year-on-year.
</P>
<P>
The Thai cabinet in its weekly meeting on April 27 acknowledged
that the interbank rates has declined from 2.73 percent per year
in January 1999 to 2.25 percent in March, while the one-day
repurchasing rates has dropped to 1.87 percent.
</P>
<P>
The low interest rates created a better liquidity situation for
the country, especially the private sector, with total amount of
capital fund in the private sector reaching 77.2 billion baht
(2.08 billion dollars) in January and February 1999 compared to
24.6 billion baht (664.8 million dollars) in the fourth quarter of
1998.
</P>
<P>
The low interest rate environment has also fueled confidence
among foreign investors and will ease the pain of corporate and
economic restructuring.
</P>
<P>
Low interest rates help keep assets at relatively high price
With these favorable economic indexes, foreign investors became
quite enthusiastic about putting money into the Thai market.
</P>
<P>
It helps to stable the rating of Thai leading banks by Moody,
and became the direct stimulus for Friday's rocketing stock
index.
</P>
<P>
The bull run of the stock revived some Thai people's memory of
their pre-crisis good old days.
</P>
<P>
But Moody, while adjusting its outlook, warned that the Thai
banks are "extremely weak". It also cautioned that financial
markets should not expect a quick economic turnaround for the
country since the economy has been deteriorated badly.
</P>
<P>
Ness, head of the Asia-Pacific Department if the International
Monetary Fund (IMF), said recently: "as long as medium-term money
is needed, it is welcome." But he warned of the prospect of a
short-lived stock market rally if the regional stock market
buoyancy should be based on progress in the economies and
continued policy implementation, in particular the banking reforms
and corporate restructuring.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Mulls Free Trade Deal with Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka is mulling to reach a free
trade deal with Pakistan in a bid to help salvage the slump-hit
tea following an unsuccessful trade agreement with India,
officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A delegation of Sri Lankan industry officials is expected to
leave for Pakistan this month to prepare the ground work to
conclude the bilateral free trade agreement.
</P>
<P>
The tea industry here hopes to boost tea sale through a
bilateral free trade agreement recently proposed by Sri Lankan
President Chandrika Kumaratunga.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan is the third largest importer of tea, second only to
Britain and Russia, and is expected to become the world's largest
consumer of tea within a decade.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka exported 30 million kilograms of tea to Pakistan in
1980 and became the largest single exporter to that market then.
</P>
<P>
But in recent years Pakistan retail stores are flooded with
Kenyan tea which accounts for 45 percent of the market while Sri
Lanka's share has dwindled to three percent.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka hopes that the treaty will ensure tariff concessions
to tea, making Ceylon tea more competitive against the cheap
Kenyan teas, and also allow Pakistan to increase its exports to
this Indian Ocean island.
</P>
<P>
A similar agreement between Sri Lanka and India was to have
gone into effect on March 1, but the deal was postponed when India
withdrew promised tariff concessions to Sri Lankan tea.

<HEADLINE> Mozambicans' Life Improved: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Prime Minister Pascoal
Mocumbi said here Saturday that the living standard of the
Mozambican people has improved thanks to the continuous economic
development in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
"No doubt we are living a better life," the prime minister told
a rally in capital Maputo marking May Day, the International Labor
Day.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican government's policy is bearing fruits, Mocumbi
said, adding that the gross domestic product (GDP) last year grew
by over 10 percent, one of the highest in the southern African
region.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate in 1998 was only one percent while it was
between 60 percent to 65 percent during 1994 and 1995, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Because of the lowering inflation these years, he pointed out,
aggregatively, the minimum real income has increased by 38
percent, which means the buying power of the workers could become
better.
</P>
<P>
The minimum income has increased from 353,000 meticais (one
U.S. dollar equals to 12,500 meticais) to 450,000 meticais at
present while pension has gone up from 212,000 meticais to 270,000
meticais, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the prime minister admitted that two-thirds of the
16.5 million Mozambicans are still living under the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
Mocumbi said that one of the great challenges facing the
government, employers and the working people is poverty.
</P>
<P>
He urged the whole society to mobilize all capacity to enable
more people to live a better life.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the same function, Mozambican President
Joaquim Chissano also called upon his fellow Mozambicans to exert
their efforts to eradicate hunger and poverty and build up a
fairer society.
</P>
<P>
As long as poverty is not eliminated, there will be no fair
society in the country, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
General Secretary of the Mozambican Labor's Organization,
Joaquim Fanheiro complained that privatization has created a lot
of unemployed workers, saying that some 116,000 workers have been
unemployed since Mozambique introduced the structural reforms in
1987 and only a small part of them found job again.
</P>
<P>
The labor leader urged the government and the society to pay
more attention to the issue of unemployment and help to resolve
the practical problems for those unemployed.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of workers participated in the rally and parade
celebrating the Labor Day.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Seek Debt Relief at Paris Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania will request aid and
debt relief from donor countries and multilateral institutions at
a meeting in Paris next week.
</P>
<P>
The Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Finance, Raphael
Mollel, said this Friday evening before his departure for Paris to
attend a two-day Consultative Group Meeting (CGM) which starts
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is very vital because the decision made during the
session is crucial to the country's budget frame, among other
things, media reports Saturday quoted Mollel as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Paris meeting is a forum where major donor countries and
multilateral institutions jointly meet individual countries to
review funded projects and agree on future terms of cooperation,
he explained.
</P>
<P>
The permanent secretary is going to Paris along with Minister
of Finance Daniel Yona and Minister of State in the President's
Office Wilson Masilingi.
</P>
<P>
The delegation also includes officials from the Planning
Commission, the Presidential Parastatal Sector Reform Commission
(PSRC), Bank of Tanzania, the Zanzibar government, as well as
people from the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Mollel was optimistic that "representatives from donor
countries and multilateral institutions will respond positively to
our request in the light of the major reforms being undertaken by
the government plus adherence to several agreed benchmarks
including those of the World Bank. "
</P>
<P>
Burdened with a heavy debt of some eight billion U.S. dollars,
this east African country's health and education services have
been deteriorating as 30 percent of the revenue has been used for
debt servicing.
</P>
<P>
He said that the main theme of the meeting is macro-economic
prospects and public expenditure.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's policy and framework papers and the World Bank report
on support of the government's anti-corruption programs would be
presented on the first day.
</P>
<P>
A paper on public expenditure management in Tanzania and the
country's external financing requirements will be presented on
Tuesday, he added.
</P>
<P>
He further said that participants at the meeting will look
into real terms surrounding the underlying and headline inflation
and the performance of inflation, gross domestic product (GDP),
money supply and the exchange rate regime.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the issue of liberalization of petroleum industry
will also be discussed at the meeting, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the last Consultative Group Meeting in 1997, donors pledged
about one billion dollars to assist Tanzania to meet its
development needs.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Orders Oil Embargo Against Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton on
Saturday extended U.S. economic sanctions against Yugoslavia to
most goods and services including oil while Belgrade agreed to
release three U.S. prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
"With these strengthened sanctions, we will diminish the
Belgrade regime's ability to continue its campaign of repression
and defiance," Clinton said in a written statement issued by the
White House.
</P>
<P>
The new rules provide the administration with the legal means
to apply the expanded sanctions agreed to last weekend at the
summit of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the sanctions would be applied "with consideration
for the humanitarian needs of displaced people in Kosovo and other
civilians, and consistent with our new policy of exempting from
sanctions commercial sales of food and medicine."
</P>
<P>
The order he issued prohibits imports and exports between the
United States and Yugoslavia "of goods, software, technology, or
services," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Exempted humanitarian goods would include food and medicine.
Such shipments would be allowed only if the U.S. company exporting
the items could guarantee the supplies would not go to Yugoslav
military forces.
</P>
<P>
The measure would also prohibit the sale of U.S. goods to a
third country if in turn it shipped them to Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the White House reacted cautiously on Saturday to
the report that three U.S. servicemen being held in Yugoslavia
will be released, but said it would be a positive development.
</P>
<P>
Civil rights leader Jesse Jackson, in Belgrade for talks with
Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic, spoke via telephone with White
House National Security Adviser Sandy Berger about the release
expected on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"Berger told him that 'obviously the release of the American
servicemen would be a positive development,'" said White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart.

<HEADLINE> China Encourages Use of Clean Energy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 2 (Xinhua) -- After five years of consideration,
the Chinese government is to shift its energy strategy towards the
use of more natural gas and away from coal as pressure for
environmental protection mounts.
</P>
<P>
The government is considering ending decades of rigid control
over pricing the clean energy, the China Daily Business Weekly
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The controls will be lifted next year as conditions mature, the
paper quoted Ma Shenyuan, a deputy division chief of the State
Administration of Petroleum and Chemical Industries, as saying.
</P>
<P>
In their place will be pricing formulas to ensure the interests
of both suppliers and end-users and State surveillance to prevent
abuse of market-power by monopoly providers.
</P>
<P>
Standards on internationally-accepted take-or-pay contracts
will be prepared.
</P>
<P>
Together with a compensation mechanism, the take-or-pay rule
will help encourage participation by foreign governments and
companies.
</P>
<P>
Natural gas development and transmission in high-pressure
pipeline is usually risky. In China, major reserves are all
verified in the remote west while most energy-thirsty cities are
concentrated in the booming east, thousands of kilometers apart.
</P>
<P>
The possibility of buying resources from Russia increases the
necessity of a nationwide pipeline network, a must for supply
stability.
</P>
<P>
Supplementary to the network will be underground storage
facilities. Construction of the first of these, estimated to cost
up to 500 million yuan (60 million U.S. dollars), is to be started
this year.
</P>
<P>
China will launch into its program of development and use of
clean energy early in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Annual use of natural gas in the country will be increased from
last year's 22 billion cubic meters to 80 billion in 2010,
according to the administration's deputy director, Chen Geng.
</P>
<P>
The policies are to be decided by the State Council. Industry
officials are optimistic, saying that the central government looks
set to fight against the economic slowdown by increasing
government spending. Expensive pipelines need support from the
State budget.

</P>
<P>
He also announced the bank's next annual meeting will be held
in Chiang Mai, Thailand.
</P>
<P>
During the three-day meeting, governors of the bank's 57
members have examined the performance of the Asian and Pacific
region and the performance of the bank.
</P>
<P>
Governors noted that while the region is beginning to show
signs of recovery, there are still many challenges during the
recovery phase.
</P>
<P>
"A number of governors underscored the need for accelerated
reforms to ensure a return to growth," Chino said.
</P>

COLOMBO, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan navy destroyed a cargo of
the liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) off the Mullaitivu
coast in Northern Province of the country Saturday night, the navy
sources said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The sources said navy fast attack craft were fighting a bitter
sea battle off the Mullaitivu coast with the LTTE boats smuggling
in military supplies from a ship in international waters.
</P>
<P>
One heavily laden boat from a logistic convoy of five boats was
destroyed. The others were being engaged but no immediate reports
were available, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Early Saturday, a Sri Lankan air force reconnaissance flight
confirmed the presence of an unidentified ship, some 80 to 90
miles north east of Mullaitivu.
</P>
<P>
The navy craft moved into the area after they received
information that a ship was due to unload military cargo in the
deep seas of Mullaitivu, the sources stated.
</P>
<P>
They added that later it was confirmed to be a ship from which
the cargo had been unloaded to the logistics boats.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has been fighting 16-year war against the government
for a separate state in the north and east of island country.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Chess Aims at Creating Junior World Champion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the Indonesian Chess
Federation Bambang N. Rachmadi has pledged to push ahead to create
an Indonesian world champion during his tenure.
</P>
<P>
Bambang, who is also the owner of McDonald's Indonesia,
Saturday took over the reins from Akbar Tanjung, who is Minister/
State Secretary, for the period 1999-2003.
</P>
<P>
"I'm anxious to see the emergence of a new Indonesian world
champion by the time my post finishes in 2003," Bambang was quoted
by The Indonesian Observer Sunday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has a strong chess player Utut Adianto, now ranked 50
th in the world. However, given the world chess power map, the
country will relish the challenge in the junior categories.
</P>
<P>
Most prospects are in the 10 and 12 year old age groups, in
which Andrean Susilodinata, Taufik Halay and Susanto Megaranto
have turned in impressive performances.
</P>
<P>
Apart from their domination in the domestic competition, the
three have also represented Indonesia in international arenas and
must be considered as serious contenders for the championship, he
said.
</P>
<P>
In the junior world championship in Spain last October, Taufik,
12, managed a place in the top ten in his class although 10-year-
old Susanto slipped to a mediocre ranking.
</P>
<P>
The most striking run was shown by Andrean. Only nine years old,
he managed to break into the top flight in his first ever
appearance in international matches.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to improve Indonesian chess, the federation has set
out to stage as many tournaments as possible at home as well as
urged the provincial federations to hold their own competitions.
</P>
<P>
"By holding many events, we hope to expose chess to a wider
network of potential sponsors," said Bambang.

<HEADLINE> Guangzhou Takes Back Unused Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Despite the revival of land auctions
in neighboring Hong Kong, the capital of south China's Guangdong
Province is to restrict auctions of new land this year, according
to today's China Daily Business Weekly.
</P>
<P>
Unused land in the Guangzhou market totals 2,859 hectares.
</P>
<P>
All that will be brought under the hammer is land that had been
idle in the hands of the previous owners and taken back by the
Guangzhou municipal government, according to Jin Gengsheng, deputy
director of the Guangzhou Administration of Land and Real Estate.
</P>
<P>
"This move is to give enough time for the market to digest the
large amount of unused land," he said.
</P>
<P>
The existence of the unused land not only wastes the decreasing
land resources in the city, but also has stopped the government
regulating and controlling the real estate market effectively, and
it even gives some speculating developers the chance to get land
from other channels than public auctions and biddings, according
to Jin.
</P>
<P>
Jin's point of view was echoed by many local real estate
analysts, who held that the control of land supply is of great
significance in reining in real estate development and easing the
oversupply of commodity housing.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou continued to expand its investment in real estate,
pushing it up 13.75 percent to 3.83 billion yuan (461.4 million U.
S. dollars), and new construction projects soared by 87.2 percent
to 1.68 million square meters.
</P>
<P>
But because of a drop in sales of over 20 percent, the city has
accumulated about 2.7 million square meters of empty commodity
housing, up 58 percent from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The Guangzhou municipal government started to take back usage
rights for land that had been unused for at least two years in
August 1997 when it issued special regulations to deal with the
problem.

BEIJING, May 2 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to take more
radical and effective measures to reform official car supply
system in a bid to stimulate car consumption, a senior official

</P>
<P>
The reform of the system will take place soon, but significant

But Zheng did not give a concrete schedule for the beginning of

being deprived of the right to use sedans for free.

He proposed that price controls over cars should be lifted to
encourage fair competition in the car market so that "car
manufacturers could tackle the challenge posed by China's
prospective entry into the World Trade Organization."
</P>
<P>
Zheng said that spending on housing and cars were supposed to
become the two focal points for social consumption, but the
prerequisite for making the huge demand turn into actual purchases
is to remove the welfare benefits allocation system.
</P>
<P>
Consumption in the form of benefits, welfare supply and
institutional spending has become the major barrier to rapid
progress in the two sectors, Zheng said.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, urban residents' spending on housing accounted for 8.6
percent of their total consumption and; in contrast, rural
residents' spending on housing accounted for 14.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
There are about 13 million motor vehicles in use throughout
China, of which 30 percent belong to individuals. Most of the
privately owned vehicles are in use in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, 2.6 million farming vehicles were sold to farmers who
use them for both production and transportation, also at their own
expense.
</P>
<P>
To further expand domestic demand is the key to maintaining the
economic growth momentum this year, so the government needs to
take a "a series of measures to facilitate consumer spending,"
Zheng said.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Looks to More Tea Sales to Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's tea industry looks to
boost tea exports to Libya following the lifting of economic
sanctions imposed by the United Nations earlier last month, press
reports here said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"The tea trade in Colombo looks to the possibility of more
regularized purchases of tea by Libya as well as an increase in
the quantum," the Sunday Times quoted a leading tea broker's
market report as saying.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has been the main supplier of tea to Libya,
accounting for around 75 to 80 percent of Libyan imports.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, Libya imported 13.6 million kilos from Sri Lanka.
Libya was also Sri Lanka's second largest export market for
packaged tea.
</P>
<P>
"Tea imports in recent years have shown fluctuations but could
be estimated to average around 15 million kilos per year," the
market report said.
</P>
<P>
Libya has a population of 5.5 million people and has a per
capita gross domestic product (GDP) of around 5,000 U.S. dollars.
Crude oil is said to account for almost 90 percent of Libyan
exports and around 70 percent of the total budget.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council suspended the sanctions
against Libya on April 5 after Secretary-General Kofi Annan
officially confirmed the two Libyans accused of the 1988 Pan Am
jet bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland, had arrived in the
Netherlands for trial.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions, imposed in 1992 and tightened in 1993, included
an air and arms embargo as well as a ban on some oil equipment.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Libya's overseas financial assets were frozen but this
excluded moneys derived from oil sales after December 1, 1993.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan tea trade is looking for a boost amidst flagging
tea exports, partly due to the financial crisis in Russia as the
Commonwealth of Independent States was the largest buyer of Ceylon
tea.

<HEADLINE> China Issues Commemorative Stamps for Kunming Horti-Expo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, May 2 (Xinhua) -- China has issued a set of two
commemorative stamps to mark the May 1 opening of the China '99
International Horticultural Exposition in Kunming, capital of
southwest China's Yunnan Province, local posts authorities said
here today.
</P>
<P>
The stamps were released by the State Administration of Postal
Services Saturday morning first in Kunming and then in other parts
of the country. One stamp features the design of a pretty camellia
native to Yunnan against the background of the design of the earth
held up by the hands of the people with different skin colors. The
other bears the design of an exuberant lush green tree against the
background of two major exhibition halls at the Kunming garden
show.
</P>
<P>
The designs of the stamps were intended to reflect the theme of
the Kunming horticultural show: Man and Nature, Marching Into the
21st Century, according to the designers.
</P>
<P>
Tourists visiting the Expo garden in the northeastern suburbs
of Kunming can buy the stamps, first-day covers and souvenir
albums in a special post office there. However, post office
employees said that the first stock of stamps were sold out within
a few hours after the release.

<HEADLINE> One More Power Plant Opens in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, May 2 (Xinhua) -- One more power plant -- Hlawga
Combined Recycle Power Plant -- of Myanmar Electric Power
Enterprise of the Ministry of Electric Power opened Saturday in
Mingaladon township, Yangon, the capital of Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Under a contract signed by Myanmar government and Marubeni
Corporation of Japan on March 24, 1997, the 54 megawatts combined
recycle power plant was installed at a cost of 28.29 million U.S.
dollars and 371.752 million kyats (1.239 million dollars) in June
1997 and was completed at the end of April, two months earlier
than scheduled.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, the installed capacity of
state-run Myanmar Electric Power Enterprise, the main electricity
supplier in the country, was only 1,248 megawatts (mw) as of the
end of 1998, while the units generated by the enterprise in 1998
were merely 4.309 billion kilowatt-hours (kwh), 487 million kwh
less than the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has been running short of electricity for many years.
In efforts to resolve the power shortage problem, Myanmar reached
some agreements with two Chinese companies last year to implement
three hydropower projects in Mandalay, Magway and Sagaing
divisions.
</P>
<P>
The authorities have been asking local subscribers to reduce
their power consumption as much as they can, especially in the
capital of Yangon that covers the areas of foreign embassies.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Myanmar is planning to purchase power from
neighboring Thailand.

<HEADLINE> Swedish Parties Urge NATO to Stop Bombing Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The leaders of major political
parties in Sweden urged NATO to stop bombing Yugoslavia and seek a
political solution to the Kosovo crisis in their speeches made to
mark the International Labor day.
</P>
<P>
NATO's attacks against Yugoslavia dominated most rallies and
demonstrations on the Labor Day as many Swedish people denounced
NATO's continued air raids.
</P>
<P>
Goran Perrson, Swedish Prime Minister and President of the
ruling Social Democratic Party (SDP), told a rally outside the
capital that the "Balkan war should be ended" and the Balkan
conflict needs a "political solution."
</P>
<P>
Gudrun Schyman, president of Sweden's third largest party, the
Left Party, said at her party's rally on the outskirts of the
capital that the NATO bombing should be halted immediately.
</P>
<P>
The bombing cannot lead to a settlement but only cause
casualties of innocent people, said Schyman.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Anna Lindh said at a SDP rally in central
Sweden that the war prompted by the Kosovo conflict demonstrated
again that measures should be taken to strengthen the United
Nations' capability and efficiency in maintaining order in the
world.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 300,000 people attended celebration activities
organized by major Swedish political parties on the Labor Day.
Many participants of the activities hold slogans denouncing NATO's
air strikes against Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Insurers Told to Wise Up to Computers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The insurance industry today relies
heavily on information technology not only to store its
underwriting information but also to acquire, store and analyze
all financial, internal, external, macro- and microeconomic data,
according to China Daily Business Weekly today.
</P>
<P>
The computer was just used to automatically produce renewal
notices and perhaps to produce account statements to replace
primitive punch cards storing key data, when it was first applied
in the insurance sector 35 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Governing committee member of the Hong Kong Federation of
Insurers and general manager of Guardian Insurance Ltd., Steven
Lau, said that the technology not only changes consumers' buying
patterns and but requires insurers to anticipate and adapt to
these changes as well.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Guojun from Huatai Insurance Co. said he believed that
the technology would help insurance firms increase their
competitiveness by improving management efficiency, upgrading
service and enhancing their ability in quick reaction to market
changes.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the development of the Internet is changing
traditional marketing methods for insurance products.
</P>
<P>
"The Internet makes round-the-clock marketing possible," said
Frank Lee, deputy general manager of the China Ping'an Insurance
Co., when he commented on the part of the Internet in the
insurance industry.
</P>
<P>
New China Life Insurance Co. delivered its first web life
policy last year. And China Ping'an has attempted to sell policies
through the Internet. Its home page contains columns on insurance
information, proposals and the procedures on purchasing insurance
products.
</P>
<P>
"We must expect that the trend will continue and it will
require considerable effort, resources, investment and commitment
to keep our industry competitive in the next millennium," Lau told
a Mainland-Hong Kong insurance conference held last week in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
To create business value from any IT investment, Lau from
Guardian Insurance added, it must be accompanied by a number of
other activities such as analyzing and changing business processes
and creating a rule-driven administration and underwriting
environment.

<P>
LONDON, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion John Higgins
became a victim in a semifinal match against Mark Williams of
Wales when he lost at 17-10 at the World Snooker Championships in
Sheffield, England on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
There was disappointment too for the mercurial Ronnie
O'Sullivan who missed out on a special pay-out of nearly 270,000 U.
S. dollars on the way to losing 17-13 to former champion Stephen
Hendry.
</P>
<P>
Trailing 14-10 overnight, Scotsman Higgins faced a big task in
the best of 33-frame match and Williams raced into his first final
with scores of 119-0, 81-21, 67-42.
</P>
<P>
Hendry and O'Sullivan were tied at 12-12 going into the last
session and the Englishman took the first frame to make it 13-12.
</P>
<P>
But the Scot, six times a world champion, roared back to take
the next five frames to book his place in the final, starting on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Defeat compunded O'Sullivan's woes. Earlier in the day he had
been in line for a highly lucrative maximum 147 break but narrowly
missed the pink, the penultimate ball.
</P>
<P>
The miss cost him a massive 167,000 pounds (269,200 U.S.
dollars)in special bonuses.

LONDON, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Victory over Aston Villa put the
Manchester United back to the top place of the English Premier
League soccer competition on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Manchester United won the match when an own goal from Steve
Watson and a blistering second-half free kick from David Beckham
gave them a 2-1 win over Aston Villa at Old Trafford.
</P>
<P>
United could even afford a Denis Irwin penalty miss as they
moved on to 71 points from 34 matches, two more points than
Arsenal who have also played 34 matches.
</P>
<P>
Defending champions Arsenal, though, have the chance of going
top again when they play Derby County at Highbury on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Chelsea kept themselves in the title race by moving on to 68
points from 35 matches with a 3-1 home win over Everton with two
goals from Gianfranco Zola and one from Dan Petrescu.
</P>
<P>
Leeds, who still have a slim mathematical chance of winning the
title, won 5-1 at West Ham who finished with only eight men after
striker Ian Wright, goalkeeper Shaka Hislop and midfielder Steve
Lomas were all sent off.
</P>
<P>
Leeds took the lead through Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink after only
19 seconds with Alan Smith, Ian Harte (penalty), Lee Bowyer and
Alf-Inge Haaland adding the others. They have now qualified for
next season's UEFA Cup.
</P>
<P>
The relegation battle between Charlton Athletic and Blackburn
Rovers ended 0-0 at The Valley, while Southampton, also battling
against the drop, beat Leicester 2-1 at The Dell.
</P>
<P>
At the bottom, Southampton have 35 points, Blackburn 33 and
Charlton 33, with Blackburn having played a match fewer than the
other two. Already relegated Nottingham Forest beat Sheffield
Wednesday 2-0.

<HEADLINE> Consumer Credit Booming In Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 2 (Xinhua) -- China's largest metropolis, which
pioneered individual housing loans in the country, is witnessing a
fast-growing and diversified consumer credit businesses locally.
</P>
<P>
Housing loans for local residents had reached 19.34 billion
yuan by March, nearly 3.19 billion more than the early part of the
year. During the first quarter of the year, 3.9 billion yuan of
housing loans were extended to local individuals, a big rise on a
yearly basis.
</P>
<P>
The growth of commercial individual housing loans runs faster
than that for the loans from the public-accumulated housing fund.
Individual housing loans which haven't been repaid on time are
only tens of millions of yuan.
</P>
<P>
The business of granting loans to automobile buyers is gearing
up in Shanghai and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and
the Construction Bank of China branches granted a combined 39
million yuan of loans for local automobile purchasers during the
first quarter of the year.
</P>
<P>
All commercial banks locally rival each other by providing
loans for a variety of consumer durables like household appliances,
computers, furniture and physical fitness equipment.
</P>
<P>
They have also introduced a housing loans program for local
farmers and migrant residents in the city and offer other new
facilities such as loans for housing decoration and mortgages for
housing auctions.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Pudong Development Bank also leads the country in
offering loans of educational tuition and living expenses for
students in universities and colleges.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the banks are preparing for increased consumer credit
demand covering tourism, education, agricultural-use materials and
farm machines within the next year.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Branch of the People's Bank of China has decided
to allocate 10 percent of its loans granted for the year to
consumer credit.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the local branch of the Industrial and
Commercial Bank of China also intends to extend three billion yuan
of consumer credit loans this year.

WUHAN, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese engineers have designed a
floating "damage-proof coating" to protect the piers of Yangtze
River Bridge from crash damage by shipping.
</P>
<P>
Four piers of the Highway Bridge at Huangshi City in central

<HEADLINE> China Steps Up Effort to Protect Wetlands in Dongting Lake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The Hunan Provincial Government
will invest heavily in the next few years to protect the wetland
resources in Dongting Lake, one of the nation's largest freshwater
lake in Hunan Province.
</P>
<P>
The eastern section of the lake has recently been included into
China's capital construction plan for state-class nature reserves
with the approval of the State Forestry Administration.
</P>
<P>
Since the early 1980s, the central government has beefed up its
effort to protect the wetlands in the lake, and three nature
reserves with an area of 350,000 ha, or three-fourths of the
lake's total area, have been set up to protect wetlands and
migrant birds.
</P>
<P>
However, increasing economic development and human activities
around the lake have caused damages to the wetlands, which play a
vital role in water conservation, and the prevention and control
of erosion and flooding.
</P>
<P>
The wetlands in the lake have been included on the 1993
International Important Wetland List.
</P>
<P>
The lake area has been shrinking at an annual rate of 16 sq km
over the past years and the storage capacity for Dongting Lake has
been reduced by 40 percent, according to the Hunan Provincial
Forestry Protection Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The Dongting Lake is home to some 16,000 migrant birds in
winter. Rare species wintering in the area include, among others,
Siberian white cranes, oriental white storks and lesser white-
breasted geese.

<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Peace for Kosovo and an end to NATO
bombings were the main demands made in the May Day rallies held in
several Spain's cities.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of workers took part in the meetings in Madrid,
Barcelona, Sevilla and other cities called by the General Workers
Union (UGT) and the Workers Commissions of the Labor Unions
Confederation.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators carried Yugoslav flags, cardboard mock-ups of
missiles and many placards with legends that said "Let us stop the
war, we want peace."
</P>
<P>
Workers Commissions general secretary Antonio Gutierrez
stressed the need to link up all peace activists in Europe to
prevent war from continuing and give a peaceful solution to the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
UGT secretary general Candido Mendez demanded to stop "urgently
and peacefully" the war in Kosovo and the return of the United
Nations intervention organizations.
</P>
<P>
Mendez said what is occurring in Kosovo is "the most terrible
war suffered by mankind."
</P>
<P>
Julio Anguita, United Left coordinator, who attended the
rallies in Madrid, said that "NATO must be asked to go, which is
there massacring the people."
</P>
<P>
Fernando Moran, Socialist Party candidate to the Madrid
mayoralty, wants "a new international order that will not be
determined by a single superpower."
</P>

that hegemony."

<HEADLINE> Northeast China Enhances Supervision On Overseas Study Consultative Agencies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Liaoning Province
has recently closed down some 300 illegal consultative agencies on
overseas study, according to Zhang Rongming, vice-governor of the
province.
</P>
<P>
A significant reduction in job opportunities in the heavy
industrial base and the further implementation of the opening up
policy have inspired more Chinese students to go abroad for
advanced study. And, as a result, more and more consultative
institutions have appeared in the province.
</P>
<P>
The agencies closed down include those without registration or
which do not satisfy the set requirements, and also those cheating
students over contracts.
</P>
<P>
The Liaoning Provincial Educational Committee, together with
the Provincial Bureau of Commerce and Industry, has issued
certificates to 53 consultative agencies, including the overseas
study service center attached to the Dalian Institute of Foreign
Languages and the Shenyang International Technological Exchange
Association.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning required that the amount of fees for consultative
services be confirmed by the price administrative departments, and
contracts be signed between students and the related agencies. It
insists that compensation be paid by the organizations to the
students if the offered information does not agree with the actual
condition of the foreign schools.
</P>
<P>
And also every agency is asked to turn in 200,000 yuan (24,000
U.S. dollars) to the provincial educational committee as an
insurance to pay up for any possible losses when the rights of the
students have been violated.

"I'm not prepared to admit that Chernomyrdin's mission has

</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin was back in Belgrade Friday continuing Russia's
efforts to persuade Yugoslavia to accept a presence of
multinational force including Russia under the aegis of the UN in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Belgrade has so far adamantly ruled out any presence of the
countries that have been bombing it, saying that it would accept a
UN-sponsored military force in Kosovo but later added this force
would have to be disarmed.
</P>
<P>
Italian Defense Minister Carlo Scognamiglio Friday said a
United Nations Security Council resolution could be the way out of
the Kosovo impasse.
</P>
<P>
He said that the most important development from Russian envoy
Viktor Chernomyrdin's mission to Belgrade had been the narrowing
of differences that appeared to make a UN Security Council
resolution possible.

This formula, Prodi added, "is necessary in a much stronger and
specific way" for Kosovo which in the future "must have strong
autonomy in but not independence" from Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
A future conference on the Balkans, Prodi explained, should not
be "a conference for one nation or two or three countries but for
the entire area where there cannot be nations nor regions which
are first class or second class. EU will strengthen political,
economic and institutional relations with these countries."
</P>
<P>
"They cannot become members of the European Union in the
immediate or near future," he said, adding that "limited ties can
be established with political organs, and Europe must offer a
