	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Powerful Typhoon Babs swept across
the central Philippines toward Manila Thursday, ripping roofs off
bamboo houses, triggering landslides and forcing widespread
evacuations.
	   Disaster officials said at least two people were killed and two
others were injured by the storm. In Camarines Sur province, three
fishermen were missing after they were washed away by surging
waves.
	   Schools, government offices and many businesses were closed in
Manila as the capital prepared for a predicted direct hit by the
storm.
	   ``We are advising people to evacuate if they are living in
low-lying areas because of the power of the typhoon,'' said weather
forecaster Leny Ruiz. ``This typhoon is going to be no joke.''
	   The typhoon comes only a week after parts of the northern
Philippines were devastated by Typhoon Zeb, which killed at least
74 people in the country.
	   Babs' strong winds knocked down trees and power lines, leaving
many remote areas of the central Philippines without
communications. Authorities appealed for help from amateur radio
operators in restoring contacts.
	   The typhoon was centered early Thursday over San Miguel Bay in
Camarines Norte, 250 kilometers (156 miles) southeast of Manila,
Ruiz said. It had sustained winds of 165 kph (103 mph) per hour,
with powerful gusts of up to 200 kph (125 mph).
	   After striking Manila, the storm was expected to threaten
several northern provinces surrounding the Mount Pinatubo volcano.
Pinatubo's eruption in 1991 left millions of tons of volcanic
debris on its slopes which can wash down into streams during heavy
rains, flooding many villages.
	   At least 12,500 people were evacuated on Catanduanes island
which was struck by Babs late Wednesday, disaster officials said.
The island was without electricity after a power generating barge
was washed away from its moorings to sea.
	   On Negros island, about 6,200 people were evacuated in eight
villages after flooding eroded a river bank and threatened to sweep
away houses, disaster officials said.
	   Babs also forced a halt to ferry service at many ports,
stranding thousands of passengers.
	   Disaster relief director Franklin Castillo said government
efforts were concentrated on evacuating people from coastal
villages. At least 90 areas in Bicol province have been evacuated,
he said.
	   A landslide was reported in nearby Calauag in Quezon province,
causing no casualties but blocking roads, he said. Other
landslides, floods and damage to houses were also reported.
	   At least 16 domestic air flights were canceled.
	   Typhoon Zeb struck last week. In addition to the 74 deaths, 129
people were injured and 37 were missing in the storm. About 415,000
Filipinos fled their homes at the height of the typhoon.
	   Zeb then struck Taiwan, killing 31 people and injuring 19,
before cutting across Japan, where it killed at least 12 people.

The '98 Yankees: The best since '27?

 &UR; By RONALD BLUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN DIEGO (AP) _ Even last spring, the great Yogi knew it: This
New York Yankees team was special.
	   ``I said they were going to win by 25,'' Yogi Berra recalled
Wednesday. ``They only won by 22.''
	   And then they went 11-2 in the postseason, completing one of
baseball's greatest years with a 125-50 record, capped by Wednesday
night's 3-0 win over San Diego. The victory finished off the
Yankees' first World Series sweep since 1950.
	   They finished with a .714 winning percentage, the highest in
baseball since the '27 Yankees Murderers' Row team and the
fourth-highest ever.
	   But how good are they? The best in 71 years? The best ever?
	   ``That can't be answered,'' said Berra, who then proceeded to
try.
	   As part of Yankees teams that won 14 pennants in 16 years, Berra
is uniquely qualified to judge. He holds the record for most World
Series games, at-bats, hits and doubles.
	   ``I hope they can win five in a row like we did,'' said Berra, a
member of 10 Series champions, including the five straight from
1949-53.
	   Led by the M and M Boys, the '61 Yankees had more power, with
Roger Maris hitting 61 homers and Mickey Mantle hitting 54 en route
to a 109-53 record and a 4-1 Series win over Cincinnati.
	   The '39 Yankees were the strongest of Joe DiMaggio's teams,
finishing the regular season 106-45 and sweeping the Reds to win
their fourth straight Series title.
	   The '27 Yankees, generally regarded as baseball's best, went
110-44 and then swept Pittsburgh.
	   And what of the 1975-76 Cincinnati Reds, the Big Red Machine led
by Johnny Bench, Joe Morgan and Pete Rose?
	   ``I would rank this team third or fourth,'' said the Chicago
Tribune's Jerome Holtzman, who has been on the beat for 42 seasons
and is the senior baseball writer in the United States. ``There
isn't a Hall of Famer. They don't have a dominant hitter.''
	   Holtzman rates this team behind the '27 Yankees, the '61
Yankees, the Big Red Machine and perhaps the '19 White Sox, who
threw the World Series against Cincinnati in a gambling scandal.
	   Morgan puts these Yankees behind the '76 Reds because there's no
superstar. Cincinnati had three of them in Bench, Rose and Morgan,
and Tony Perez and Dave Concepcion were close behind.
	   ``If you're going to dominate for a long time, you have to have
a stud,'' Morgan said. ``I don't like talking about individuals or
throwing them up against my team because they're going to come up
second-best. But they're a team.''
	   It's also hard to rank these Yankees because they had a huge
lead by the All-Star break and coasted to a 114-48 record, the most
wins in the regular season since the '06 Cubs went 116-36.
	   ``New York played against themselves all year just to see how
good they could be,'' Morgan said. ``Maybe they would have won 120
games if someone was pushing them.''
	   Sparky Anderson knows something about great teams, too. He
managed the Reds to Series titles in '75 and '76, as well as the
'84 Detroit Tigers, who started the season 35-5 and beat San Diego
4-1 in the Padres' only other World Series appearance.
	   ``You can never rank teams for this reason: There's no way the
'27 Yankees can ever play the '98 Yankees or the Baltimore Orioles
and the Oakland Athletics or the great Reds team,'' Anderson said.
``They're a great team for this era and will go down in history as
a great team, but they cannot be rated until they've won at least
three World Series.''
	   The Swingin' A's from 1973-75 were the last team to win three
with the same nucleus. New York manager Joe Torre looks up to the
Catfish Hunter-Reggie Jackson-Rollie Fingers teams as a standard,
along with the Yankees in the '40s and '50s, and the Big Red
Machine.
	   ``The '27 Yankees may have the better club, but we have the best
record,'' the 58-year-old manager said after the finale. ``We have
to take a back seat to no one in my lifetime.''
	   All through September and October, as the wins kept piling up,
more and more Yankees talked about magnitude of the
accomplishments.
	   ``There's going to be a lot of arguments historically about
where this team fits in,'' David Cone said. ``It's the most
professional team, it's the best team in baseball. We've worked
very hard to play professionally, to come out every night. We won
114 games during the regular season, and you don't do that without
being an unbelievably professional team, and I'm very proud to be
part of it.''

Moody's considering ratings-cut on five Japanese banks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Moody's Investors Service said Thursday that it is
considering lowering its credit ratings on five mid-size Japanese
banks.
	   Moody's is reviewing its ratings on Fukuoka City Bank Ltd., Joyo
Bank Ltd., Bank of Yokohama Ltd., Gunma Bank Ltd. and Suruga Bank
Ltd. All are regional lenders.
	   Moody's said the reviews were ``prompted by concerns that the
continuous deterioration of Japan's economy and financial markets
may further affect the financial fundamentals of these regional
banks.''
	   Moody's ratings are used by bond investors and lenders to assess
the risk that a bank will be unable to repay some of its
obligations. A lower rating is associated with higher risk and, in
theory, would increase the banks' costs of raising funds.
	   Moody's currently rates the five banks' debt near the middle of
so-called ``investment-grade'' securities. Among them, Fukuoka City
Bank carries the lowest Moody's ranking with a ``Baa1.'' Bank of
Yokohama is rated ``A3,'' Surugu Bank carries an ``A2,'' and Joyo
Bank and Gunma Bank are rated ``A1.''
	   Bad-loan problems at Japanese banks have been a major factor
contributing to the country's deepest recession in its postwar
history.
	   Japan's Parliament adopted laws earlier this month which will
allow the government to take over foundering banks and to inject up
to 60 trillion yen (dlrs 515 billion) in taxpayer money into the
cash-strapped financial system.

<TEXT>
	   SAN DIEGO (AP) _ How appropriate _ a sweep.
	   What else could it be for a New York Yankees team that is surely
one of the greatest in baseball history.
	   Andy Pettitte and the Yankees put the finishing touch on their
most dominant season by beating the San Diego Padres 3-0 Wednesday
night for a record 24th World Series championship.
	   ``This is the top,'' weeping owner George Steinbrenner said.
``This is truly one of the greatest teams in baseball history. I've
never seen anything like this. They don't quit and seem to overcome
everything.''
	   It was New York's second title in three years and its first
sweep since 1950. The Game 4 victory gave the Yankees 125 wins _ a
total that ranks right up there with all the other big numbers put
up in baseball this year. Their 114 regular-season victories were
the most ever for a champion.
	   And it was a tribute to a team vastly different from all those
other pinstriped winners. Without a Ruth, DiMaggio or Mantle among
them _ no certain Hall of Famers and no one even elected to start
in the All-Star game this season _ these Yankees posted a .714
winning percentage, the best in the majors since their Murderers'
Row club of 1927.
	   ``This is the most determined team I've been around,'' Yankees
manager Joe Torre said. ``I don't know if we have the best team of
all time, but I do know that we have the best record. We have to
take a back seat to no one in my lifetime.''
	   Scott Brosius carried on the Yankees' tradition of unlikely
infielders coming up big in huge games _ remember Bucky Dent and
Brian Doyle? _ and was the Series MVP. The third baseman went
8-for-17 in the Series with six RBIs.
	   Fittingly, Brosius handled the last ball of the year, a grounder
by pinch-hitter Mark Sweeney.
	   ``I think the biggest moment is that third out, throwing the
ball and knowing it's going to end the game and end the season,''
Brosius said. ``There's nothing better than coming up and seeing
the players' eyes and that sense of achievement and accomplishment
and excitement. It was just a great scene.''
	   The Padres, the only team in the majors that did not get swept
in a series this year, beat 100-game winners Houston and Atlanta in
the NL playoffs. A record crowd of 65,247 saluted San Diego players
who came back on the field after the game.
	   ``We got close,'' first baseman Wally Joyner told the fans,
``and it was very special because of you.''
	   Pettitte shut out San Diego into the eighth inning while the
Yankees hitters did just enough to bring down ace Kevin Brown.
	   Bernie Williams, perhaps playing his last game for New York,
broke a scoreless tie with an RBI chopper in the sixth. In the
seventh, Brosius singled home a run and surprising rookie Ricky
Ledee hit a sacrifice fly.
	   The Padres tried to rally in the eighth, when Tony Gwynn's
eighth hit of the Series finished Pettitte. A single by Ken
Caminiti off Mariano Rivera loaded the bases with two outs, but Jim
Leyritz, a postseason hero in the past for the Yankees and San
Diego, flied out to Williams.
	   Gwynn went 8-for-16 in the Series. He was only player remaining
from the Padres' five-game loss to Detroit in 1984.
	   ``Sure, we would have liked it to have worked out better, but
the Yankees have a great club _ probably the best team we've faced
all year,'' Gwynn said. ``They did everything they needed to to
win.''
	   The Series sweep was the first since Cincinnati upset Oakland in
1990, and was the Yankees' seventh. Also, New York won its eighth
straight Series game while the Padres lost their seventh in a row.
	   For a team that led the AL in pitching and scoring, it was a
complete performance that produced its seventh straight win in this
postseason.
	   Perhaps the Yankees had something else going for them, too _
inspiration from slugger Darryl Strawberry, out because of colon
cancer. All the Yankees had his No. 39 embroidered on their caps,
and they chanted ``Straw Man! Straw Man!'' in the victorious
clubhouse.
	   Pettitte won just six days after his father underwent heart
bypass surgery, allowing five hits in 7 1-3 innings. It was
reminiscent of his performance in Game 5 of the 1996 World Series,
when he beat Atlanta 1-0.
	   ``This is more gratifying than the Game 5 victory,'' Pettitte
said. ``It has been an up-and-down year, especially with the
situation with my dad. He's home watching. I know he's at home with
a big smile on his face.''
	   Brown, who could not hold a three-run lead in the seventh inning
of Game 1, took the loss.
	   Rivera closed out his spectacular postseason, getting the last
four outs for his third save of the Series. Including the playoff
wins over Texas and Cleveland, he pitched 13 1-3 scoreless innings
and recorded six saves.
	   Pettitte and Brown dueled evenly into the sixth, when the
Yankees moved ahead by the slightest of margins.
	   Derek Jeter singled with one out and slumping Paul O'Neill
doubled. Williams, the AL batting champion, hit a chopper in front
of the mound that Brown barehanded.
	   But Jeter quickly broke for home and Brown saw he had no play,
getting the out at first. Jeter took no chances, sliding home and
toppling Padres catcher Carlos Hernandez.
	   Williams finished 1-for-16 in the Series. He's eligible for free
agency, and there's been talk that he might leave for Arizona,
Colorado or another club and a salary of more than dlrs 10 million
a season.
	   ``I just want to enjoy the moment and not think about that
now,'' Williams said. ``I'm just focusing on this moment.''
	   In the eighth, Jeter led off with a walk and O'Neill reached on
an infield single, a close play disputed by Brown and manager Bruce
Bochy. Both runners moved up on Williams' groundout and Brown
intentionally walked Tino Martinez to load the bases.
	   That brought up Brosius, acquired in the winter after hitting
just .203 last year for Oakland. The hero of Game 3 with two
homers, he hit an RBI single.
	   Ledee followed with a sacrifice fly. He finished 6-for-10 in
three starts.
	   Brosius and Ledee provided the last of several highlights for
the Yankees this year, a season that included David Wells' perfect
game and the debut of Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez.

Brosius named Series MVP

	   SAN DIEGO (AP) _ Scott Brosius was an unknown commodity to the
New York Yankees when they traded for him last November. What they
got was a World Series MVP.
	   Brosius finished the series 8-for-17 (.471) with two homers and
six RBIs in four games to earn MVP honors after New York defeated
the San Diego Padres 3-0 in Game 4 Wednesday night.
	   And after the Yankees finished the sweep _ with Brosius throwing
to first for the final out _ the third baseman was serenaded by his
Yankee teammates in the clubhouse the same way the right-field
bleacher fans rhythmically chanted his name all season at Yankee
Stadium.
	   ``Scot-ty, Bro-sius ..... Scot-ty Bro-sius.''
	   ``I think it's every player's dream to get to the World Series
and feel like you've played a part of the team getting there and
the team winning,'' Brosius said.
	   Brosius, who said he was eating pizza and watching TV when
Florida won the Series last October, drove in the Yankees' final
run in the eighth inning of New York's 3-0 win in Game 4 with a
weak single over shortstop Chris Gomez that didn't make it out of
the infield.
	   The hit symbolized Brosius' regular season and postseason. A
year ago, a ball he would have hit like that probably would have
been turned for a double play.
	   ``There's certainly some satisfaction in how this has worked
out,'' Brosius said. ``But I also just feel very lucky to be in
this position, how things have changed from last year, it's just an
unbelievable turnaround.''
	   Last fall, the Yankees finally dumped disappointing pitcher
Kenny Rogers off Oakland and got Brosius in return. There were some
eyebrows raised at the deal since the third baseman was coming off
a miserable 1997 season with the A's, batting .203 with just 41
RBIs.
	   But from the outset of this season, Brosius fit right in with
the Yankees. He batted .300 with 19 homers and 98 RBIs in 152
games. Punctuating his remarkable season and the Yankees'
incredible depth is the fact that Brosius often batted ninth in the
order.
	   Forget the World Series MVP, many of the Yankees felt Brosius
was their most valuable player since April because of his presence
on the field and in the clubhouse.
	   ``There's a lot of things he has done base-hit wise,
defense-wise and just attitude-wise that has helped everyone on the
bench also,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre said before Game 4.
	   Brosius, 32, played the postseason while his father underwent
colon cancer surgery and chemotherapy. His father was in the stands
Tuesday night when Brosius hit the two homers and came close to
hitting a third.
	   Brosius was such a low-key part of the Yankees during spring
training that Torre stared at the team press guide, trying to
figure out why his numbers tailed off so much the year before.
	   ``We didn't know what Scott Brosius was all about,'' Torre said.
``The first half of the year, it didn't take long for us to see
that he knocked in big runs for us, and was very important for us
both defensively and offensively.''
	   A storybook season for Brosius and the Yankees needed a perfect
ending, and they got it.
	   With two outs in the bottom of the ninth, Brosius fielded
pinch-hitter Mark Sweeney's grounder and threw to first for the
final out.
	   ``I just think the biggest moment (of the season) is that third
out,'' Brosius said. ``Throwing the ball and knowing it was the end
of the game and the end of the season. There's nothing better than
coming up and seeing the player's eyes, and the sense of
achievement and accomplishment and excitement.''

postgame quote &QL; 
 &UR; By RONALD BLUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN DIEGO (AP) _ Back on April 4, the Yankees were 0-3 for the
first time in 14 years and already the New York tabloids and talk
radio gurus were in a panic: No team had ever lost its first four
games and gone on to win the World Series.
	   ``I don't know that after three losses you can worry about
pressure,'' manager Joe Torre said that afternoon after a 7-3 loss
at Oakland. ``We're still not swinging the bats. We just couldn't
get anything going. We will. It's just a matter of time.''
	   One of the greatest seasons ever was about to start, and the
Yankees didn't even know it.
	   They got their first win the next day, 9-7 against the Athletics
behind Chuck Knoblauch's go-ahead sacrifice fly. They lost 8-0 the
next day at Seattle, and then the magic began.
	   An eight-game winning streak _ which included a win over Anaheim
at Shea Stadium after Yankee Stadium was temporarily closed because
of a fallen expansion joint _ put New York in first place.
	   After a loss at Detroit, the Yankees reeled off six more wins
and were atop the AL East to stay. Then, following a loss to
Toronto came an eight-game winning streak that ran the record to
23-6. They never looked back.
	   ``We've had an uncanny knack all year,'' said David Cone, a team
leader and often its chief spokesman. ``When we need to pitch well,
when we win 1-0 or 2-1, we get great pitching performances. And
when we need to score runs, it seems like we're able to match up
and do that. Is that character? Is it integrity? It's a team that
really picks each other up and pulls for each other.
	   ``We sense when the starter is struggling, then we score runs.
And vice versa. If the other pitcher does well and we need to hold
them down as a pitching staff, we do that as well.''
	   It all added up to a 114-48 regular season record, an 11-2
postseason mark and the team's second World Series title in three
seasons. Wednesday night's 3-0 win over the San Diego Padres gave
the Yankees their first Series sweep in 48 years and a .714 winning
percentage, the best _ regular and postseason _ since the '27
Yankees Murderers' Row team.
	   ``It's the best club I've ever been around,'' Torre said during
the postgame celebration. ``Twenty-seven Yankees, they may be a
better club, but we had the best record. To me, that was the
standard that I was looking to pass.''
	   All along the way, they destroyed records:
	   _ The 114 wins (including 50 in which they came from behind)
broke the old AL record of 111 by the '54 Cleveland Indians and was
the second-highest total ever, trailing only the 1906 Chicago Cubs,
who went 116-36. It also broke the team record set by the Babe
Ruth-Lou Gehrig team that went 110-44.
	   _ They played .700 ball in each of the first four months of the
season, the first team ever to do that.
	   _ They went 61-20 in the first half of the season, the best
record since baseball went to a 162-game schedule in 1961.
	   _ They took leads in 48 consecutive games starting June 28 at
the Mets, a streak not broken until a 9-4 loss at Minnesota on Aug.
20.
	   _ They clinched a postseason berth on Aug. 29, the earliest in
baseball history, and won their 100th game on Sept. 4, also the
earliest.
	   _ They matched a team record by finishing 66 games over .500,
the most in baseball since the '54 Indians went 111-43, and
finished with a 22-game lead over second-place Boston, the largest
victory margin ever for a Yankees team.
	   And all the accomplishments were spread out.
	   Tino Martinez (123) and Paul O'Neill (116) were the only players
to drive in 100 runs. Ten players hit 10 or more home runs.
	   Bernie Williams won the AL batting title at .339, and Derek
Jeter (.324), O'Neill (.317) and Scott Brosius (.300) all hit .300
or better.
	   Cone (20-7) became a 20-game winner for the first time in 10
years, David Wells went 18-4 _ including his perfect game against
Minnesota at Yankee Stadium on May 17 _ Andy Pettitte went 16-11
and Orlando Hernandez was 12-4 after joining the team in June.
	   Hideki Irabu, who didn't even pitch in the postseason, was 13-9.
	   Mariano Rivera backed the starters with 36 saves, and all that
led to a 10-game winning streak, a pair of nine-game streaks,
another pair of eight-game streaks, plus a seven-game streak and a
six-game streak.
	   After the first three games, they didn't lose three in a row
until Aug. 23-26, when they dropped four straight against Anaheim
and Texas. They had a pair of three-game losing streaks in
September, dropping eight of 12 as middle relievers fought
injuries, then closed with seven straight wins against Cleveland
and Tampa Bay. That started a stretch of 18 wins in their final 20
games, including the postseason. And they went through October
without Darryl Strawberry, recovering from colon cancer surgery
following his finest season since 1991.
	   ``This ballclub, they're going to take MVP votes away from each
other,'' Torre said. ``It's a great feeling for a manager to know
when these guys come to the field, the only thing they're
interested in is winning the game. They don't care who gets the
winning hit. They all want to get the game-winning hit, but they
don't want to talk about it. It's a very unusual club.''

<TEXT>
	   URAYASU, Japan (AP) _ Hoping to mine even more gold from the
Japanese love affair with Mickey, Minnie and Donald, the Walt
Disney Co. and the owner of Tokyo Disneyland began construction
Thursday of a dlrs 2.9 billion ``DisneySea'' theme park.
	   Company officials predict the park, which is being built on 167
acres (67 hectares) of reclaimed shoreline adjacent to Tokyo
Disneyland, will draw more than 10 million visitors a year once it
opens in 2001.
	   And although Japan is now slogging through its worst economic
slump since World War II, they have reason to be optimistic
Disney's ninth theme park in the world will be a success.
	   Tokyo Disneyland, which marked its 15th anniversary this year,
has proven to be the most lucrative of all Disney parks worldwide.
More than 200 million people have passed through its gates, and _
recession notwithstanding _ attendance last year alone was more
than 17 million.
	   Per capita expenditure among visitors to Tokyo Disneyland,
located in this suburb just east of the capital, is also typically
higher than other Disney parks. In 1997, the average visitor spent
about dlrs 75.
	   ``It's true that the economy is bad now but I think people in
times like these need something to take their minds off of their
troubles,'' said Toshio Kagami, president of Oriental Land Co.
which owns Tokyo Disneyland and will also build, own and operate
DisneySea.
	   ``Our attendance hasn't dropped due to the economy. I think this
shows the high standards that we keep,'' Kagami said.
	   When asked if the timing of the project might be a problem
because of Japan's economy, Disney Chairman Michael Eisner said
``I'm a bit of an expert on that. We built an expensive park in
Paris during an extremely robust economy and then opened it in a
recession.''
	   He says he would prefer to build in a recession and open when
the economy is strong.
	   Eisner said Disney may build more parks in Japan, though ``not
in the next few years.'' He denied denied rumors that Disney plans
to build parks elsewhere in Asia.
	   Disney will license its names and characters and act as a
consultant in the construction and operation of DisneySea.
	   The park will consist of seven areas.
	   One, dubbed Mysterious Island, is based on the stories of Jules
Verne, while the Mermaid Lagoon takes its inspiration from the
animated movie ``The Little Mermaid.''
	   An American Waterfront section will include reproductions of the
New York City waterfront at the beginning of the 20th century.
	   It's a ``totally different and unique'' Disney park, Eisner
said.
	   As yet more evidence that theme park investors aren't being
scared off by Japan's stagnant economy, MCA Inc. plans to start
construction later this month on a Universal Studios project in
Osaka, in western Japan.
	   That park, also slated to open in 2001, will feature rides based
on hit movies such as ``Back to the Future'' and ``Jurassic Park.''

	   SAN DIEGO (AP) _ Scott Brosius was an unknown commodity to the
New York Yankees when they traded for him last November. What they
got was a World Series MVP.
	   Brosius finished the series 8-for-17 (.471) with two homers and
six RBIs in four games to earn MVP honors after New York defeated
the San Diego Padres 3-0 in Game 4 Wednesday night.
	   And after the Yankees finished the sweep _ with Brosius throwing
to first for the final out _ the third baseman was serenaded by his
Yankee teammates in the clubhouse the same way the right-field
bleacher fans rhythmically chanted his name all season at Yankee
Stadium.
	   ``Scot-ty, Bro-sius ..... Scot-ty Bro-sius.''
	   ``I think it's every player's dream to get to the World Series
and feel like you've played a part of the team getting there and
the team winning,'' Brosius said.
	   Brosius, who said he was eating pizza and watching TV when
Florida won the Series last October, drove in the second run of New
York's 3-0 win in Game 4 with a weak single in the eighth inning
over shortstop Chris Gomez that didn't make it out of the infield.
	   The hit symbolized, 7th graf pvs.

Creditor banks expected to approve Hyundai's takeover of Kia Motors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Creditor banks are expected to approve
Hyundai Motors Co.'s takeover of bankrupt Kia Motors Corp., a top
government official said Thursday.
	   The comment by Chairman Lee Hun-jai of the Financial Supervisory
Commission appeared to be a tacit government endorsement of
Hyundai's bid to acquire Kia.
	   Hyundai was named the winning bidder for Kia in an auction
Monday, but its offer still must be approved by Kia's creditor
banks, most of which are controlled by the government.
	   ``As far as there are no other options, the creditor banks are
expected to approve the results of Monday's auction,'' Lee told a
meeting with business leaders.
	   Hyundai bid was chosen over those of Ford Motor Co. of the
United States and two domestic competitors, Daewoo Motors Co. and
Samsung Motors Inc.
	   There has been speculation that the banks might reject Hyundai's
bid, which included a demand that they write off dlrs 7.3 billion
of Kia's dlrs 8.4 billion debt.
	   Lee said Hyundai's takeover of Kia would spur a reorganization
of South Korea's shaky auto industry, plagued by over-supply
problems.
	   With a combined capacity of 3.5 million vehicles a year, South
Korea is the world's fifth largest car producer.

Six-year-old boy thwarts robber with computer SOS to father
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A gifted six-year-old boy used a computer to
call for help while his mother was being tied up in the next room
by an armed robber _ and police were able to catch the thief on the
scene, a newspaper reported Thursday.
	   A district court heard Wednesday that the boy, Lau Chun-yin,
sneaked into the bedroom and used a pre-programmed computer
function to call his father while his mother and a maid were being
tied up in the next room by a masked robber armed with a knife, the
South China Morning Post reported.
	   The boy's father alerted police, who quickly arrested Ma Ka-lam,
a 17-year-old boy, the paper said. Police said Ma was stealing
money to buy designer clothes.
	   The boy's mother, Leung Sau-king, told reporters outside the
court that Chun-yin had been working with computers since he was 3
years old.
	   ``I wouldn't say he's a genius, but Chun-yin learns relatively
fast,'' the Post quoted her as saying.
	   Ma, who took 270 Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 35) from Leung's
wallet, pleaded guilty in the July 21 robbery and was ordered to
serve 200 hours of community service, the newspaper said.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By BEN WALKER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Baseball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN DIEGO (AP) _ There simply was no other way for it to end.
	   A World Series sweep was clearly the fitting finish for a New
York Yankees team that utterly dominated the season.
	   Victory No. 125 was surely the one they'll savor the longest.
Even owner George Steinbrenner wept with joy.
	   Andy Pettitte, MVP Scott Brosius and the Yankees made a case for
being the best team in baseball history, beating the San Diego
Padres 3-0 Wednesday night for a record 24th championship.
	   ``This is truly, you can say it now, one of the greatest teams
in baseball,'' a champagne-soaked Steinbrenner said.
	   ``We really worked for his,'' he said, too overcome to go on.
	   It was New York's second title in three years and its first
sweep since 1950. The Game 4 victory gave the Yankees an overall
125-50 record and a win total that ranks right up there with all
the other big numbers put up in the majors this year. Their 114
regular-season victories were the most ever for a champion.
	   And it was a tribute to a team vastly different from all those
other pinstriped winners. Without a Ruth, DiMaggio or Mantle among
them _ no certain Hall of Famers and no one even elected to start
in the All-Star game this season _ these Yankees posted a .714
winning percentage, the best in the majors since their Murderers'
Row club of 1927.
	   ``This is the most determined team I've been around,'' Yankees
manager Joe Torre said. ``I don't know if we have the best team of
all time, but I do know that we have the best record. We have to
take a back seat to no one in my lifetime.''
	   Steinbrenner and Torre met in the clubhouse, both wearing hats
emblazoned with ``World Champions.'' They embraced.
	   ``You're the best manager I ever had. You deserve it,''
Steinbrenner said.
	   ``Thanks, Boss,'' Torre said.
	   Brosius carried on the Yankees' tradition of unlikely
infielders, coming up big in huge games _ remember Bucky Dent and
Brian Doyle? The third baseman went 8-for-17 in the Series with six
RBIs.
	   Fittingly, Brosius handled the last ball of the year, a grounder
by pinch-hitter Mark Sweeney.
	   ``I think the biggest moment is that third out, throwing the
ball and knowing it's going to end the game and end the season,''
Brosius said. ``There's nothing better than coming up and seeing
the players' eyes and that sense of achievement and accomplishment
and excitement.''
	   And sure to touch off the debate about baseball's greatest team.
	   ``I think that will probably be talked about forever,'' Brosius
said. ``The comparisons will go on and on, and maybe nobody will
have a definite answer. But you can look at this year and say we
had the single best season of any other team.''
	   The Padres, the only team in the majors that did not get swept
in a regular-season series this year, beat 100-game winners Houston
and Atlanta in the NL playoffs. A record crowd of 65,247 saluted
San Diego players who came back on the field after the loss.
	   Pettitte shut out San Diego into the eighth inning while the
Yankees hitters did just enough to bring down ace Kevin Brown.
	   Bernie Williams, playing perhaps his last game for New York,
broke a scoreless tie with an RBI chopper in the sixth. In the
seventh, Brosius singled home a run and surprising rookie Ricky
Ledee hit a sacrifice fly.
	   The Padres tried to rally in the eighth, when Tony Gwynn's
single finished Pettitte. A single by Ken Caminiti off Mariano
Rivera loaded the bases with two outs, but Jim Leyritz, a
postseason hero in the past for the Yankees and San Diego, flied
out to Williams in center field.
	   Gwynn went 8-for-16 in the Series. He was only player remaining
from the Padres' team that lost in five games to Detroit in 1984,
the only other time San Diego was in the Series.
	   ``Sure, we would have liked it to have worked out better, but
the Yankees have a great club _ probably the best team we've faced
all year,'' Gwynn said. ``They did everything they needed to to
win.''
	   The Series sweep was the first since Cincinnati upset Oakland in
1990, and was the Yankees' seventh. Also, New York won its eighth
straight Series game while the Padres lost their seventh in a row.
	   For a team that led the AL in pitching and scoring, it was a
complete performance that produced its seventh straight win in this
postseason.
	   Perhaps the Yankees had something else going for them, too _
inspiration from slugger Darryl Strawberry, out because of colon
cancer. All the Yankees had his No. 39 embroidered on their caps,
and they chanted ``Straw Man! Straw Man!'' in the victorious
clubhouse.
	   Pettitte won just six days after his father underwent heart
bypass surgery, allowing five hits in 7 1-3 innings. It was
reminiscent of his performance in Game 5 of the 1996 World Series,
when he beat Atlanta 1-0.
	   ``This is more gratifying than the Game 5 victory,'' Pettitte
said. ``It has been an up-and-down year, especially with the
situation with my dad. He's home watching. I know he's at home with
a big smile on his face.''
	   Brown, who could not hold a three-run lead in the seventh inning
of Game 1, took the loss.
	   Rivera closed out his spectacular postseason, getting the last
four outs for his third save of the Series. Including the playoff
wins over Texas and Cleveland, he pitched 13 1-3 scoreless innings
and recorded six saves.
	   Pettitte and Brown dueled evenly into the sixth, when the
Yankees moved ahead by the slightest of margins.
	   Derek Jeter singled with one out and slumping Paul O'Neill
doubled. Williams, the AL batting champion, hit a chopper in front
of the mound that Brown barehanded.
	   But Jeter quickly broke for home and Brown saw he had no play,
getting the out at first. Jeter took no chances, sliding home and
toppling Padres catcher Carlos Hernandez.
	   Williams finished 1-for-16 in the Series. He's eligible for free
agency, and there's been talk that he might leave for Arizona,
Colorado or another club and a salary of more than dlrs 10 million
a season.
	   In the eighth, Jeter led off with a walk and O'Neill reached on
an infield single, a close play disputed by Brown and manager Bruce
Bochy. Both runners moved up on Williams' groundout and Brown
intentionally walked Tino Martinez to load the bases.
	   That brought up Brosius, acquired in the winter after hitting
just .203 last year for Oakland. The hero of Game 3 with two
homers, he hit an RBI single.
	   Ledee followed with a sacrifice fly. He finished 6-for-10 in
three starts.
	   Brosius and Ledee provided the last of several highlights for
the Yankees this year, a season that included David Wells' perfect
game and the debut of Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez.

Pettitte gets clinching win in Yankees sweep
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RONALD BLUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN DIEGO (AP) _ Andy Pettitte was worried. He didn't want his
father watching television, even though his son was trying to win
the World Series clincher for one of baseball's greatest teams.
	   ``If something bad happened, I didn't want him to end up back in
the hospital,'' Pettitte said.
	   Tom Pettitte's newly fixed heart was just fine. And his son
showed a lot of his own heart Wednesday night, putting everything
aside and pitching the Yankees over the top.
	   He didn't let his father's health bother him, didn't worry about
his season-long problems with control.
	   With the Yankees trying to sweep the World Series for the first
time in 48 years, Pettitte pushed the Padres over the edge,
throwing 7 1-3 shutout innings in a 3-0, Series-ending win over San
Diego.
	   ``I know there's an enormous heart there,'' said Yankees manager
Joe Torre.
	   Pettitte allowed just five hits, got out of a bases-loaded jam
in the second, came up with his best game of the year. And as
Mariano Rivera got the final four outs for the save, a myriad of
thoughts swirled through Pettitte's mind.
	   ``Just really thinking about everything that's happened this
year,'' he said, ``from us having our second child and almost
thinking I was going to lose him. And then with what happened to my
father and he wasn't able to be here. And just the up-and-down
season I had. And even in the playoffs, my last start.''
	   All year long, Pettitte was plagued by self doubt, a perplexed
look across his boyish face as he tried to explain a string of off
nights.
	   ``I tend to think about the bad things instead of the good
things a little bit too much,'' he admitted. ``So this was
definitely gratifying for me.''
	   His Series-winning performance came after an 11-day layoff, with
his father at home in Texas a week after emergency heart surgery.
	   ``Just tell him I love him. Glad I talked to him today and he
was able to go home,'' Pettitte told a national TV audience. ``I'm
just glad I was able to throw a great game. He's at home watching.
I know he's at home with a big smile on his face.''
	   His father failed to convince doctors to postpone surgery until
after the Series. Andy went back to Houston after the AL
championship series, arriving back at Yankee Stadium just before
the World Series opener.
	   ``Andy Pettitte has a history of throwing great in big games,''
World Series MVP Scott Brosius said. ``When we went out today, we
had a great feeling with him on the mound. He had a focus and he
wasn't going to accept losing tonight.''
	   The 26-year-old left-hander was just 16-11 with a 4.24 ERA in
the regular season, his fewest wins since 1995 and the highest ERA
of his major league career. He repeatedly fell behind hitters,
nibbling at the plate instead of attacking.
	   He beat Texas in Game 2 of the division series, allowing just a
run and three hits in seven innings, but bombed out in the third
game against Cleveland, putting the Yankees' season in danger when
he gave up six runs and eight hits in 4 2-3 innings, allowing the
Indians to take a 2-1 series lead.
	   But on Wednesday, he looked like the Pettitte who went 21-8 two
years ago, the one who pitched 8 1-3 shutout innings against
Atlanta in Game 5. Everything was right again.'
	   And with that, one of the greatest teams ever finished its
historic season.
	   ``He can match the best of them,'' Torre said. ``As soon as I
saw the first pitch he threw, I knew we were in good shape. He let
it go, trusted his stuff.''

Williams' savors Yankees title
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with postgame notes &QL; 
 &UR; By TOM WITHERS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN DIEGO (AP) _ Bernie Williams had stripped off his game
jersey and was now holding a cigar in his right hand, his
champagne-soaked T-shirt clinging to his chest.
	   Williams was right in the middle of all the partying Yankees,
and if this was his final game for New York, he was savoring each
second.
	   ``I'm just enjoying every moment,'' he said.
	   He had prepared for Game 4 of the World Series as if it were the
season opener. And he didn't allow himself to think it could be his
last one with for New York.
	   Williams is eligible for free agency, and there's a chance the
All-Star center fielder won't play in New York again after the
World Series.
	   ``I'm just not going to let myself think about that possibility
right now,'' he said before the game. ``I have a lot more things to
think about within the next three or four hours, and then after
that ... .''
	   Williams and his agent, Scott Boras, were only able to work out
a one-year contract after negotiations on a multiyear deal fell
through last winter. Williams' uncertain future in New York was a
hot topic all season, and recently there was speculation Williams
had already made up his mind about leaving the team.
	   He was reported as having distanced himself from teammates,
refusing to join the celebration after the club won the AL East
title, the division series over Texas and the ALCS against
Cleveland.
	   Williams, who won the AL batting title this season despite all
the outside distractions, said he's the same on Oct. 21 as he was
on April 15.
	   ``The circumstances surrounding my situation ... has maybe made
people assume that I'm trying to distance myself from the team, and
doing all kinds of stuff,'' he said. ``But I haven't changed.''
	   Williams went 0-for-4 Wednesday night but drove in the Yankees'
first run with a chopper in front of the plate. When the final out
of 1998 was recorded, Williams sprinted to the middle of the
diamond to join his teammates.
	   ``We had a lot of pressure,'' he said. ``We won so many games in
the regular season. We had to prove that we were the best team.''
	   Outside, Yankees fans were trying to send owner George
Steinbrenner a message with chants of: ``Bring back Bernie.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; BIG MAC: Mark McGwire's 70 homers earned him a trip to the
World Series. Baseball's new home-run king threw out the ceremonial
first pitch for Game 4.
	   Introduced as ``one of baseball's greatest ambassadors,''
McGwire, wearing a World Series jacket, saluted the players and
fans before throwing the ball to Padres reserve outfielder Mark
Sweeney.
	   McGwire and Sweeney then delivered uppercut punches to each
other's gut, the slugger's signature greeting after a home run.
	   ``I still can't figure out how I hit 70,'' McGwire said. ``It's
hard enough to hit 62; 70 was incredible.''
	   In the fourth inning, McGwire, sitting in the front row down the
third-base line, barehanded a foul ball hit by New York's Chuck
Knoblauch. McGwire proudly held the ball over his head before
flipping it into the stands behind him.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; LOVE THEM YANKS: Among those celebrating along with the Yankees
in their tiny clubhouse were actors Kirk Douglas and Tom Arnold, as
well as Mr. October himself, Reggie Jackson.
	   In a sportsmanlike gesture, most of the Padres front office also
stopped by to pay their respects to the new champions.
	   Padres general manager Kevin Towers told New York GM Brian
Cashman: ``You guys did a hell of a job, you deserve it.''
	   Cashman was equally complimentary.
	   ``Kevin,'' he said, ``you guys can hold your heads high. There
are a lot of other teams that would gladly swap spots with you.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; ODDS AND ENDS: With five scoreless innings to start Games 3 and
4, this was the first time that consecutive Series games had been
scoreless through five innings since 1906. ... Yankees left fielder
Ricky Ledee's .600 batting average was the third-highest ever for a
rookie in the World Series. Only Billy Hatcher's .750 (1990) and
Babe Ruth's .625 (1928) were higher. ... Scott Brosius was the
sixth third baseman to win MVP honors. The others: Brooks Robinson
(1970), Pete Rose (1975), Mike Schmidt (1980), Ron Cey (tri-winner
1981) and Ray Knight (1986). ... The Yankees' 24 world titles are
the most by a professional sports team. The Montreal Canadiens have
won 23 Stanley Cups. ... New York has won eight straight Series
games since losing Game 2 in 1996. It's the fourth longest streak
in Series history. Conversely, the Padres have dropped seven
straight World Series games.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; TORRE'S TEAM: New York manager Joe Torre still wasn't sure
where his club ranks among the great teams. But even before the
club had wrapped up its World Series title, Torre said he was still
being surprised by the '98 Yankees.
	   When the club started the season on the West Coast losing four
of its first five games, Torre decided it was time for a meeting
when the team got to Seattle.
	   ``Let's do something about it,'' Torre recalled as the meeting's
tone. ``We've got to get hungry, we've got to get angry.''
	   Torre said his record-setting team has shown him a side this
fall he hadn't previously seen.
	   ``I found out something in the postseason,'' he said, ``that
it's OK to be tense in games and admit your tense, and you still do
a good job. I felt that way during the Texas series. That was a
revelation for me, that guys aren't loose and yet they still manage
to win.''
	   For months, he's been asked to compare his team with other World
Series champions and on Wednesday Torre was once again asked to
measure the 1998 Yankees against the 1927 team.
	   ``Well, I don't remember the '27 Yankees,'' he said, smiling.
``But you hear about those guys a lot.''

Four-party talks on Korea resume with little hope of progress

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Four-party talks on a permanent peace treaty for
the Korean peninsula resumed after a break of more than six months,
with little sign of progress.
	   South Korean officials were tightlipped at the end of
Wednesday's discussions, saying only that the talks were
businesslike and constructive. North Korean diplomats had no
comment for reporters.
	   The two nations have been in a technical state of war since the
1950-53 Korean War ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty. Their
border is the world's most heavily armed, with nearly 2 million
troops deployed on both sides.
	   The United States and China are participating in the talks, and
U.S. diplomats met with North Korean officials late Wednesday.
	   ``I think we're making progress,'' U.S. delegation chief Charles
Kartman said.
	   Switzerland, hosting the meeting in a Geneva conference center,
began the talks by proposing that a cross-border corridor be opened
at the village of Panmunjom to ease distribution of humanitarian
aid to North Korea.
	   Decades of economic mismanagement, aggravated by three years of
flooding and drought, have led to chronic food shortages in the
North. The country's reclusive, communist leadership has since
relied on outside aid to help feed its 23 million people.
	   U.S. officials who toured North Korea this summer said 2 million
North Koreans may have died in a famine.
	   ``The four-party talks have great importance for the peace and
stability in and around the Korean peninsula,'' said South Korean
delegation leader Park Kun-woo.
	   However, chances of a breakthrough seemed limited.
	   Last week North Korea reiterated its demands that the main
agenda focus on a U.S. troop withdrawal from South Korea and the
signing of a peace treaty with the United States.
	   Two previous rounds of talks, in November and March, broke down
over the same demands.
	   Officials told reporters that the North Korean delegation
brought up the issue again at Wednesday's talks.
	   U.S. and South Korean officials have indicated that the removal
of the 37,000 U.S. troops can be discussed. However, Seoul doesn't
want the withdrawal to be a formal agenda item.
	   For their part, the United States and South Korea have ruled out
discussions on a peace treaty between Washington and Pyongyang.
Washington maintains that any Korean peace treaty should be signed
between the two Koreas.
	   Pyongyang blamed the United States after the talks broke down in
March and only agreed to resume the negotiations as part of a
package deal with Washington last month.

Singapore leader says country will suffer if Malaysian capital
</HEADLINE>
controls fail

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong
has warned in a magazine interview that the vulnerable city-state
would suffer if Malaysia's controversial capital controls fail.
	   ``We hope that Malaysia succeeds, because if they don't, we will
be badly affected,'' Lee, who also heads Singapore's de facto
central bank, was quoted as saying in the Oct. 23 edition of
Asiaweek.
	   Malaysia introduced controls in early September that pegged the
Malaysian ringgit to the U.S. dollar and banned overseas trade of
their stocks and currency, in an effort to stabilize their markets
and lead its beleaguered economy out of recession.
	   ``The sooner the Malaysian economy turns around, the more scope
there is for Singapore and Malaysia to work together on a
`prosper-thy-neighbor' basis,'' Lee said in the interview.
	   Singapore's economy relies heavily on trade with its larger
neighbor to the north, and the island republic's financial sector
has suffered in part from Malaysia's surprise move.
	   Lee noted that the Malaysian approach was unconventional, and
said he doesn't expect other Southeast Asian countries to emulate
them.
	   Countries in the region ``might be forced into exchange controls
in an extreme situation where the economy is almost collapsing, but
I don't think any of them will choose this,'' he was quoted as
saying. ``Their problem is not to stop money from leaving the
country, but to encourage money to come back.''
	   Lee added in the magazine interview that the International
Monetary Fund's policies to help the region through its crisis
haven't always been successful because some of the problems have
gone beyond the economic.
	   ``It has not always worked because this depends on the
circumstances faced by the country,'' he argued. ``Sometimes the
problems are not economic, but social and political and beyond the
IMF's competence.''
	   He said that the main issue facing crisis-hit countries is no
longer a lack of international aid, but domestic imperatives to
solve their own problems.
	   ``It is that the countries must decide for themselves whether
and how to recognize and tackle their problems, whether it's Japan,
Indonesia or Malaysia,'' he said. ``Then solutions will follow.
It's not possible for the IMF or wise men to do this for them.''

	   Goaltender Guy Hebert, the only player who has spent every
season with the Mighty Ducks since they came into the NHL in 1993,
got his first shutout of the year and 17th of his career.
	   Hebert, back after having surgery on his right shoulder last
April, stopped 26 Boston shots and got a break when a shot from the
left point by Ray Bourque bounced off the post midway through the
third period.
	   Rookie defenseman Mike Crowley assisted on all three Anaheim
goals.

Reports: Officials fear assassination attempts in gangster trial
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Tight security around the Chinese trial of a
reputed Hong Kong crime boss and his underlings reflects concerns
by authorities the gang's illicit weapon suppliers might try to
assassinate the defendants to silence them, local media reported
Thursday.
	   Police sharpshooters have ringed a courthouse in Guangzhou,
southern China, since Cheung Tze-keung, whose alias is ``Big
Spender,'' went on trial along with 35 other defendants Tuesday.
	   The South China Morning Post quoted one source as saying ``the
threat of an assassination attempt is being taken very seriously.''
The newspaper did not name its source, who was also quoted as
saying Cheung ``could name a lot of names and there must be a lot
of nervous people out there.''
	   The people who supplied guns, grenades and bombs to Cheung's
gang might want to silence the defendants to keep their own
identities secret, the Post said.
	   Cheung and the others are being tried on charges that center
around the killing of a mainland Chinese businessman and a Hong
Kong resident, armed robberies, smuggling explosives into Hong
Kong, and the kidnapping of two Hong Kong businessmen for more than
1.6 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 205 million) in ransom.
	   Prosecutors also accused the defendants of kidnapping a merchant
from Fujian, China, for a 4 million Chinese yuan (U.S. dlrs 48,300)
ransom, the Hong Kong Standard reported.
	   The trial is closed to journalists _ drawing fire from human
rights activists _ but details are emerging in Kong Kong
newspapers.
	   The Chinese-language daily Ming Pao reported that Cheung
admitted Wednesday to planning and participating in the kidnapping
of Hong Kong property tycoon Li Ka-shing's son, Victor Li, and
Walter Kwok, chairman of Sun Hung Kai Properties.
	   ``The purpose of life is just to make money, I have to make
money, I have to do great things and organize something big,'' the
paper quoted Cheung as saying in response to prosecutors'
questions.
	   Ming Pao did not disclose how it obtained details of the
proceedings _ but Chinese officials are apparently concerned about
news leaks from the trial expected to last through next week.
	   A Guangdong judiciary spokeswoman told the Post that authorities
would investigate allegations that some Hong Kong media have paid
authorized court visitors for information on the trial.
	   Also, Guangdong police inspected hotel rooms of Hong Kong
Standard reporters and asked them to hand over pictures taken
outside the court.
	   Amnesty International has called for an open trial, while
complaining that the defendants, 19 of whom are from Hong Kong, are
being tried in China for crimes that took place in Hong Kong but
are punishable by death in the mainland. Hong Kong has no death
penalty.

Australian depth the key to Ashes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ England's cricket team arrives in
Australia on Friday with captain Alec Stewart the latest to believe
the land of perpetual hope might be able to get a little glory.
	   ``We've got a good squad of players going out to Australia. If
we play to our full potential we'll be very competitive with the
best team in the world,'' said Stewart before leaving home with the
job of preventing Australia's sixth-straight Ashes series victory.
	   England's hopes might be shaped by events in Pakistan over the
next few days. If Australia can get a win or draw against the hosts
in Lahore it will mean a first series victory on the subcontinent
in 39 years.
	   If Mark Taylor should lead his men to that landmark, after his
Australian record 334 in the second test, he will bring home a
buoyant team which would be unbackable favorite to beat the
tourists.
	   Should Pakistan win to level the series, it might send
Australian spirits tumbling after a trying tour, and boost
England's chances.
	   But Australia appears to have the depth to counter an English
team which is dreadfully inconsistent _ from beating South Africa
in a home series to losing a one-off test against Sri Lanka.
	   The Sheffield Shield competition opened this week and some
familiar names made the early moves to get in position should those
on the Pakistan tour falter.
	   To many who saw Matthew Elliott on last year's Ashes tour to
England it must come as a surprise that he is no longer part of
Australia's test squad.
	   He topped Australia's scoring in that 3-2 series win with 556 at
55.60 including a 199.
	   Greg Blewett was Australia's second-best batsman on that tour,
his century in the first test was his third from his first three
Ashes tests, but like Elliott has found himself relegated to Shield
cricket.
	   Australia's limited-overs wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist is the
heir-apparent to Ian Healy, who set a world record for dismissals
in the first test victory in Pakistan.
	   All three fringe players made imposing starts to the season.
Blewett, opting to parade his skills as a potential opener, scored
a dashing 175 for South Australia against New South Wales.
	   Elliott, who said his passion for the game disappeared last
season, made a determined hundred for Victoria on Thursday, while
Gilchrist scored a century for Western Australia.
	   Australia's main bowler, spinner Shane Warne, is in serious
doubt for the opening two tests because of a shoulder injury but
paceman Glenn McGrath has performed well on unsuitable wickets in
Pakistan and appears over his injury problems.
	   McGrath was the chief weapon in last year's Ashes series. He
took 36 wickets, 12 more than Warne, including a lethal 8-38 at
Lord's.
	   But England team manager Graham Gooch has high hopes for his
team.
	   ``We want to be the best and most respected team in the world.
There's no shame in saying that,'' Gooch said before his departure.
	   Gooch has warned his players that they will need to act
professionally to beat the Australians, even dispensing advice on
how much to drink.
	   Gooch wants his team to go into the five-test series with
confidence _ not clutching at straws.

Major Japanese travel agencies raided over alleged fare-fixing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's anti-monopoly watchdog on Thursday raided
several major domestic travel agencies suspected of illegally
setting fares for school trips, spokesmen for the agencies said.
	   Fair Trade Commission officials raided Osaka offices of Japan
Travel Bureau, Nippon Travel Agency, Kinki Nippon Tourist and
several other major travel companies.
	   The companies searched are suspected of forming a cartel to set
fares for excursions organized by elementary and junior high
schools, Kyodo News said.
	   The FTC does not customarily comment on ongoing raids.
	   Hitoshi Sato, a spokesman for Nippon Travel said a ``study
group'' has been formed among travel companies. He added, however,
that whether fare-fixing had occurred was not immediately known.
	   JTB spokesman Toshihiro Ebara confirmed the company's Osaka
office was raided, but refused to comment. JTB is Japan's largest
travel agency. A spokesman for Kinki Nippon Tourist also confirmed
the raid.
	   Bid-rigging, known as ``dango,'' is reputedly rife in Japanese
industry. The United States has accused Japanese companies of using
the practice to shut American construction firms out of Japan.
	   Under Japanese law, the maximum fine for bid-rigging is 100
million yen (dlrs 854,000).
	   In 1990, major travel companies were ordered to depict package
tour advertisements in a more explicit manner.
	   Many Japanese schools, from elementary through high school,
conduct annual excursions. In recent years, an increasing number of
high schools have chosen destinations abroad, including South
Korea.

Four Thai soldiers arrested for beating and robbing woman
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Just days after Thailand's police and
military announced they would work together to catch criminals in
their ranks, four Thai soldiers were arrested for beating and
robbing a woman, local newspapers reported Thursday.
	   Police said the four soldiers from the 1st Cavalry Division
stole cash and jewelry worth more than 300,000 baht (dlrs 8,000)
from the 53-year-old woman last week, The Nation newspaper
reported.
	   The soldiers have confessed to police, and the leader of the
group, a sergeant major, was found with two of the woman's rings
when he was arrested.
	   Both the Thai military and police have reputations for
corruption. Soldiers and policeman have been caught smuggling
drugs, running extortion rings, working as bodyguards and enforcers
for criminal godfathers, and even sometimes as hit men.
	   New Army Commander in Chief Gen. Sorayudh Julanont has vowed to
crack down on lawbreakers in the military and has recruited a
special detail of bodyguards to shield him against any reprisals.
	   National police chief Pracha Promnok is regarded as a reformer,
but extremely low pay scales for police are just one of many
inducements to corruption and lawbreaking among law enforcement
officers.
	   The Nation also reported on Thursday that a restaurant owner
near Bangkok's airport has filed a complaint with police against an
army general and several other military officers.
	   The female restaurateur told police that the general and
officers threatened her life when she asked them to pay their
bills.

Indonesian president vows to serve until 2000
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ President B.J. Habibie has rejected
calls to step down and plans to serve as president until the year
2000, the official Antara news agency reported Thursday.
	   Habibie replaced autocratic President Suharto, who quit in May
amid student protests and riots after 32 years in power.
Dissatisfaction over Indonesia's worst economic crisis in decades
was largely responsible for his downfall.
	   Habibie has promised to hold parliamentary elections next May
and then a special assembly of legislators and other delegates will
convene next December to choose a president and vice president.
	   Student protesters have periodically called for Habibie to
resign, but the president said that Indonesia's move toward
democracy would suffer if he succumbed to their demands.
	   ``If I do it, then that would signal the end of democracy,''
Antara quoted Habibie as saying Wednesday at the state palace.
	   Habibie said democracy can fail if a minority that dominates the
media's attention is granted its goals even though it doesn't
represent most of the population.
	   Asked whether he would stand as a presidential candidate next
year, Habibie said only that he would not block the development of
democracy in the nation of 200 million people.
	   In a television interview, Habibie also said he was determined
to do away with ``political as well as economic brokers'' who
pursue their own agendas and neglect the welfare of the nation.
	   Habibie said that such figures contributed to the downfall of
Suharto as well as Indonesia's first and founding president,
Sukarno.
	   ``I do not want to repeat the past,'' Habibie said.

Taiwan's first lady visits Europe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Tseng Wen-fui, wife of Taiwanese President
Lee Teng-hui, is visiting Europe on behalf of her husband who is
unable to travel there because of China's diplomatic pressure.
	   Taiwan's China Times newspaper labeled Tseng's trip ``first lady
diplomacy,'' suggesting she would carry out political contacts on
Lee's behalf. But a Foreign Ministry spokesman, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said the visit was ``entirely innocent.''
	   Many western countries bar visits by Lee, fearing it would upset
their relations with mainland China.
	   Tseng departed Wednesday to present a prize on behalf of Taiwan
at a cultural awards ceremony in Paris and to make private visits
in the French capital, the Foreign Ministry said Thursday.
	   She will then visit the Vatican, Taiwan's only diplomatic ally
in Europe, to present Lee's congratulation's to Pope John Paul II
on his 20th anniversary in office. After sightseeing in Austria she
will return to Taiwan, the Foreign Ministry said.
	   Similar visits by ranking Taiwanese officials routinely provoke
angry responses from China, which claims Taiwan as a breakaway
province with no right to international relations.
	   Under unrelenting Chinese diplomatic pressure, just 27 countries
recognize Taiwan, most of them impoverished nations in Africa,
Central America and the Caribbean. Taiwan and China divided
politically in a 1949 civil war.

Huge mudslide seen wrecking transport and power links near volcano
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAY LILLEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ A massive mudslide more
destructive than one which killed 151 people 45 years ago was
likely to flow from New Zealand volcano Mount Ruapehu within the
first five years of the new century, scientists predicted Thursday.
	   The flooding and mudflows, also known as lahar, could wipe out
the North Island's main rail, road and national power grid links,
the scientists warned in a report.
	   The lahar could be twice as devastating as that which led to the
Tangiwai rail disaster at the same place on Christmas Eve, 1953.
Then, 151 people were killed after a train plunged from a rail
bridge wrecked by the lahar in a national park area near the
volcano.
	   The latest report, prepared for the Department of Conservation,
predicts the new mudflows are most likely to occur sometime between
2000 and 2005.
	   It said Mount Ruapehu's crater had been ``significantly
altered'' by eruptions over the past three years and there was now
a major blockage over an outlet from the crater lake comprising
about 20 feet (six meters) of loose ash, scoria and rocks.
	   The crater lake is slowly refilling after being blown out during
past eruptions and once it reaches the rim, it is likely to
overflow and dump 1.5 million cubic meters (yards) of mud and water
on the surrounding countryside, the report predicted.
	   ``This would probably cause greater damage to bridges, roads and
possibly power lines and the Rangipo (electric) Power Station than
has occurred in the past,'' the report says.
	   Conservation Minister Nick Smith, who visited the site Thursday,
said the report made for worrying reading.
	   ``Volcanic eruptions in the mid-1990s have deposited several
meters (yards) of loose sandy ash and scoria on the crater rim,''
Smith said.
	   ``As the lake fills, the material acts as a weak dam which
enables huge volumes of water to be stored and then suddenly
released.''
	   That scenario was identical to the one which followed an
eruption in 1945 and caused the fatal 1953 lahar.
	   The scientists suggested constructing a dam and stop banks or
earthworks to clear the crater of loose ash and prevent potential
disaster.
	   The Department of Conservation is calling for submissions on
proposals for dealing with the problem.

Talks to return U.N. staff to Kabul in final stage
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KATHY GANNON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ The United Nations forged ahead
Thursday in talks with Afghanistan's Taliban militia aimed at
returning its estimated 50 international workers to the war-ravaged
nation after an absence of nearly two months.
	   The Taliban and U.N. negotiators were wrapping up talks in
neighboring Pakistan, where the world body hoped to have a 14-point
agreement signed by early Thursday evening, U.N. spokesperson Sarah
Russell said.
	   The withdrawal of U.N. workers have affected programs such as
land mine clearing, water systems repairs and emergency
distribution. At issue are U.N. concerns about security after three
U.N. staff members were killed in July and August.
	   ``They (the Taliban) have got to say they are progressing on
their investigations'' into the killings, said Russell.
	   Other agreements under negotiation include a Taliban pledge not
to hold U.N. staff beyond 72 hours unless charges are filed,
security guarantees for premises, vehicles and equipment as well as
staff, Russell said.
	   ``We need to get back . . . winter is coming,'' she said.
	   However, an agreement Thursday does not mean an immediate
resumption of U.N. programs, which take about one month to get up
and running, Russell said.
	   ``The next step will be to assess the security situation on the
ground,'' she said.
	   The Taliban are currently locked in a fierce battle with its
northern-based enemies on several fronts, including one barely 20
kilometers (12 miles) north of the capital of Kabul
	   While the Taliban controls about 90 percent of the country, the
pockets of resistance have been violent and have resulted in
several deadly rocket attacks on Kabul.

ILO signs pact to end child labor in carpet industry
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By KATHY GANNON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Heavily criticized for its use of
child labor, Pakistan's carpet weaving industry took a step
Thursday toward improving its image with an agreement to phase out
child labor.
	   The agreement, signed by the United Nation's International Labor
Organization and Pakistan's carpet manufacturing industry, plans to
take small children off the weaving looms, put them in school and
train others, preferably women, to do the job and earn an income.
	   The agreement allocates dlrs 300,000 toward this program, much
of that coming from the U.S. Department of Labor. The carpet
weaving industry is Pakistan's largest cottage industry exporting
carpets valued at roughly dlrs 150 million. In rural Pakistan,
particularly in the country's most populous Punjab province,
children, often girls, spend long hours weaving carpets in their
home for sale abroad, said an ILO release.
	   ``This agreement reflects a commitment on the part of the carpet
manufacturers in Pakistan to address child labor . . . not by
removing the children from he workplace, but rather by transferring
them from the weaving looms to the educational centers,'' ILO
Deputy Director Kari Tapila said during the agreement signing
ceremony in the Pakistani capital, Islamabad.
	   Human rights organizations estimate millions of Pakistani
children are working in a variety of industries from carpet weaving
to more dangerous occupations in garages and at industrial sites.
	   In poor Pakistan, where the average annual income is barely dlrs
400 a year, children often are put into the labor market at a young
age and often by their parents.
	   The goal of the new agreement is to get children under 14 out of
the carpet weaving industry. It will begin with at least 8,000
children currently making carpets, according to an ILO release.
	   According to a Human Development in South Asia report, the poor
in Pakistan is on the increase with a reduced growth rate,
widespread corruption and ``endless political confrontation in the
country . . . taking its toll on the poor.''
	   Negative international publicity about the use of child labor in
carpets hurt exports, which also prompted the manufacturing
industry to participate in this program, said Tariq Mahmood, an
industry spokesman.

	   NES TSIONA, Israel (AP) _ A horse whinnied behind an
electrified, barbed-wire fence that protects the Israel Institute
for Biological Research, a cluster of low buildings hidden by
trees.
	   The institute's official Internet site says its researchers
develop veterinary medicines.
	   That explains the horses, but not the barbed wire.
	   Recent developments have fueled new speculation that the
top-secret facility makes biological and chemical weapons.
	   On Oct. 1, government officials confirmed an Israeli cargo plane
that crashed in the Netherlands six years ago was carrying a
shipment for the institute of a chemical that can be used in the
manufacture of nerve gas.
	   While conceding that the chemical, dimethyl methylphosphonate,
can be used to make sarin gas, officials said the shipment was
going to be used for testing gas mask filters.
	   A week before that announcement, the government dropped plans to
expand the institute, apparently to avoid a high-publicity court
battle with residents of Nes Tsiona fearful of a toxic spill. Now
the mayor, Yossi Shevo, wants the facility removed from his town of
30,000 people, which is about 20 kilometers (12 miles) south of Tel
Aviv.
	   Many in Nes Tsiona are uneasy about their mysterious neighbor.
	   ``It would be better if it were somewhere else, not next to a
city,'' said Alon Kedem, a salesman in a toy store in a shopping
center across the street from the institute.
	   Israel's government has done its best to keep the institute out
of the news, with the military censor restricting reporting by
Israel-based journalists.
	   During a recent tour by journalists and town officials along the
perimeter road around the institute fence, a patrol vehicle inside
the barrier screeched to a halt. A young Israeli, solid, crewcut,
wearing the loose gray jacket that is the trademark of government
security guards, peered through aviator-style sunglasses at the
group.
	   Within 15 minutes, three more security vehicles drove by for a
look. Even in security-conscious Israel, that is not standard
procedure for a horse hospital.
	   An Associated Press request to the Defense Ministry for
permission to tour the facility was ignored.
	   A government spokesman, Moshe Fogel, said the institute
``produces medicines and antidotes for poisoning from chemical
weapons.''
	   He said there have been many false reports about the institute,
but ``beyond that we haven't been saying anything'' about the
alleged production of weapons material there.
	   The state has said the institute employs about 300 people, 120
of them scientists in the fields of biology, biochemistry,
biotechnology, chemistry, mathematics, pharmacology, physics and
environmental sciences.
	   According to institute documents quoted by the Israeli newspaper
Haaretz, the institute has manufactured small amounts of nerve gas
for experimental purposes. Laboratory animals were injected with
the poison, the report said.
	   Yiftach Shapir, an expert on chemical and biological warfare at
Tel Aviv University's Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies, said,
``Even if you don't make chemical or biological weapons as weapons,
you need small quantities to produce and test antidotes.''
	   Having small quantities of dangerous agents for research
purposes would make the institute no more threatening than an
ordinary pharmaceutical factory manufacturing vaccines, he said.
	   Foreign newspaper reports, quoted widely in Israel, have gone
much further.
	   The newspaper Yediot Ahronot, citing a foreign report, wrote of
hundreds of bottles of deadly anthrax toxin being stored in
refrigerators at the institute.
	   The Sunday Times of London said the institute produced the
poison gas used in Jordan a year ago in a botched Israeli attempt
to assassinate a leader of the militant Hamas group. It also made
the antidote that saved him after the two Israeli assassins were
captured, the Times said.
	   In September, the institute's former deputy director, Marcus
Klingberg, was released from jail for health reasons after serving
15 years of a 20-year sentence for passing state secrets to the
Soviet Union. But the 80-year-old scientist is still considered a
security risk because of his knowledge and remains under
round-the-clock surveillance.
	   Government secrecy about the institute has not prevented concern
from building.
	   In August, Yediot Ahronot splashed a picture of a man wearing a
gas mask on the cover of its weekend magazine and headlined in
large type, ``The Next Disaster,'' for a story warning of
widespread casualties if germs leaked out of the institute.
	   In his petition to the Supreme Court, Nes Tsiona's mayor wrote
that the institute conducts research ``in the area of biological
weapons and manufactures ... violent bacteria, which constitute a
danger to the lives of the people living in the vicinity of the
institute.''
	   Not everyone is worried.
	   Zvi Naim, who grew up in a little house just across from the
institute, said the reports about the goings-on inside never
bothered him.
	   ``You see,'' he joked, ``I haven't sprouted horns, and neither
have my children.''

Anti-government strike paralyzes life in several Bangladesh cities

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Accusing the government of mismanaging
relief for millions of flood victims, opposition protesters staged
a nationwide strike Thursday that paralyzed at least 60 cities and
towns.
	   Thousands of demonstrators took to the streets in the capital,
Dhaka, forcing motorists to stay off the roads and shutting
businesses. Hundreds of bicycle rickshaw drivers, who survive on a
daily income of takas 100 (dlrs 2), ignored the strike call. More
than 5,000 security forces patrolled the streets.
	   It was the second general strike in a week. An alliance of seven
opposition parties, led by former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia,
sponsored the strike. The opposition accuses the government of
corruption and mismanaging relief aid. It said state-run banks are
slow to disburse credit to farmers to replant their crops and
supporters of the ruling party are favored in the distribution of
rice and wheat.
	   A day earlier, some 250 street children were detained to prevent
them from being hired to bolster the crowds and smash vehicles
defying the strike.
	   Bangladesh has received dlrs 210 million in international food
assistance to feed nearly 35 million people who lost their crops or
houses. More than 900 people died in July and August in one of the
country's worst floods on record. The flooding was caused by
unusually heavy rains and a series of undersea earthquakes that
created higher-than-normal tides in the Bay of Bengal.

Packer says he may aid troubled Australian casino
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Fresh from an unrelated victory over
the taxman, media magnate Kerry Packer indicated Thursday he is
still interested in bailing out Australia's ailing Crown casino _
if it's allowed to pay less tax.
	   Crown Casino Ltd. Thursday put an end to speculation that Packer
had gone cold on a proposed joint venture by issuing a statement
which said his private company Consolidated Press Holdings Ltd. was
still interested, after it completed a review of Crown's
operations.
	   The joint venture would see Consolidated Press inject Australian
dollars 425 million (U.S. dlrs 267 million) into the troubled
casino company in exchange for a share of operating profit.
	   Also Thursday, Crown released its quarterly earnings result to
Sept. 30, 1998, that showed operating profit for the period was
Australian dollars 9.1 million (U.S. dlrs 5.7 million) on revenue
of Australian dollars 225 million (U.S. dlrs 142 million).
	   In a statement to the Australian Stock Exchange, Crown said
Consolidated Press considered that amendments Crown is seeking to
the Victoria state laws under which it operates ``are fundamental
to the future successful conduct of the business.''
	   Crown is seeking a reduction in the current tax on so-called
high rollers so it can compete with casinos in other Australian
states that pay less tax.
	   Consolidated Press also said that before it enters the joint
venture, it wants an obligation that Crown build a second hotel
tower and theater in the casino complex to be dropped.
	   Consolidated Press said it wants to extend the review period in
light of Crown's application to the state government for the
changes, Crown said.
	   On Oct. 13, Packer, Australia's richest man, won a court case
against Australia's Commissioner of Taxation claiming that
Consolidated Press had shuffled more than Australian dollars 200
million (U.S. dlrs 126 million) through its international companies
to avoid taxes.
	   Tax Commissioner Michael Carmody is appealing the decision.
	   Crown said that international business had ``substantially
reduced from levels experienced prior to the Asian crisis'' and
that it was struggling to be globally competitive.
	   ``The deterioration in the Asian and global economies has placed
the economic fundamentals of our business under extreme pressure,''
the company said, noting an ``additional supply'' of casinos in the
United States and an oversupply in Australia.
	   ``Crown must be able to show commercially acceptable returns to
global financial institutions and investors in order to attract
long term capital,'' the company said.
	   ``Under the current tax structure and regulatory restrictions
this won't be possible until major structural change is achieved.''

Yeltsin returns to Kremlin
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin returned to work at the
Kremlin on Thursday after doctors pronounced him fit following a
respiratory infection, officials said.
	   Yeltsin may meet with some officials on Thursday, said
presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin.
	   The president underwent a medical checkup Wednesday at the
Central Clinical Hospital in Moscow that had been scheduled before
he came down with his recent illness, Yakushkin said.
	   The exam included an X-ray, and doctors reported that Yeltsin's
health had returned to normal.
	   Yeltsin's latest illness, described as a respiratory infection,
forced him to cut short a visit to Central Asia last week. He
canceled a trip to an Asian summit in Malaysia next month and has
been spending most of his time at a country residence outside
Moscow.
	   He is still preparing for a trip to Vienna next week to meet
with European leaders, the Kremlin said.
	   Yeltsin, 67, has been weakened by recurring health problems in
recent years, including heart bypass surgery two years ago.
	   The president and his doctors insist that Yeltsin will serve out
the two years remaining in his term, and they deny speculation that
he has serious health problems.

Hungry Russian soldier shoots comrade, then himself
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ An 18-year-old army conscript killed a guard at an
officers' canteen early Thursday _ then ate his fill and shot
himself dead, officials said.
	   Pvt. Roman Seryodkin left a letter saying he had suffered from
headaches, didn't want to live and blamed no one for his death, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported, quoting local police officials.
	   The shootings took place at a military base in Divisionnaya, in
eastern Siberia near the border with Mongolia.
	   Abysmal living conditions and the ritual hazings of young
conscripts have contributed to frequent shootings and suicides in
the demoralized Russian military.
	   According to official figures, 50 soldiers were killed by their
fellow servicemen last year, and about 500 committed suicide.

Dollar higher, Tokyo stock prices rise
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing stocks, mid-afternoon dollar, bond &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo stocks ended higher Thursday for the fifth
day in a row but erased most of their gains earlier in the day. The
U.S. dollar was stronger against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 79.23
points, or 0.56 percent, ending the day at 14,295.56. The index was
up 415.29 points, or 2.92 percent, at the end of morning trading.
On Wednesday, it closed up 408.28 points, or 2.96 percent, for its
fourth consecutive trading day of increase.
	   The dollar bought 117.78 yen at mid-afternoon, up 1.42 yen from
late Wednesday in Tokyo and also above its New York rate of 117.00
yen in late overnight trading.
	   Stock prices ended sharply below their highs Thursday as an
early rally on the debut of the subsidiary of telecommunications
giant Nippon Telegram and Telephone Corp. ran out of stream in the
afternoon.
	   Shares of NTT Mobile Communications Network Inc., commonly known
as NTT DoCoMo, closed at 4.65 million yen (dlrs 39,480), up 19
percent from its initial-public-offering price of 3.9 million yen
(dlrs 33,112). Traders said the debut was successful enough to give
the market a confidence boost.
	   NTT DoCoMo is Japan's largest cellular phone carrier.
	   Traders said the market was also lifted on hopes that more of
Japan's troubled banks will accept public funds.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section rose 2.46 points, or 0.23 percent, to 1,074.29. The
TOPIX closed up 28.81 points, or 2.76 percent, the day before.
	   Japanese currency investors continued to bid up the dollar
against the German mark Thursday after it rose nearly two pfennings
Wednesday.
	   The dollar was quoted at 1.6558 marks, up from 1.6370 late
Wednesday in Tokyo and 1.6525 late in New York overnight.
	   The dollar's surge was triggered after Bundesbank official Hans
Juergen Krupp told a German news magazine European short-term
interest rates should converge below Germany's. Traders interpreted
his remarks as favoring a German rate cut sometime before the euro
is launched on Jan. 1.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 0.830 percent from Wednesday's finish of 0.845
percent, driving up its price to 108.66 yen from 108.52 yen.

Philips ends loss-making cellular phone joint venture with Lucent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Royal Philips Electronics NV said
Thursday it has agreed to end its loss-making telecommunications
joint venture with U.S. company Lucent Technologies Inc.
	   The announcement was made as the Dutch electronics giant
unveiled third-quarter income from normal operations that was down
38 percent to 449 million guilders (dlrs 241.4 million) from the
same period last year.
	   Rumors about the possible ending of the cellular telephone joint
venture with New Jersey-based Lucent had been rife since Philips
issued a profit warning in late September and put most of the blame
for the lowered expectations on the venture.
	   The venture, called Philips Consumer Communications, was formed
Oct. 1, 1997, and the two companies said Thursday that they agreed
to end their cooperation Sept. 25 1998.
	   It was not immediately clear exactly how much money the joint
venture had lost, but in this year's first quarter alone it lost
250 million guilders (dlrs 134.4 million).
	   Philips, which owned 60 percent of PCC, said it will take a
restructuring charge for an undisclosed amount related to PCC in
the fourth quarter.
	   Philips announced that its third quarter net profit had plunged
to 425 million guilders (dlrs 228.5 million) from 1.43 billion
guilders (dlrs 768.8 million) in the same period last year as sales
dropped from 16.13 billion guilders (dlrs 8.67 billion) to 18.88
billion guilders (dlrs 10.1 billion).
	   Last year's figures were boosted by a 711 million guilder (dlrs
382.2 million) extraordinary gain, while Philips took a 24-million
guiler (dlrs 12.9-million) charge in this year's third quarter.
	   In a statement, Philips president Cor Boonstra said that the
company intends to stay in the mobile phone business because it is
of ``strategic importance'' to the group's Consumer Electronics
business.
	   ``Now we need to move quickly and focus on the necessary
restructuring measures,'' Boonstra said adding that consumer
communications is a market that is growing rapidly and ``we have
the brands, the skill set and technology...to be a successful
market player.''
	   The PCC joint venture is expected to be broken in November and
restructuring measures should be complete by the first quarter of
1999.
	   The venture's current 5,000-strong workforce will be
``substantially downsized,'' the group said.
	   Both Lucent and Philips will each regain control of the assets
they brought into the venture. The Dutch group said that it will
now focus on its core strenghts in GSM technology and will continue
to work on third generation mobile phone technology.

Cambodia's Hun Sen pressures opposition to break deadlock
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodian leader Hun Sen used
Thursday's anniversary of a peace agreement ending the country's
civil war to pressure the opposition to form a coalition government
with his party.
	   ``Only those who want to prolong the anarchy and instability
prevent efforts to set up a new government,'' Hun Sen said in a
televised speech marking the anniversary of the 1991 Paris Peace
Accords.
	   Hun Sen's party won 64 of the 122 seats in parliament in July's
national election, but not the two-thirds majority necessary to
form a government on its own.
	   Opposition parties led by Prince Norodom Ranariddh and former
Finance Minister Sam Ram Rainsy have refused to enter into a
coalition with Hun Sen until their allegations of election fraud
have been thoroughly investigated.
	   International monitors said the election was relatively free and
fair. Hun Sen said his current government would remain in power as
long as the opposition refused to form a new one.
	   Ranariddh and Hun Sen were on opposite sides during the
country's long civil war. After the United Nations brokered the
Paris agreement and supervised a 1993 election, the two men formed
a coalition government as co-prime ministers.
	   Hun Sen ousted Ranariddh in a bloody coup in July 1997.
International mediation was needed to force him into allowing
Ranariddh to participate in July's election.
	   Since the election, negotiations on a new government so far have
proved fruitless, despite occasional mediating sessions with King
Norodom Sihanouk, who is also Ranariddh's father.
	   Hun Sen implied Thursday that the opposition did not fulfill
agreements made at a recent summit of party leaders chaired by
Sihanouk.
	   ``The results of these meetings were rejected,'' he said.
	   The summit led to the ceremonial opening of parliament on Sept.
24, but Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy left the country the next day and
have not returned, saying they do not feel safe in Cambodia.
	   Hun Sen threatened to arrest opposition politicians following
two alleged attempts on his life.
	   In September, thousands of people filled the streets of Phnom
Penh to protest against the alleged election fraud.
	   Hun Sen ordered police to break up the demonstrations. At least
four demonstrators were killed by police, but the discovery of more
than 20 bodies in the aftermath has prompted speculation that the
death tally could be much higher.
	   In his speech, Hun Sen blamed the violence on opposition
leaders, saying the demonstrations instigated social and economic
chaos.

Crews recover last of three Swissair engine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ Salvage crews attempting to retrieve
the bulk of Swissair Flight 111 have recovered the last of the
plane's three engines.
	   The heavy-lift vessel Sea Sorceress recovered the engine
Wednesday afternoon. High winds and sea swells had stalled the
recovery effort Monday and Tuesday.
	   ``They got it on the first lift,'' said Jim Harris of the
Transportation Safety Board of Canada.
	   It was unclear if a digital control that could give
investigators crucial information like how fast the MD-11 was going
when it crashed was attached to the recovered under-wing engine, he
said. The digital control on one of two engines previously
recovered is still being analysed by its Connecticut manufacturer,
Harris said.
	   The FADEC _ full authority digital engine control _ from the
plane's middle engine has ``information on it and we're getting
data from it so that's a good sign,'' he said.
	   About 25 percent of the plane has been recovered since it
crashed off the coast of Nova Scotia on Sept. 2, killing all 229
people aboard.
	   Harris said officials still do not have enough of the aircraft
to determine the cause of the crash, although analysis of the
plane's cockpit and flight data recorders is continuing.
	   Also Wednesday, the number of victims identified increased to
105 from 100.

Singapore, France expand military ties
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore will have more jet fighter crews
training in France following an expanded military cooperation
agreement between the two countries, Singapore TV reported
Thursday.
	   Tony Tan, Singapore's deputy prime minister and defense
minister, and French Defense Minister Alain Richard signed an
accord Wednesday aimed at strengthening the two countries' defense
ties.
	   The agreement, signed in Paris, will allow for Singapore to
train the crews of a full squadron of 20 jets in Cazaux, southern
France. Singapore currently has 10 Skyhawk jet fighters and about
100 staff at the French air base.
	   Singapore also will consider French companies in upgrading its
fleet of missile gunboats, and is evaluating the French-made
Raphael fighter for its new generation of military planes.
	   In addition, Singapore plans to set up a Defense Technology
Office in Paris, TV reported.
	   ``The choice of Paris for the location of Defense Technology
Office is a reflection of our good defense ties and keenness to
pursue defense technology cooperation with France,'' Tan was quoted
as saying.
	   Tiny and rich, this island nation of 3.1 million has no token
army. It has recently added six F-16 U.S. jet fighters to its
arsenal, and will take delivery of eight more soon.
	   Male Singaporeans serve a compulsory 2 1/2 years of military
service, after which they are called at regular intervals to
refresh their combat prowess.
	   Singapore is part of Five Power Defense Arrangement, a
27-year-old pact that also includes Malaysia, Australia, New
Zealand and Britain.

	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ Salvage crews have recovered the
last of Swissair Flight 111's three engines from the Altantic Ocean
off Nova Scotia.
	   The heavy-lift vessel Sea Sorceress recovered the engine

Ethiopian prime minister arrives in Malaysia for five-day visit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles
Zenawi began a five-day visit to Malaysia Thursday to promote trade
and investment.
	   Zenawi, accompanied by Trade Minister Kasahaun Ayele, other
senior government officials and dozens of businessmen, was
officially welcomed at Parliament Square by Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad, the national news agency Bernama reported.
	   The Ethiopian delegation plans to meet with Malaysia's king as
well as visit the Prime Minister's Department to discuss trade and
regional issues.
	   It also is to visit various industrial facilities specializing
in oil palm and rubber research.
	   Zenawi, a former Marxist guerrilla-turned-capitalist, came to
Malaysia at Mahathir's invitation.
	   Backed by international loans and debt relief, Ethiopia has been
pushing for trade liberalization in recent years, selling off
state-owned enterprises and courting partnerships with foreign
investors.

Drug company says nine-month group sales rise
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ Novartis, the Swiss drug giant, said
its nine-month group sales rose 3 percent to 24.6 billion Swiss
francs (dlrs 18.2 billion) from the same period last year.
	   In another important barometer of the company's performance,
sales before translation from the local currencies of its various
markets rose 6 percent in the first nine months.
	   The sales percentages for the third quarter alone rose 7 percent
in francs and 12 percent in local currencies.
	   Turning to the full-year outlook, Novartis said it expects a
``marked'' increase in net income for the year, provided that
``additional, unforeseen economic or financial disturbances'' don't
occur.
	   Novartis attributed the improvement to higher productivity and
high volume growth in the health care division, its largest.
Nine-month sales there rose 4 percent in francs and 7 percent in
local currencies.
	   These factors ``are expected to result in an even higher group
operating profitability,'' the company said, without providing
specific estimates.
	   The one blot on the profit outlook, Novartis said, will be net
financial income, which ``will reflect the turbulence in the
financial markets in the second half of the year.'' It wasn't more
specific.
	   In the first half, the company had reported net financial income
of 516 million francs (dlrs 382.2 million), up from 95 million
francs (dlrs 70 million) in last year's first half. The company's
total net profit in the first half rose 14 percent to 3.55 billion
francs (dlrs 2.62 billion).
	   For all of last year, the company had net profit of 5.21 billion
francs (dlrs 3.85 billion), up 43 percent.
	   Novartis is one of the world's largest life sciences groups,
with strong positions in its fields of activity: pharmaceuticals,
crop protection, animal health and clinical nutrition.

Yeltsin returns to Kremlin, prepares for trip to Austria
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Yeltsin planning to visit Austria for only one
day sted of two. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin returned to work at the
Kremlin on Thursday after doctors pronounced him fit following a
respiratory infection, officials said.
	   Yeltsin was meeting with aides on Thursday and was preparing for
one-day trip to Austria next week, said presidential spokesman
Dmitry Yakushkin.
	   The trip had originally been announced as a two-day visit, but
Yeltsin now plans to arrive and leave Austria next Tuesday.
Yakushkin insisted that the president would hold all his scheduled
meetings with European leaders.
	   ``We have condensed the schedule,'' he said, according to the
Russian news reports.
	   The president underwent a medical checkup Wednesday at the
Central Clinical Hospital in Moscow that had been planned before he
came down with his latest illness, Yakushkin said.
	   The exam included an X-ray, and doctors reported that Yeltsin's
health had returned to normal.
	   Yeltsin's illness, described as a respiratory infection and
bronchitis, forced him to cut short a visit to Central Asia last
week. He canceled a trip to an Asian summit in Malaysia next month
and has been spending most of his time at a country residence
outside Moscow.
	   Yeltsin, 67, has been weakened by recurring health problems in
recent years, including heart bypass surgery two years ago.
	   The president and his doctors insist that Yeltsin will serve out
the two years remaining in his term, and they deny speculation that
he has serious health problems.

NTT DoCoMo shares debut on Tokyo Stock Exchange

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Shares of Japan's top cellular-phone company soared
Thursday in the world's biggest initial public stock offering to
date.
	   NTT Mobile Communications Network Inc., commonly known as NTT
DoCoMo, raised 2.13 trillion yen (dlrs 18.6 billion) through the
share sale, making it Japan's third largest company in terms of
market capitalization after its parent company Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone Corp. and Toyota Motor Corp.
	   The stock rose to 4.65 million yen (dlrs 39,540) in its first
day of trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, a gain of 750,000 yen
(dlrs 6,410), or 29 percent, from its 3.9 million yen (dlrs 33,163)
initial public offering price.
	   The advance had been expected, as Japan's fast-growing and
profitable cellular-phone industry is a bright spot in an economy
mired in its deepest recession in decades.
	   The cellular market has grown from around 2 million subscribers
in 1995 to 42.8 million at the end of September. With a 57 percent
market share, NTT DoCoMo has a commanding lead over two rival
companies.
	   DoCoMo forecast Thursday that its net profit will rise 53
percent this fiscal year to 184 billion yen (dlrs 1.6 billion) from
120.63 billion yen (dlrs 1 billion) last year.
	   Analysts said one risk for NTT DoCoMo is the large loss they
expect the company to suffer as it absorbs the operations and debts
of NTT Personal Communications Network. NTT Personal sells a
cheaper version of cellular service known as the personal
handyphone system, or PHS.
	   PHS phones can't be used in moving vehicles or in remote areas,
and the falling price of cellular phones has made it increasingly
difficult for PHS providers to compete.
	   DoCoMo's initial public offering was the largest since parent
NTT went public for dlrs 13.6 billion in 1986. The sale of 545,000
shares includes 218,000 shares from NTT and 327,000 newly issued
shares.
	   NTT, the country's largest phone company, had held 95 percent of
DoCoMo and will retain a 67 percent share of the company even after
Thursday's sale.
	   NTT DoCoMo plans to use the proceeds from its stock sale to
develop a new cellular phone system.

France says NATO must keep up pressure on Milosevic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine warned
Thursday that the Balkans conflict could explode again unless NATO
presses Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic to pull his troops out
Kosovo.
	   ``The withdrawal of forces is very advanced, but that is not
enough,'' Vedrine said on France's RTL radio, referring to the
pullout of Serb forces from the mainly Albanian province.
	   NATO must ``not let go'' now, said Vedrine. He said the alliance
must be vigilant in making sure that Milosevic adheres to the Oct.
12 pullout agreement.
	   ``If we don't take care of the question of Kosovo and one thing
leads to another, it could reinflame the situation in the Balkans
and put the entire region in danger,'' Vedrine said.
	   He called on NATO to make sure the verification mission by the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe gets off the
ground and continue to pursue political negotiations.
	   Fighting between Serb forces and ethnic Albanians _ who make up
90 percent of the population of Kosovo, a province of Yugoslavia's
main republic Serbia _ has killed hundreds of people and forced
around 300,000 from their homes this year.

Pakistan gives Test caps to Afridi and Ahmed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RIZWAN ALI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Off-spinner Arshad Khan got the prized
wicket of Australian skipper Mark Taylor off his fifth ball as the
tourists crawled to 65 for one at lunch on the first day of the
third and final cricket Test against Pakistan Thursday.
	   Michael Slater, twice hit on the temple off Wasim Akram's short
deliveries, was 30 not out while Justin Langer was 13 not out.
	   On a dry and bare wicket, Pakistan spinners debutante Shakeel
Ahmed and Khan bowled to a steady line and length and kept the
Australians quiet.
	   Taylor, who hit 334 and equaled Sir Don Bradman's record in the
drawn Test at Peshawar, top edged Khan to Inzamamul Haq at
midwicket after scoring 16 in 62 minutes and putting on 38 runs for
the first wicket.
	   Khan has given away just nine runs in nine overs for the wicket
of the Australian captain. Ahmed also bowled a tidy 10 overs giving
away just 15 runs.
	   Pakistan, 1-0 down in the three-match series, made four changes
from the drawn second Test at Peshawar.
	   Opening batsman Saeed Anwar had a pain in his stomach and was
forced to sit out Thursday morning. He was replaced by 18-year-old
Shahid Afridi, who made his Test debut after playing in 67 one-day
Internationals. Muhammad Zahid, who had aggravated groin injury at
Peshawar, was replaced by Wasim Akram, while injured leg-spinner
Mushtaq Ahmed made way for Arshad Khan.
	   Ahmed is nursing a knee injury.
	   Pakistan also awarded Test cap to 32-year-old Rawalpindi
left-arm spinner Shakeel Ahmed, who came in place of all-rounder
Azhar Mahmood.
	   Australia brought back their inform left-handed batsman Darren
Lehmann, who missed the second Test due to groin injury. He
replaced Ricky Ponting.
	   Off-spinner Gavin Robertson, who did not feature in the first
two Tests, was included in place of medium fast Damien Fleming.

Cambodian leader calls for wide-ranging reforms for economy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodian leader Hun Sen called
Thursday for the formation of a government that would concentrate
on the economy and make the reforms needed to attract new
investment.
	   In a speech on the anniversary of the 1991 Paris Peace Accords,
Hun Sen acknowledged that recent political instability had hurt
Cambodia's economy. He said the country needs a new economic policy
including wide-ranging reforms in the army, police, civil
administration and judiciary.
	   ``Combat against corruption, against the abuse of power and
against negative phenomena in society must become the routine
activities of these forces without exception,'' he said. ``We must
not let our citizens and businessmen fall victims to these negative
acts.''
	   Hun Sen's ruling party and the two-party opposition are
deadlocked in negotiations over the formation of the next
government after elections held in July.
	   But Hun Sen, whose party narrowly won the polls, said he could
no longer wait to put forward his reform proposal.
	   ``I declared before the election that if I enjoyed the
confidence of the people to be prime minister of the new
government, I would set up an economy-oriented government,'' he
said. ``However, the lifeline and the brains of an economy-oriented
government have to start up now.''
	   Promises to get tough on crime and ensure fair and equitable
treatment for all businesses were cornerstones of Hun Sen's plan.
	   Kidnappings of businessmen for ransom is a periodic occurrence
in the Cambodian capital, and new investors have complained that
their entrenched competition receives breaks on taxes and duties
from cronies in the government.
	   Hun Sen also paid special attention to the illegal timber trade
that deprives the cash-strapped Cambodian treasury of millions of
dollars in export duties each year.
	   Calling the outgoing government's forestry policy its weakest
initiative over the past five years, Hun Sen declared the need for
a sustainable forestry policy and a review of current regulations
on forestry management.
	   Environmentalists, skeptical of past ineffective measures to
halt illegal logging, have said that Hun Sen is the only man with
enough power to untangle the web of corruption in the government
and military that drives the trade.
	   Hun Sen's forestry proposal included a review of contracts the
government has signed with timber companies and stamping out
illegal logging that is rampant in the nation's parks and wildlife
refuges.

Philippine Muslim rebels ambush army patrol, six soldiers wounded
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COTABATO, Philippines (AP) _ About 30 Muslim secessionist rebels
ambushed an army patrol in the southern Philippines early Thursday,
wounding six soldiers, the military said.
	   The soldiers fought back and wounded or killed an undetermined
number of guerrillas from the Moro Islamic Liberation Front in
Talayan in Maguindanao province, said 6th Infantry Division
spokesman Lt. Col. Ricardo Torrevillas.
	   The encounter was the latest in a series of clashes that began
Sunday when MILF guerrillas attacked a group of farmers who were
former members of the rival Moro National Liberation Front. The
MNLF signed a peace agreement with the government two years ago.
	   So far, three former MNLF guerrillas and nine MILF rebels have
been killed in the clashes since the military intervened in the
feud between the two groups, Torrevillas said.
	   The clashes in Maguindanao, about 575 kilometers (360 miles)
south of Manila, are undermining peace talks between the government
and the MILF.
	   MILF vice chairman Ghadzali Jaafar said the rebels will not
attend the scheduled resumption of the talks next month if the
military does not stop its operations.
	   A cease-fire agreement between the government and the MILF
appears to have helped little in preventing clashes between the
rebels and soldiers.
	   The MILF is the largest of two Muslim rebel groups still
battling the government to establish a separate Islamic state in
the southern Philippines.

Public transport workers strike in northern French city of Lille
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LILLE, France (AP) _ Public transport workers in the northern
French city of Lille went on strike Thursday to protest attacks
against personnel and an inequality in rest breaks.
	   There was no bus, metro or tram service in the entire city
Thursday.
	   Most unions supported the walkout. Other grievances by the
strikers include the decision to use mechanics not employed by the
city to repair vehicles.
	   The number of strikes due to an increase in attacks on public
transport workers, especially by gangs of unemployed youths, has
been on the rise in France this year.

Indonesia's Habibie to attend APEC summit for one day
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ President B.J. Habibie will spend one
day at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Malaysia
next month.
	   Habibie, who is pursuing democratic reforms, canceled a visit to
Malaysia earlier this month after criticizing the detention of
Malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim.
	   The Indonesian president said he will travel to Malaysia on the
morning of Nov. 17 and return in the evening.
	   ``God willing, I will attend,'' Habibie said in an interview
with the state-run TVRI station Wednesday night.
	   He said his visit would be brief because he currently has no
deputy to take charge in his absence. Habibie had filled the post
of vice president until he took over from former President Suharto,
who quit in May amid riots and protests against his 32-year rule.
	   Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad fired Anwar, 51, as
deputy prime minister on Sept. 2 after the two differed on economic
policy. Anwar began rallying opposition to Mahathir and was
arrested Sept. 20.
	   APEC meetings will be held Nov. 12-18, with country leaders
convening on Nov. 17. Many of the 21 member nations are grappling
with severe economic problems.

Government says no to talks with Tamil rebels
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Sri Lanka's government on Thursday
ruled out any peace talks for now with Tamil Tiger rebels as its
military reported recent battlefield successes.
	   ``There is no move on our part to start the process, no move
whatsoever,'' Constitutional Affairs Minister Lakshman Peiris told
reporters in the capital, Colombo, in response to a magazine
interview that said the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam were not
averse to resuming dialogue with the government through a
facilitator.
	   Citing the examples of Kosovo and Bosnia, Tamil Tiger spokesman
V. Rudrakumaran, a U.S.-based lawyer, told the Midweek Mirror in
London that any major Western power could bring the two sides
together to talk.
	   Peiris said his administration was not against a facilitator.
Several rounds of peace talks in the past have ended with the
rebels breaking off negotiations and staging surprise attacks on
the military. The last unsuccessful negotiations were held in April
1995.
	   Sri Lanka's 15-year-old civil war has its roots in the conflict
between two ethnic groups with distinct languages, cultures and
history. The majority Sinhalese _ who make up 76 percent of Sri
Lanka's 18.5 million people _ are mainly Buddhist.
	   Most Tamils, who are 18 percent of the population, are Hindus.
The separatist campaign has claimed more than 55,000 live in the
past 15 years.
	   In fighting in the past two weeks, military spokesman Brigadier
Sunil Tennekoon said government forces killed 48 rebels in the
north and east. At least 39 government soldiers were wounded.
	   In September, government forces and Tamil rebels were locked in
heavy fighting for the control of a strategic highway that could
link government-held Jaffna Peninsula with mainland Sri Lanka.

In rare move, parliament votes to lift two deputies' immunity
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ In a rare break from staunch parliamentary
solidarity, Greek deputies overwhelmingly lifted the immunity from
prosecution of two lawmakers accused in separate cases, according
to vote tallies published Thursday.
	   Costas Karaminas, a conservative opposition party deputy, is
accused of causing a car crash that killed a 26-year-old woman who
was riding in his car. He also allegedly refused to take an alcohol
test after the crash, citing his parliamentary immunity from
prosecution.
	   Varsamis Yiovanoudas, an independent deputy ousted from the
conservative party in July, has a lawsuit pending against him for
allegedly beating his girlfriend.
	   Deputies have protection from any type of prosecution in order
to protect them against politically motivated lawsuits. Similar
protective legislation exists in many European countries. But in
Greece, the immunity is rarely lifted even in criminal and other
non-political cases.
	   The immunity can only be lifted by a secret ballot in the
300-member parliament.
	   In the vote, held shortly before midnight Wednesday, 181
deputies voted in favor of lifting Yiovanoudas' immunity, with 36
voting against, four blank votes and one abstention.
	   Out of the 222 deputies present, 196 voted for lifting the
immunity of Karaminas, with 20 against, four blank ballots and two
abstentions.
	   There has been growing debate in parliament over the misuse of
immunity.
	   In February, deputies ignored an appeal by a public prosecutor
and voted not to strip socialist Yiannis Tsaklidis of his immunity
after he was accused of beating a soccer referee following a
first-division match last year.
	   Since the 1974 fall of the military dictatorship, parliament has
dealt with 530 immunity cases. Only in three other cases were
deputies stripped of their immunity: on charges of bribery, fraud
and aiding a drug dealer.

French customs seize 600 kilos of marijuana
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAYONNE, France (AP) _ French officials have seized 600
kilograms (1,320 pounds) of marijuana that was headed from Spain to
the Netherlands, French customs said Thursday.
	   The seizure was made Monday at the Biriatou border post in
southwestern France on the border with Spain.
	   The marijuana had been concealed in a truck driven by a Dutch
citizen, who is to appear before a French court Thursday.
	   According to police in the southwestern city of Bayonne, the
driver has been implicated in drug smuggling in this region before.
	   France and the Netherlands earlier this year signed an agreement
to fight drug trafficking.
	   Relations between the two countries soured in 1995 when
President Jacques Chirac was highly critical of the Netherlands'
liberal drug policies.

 &UR; Jewish settlers block West Bank roads, protest Wye talks
 &UR; By LAURIE COPANS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIT HAGGAI, West Bank (AP) _ Jewish settlers opposed to an
Israeli troop withdrawal blocked more than a dozen West Bank roads
Thursday, stopping traffic near areas that might come under
Palestinian control.
	   In most of the protests, police did not interfere, rerouting
Palestinian motorists instead. However, at two junctions policemen
scuffled with demonstrators, and nine settlers were detained.
	   Near the Jewish settlement of Beit Haggai, about 70 settlers
wearing black-and-white fringed prayer shawls carried two Torah
scrolls into the middle of the West Bank's north-south highway and
conducted morning prayers, blocking traffic.
	   Opposition to a troop withdrawal also grew within Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition, with three Netanyahu loyalists in
the Cabinet saying they might vote against an emerging agreement at
the Mideast summit in Maryland if Israel made too many concessions.
	   Justice Minister Tsahi Hanegbi said he would object to any deal
that does not include a promise by the Palestinian Authority to
hand over 36 wanted Palestinians, including several who killed
Israelis.
	   Israeli media quoted Netanyahu aides as saying the prime
minister might call snap elections if he believes he cannot get a
withdrawal agreement passed in the Cabinet or in parliament.
	   The opposition has said it would support an agreement with the
Palestinians in parliament, protecting Netanyahu's government from
falling because of expected defections by hard-liners in his
coalition.
	   But the safety net offered by Israeli moderates has a large hole
in it. They will support ``peace, not Netanyahu,'' as Yossi Sarid,
leader of the dovish Meretz party, put it.
	   The implication is that when a motion of no confidence on a
non-peace issue comes up, moderates would vote with the hard-liners
to bring down Netanyahu's government.
	   In the negotiations, Israel has agreed to turn over another 13.1
percent of the West Bank to Palestinian civilian control if the
Palestinians agree to Israeli conditions, mostly about security.
	   Israel threatened to walk out of the Wye Plantation talks
Wednesday, but remained after what Israeli officials called a
turnaround in Palestinian attitudes.
	   A senior Israeli official has said that as part of the
withdrawal plan, the Palestinian Authority would gain control of
some of the land near Beit Haggai, a picturesque settlement with
neat rows of red-roofed houses about 10 kilometers (six miles)
south of the Palestinian town of Hebron.
	   ``We are screaming our little scream against Netanyahu and his
government so that they won't surrender our land,'' said Zvi
Katsover, mayor of Kiryat Arba, a settlement next to Hebron, as he
stood in the middle of the road during Thursday's protest.
	   Asked why police did not try to clear the roads from the start,
Israeli police spokeswoman Linda Menuhin said police tried to avoid
conflict with the settlers, while keeping the roads open. She said
the settlers' demonstrations were brief and ``did not bring the
country to a stop.''

Reports: Malaysian court orders trial of 127 protesters
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments by human rights activist, latest details
on arrests, grafs 5-8 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A local court has ordered the
trial of 127 people who were arrested for participating in a
demonstration that demanded the resignation of Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad, news reports said Thursday.
	   They were produced Wednesday before a magistrate and charged
with unlawful assembly and disobeying police orders to disperse
from the streets of downtown Kuala Lumpur on Saturday, The Star
daily said.
	   All 127 pleaded innocent. Another person, who pleaded guilty,
was fined 2,000 ringgit (dlrs 526). Those going on trial, due to
begin in May, could be jailed for one year and fined 10,000 ringgit
(dlrs 2,600) if convicted.
	   Police have declared illegal all demonstrations in support of
jailed dissident leader Anwar Ibrahim, and have arrested people
each time such demonstrations have been held.
	   So far, authorities have detained 262 people who have been
released on bail pending trial.
	   Nineteen others, including Anwar, suspected of organizing the
demonstrations, were arrested under a harsh security law that
allows for indefinite imprisonment without trial. All but four have
been released.
	   Local human rights activists on Thursday praised the bravery of
the demonstrators, and urged more Malaysians to stand up for their
constitutional right to peaceful assembly.
	   Chandra Muzaffar, president of the International Movement for a
Just World, said he hoped that ``the courage and firmness shown by
Malaysians will open the eyes of their compatriots ... and persuade
them to join the struggle for freedom and justice in this dear land
of ours.''
	   Since Anwar's arrest, several thousand Malaysians have gathered
in Kuala Lumpur and other cities regularly to demand justice for
the jailed leader. Anwar faces trial beginning Nov. 2 on 10 counts
of corruption and illegal homosexual acts. He has called the
charges false and politically motivated.
	   Mahathir, who fired Anwar as deputy prime minister and finance
minister on Sept. 2, has said the protesters want to overthrow his
government by violence.
	   Speaking to local reporters Wednesday at a news conference where
foreign reporters were barred, Mahathir accused the foreign press
of trying to influence Anwar's trial by biased reporting.
	   ``The government is on trial as far as the foreign media is
concerned,'' Mahathir said.
	   ``They are not concerned whether Anwar is guilty or not but they
want to make sure the government or the courts are guilty,''
Mahathir was quoted as saying by the Star.
	   Meanwhile, Anwar's case continued to attract international
attention.
	   On Wednesday, Abid Hussain, the special rapporteur on freedom of
expression and opinion for the U.N. Commission on Human Rights,
visited Anwar's wife and expressed admiration for her courage in
facing up to the threats of arrests and police intimidation.
	   Azizah, Anwar's wife, said earlier she hoped she would not be
arrested on charges of encouraging protests against Mahathir.

ABB appeals against EU fine for alleged price fixing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Swedish-Swiss engineering group ABB
Asea Brown Boveri said Thursday it will appeal a dlrs 84 million
fine imposed by the European Union for alleged price fixing in the
1980s.
	   ABB said it considered the penalty levied by the EU's executive
body, the European Commission, disproportionate and out of line
with previous EU practice.
	   In its ruling, the commission fined ABB for its alleged
involvement in cartel activities in the heating pipe manufacturing
business between 1980 and 1989.
	   The fines were imposed for ``running a secret market-sharing,
price-fixing and bid-rigging cartel in pipes used for district
heating systems and for attempting to eliminate a competitor,'' the
commission said in a statement Wednesday.
	   Since 1996, when ABB management had established the facts on the
violations, ABB cooperated closely with the European Commission's
investigations, ABB said.
	   ``Following the discovery of the infringements, ABB has taken
strong internal measures to reinforce compliance with competition
rules,'' ABB said.

HIV carrier wanted by police may be Iranian, not American
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ The HIV-positive man being intensively
hunted by police for allegedly having unprotected sex with scores
of women apparently is an Iranian using the identity of a dead
American, police said Thursday.
	   The manhunt, now extended to neighboring Denmark, has been given
extensive coverage in Swedish newspapers, TV and radio, prompting a
flood of phone calls to police from women who had contact with him.
	   About 80 women have reported having sex with him, reports said
Thursday.
	   Police initially identified the man as James Patric Kimball of
the United States, but Interpol informed them that the man actually
was Mehdi Tayeb, 45, an Iranian citizen using Kimball's identity.
	   ``It seems that the man has used a false identity since 1985.
This does not surprise me completely, but it does not make our
investigation easier,'' police inspector Christer Sjoeblom told the
national news agency TT.
	   Kimball apparently died 13 years ago. The newspaper Expressen
reported Thursday that Kimball's father Ervin, in Gorham, Maine,
said James suffered a fatal heart attack in March 1985. The paper
published a photo of the father kneeling beside his son's
gravestone.
	   The passport Tayeb used was issued in Miami, in Kimball's name,
three months later.
	   The man has been charged in Sweden with rape and grave assault.
The latter charge has been used by Swedish authorities to prosecute
people who engage in unprotected sex while knowingly being infected
with HIV.
	   Tayeb also is wanted in the United States on charges of fraud
and handling of stolen goods, Swedish police said.
	   The man lived in a two-room apartment in a Stockholm suburb and
worked for a small taxi company, but claimed to have wide celebrity
contacts and styled himself as a party-arranger, according to
Stockholm newspapers.

South Africans brace for truth body's final report
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos NY108-110 &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ It is not an easy story to tell:
a tale of prejudice, torture and killing that spans more than three
decades and involves an entire nation.
	   But telling the story is the task of South Africa's Truth and
Reconciliation Commission, which will present its final report to
the nation next week.
	   On Oct. 29, Desmond Tutu will give the 3,500-page tome to
President Nelson Mandela and mark the end of the commission's trawl
through the violence that wracked South Africa during the apartheid
era.
	   The report is the culmination of the commission's work since it
was set up in 1995, a year after all-race elections ended
white-minority rule. It will describe the abuses of the past, try
to explain why they happened and apportion blame.
	   ``The report is an important milestone,'' Truth Commissioner
Mary Burton said. ``It has been a very necessary, but very
difficult experience for individuals and the country.''
	   Some whites, burdened by evidence of the brutality of the past,
may be relieved the probe is finally over. Others may be angry and
think it unfairly blames those who claim they were only fighting
communism.
	   For many blacks, the report means the story of their suffering
has finally been told, and that victims have been given a chance to
speak out. But some may feel cheated; most of apartheid's top
leaders are believed to have admitted nothing.
	   During its three years, the commission has rarely been out of
newspaper headlines. People like police death-squad leader Eugene
de Kock _ dubbed ``Prime Evil'' by his own men _ horrified the
world as they described cruel deaths meted out to black activists.
	   But among the horrors, there have been lights of hope, like
physiotherapist Gin Fourie, whose daughter was killed during an
attack by black gunmen on a Cape Town student bar.
	   Fourie supported giving amnesty to the three men who killed her
daughter. After they walked free from jail, she hugged them.
	   Truth Commission staff are tightlipped about the report's
details. However, it seems likely that senior figures from both
sides of the conflict will be criticized.
	   In recent months, the commission sent about 200 letters warning
people they may be portrayed negatively. Local newspaper reports
say liberation heroes like Mandela's ex-wife, Winnie
Madikizela-Mandela, and current Deputy Defense Minister Ronnie
Kasrils are on the list, as are senior apartheid figures like
former President P.W. Botha.
	   Though the blame for the past conflict will overwhelmingly be
placed on white governments and their brutal security services, the
African National Congress was nervous enough about the report to
request a meeting with the commission earlier this month.
	   The commission refused, to avoid appearing biased.
	   ANC spokesman Thabo Masebe said his party was told it could be
implicated in human rights violations for planting land mines on
border farms and for abuses at military camps in Angola. But Masebe
said the ruling ANC had nothing to fear.
	   ``We have not hidden anything,'' he said. ``Ours was a just
war.''
	   On numerous occasions, Tutu, a former Anglican archbishop and
winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, has stressed his belief that those
who struggled against apartheid, even if they used violence, were
on the side of justice.
	   The ``just war'' concept is likely to be discussed at length in
the report.
	   Even after the report, the commission's work will live on. It
has been swamped with 7,000 amnesty applications, and the amnesty
process has been extended indefinitely.
	   The report itself could also be potentially explosive. Many
prominent South Africans, like Madikizela-Mandela and Botha, did
not apply for amnesty. They could face criminal prosecution if the
report finds they committed human rights abuses.
	   The report will likely leave many questions unanswered.
Condensed from 20,500 victim statements and testimony from 140
public hearings in 61 different towns, it is a mere summary of
millions of pages of evidence that will be placed in South Africa's
National Archives.
	   As for reconciliation, the report will not immediately bridge
South Africa's age-old racial divides.
	   ``I don't think one should expect political miracles or dramatic
shifts in public opinion,'' said Tom Lodge, professor of politics
at the University of the Witwatersrand. ``But I think it will
contribute to a general healing.''

Romania's interior ministry fires 10 high-ranking officers for
</HEADLINE>
fraud &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Romania's interior minister has fired
ten top officers accused of misappropriating huge sums of public
money, a newspaper reported Thursday.
	   Gavril Dejeu said a financial audit by ministry officials
revealed that the officers had misappropriated billions of lei
(millions of dollars) from 1993-97, the daily Libertatea quoted him
as saying.
	   The ten allegedly misused money earmarked for public projects
such as building roads and bridges. There was no comment from any
of the officers, who are colonels and lieutenants and are being
investigated by prosecutors.
	   In recent months, Dejeu has been criticized for failing to stem
alleged cases of corruption in his ministry.
	   Corruption and fraud is widespread in Romania, starting with
small things like shop receipts and allegedly plaguing high-level
business deals.
	   Reformers won elections two years ago, vowing to eradicate
top-level corruption, but are seen to have largely failed.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's biggest brokerage, Nomura Securities Co.,
said Thursday it lost dlrs 1.76 billion in the first half of fiscal
1998 as global financial turmoil took a toll, especially on its
overseas operations.
	   Two other Japanese brokerages also reported losses, although on
a smaller scale than Nomura's.
	   Nomura posted a group loss of 207.2 billion yen (dlrs 1.76
billion) for the half year ended Sept. 30, compared to a net profit
of 49.71 billion yen (dlrs 422 million) in the same period a year
earlier.
	   The company lost hundreds of millions of dollars on its holdings
of Russian bonds.
	   In the United States, Nomura's once-celebrated
real-estate-finance unit lost about dlrs 600 million over the six
months, the company said. Nomura was forced to inject dlrs 1.2
billion into its U.S. operation to cover all the losses there.
	   The losses will prompt Nomura to cut between 1,000 and 2,000
jobs worldwide, a news report said.
	   The cuts will include layoffs at Nomura's U.S. and British
subsidiaries, according to Kyodo News service. In Japan, Nomura cut
as many as 1,000 jobs from a work force of 10,000 by freezing new
hiring and encouraging some employees to retire early, the report
said.
	   Japan's second- and third-largest securities companies also
announced big losses Thursday.
	   Daiwa Securities Co. posted a group net loss of 66.84 billion
yen (dlrs 568 million) for the half-year, compared to a net profit
of 15.53 billion yen (dlrs 132 million) last year.
	   Nikko Securities, Co. suffered a group net less of 57.72 billion
yen (dlrs 491 million) compared to a net profit of 283 million yen
(dlrs 2.4 million) a year earlier.

Furious education officials walk out on prime minister
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DONNA BRYSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ A chorus of blind children singing a
hymn to the Hindu goddess of learning prompted education officials
to storm out of a conference Thursday attended by Indian Prime
Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
	   The hymn was the last straw for the officials who have been
incensed by the federal government's recommendations that
``education should be Indianized, nationalized and spiritualized.''
The recommendations, made by an unknown ``group of experts,'' also
call for study of Hindu religious treatises at all levels of
education.
	   ``They want to make this a theocratic state,'' fumed S.H.
Chakravarty, minister for higher education in the leftist
government of West Bengal, a state in eastern India.
	   He was among about 40 officials whose shouts competed with the
clear voices of the blind children as they walked out briefly at
the beginning of a conference of state education and youth affairs
ministers.
	   ``This is anti-minority,'' said Abdul Bahri Siddiqui, minister
of sports and culture in eastern Bihar state and a Muslim. Some 80
percent of India's nearly 1 billion people are Hindu; Muslims make
up the largest minority at about 12 percent of the population.
	   Vajpayee's Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party faces a hard
fight in its efforts to impose its vision of India, where education
ministers in 32 states and territories have broad policy making
powers.
	   In his conference speech, Murli Manohar Joshi, the federal
minister in charge of education, acknowledged the difficulty the
central government has in getting cooperation from the state
education ministers if it wants its ideas implemented.
	   ``There is obviously no question of taking any hasty or
pre-conceived decision or chalking up any implementation plan ...
without any clear consensus,'' Joshi said.
	   Many of the state ministers directed their anger at Vajpayee,
who sat impassively next to Joshi during the protest. In a speech
later, Vajpayee stressed children should be taught to respect all
religions, and that ``there must be no place for religious bigotry
and intolerance'' in schools.
	   Vajpayee's party wants to promote Hindutva, roughly translated
as Hindu culture, at all levels of Indian society. But it has had
to soften its approach to ensure the loyalty of the 19 other
parties in the governing coalition it leads.

Russian official: IMF wants to see long-term economic plan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A visiting International Monetary Fund teams wants
to see a long-term economic recovery plan from Russia, but the
country doesn't have one and is therefore unlikely to get new loan
installments soon, a senior Russia official said Thursday.
	   The government has spent this week working on a budget plan for
the final three months of the year, and more extended forecasts are
still in the making, Deputy Finance Minister Oleg Vyugin said in an
interview published in the daily liberal Vremya (Time).
	   The IMF, meanwhile, has been asking to see the government's plan
through the end of 1999, Vyugin said.
	   ``There is no official budget plan for next year, and that will
complicate our talks with the IMF,'' Vyugin said. ``We can't offer
them any document. To speak the truth, we don't even have a final
version for ourselves (in the Finance Ministry).''
	   The IMF organized a dlrs 22.6 billion bailout package with
Russia in July, a month before the country's economic crisis hit
with full force. Russia received the first installment of dlrs 4.8
billion, but the IMF has frozen additional money.
	   In the meantime, the Russian government is scrambling to come up
with money to pay its bill.
	   The government plans to spend 130 billion rubles (dlrs 7.6
billion) in the final three months of the year, but expects
revenues of only around 70 billion rubles (dlrs 4.1 billion),
officials said earlier this week.
	   If the government does not receive foreign help, it will have to
make up most of the shortfall by printing money, a move that would
drive inflation higher.
	   Vyugin said the government had already warned the IMF about the
possibility of printing more money.

Western officials push both sides to achieve peace in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TOM COHEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ With Kosovo's cease-fire still
mostly holding, Western officials pressed both Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic and the ethnic Albanians on Thursday to do more
to achieve lasting peace in the embattled province.
	   The French foreign minister warned that Milosevic still must
pull out more troops, and U.S. envoy Christopher Hill was expected
to hold new talks with political leader Ibrahim Rugova and other
ethnic Albanian officials.
	   Ten days after the breakthrough agreement on Kosovo brokered by
American diplomat Richard Holbrooke, there are scattered reports of
shelling and shooting incidents at night but no apparent fighting
in the separatist province of Serbia, the dominant of the two
republics that make up Yugoslavia.
	   Still threatening airstrikes, NATO has given Milosevic until
Tuesday to withdraw more military and special police forces from
Kosovo and return others to garrison in the province where he
launched an offensive against ethnic Albanian guerrillas eight
months ago.
	   ``The withdrawal of forces is very advanced, but that is not
enough,'' French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said on France's
RTL radio Thursday, warning that the conflict could explode again.
NATO must ``not let go'' now, he said.
	   Milosevic also must cooperate with war crimes investigations and
efforts to aid and return the 300,000 people displaced from their
homes, and agree on a specific timetable for talks giving Kosovo
Albanians self-government and their own local police.
	   But the ethnic Albanians must also consent to political
negotiations, and many remain reluctant to give up their goal of
outright independence for promises of regaining their autonomy.
	   Hill has been working to get them to sit down for talks with
Serb authorities, while making clear independence is not an option.
Western nations fear an independent Kosovo would trigger similar
demands by ethnic Albanian communities in Macedonia and elsewhere
in the southern Balkans.
	   The ethnic Albanians' Kosovo Liberation Army has been fighting
for independence for Kosovo. But the West considers Rugova, the
moderate ethnic Albanian leader, and his negotiating team the
legitimate representatives of the Kosovo Albanians, who account for
about 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million people.
	   Also Thursday, the 54-nation Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe was set to formally approve a ground
verification force of roughly 2,000 international monitors who will
ensure that Yugoslavia keeps its promises in Kosovo.
	   The vote will authorize the first of the verifiers _ about 50
Americans, Europeans and Russians already in Kosovo as part of a
diplomatic mission. American diplomat William Walker, the mission
chief, is to head to the provincial capital Pristina next week to
officially launch the mission.
	   At the United Nations in New York, a Security Council resolution
aimed at backing the Oct. 12 Kosovo accord stalled Wednesday amid
differences over whether to use the threat of force to implement
the agreement.
	   An effort to warn both sides that the international community
would use ``all necessary measures,'' to enforce the agreement
appears to have been quashed, diplomatic sources said on condition
of anonymity.
	   Permanent council members Russia and China are adamantly against
using force and said they wouldn't support any resolution that
carried the threat of international intervention to enforce the
deal.

HIV carrier wanted by police may be Iranian, not American
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ The HIV-positive man sought by police
for allegedly having unprotected sex with scores of women
apparently is an Iranian using the identity of a dead American,
police said Thursday.
	   The manhunt, now extended to neighboring Denmark, has been given
extensive coverage in Swedish newspapers, TV and radio, prompting a
flood of phone calls to police from women who had contact with him.
About 80 women have reported having sex with him, reports said
Thursday.
	   Police initially identified the man as James Patric Kimball of
the United States, but Interpol informed them that the man actually
was Mehdi Tayeb, 45, an Iranian citizen using Kimball's identity.
	   ``It seems that the man has used a false identity since 1985.
This does not surprise me completely, but it does not make our
investigation easier,'' police inspector Christer Sjoeblom told the
national news agency TT.
	   Kimball apparently died 13 years ago. The newspaper Expressen
reported Thursday that Kimball's father Ervin, in Gorham, Maine,
said James suffered a fatal heart attack in March 1985. The paper
published a photo of the father kneeling beside his son's
gravestone.
	   The passport Tayeb used was issued in Miami, in Kimball's name,
three months later.
	   The man has been charged in Sweden with rape and grave assault.
The latter charge has been used by Swedish authorities to prosecute
people who engage in unprotected sex while knowingly being infected
with HIV.
	   Tayeb also is wanted in the United States on charges of fraud
and handling of stolen goods, Swedish police said.
	   The man lived in a two-room apartment in a Stockholm suburb and
worked for a small taxi company, but claimed to have wide celebrity
contacts and styled himself as a party-arranger, according to
Stockholm newspapers.

Editor-in-chief of banned liberal paper released
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ The editor-in-chief of a banned liberal
paper has been released from detention, the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported Thursday.
	   Mahmoud Shams, editor-in-chief of Tous newspaper, was released
on bail Wednesday night, the agency said. IRNA did not report the
amount of the bail for Shams.
	   He was the last of four key figures at the paper to be released
after they were arrested on Sept. 16 on charges of activities
against Iran's security and interests.
	   Earlier Wednesday, Ebrahim Nabavi, a columnist at the paper, and
Mohammed Sadeq Javadi Hesar, a director, were freed on bail.
	   The managing director of the paper, Hamid Reza Jalaipur, was
released on bail last week on the orders of Iran's supreme leader,
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, following an appeal by Jalaipur's mother.
	   The newspaper had angered hard-liners by questioning the
authority of Khamenei. Hard-liners in the judiciary have shut down
six publications in recent months and detained six journalists for
allegedly publishing lies.
	   The crackdown is stymieing the efforts of moderate President
Mohammad Khatami, who has promoted press freedom since taking
office in August 1997.
	   Tous had begun with the name Jameah. It was closed in July but
reappeared shortly afterward under the title Tous.
	   No date has been set for a trial of Shams and the other Tous
journalists who were arrested and then released.

Red Star coach resigns following UEFA Cup loss
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Red Star coach Milorad Kosanovic has
resigned following his team's 2-1 loss to Lyon in the UEFA Cup, the
Belgrade soccer club announced Thursday.
	   Kosanovic, who has been training Red Star for 18 months, was
replaced by his aide and the team's former forward Vojin Lazarevic.
	   Red Star was forced to play its second-round, first-leg UEFA Cup
home game against France's Lyon in Bucharest, Romania, on Tuesday
due to security concerns related to the threat of NATO airstrikes
on military targets in Yugoslavia.
	   The best-known Yugoslav team, which was the 1991 Champions' Cup
winner, is also struggling in the weak domestic league, lagging in
fourth place with 10 points fewer than rival Partizan Belgrade.
	   Kosanovic, who was highly unpopular among Red Star fans, said he
couldn't endure their pressure.
	   ``The negative atmosphere among the fans reflected badly on the
team's play,'' he said. ``I had no choice but to leave.''

Greek, Russian foreign ministers discuss Kosovo, Cyprus
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos
discussed the situation in Kosovo and the divided island of Cyprus
during a meeting Thursday with his Russian counterpart Igor Ivanov.
	   The two ministers were expected to sign cooperation agreements,
the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   The Russian Foreign Ministry has said that Pangalos' talks would
not address military cooperation between Russia and Greece.
	   Russia has delayed the delivery of S-300 anti-aircraft missiles
to the Greek Cypriots for several months following warnings from
Turkey that the move would escalate tensions. Cyprus, an
independent country, has been divided into ethnic Greek and ethnic
Turkish sectors for almost a quarter-century.
	   On the issue of Kosovo, Russia opposes proposed NATO airstrikes
on the Yugoslav province. Pangalos has said Western powers have
blown the conflict out of proportion and warned that airstrikes
would cause serious problems for the whole Balkan peninsula.
	   Pangalos plans to stay in Moscow through Friday.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Shares of Japan's top cellular-phone company soared
Thursday in the world's biggest initial public stock offering to
date.
	   NTT Mobile Communications Network Inc., commonly known as NTT
DoCoMo, raised 2.13 trillion yen (dlrs 18.6 billion) through the
share sale, making it Japan's third largest company in terms of
market capitalization after its parent company Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone Corp. and Toyota Motor Corp.
	   The stock rose to 4.65 million yen (dlrs 39,540) in its first
day of trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, a gain of 750,000 yen
(dlrs 6,410), or 19 percent, from its 3.9 million yen (dlrs 33,163)
initial public offering price.
	   The advance had been expected, as Japan's fast-growing and
profitable cellular-phone industry is a bright spot in an economy
mired in its deepest recession in decades.
	   The cellular market has grown from around 2 million subscribers
in 1995 to 42.8 million at the end of September. With a 57 percent
market share, NTT DoCoMo has a commanding lead over two rival
companies.
	   DoCoMo forecast Thursday that its net profit will rise 53
percent this fiscal year to 184 billion yen (dlrs 1.6 billion) from
120.63 billion yen (dlrs 1 billion) last year.
	   Analysts said one risk for NTT DoCoMo is the large loss they
expect the company to suffer as it absorbs the operations and debts
of NTT Personal Communications Network. NTT Personal sells a
cheaper version of cellular service known as the personal
handyphone system, or PHS.
	   PHS phones can't be used in moving vehicles or in remote areas,
and the falling price of cellular phones has made it increasingly
difficult for PHS providers to compete.
	   DoCoMo's initial public offering was the largest since parent
NTT went public for dlrs 13.6 billion in 1986. The sale of 545,000
shares includes 218,000 shares from NTT and 327,000 newly issued
shares.
	   NTT, the country's largest phone company, had held 95 percent of
DoCoMo and will retain a 67 percent share of the company even after
Thursday's sale.
	   NTT DoCoMo plans to use the proceeds from its stock sale to
develop a new cellular phone system.

 &UR; Eds: Wraps up with late dollar, bond, comments &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo stocks rose for the fifth consecutive session
Thursday, lifted by the listing of Japan's largest cellular phone
company. The U.S. dollar rose against the yen on speculation that
German interest rates may ease.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 79.23
points, or 0.56 percent, closing at 14,295.56. On Wednesday, it had
climbed 408.28 points, or 2.96 percent.
	   The dollar bought 117.72 yen in late afternoon, up 1.36 yen from
late Wednesday in Tokyo and also above its New York rate of 117.00
yen in late overnight trading. In Thursday's trading, it ranged
between 117.15 yen and 118.20 yen.
	   Traders said the market debut of NTT Mobile Communications
Network Inc., better known as NTT DoCoMo, boosted confidence.
	   ``The listing of NTT DoCoMo was a success,'' said Yasuo Ueki,
general manager at Nikko Securities. But it was unclear whether
DoCoMo, a subsidiary of telecommunications giant Nippon Telegraph
and Telephone Corp., would continue to support the market, he
added.
	   Shares of NTT DoCoMo closed at 4.65 million yen (dlrs 39,540),
up 19 percent from the initial public offering price of 3.9 million
yen (dlrs 33,163).
	   The market was also lifted on hopes that more of Japan's
troubled banks will accept public funds.
	   But an early rally ran out of steam in the afternoon. The Nikkei
was up 415.29 points, or 2.92 percent, at the end of morning
trading.
	   But traders said some shares, including steel, shipping and
banking issues, came under selling pressure as investors rushed to
raise funds to snap up NTT DoCoMo shares.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section rose 2.46 points, or 0.23 percent, to 1,074.29. It
had gained 28.81 points, or 2.76 percent, the previous day.
	   Volume on the first section was estimated at 868 million shares,
up from 861.51 million Wednesday. Thursday's turnover was boosted
by heavy trading in bank shares. Advances beat retreats 690 to 505,
while 117 issues were unchanged.
	   In currency dealings, Japanese investors continued to bid up the
dollar against the German mark Thursday after it rose nearly two
pfennigs Wednesday.
	   The dollar was quoted at 1.6558 marks, up from 1.6370 late
Wednesday in Tokyo and 1.6525 late in New York overnight.
	   The dollar's surge came after German central bank official Hans
Juergen Krupp told a German news magazine European short-term
interest rates should converge below Germany's. Traders interpreted
his remarks as favoring a German rate cut sometime before the euro
is launched on Jan. 1.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 0.830 percent from Wednesday's finish of 0.845
percent, driving up its price to 108.66 yen from 108.52 yen.

Anti-government strike paralyzes life in several Bangladesh cities

	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Riot police fired tear gas at
anti-government protesters who burned a police van, attacked buses
and exploded firecrackers Thursday as they paralyzed at least 60
cities and towns with a general strike. At least 50 people were
injured, doctors and witnesses said.
	   Hospitals admitted 25 people with cuts and bruises after
demonstrators attacked their bus for defying the general strike
call in Dhaka's northern Mirpur district, doctors said
	   The strike, the second in a week, was sponsored by an alliance
of seven opposition parties which accuse the government of
corruption and mismanaging relief aid for millions of flood
victims.
	   In downtown Dhaka, some protesters burned a police van after the
security forces left it unprotected to chased stone-throwing
activists, witnesses said.
	   Demonstrators forced motorists to stay off the roads and shut
businesses. But hundreds of bicycle rickshaw drivers, who survive
on a daily income of 100 takas (dlrs 2), ignored the strike call.
	   More than 5,000 security forces patrolled the capital's streets.
	   A day earlier, some 250 street children were detained to prevent
them from being hired to bolster the crowds and smash vehicles that
defy the strike.
	   The opposition said state-run banks are slow to disburse credit
to farmers to replant their crops, and supporters of the ruling
party are favored in the distribution of rice and wheat.
	   Bangladesh has received dlrs 210 million in international food
assistance to feed nearly 35 million people who lost their crops or
houses. More than 900 people died in July and August, in one of the
country's worst floods on record. The flooding was caused by
unusually heavy rains and a series of undersea earthquakes that
created higher-than-normal tides in the Bay of Bengal.

Moseley leads South Australian Open

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ Jarrod Moseley shot a 6-under par 66
Thursday to lead by two after the first round of the Australian
dlrs 500,000 (U.S. dlrs 316,000) Ford South Australian Open golf
tournament at the 6,160-meter (6,736-yard) Kooyonga Golf Club
course.
	   Australian Moseley had a brilliant five holes from the 7th to
11th, getting four birdies and an eagle. He had six birdies, an
eagle and two bogeys overall, including a dropped shot on the par-4
17th.
	   ``My round had flattened out and I just cruised home, I didn't
want to make many mistakes,'' Moseley said. ``I dropped 17 but
that's a tough hole and I hit into the rough down there so I was
happy with my finish.''
	   Australians Stephen Leaney, Matthew King and Jamie McCallum were
tied for second after 68s while there were seven players on 69.
	   Robin Byrd, of the United States, was the leading international
on 70. England's Justin Rose, who turned professional after his tie
for 4th at the British Open in July, shot 77 and will struggle to
make the cut.

Chechnya's president orders rebel commanders to surrender
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Chechnya's President Aslan Maskhadov ordered rebel
field commanders Thursday to disband their units, threatening a
crackdown if they disobeyed, a news report said.
	   Since the end of Chechnya's 1994-6 war with Russia, many field
commanders have remained outside the control of the territory's
government, and are unlikely to comply with this latest order.
	   In a decree signed Thursday, Maskhadov also demanded that the
``military bases of these formations be eliminated immediately,''
the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Maskhadov has ordered the police and security forces to enforce
the decree and prosecute field commander who fail to comply, said
presidential spokesman Mairbek Vachagayev, according to Interfax.
	   The renegade armed units discredit Chechnya's effort to be
recognized as an independent state, Maskhadov said in his decree.
	   Chechnya has been running its own affairs since the end of the
war against Russia, but no country has recognized its independence
claim. Moscow insists the territory remains part of Russia.
	   Maskhadov also planned to meet field commanders loyal to his
government on Thursday, Vachagayev said. The talks may deal with
plans to the many hostages who have been seized in Chechnya since
the end of the war, he said.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's biggest brokerage, Nomura Securities Co.,
said Thursday it lost dlrs 1.76 billion in the first half of fiscal
1998 as global financial turmoil took a toll, especially on its
overseas operations.
	   Two other Japanese brokerages also reported losses, although on
a smaller scale than Nomura's.
	   Nomura posted a group loss of 207.2 billion yen (dlrs 1.76
billion) for the half year ended Sept. 30, compared to a net profit
of 49.71 billion yen (dlrs 422 million) in the same period a year
earlier.
	   The company lost hundreds of millions of dollars on its holdings
of Russian bonds.
	   In the United States, Nomura's once-celebrated
real-estate-finance unit lost about dlrs 600 million over the six
months, the company said. Nomura was forced to inject dlrs 1.2
billion into its U.S. operation to cover all the losses there.
	   The losses will prompt Nomura to cut between 1,000 and 2,000
jobs worldwide, a news report said.
	   The cuts will include layoffs at Nomura's U.S. and British
subsidiaries, according to Kyodo News service. In Japan, Nomura cut
as many as 1,000 jobs from a work force of 10,000 by freezing new
hiring and encouraging some employees to retire early, the report
said.
	   Japan's second- and third-largest securities companies also
announced big losses Thursday.
	   Daiwa Securities Co. posted a group net loss of 66.84 billion
yen (dlrs 568 million) for the half-year, compared to a net profit
of 15.53 billion yen (dlrs 132 million) last year.
	   Nikko Securities, Co. suffered a group net less of 57.72 billion
yen (dlrs 491 million) compared to a net profit of 283 million yen
(dlrs 2.4 million) a year earlier.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Creditor banks are expected to approve
Hyundai Motors Co.'s takeover of bankrupt Kia Motors Corp., a top
government official said Thursday.
	   The comment by Chairman Lee Hun-jai of the Financial Supervisory
Commission appeared to be a tacit government endorsement of
Hyundai's bid to acquire Kia.
	   Hyundai was named the winning bidder for Kia in an auction
Monday, but its offer still must be approved by Kia's creditor
banks, most of which are controlled by the government.
	   ``As far as there are no other options, the creditor banks are
expected to approve the results of Monday's auction,'' Lee told a
meeting with business leaders.
	   Hyundai bid was chosen over those of Ford Motor Co. of the
United States and two domestic competitors, Daewoo Motors Co. and
Samsung Motors Inc.
	   There has been speculation that the banks might reject Hyundai's
bid, which included a demand that they write off dlrs 7.3 billion
of Kia's dlrs 8.4 billion debt.
	   Lee said Hyundai's takeover of Kia would spur a reorganization
of South Korea's shaky auto industry, plagued by over-supply
problems.
	   With a combined capacity of 3.5 million vehicles a year, South
Korea is the world's fifth largest car producer.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ China's ambassador to Singapore said the tiny
city-state tops all other Southeast Asian countries in trade and
economic cooperation with her country, a newspaper reported
Thursday.
	   ``Singapore now enjoys the closest economic relations with China
among ASEAN countries in trade and investment,'' Chen Baoliu was
quoted as saying in The Straits Times.
	   Bilateral trade reached dlrs 8.78 billion in 1997, about
one-third of the dlrs 25.1 billion total trade between China and
members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations last year,
the daily reported.
	   ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
	   Singapore, which is predominantly ethnic Chinese, has encouraged
greater trade and investment with China since the two countries
established diplomatic relations in 1990.
	   The government here has spearheaded several ambitious joint
projects in various industrial zones in the mainland, and has urged
entrepreneurs to explore business opportunities in China.
	   As a result, small Singapore was China's fifth largest investor
last year, committing dlrs 8.75 billion in fresh projects, the
daily said.
	   But not all these projects have yet borne fruit. The Suzhou
Industrial Park _ 65 percent owned by Singapore and 35 percent by
China _ has been mired in disagreements almost since its inception
four years ago.
	   Singapore has expressed concerns that the park was not
commercially viable. Less than half of the 106 projects were
operating as of June, although dlrs 3.2 billion had been invested.

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodian leader Hun Sen called
Thursday for the formation of a government that would concentrate
on the economy and make the reforms needed to attract new
investment.
	   In a speech on the anniversary of the 1991 Paris Peace Accords,
Hun Sen acknowledged that recent political instability had hurt
Cambodia's economy. He said the country needs a new economic policy
including wide-ranging reforms in the army, police, civil
administration and judiciary.
	   ``Combat against corruption, against the abuse of power and
against negative phenomena in society must become the routine
activities of these forces without exception,'' he said. ``We must
not let our citizens and businessmen fall victims to these negative
acts.''
	   Hun Sen's ruling party and the two-party opposition are
deadlocked in negotiations over the formation of the next
government after elections held in July.
	   Promises to get tough on crime and ensure fair and equitable
treatment for all businesses were cornerstones of Hun Sen's plan.
	   Kidnappings of businessmen for ransom is a periodic occurrence
in the Cambodian capital, and new investors have complained that
their entrenched competition receives breaks on taxes and duties
from cronies in the government.
	   Hun Sen also paid special attention to the illegal timber trade
that deprives the cash-strapped Cambodian treasury of millions of
dollars in export duties each year.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Moody's Investors Service said Thursday that it is
considering lowering its credit ratings on five mid-size Japanese
banks.
	   Moody's is reviewing its ratings on Fukuoka City Bank Ltd., Joyo
Bank Ltd., Bank of Yokohama Ltd., Gunma Bank Ltd. and Suruga Bank
Ltd. All are regional lenders.
	   Moody's said the reviews were ``prompted by concerns that the
continuous deterioration of Japan's economy and financial markets
may further affect the financial fundamentals of these regional
banks.''
	   Moody's ratings are used by bond investors and lenders to assess
the risk that a bank will be unable to repay some of its
obligations. A lower rating is associated with higher risk and, in
theory, would increase the banks' costs of raising funds.
	   Moody's currently rates the five banks' debt near the middle of
so-called ``investment-grade'' securities. Among them, Fukuoka City
Bank carries the lowest Moody's ranking with a ``Baa1.'' Bank of
Yokohama is rated ``A3,'' Surugu Bank carries an ``A2,'' and Joyo
Bank and Gunma Bank are rated ``A1.''
	   Bad-loan problems at Japanese banks have been a major factor
contributing to the country's deepest recession in its postwar
history.
	   Japan's Parliament adopted laws earlier this month which will
allow the government to take over foundering banks and to inject up
to 60 trillion yen (dlrs 515 billion) in taxpayer money into the
cash-strapped financial system.

Editor-in-chief of banned liberal paper released
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ The editor-in-chief of a banned liberal
paper has been released from detention, the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported Thursday.
	   Mahmoud Shams, editor-in-chief of Tous newspaper, was released
on bail Wednesday night, the agency said. IRNA did not report the
amount of the bail.
	   He was the last of four key figures at the paper to be released
after they were arrested Sept. 16 on charges of activities against
Iran's security and interests.
	   Earlier Wednesday, Ebrahim Nabavi, a columnist at the paper, and
Mohammed Sadeq Javadi Hesar, a director, were freed on bail.
	   The managing director of the paper, Hamid Reza Jalaipur, was
released on bail last week on the orders of Iran's supreme leader,
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, following an appeal by Jalaipur's mother.
	   The newspaper angered hard-liners by questioning the authority
of Khamenei. Hard-liners in the judiciary have shut down six
publications in recent months and detained six journalists for
allegedly publishing lies.
	   The crackdown is hindering the efforts of moderate President
Mohammad Khatami, who has promoted press freedom since taking
office in August 1997.
	   Tous had begun with the name Jameah, which closed in July but
reappeared shortly afterward under the title Tous.
	   No date has been set for a trial of Shams and the other Tous
journalists who were arrested and then released.

`Straw Man' shares in long-distance love fest
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BETH HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN DIEGO (AP) _ A continent away from the raucous,
champagne-soaked, smoke-filled New York Yankees clubhouse, Darryl
Strawberry felt the love of his teammates.
	   The cancer-stricken slugger missed their World Series sweep of
the San Diego Padres after undergoing colon cancer surgery earlier
this month.
	   But his presence was felt during a telephone call after New
York's 3-0 victory wrapped up its 24th world championship Wednesday
night.
	   ``We told him how much we loved him and missed him. It was a
very emotional moment,'' catcher Joe Girardi said of the trainer's
room chat. ``It was hard without Darryl, not so much because of his
baseball presence but just as a person.''
	   Strawberry told his teammates how proud he was of them as he
watched Game 4 and stayed tuned to the postgame interviews.
	   ``We told him that we loved him and that we couldn't have done
this without him,'' pitcher David Cone said. ``This one's for
Darryl, he's as much a part of this as anyone else.''
	   Indeed, Strawberry might as well have been squeezed into the
small, sweaty visitor's clubhouse as many times as his name was
chanted.
	   David Wells raised his voice above the din and shouted, ``We
finally did it, we did it great. This one is for the Straw Man.''
	   The rest of the soaked Yankees, white championship T-shirts
clinging to their bodies, momentarily stopped dousing each other
and yelled, ``Straw Man! Straw Man!''
	   ``We're thinking about Darryl and Joe DiMaggio. It was
emotional,'' team owner George Steinbrenner said. ``They're both
tremendous Yankees.''
	   DiMaggio, ``The Yankee Clipper,'' is hospitalized in Florida
with pneumonia, which kept him from tossing out the first pitch in
Game 1.
	   New York fans gathered in the stands above the team's dugout for
their post-game shouted salute of ``Darryl! Darryl!''
	   Strawberry made his first public appearance Wednesday since
being released from the hospital last Friday.
	   The 36-year-old slugger said his prognosis is good because
doctors caught the colon cancer early. ``Don't worry _ I'm going to
live,'' he said.
	   He's also getting ready for the big party in New York at
Steinbrenner's request.
	   ``The Boss called me to tell me to get ready for the parade,''
Strawberry said.
	   The Yankees won 125 games this season, prompting Steinbrenner to
label his team ``as good as any there's ever been.''
	   ``I'm not going to rate our fellows because that might take away
from the others,'' he said of previous great Yankees teams.
	   Steinbrenner didn't stay dry for long. Grinning mischievously,
Derek Jeter pointed an extra-large, green champagne bottle at the
owner's navy blazer, white turtleneck and gray hair, leaving a
disheveled Steinbrenner grabbing for a towel.
	   ``I got to get a bottle and do some soaking of my own,''
Steinbrenner said. ``I got a few guys I want to get.''
	   ``Mr. October'' Reggie Jackson, who starred on New York's
championship teams of 1977 and 1978, pushed his way through the
chaos and embraced any players he encountered. ``I just want to
visit,'' he told reporters.
	   As people bounced around him like bowling pins, outfielder
Bernie Williams celebrated what may have been his final game in a
New York uniform. His future is in doubt during contract
negotiations.
	   ``I'm just enjoying the moment,'' he said, an unlit cigar in his
right hand. ``We had a lot of pressure. We won so many games in the
regular season, we had to prove we were the best.''
	   While the Yankees got rowdy inside, their fans put on a show
outside. As the stadium lights blinked off and the loud music was
silenced, they kept chanting, ``Best team ever.''

Typhoon Babs sweeps across Philippines toward Manila

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Typhoon Babs swept across the central
Philippines toward Manila on Thursday, ripping roofs off bamboo
houses, triggering landslides and forcing widespread evacuations.
	   Disaster officials said at least two people were killed and two
others were injured. In Camarines Sur province, three fishermen
were missing after they were washed away by surging waves.
	   About 28,500 people were evacuated from their homes in at least
four provinces, the officials said.
	   Schools, government offices and businesses were closed in Manila
as the capital prepared for a direct hit by the storm.
	   ``We are advising people to evacuate if they are living in
low-lying areas because of the power of the typhoon,'' said weather
forecaster Leny Ruiz. ``This typhoon is going to be no joke.''
	   The typhoon comes only a week after parts of the northern
Philippines were devastated by Typhoon Zeb, which killed at least
74 people in the country.
	   Babs' strong winds knocked down trees and power lines, leaving
many remote areas of the central Philippines without
communications. Authorities appealed for help from amateur radio
operators.
	   President Joseph Estrada called on slum dwellers living in
makeshift houses along river banks in metropolitan Manila to move
to safer ground.
	   Two passenger ships en route to Manila with 1,300 people aboard
sought shelter near islands in the central Philippines.
	   All sea vessels were banned from leaving Manila, and ferry
service was halted in many ports, stranding thousands of
passengers.
	   The typhoon also prevented three Indian naval ships from making
a scheduled port call in Manila, the Indian Embassy said.
	   In late afternoon, the typhoon was centered over Lamon Bay in
Quezon province, 160 kilometers (100 miles) southeast of Manila. It
had sustained winds of 150 kph (94 mph), with gusts of up to 186
kph (116 mph), weather officials said.
	   After striking Manila, the storm was expected to threaten
several northern provinces surrounding the Mount Pinatubo volcano.
Pinatubo's eruption in 1991 left millions of tons of volcanic
debris on its slopes _ material that may cause landslides and
floods during heavy rains.
	   At least 12,800 people were evacuated in Catanduanes Island,
which was struck by Babs late Wednesday, disaster officials said.
The island was without electricity after a power generating barge
was washed away from its moorings to sea.
	   In nearby Quezon province, at least 6,000 people were staying in
churches and schools.
	   On Negros Island, about 6,200 people were evacuated from eight
villages after flooding eroded a river bank and threatened to sweep
away houses, disaster officials said.
	   On Marinduque Island, 3,500 people were evacuated from the banks
of a river filled with silt from a nearby copper mine.
	   Landslides, flooding and widespread damage to houses were
reported in various areas, officials said.
	   Last week, about 415,000 Filipinos fled their homes at the
height of Typhoon Zeb, which left 37 people missing in addition to
killing 74.
	   Zeb then struck Taiwan, killing 31 people, before cutting across
Japan, where it killed at least 12 others.

Hong Kong shares end moderately lower in lackluster trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong shares finished a touch lower
Thursday after giving up early gains in a dull session.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index shed 3.54 points, or 0.04 percent,
closing at 9,658.58. The index rose more than 100 points at one
point in early morning, then began to drift down as buying interest
fizzled amid a lack of any fresh news to encourage investors.
	   ``The market is quite sluggish. There's not much indication from
overseas markets,'' said Michael Ng, dealing director at Sassoon
Securities Ltd. Investors seem to think interest rates may have
bottomed out for the near term, which was putting a damper on the
market, he said.
	   HSBC Holdings _ the banking company whose stock is the biggest
on the the Hong Kong Stock Exchange _ led the day's gainers,
closing 3.00 Hong Kong dollars higher at 180.00. Other gainers were
Swire Pacific ``A,'' up 0.90 at 33.30, Hang Seng Bank up 0.75 at
65.00, and China Light up 0.70 at 41.10.
	   Among the losers were New World Development, down 1.50 at 17.30,
Cheung Kong Holdings down 0.80 at 49.00, Shanghai Industrial down
0.75 at 16.60, and China Resources down 0.65 at 9.20.
	   Hong Kong's airline, Cathay Pacific, was down 0.05 at 8.30.

Malaysia keen on bidding for 2008 Olympic Games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia is making a serious bid
to play host to the 2008 Olympic Games, a senior sports official
said Thursday.
	   Deputy Sports Minister Loke Yuen Yow told Parliament a special
committee had been formed to study whether Malaysia could stage the
world's biggest sporting event, the national news agency Bernama
reported.
	   He said local sports officials would visit the International
Olympic Committee headquarters in Switzerland next month to study
bidding procedures and seek advice from Olympic board members.
	   ``If we can successfully organize the Commonwealth Games, I
believe we can also organize the Olympic Games,'' Loke said,
referring to the 10-day event Malaysia staged last month for 360
million ringgit (dlrs 95 million).
	   The Commonwealth Games committee said earlier it expected to
make a profit of 5 million ringgit (dlrs 1.5 million) after
building and upgrading sports arenas, including the main stadium,
which cost dlrs 300 million to build.
	   The infrastructure is mostly in place and only minor upgrading
to Olympic standards would be needed, Loke said.
	   He acknowledged profits from staging such an event would be
minimal, but said the Olympics would burnish the country's image
and boost tourism.
	   Such sporting events would also enhance ``the feeling of
patriotism which is important to racial unity'' in multi-ethnic
Malaysia, he said.
	   Malaysia is making a bid to stage the Asian Games in 2006.

Police searching for bodies after boat capsizes in Gulf of
</HEADLINE>
Thailand &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Marine police on Thursday resumed their
search for passengers missing from a ferry boat that capsized in
the Gulf of Thailand, killing at least three people.
	   Two Australian women and a pregnant Thai woman are known to have
died in the accident early Wednesday as the boat was traveling to
Koh Tao, an island popular with young travelers.
	   Two officials from the Australian Embassy's consular section who
went to the scene confirmed the two women were Australians, said an
embassy official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   He identified one as Gabrielle Sandercock, and said the family
of the second victim had asked that her name not be released.
	   The ferry left Don Sak town in Surat Thani province, 530
kilometers (330 miles) south of Bangkok, at 11 p.m. Tuesday and
capsized in rough seas at 4 a.m. Wednesday, said a marine police
officer.
	   An unknown number of passengers were missing and presumed dead.
The officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he suspected
some passengers had not managed to escape the stricken vessel.
	   Naval authorities believe the boat may have capsized because it
was carrying a heavy load of construction materials in choppy
waters.
	   Search and rescue operations were suspended late Wednesday and
for a few hours Thursday morning because of heavy rains, said the
marine police.
	   Col. Kriran Intrakaew, the police chief for Koh Samui, an island
to which the survivors and the bodies were taken, told The
Associated Press Wednesday night that a total of 18 passengers had
been rescued, 10 of whom were hospitalized. The rescued including
two Americans and two Swiss.

Annan hopes for progress in Middle East talks
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Thursday
that he hoped for a breakthrough in the Middle East peace talks now
being held in the United States.
	   ``I think it is essential we try to make some progress in the
talks,'' he told reporters while in Japan to attend an
international conference on African development.
	   Annan said he visited the Middle East earlier this year and met
with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat.
	   The talks in Maryland appeared to be running into trouble.
Netanyahu threatened to leave in the middle of the night Wednesday
unless the Israelis won more Palestinian concessions.
	   Netanyahu later agreed to stay and work with U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright and CIA Director George Tenet on a West
Bank security proposal that Israel could accept.
	   Annan said Middle East leaders were ``extremely concerned''
about rising tensions in the area because of the continuing impasse
in the peace process.
	   ``I hope we will have a breakthrough in the talks,'' he said at
a news conference.
	   Annan also chided the United States for being behind in dues
payments to the United Nations, totaling nearly dlrs 1 billion.
	   ``This obviously is a disappointment,'' he said.
	   But Annan welcomed the U.S. decision to provide dlrs 17.9
billion for the International Monetary Fund.
	   Annan, who is from Ghana, was one of the main guests at the
three-day Tokyo International Conference on African Development,
which drew representatives from more than 80 nations and 40
organizations. Annan was scheduled to leave Tokyo for South Korea
Thursday.
	   On the conference's closing day Wednesday, Tokyo announced new
aid for Africa totaling 90 billion yen (dlrs 764 million) over the
next five years for new schools, better medical services and
cleaner water.
	   The money is part of Japan's official assistance for Africa and
other developing nations, which totals nearly 1 trillion yen (dlrs
8.5 billion) a year. Japan is one of the top aid-givers in the
world.
	   Japan's economy is in recession because of a credit crunch
caused by debt-laden banks. But its national coffers are far from
depleted, a major factor that differentiates Japan's economic
problems from those of poorer Asian nations.
	   Tokyo has repeatedly promised to continue aid to Africa, which
totals about 80 billion yen (dlrs 679 million) a year.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Here they go again.
	   New York Yankee fans let out a collective cheer Wednesday as the
Bronx Bombers capped a magical season with their 24th World Series
title, their second championship in three years.
	   ``Champs!'' the Daily News cheered in its early edition.
``Sweep!'' raved the New York Post in lurid red ink.
	   ``This is the greatest team ever,'' said Bernard Rhodes, who
watched New York beat San Diego 3-0 at the Yankee Tavern. ``The
Yankees showed they are true champions.''
	   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, dressed in Yankee cap and jacket,
watched the game from a bar in midtown Manhattan and announced that
_ subject to the approval of the Yankees _ a parade would be held
Friday to honor the team.
	   ``We are very proud the Yankees will be coming up the Canyon of
Heroes for the second time in three years,'' Giuliani said.
	   In the shadow of Yankee Stadium in the Bronx, people spilled
into the streets banging pots, blowing whistles, ringing cowbells
and generally making as much noise as possible.
	   ``This is where it's at,'' said 26-year-old Jay Justino of the
Bronx, looking wistfully at the stadium. He still managed to
kvetch: ``Just to think, if they were home.''
	   The Yankees were dominant all year. They finished at 125-50, the
most victories ever and the best winning percentage since the 1927
Yankees. Their 114 regular-season victories were the most ever for
a champion.
	   The picture-perfect season also was notable for the emotional
outpouring of fan support for Yankee slugger Darryl Strawberry, who
underwent surgery for colon cancer.
	   Bud Harrelson, a member of that other famous New York team _ the
1969 World Series champion Mets _ paid the Yankees perhaps the
ultimate compliment from the bar at Mickey Mantle's restaurant in
Manhattan.
	   ``If we were amazin', they're just incredible,'' he said.

China angry over India meeting with Dalai Lama
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China expressed outrage Thursday over a meeting
between India's prime minister and the Dalai Lama, saying Delhi
violated commitments to limit the exiled Tibetan leader's
activities.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang Guoqiang, reiterating China's
criticisms of the Dalai Lama, said the Buddhist leader has ``long
engaged in activities to split the motherland and undermine
national harmony.''
	   Worried about separatism in Tibet, China has put pressure on
Delhi over the Dalai Lama ever since he fled to India amid an
abortive uprising against Chinese rule in Tibet in 1959.
	   He remains popular among Tibet's fervently Buddhist people
despite decades of religious repression by China's rulers and
recent campaigns to ban his photographs and discredit him.
	   The Dalai Lama, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989, met
Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee earlier this month, their first
meeting since Vajpayee became prime minister in March. No
announcements followed the meeting and the Indian Foreign Office
and a Dalai Lama aide refused to divulge details.
	   ``It's nothing unusual. He meets all the prime ministers,'' said
Tenpa Tsering, a spokesman for the Dalai Lama.
	   Still Beijing objected, as it often does to any forums that seem
to confer legitimacy on the Dalai Lama.
	   ``The meeting by the prime minister of India with Dalai violated
the commitment by the Indian side of not allowing the Dalai to
engage in anti-China political activities in India,'' Tang said at
a routine media briefing.
	   He added that the meeting ``interfered in the internal affairs
of China and hurt the feelings of the Chinese people. The Chinese
side hereby expresses its deep resentment and regret over this.''

Thai telecoms, zoo contracts canceled amid graft charges
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The Thai government has canceled
contracts for a digital communications project and the renovation
of Bangkok's zoo amid allegations of corruption, government
agencies said Thursday.
	   Meanwhile, a former Cabinet member called for the cancellation
of a suspicious landfill contract for Bangkok's new airport, and a
former official of the Food and Drug Administration was accused of
approving advertisements for products after he left the agency.
	   These are just some of the many scandals plaguing the coalition
government of Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai, who is widely regarded
as one of the most honest politicians in Thai history.
	   But perceptions of corruption are tainting his administration as
questionable practices and decisions by some ministers and
bureaucrats have come under fire.
	   Of the four scandals, the alleged collusion in awarding a
contract for a digital high-speed communications network is the one
that most closely touches Chuan's team.
	   Transport and Communications Minister Suthep Thauksuban, a
senior members of Chuan's Democrat Party, was accused by a fellow
Democrat of participating in a bid-rigging scheme for the project.
	   No one has proven that the minister was personally involved.
	   But on Thursday, the state-owned Telephone Organization of
Thailand, which is overseeing the project, canceled the contract.
	   ``The board has agreed to cancel the project and initiate a new
bidding process,'' the TOT said in a press release, adding it was
sure new bidding would result in the project costing less.
	   ``The cost of the project has exceeded the budget by 3 billion
baht (dlrs 80 million),'' it said. The project had been budgeted at
10.4 billion baht (dlrs 277 million).
	   The companies involved in the project are Sweden's Ericsson, two
companies in Japan's Mitsui and Tomen groups, Germany's Siemens,
and Thai companies Loxley and Jasmine International.
	   Also, a former Cabinet member urged Chuan to cancel a contract
with Ital-Thai Development to supply landfill for Bangkok's second
international airport, the building of which has been delayed for
years, the newspaper The Nation reported.
	   The call by Bokhin Polakul, who served during the administration
of former Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, was unusual in that
the contract was signed by the government in which he served.
	   Critics say Ital-Thai is overcharging for sand.
	   The Bangkok Post reported Thursday that the board of the
Zoological Park Organization terminated a contract with Kingpower
Development, a private company, to renovate and run the Dusit Zoo
in Bangkok.
	   Social activists complained the awarding of the contract wasn't
handled with transparency, and demanded to know why only 6 percent
of profits would be returned to the government.
	   And The Nation reported that officials of the Food and Drug
Administration have charged that Prasert Charoenphon, a former
deputy, signed papers approving advertisements for food products
after he no longer worked at the FDA.
	   FDA approval is necessary before ads for food and drugs can be
run.

	   GENEVA (AP) _ North Korea's protest over planned U.S. military
exercises with South Korea hung over negotiators Thursday as
efforts resumed to reach a permanent peace treaty for the Korean
peninsula.
	   But delegates from North and South Korea, China and the United
States had little or nothing to say to reporters as they began a
second day of talks after a break of more than six months.
	   Park Kun-woo, leader of the South Korean delegation which is
chairing the current round, said he was unable to go into detail
about what the the four sides were discussing.
	   The North's official Korean Central News Agency said U.S. and
South Korean officials were ``seriously provoking'' by scheduling
the maneuvers to begin the day after the current round of talks
ends Sunday.
	   ``The war exercises are patent proof that the United States and
the South Korean authorities have no interest in discussing an
issue of ``ensuring peace on the Korean peninsula,'' it said.
	   This year's maneuvers will be the 37th the two countries have
held since 1961. U.S. and South Korean officials termed them
``routine and defensive.''
	   Most of the exercises, involving the 650,000-strong South Korean
military and the 37,000 U.S. troops stationed there, will be held
well south of the border with the North, U.S. officials have said.
	   Their border is the world's most heavily armed, with nearly 2
million troops deployed on both sides.
	   North and South Korea have been in a technical state of war
since the 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armistice, not a peace
treaty. The United States and China, the other two parties to the
talks, were the other main combatants in the war.
	   Diplomats said the first round of the talks Wednesday appeared
to be making progress, but they declined to elaborate.
	   The South's Yonhap news agency reported that the negotiators
were still bogged down in conflicting stands on the agenda and
other procedural matters.
	   South Korea has proposed forming committees to deal with
different issues, but the North has demanded that the agenda be
arranged first, Yonhap said.
	   Officials said North Korea also insists that the United States
withdraw its troops and reach a peace treaty with Pyongyang,
excluding South Korea.
	   The United States and South Korea have indicated willingness to
discuss the troop withdrawal, but the South opposes having it as a
formal agenda item.
	   Both also have ruled out discussions on a Washington-Pyongyang
peace treaty. The United States maintains that any Korean peace
treaty should be signed between the two Koreas.
	   The first two rounds _ last December and March _ failed to
overcome the procedural differences.

Chechnya's president orders rebel commanders to surrender
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in last three grafs with hostages freed. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Chechnya's President Aslan Maskhadov ordered rebel
field commanders Thursday to disband their units, threatening a
crackdown if they disobeyed, a news report said.
	   Since the end of Chechnya's 1994-6 war with Russia, many field
commanders have remained outside the control of the territory's
government, and are unlikely to comply with this latest order.
	   In a decree signed Thursday, Maskhadov also demanded that the
``military bases of these formations be eliminated immediately,''
the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Maskhadov has ordered the police and security forces to enforce
the decree and prosecute field commander who fail to comply, said
presidential spokesman Mairbek Vachagayev, according to Interfax.
	   The renegade armed units discredit Chechnya's effort to be
recognized as an independent state, Maskhadov said in his decree.
	   Chechnya has been running its own affairs since the end of the
war against Russia, but no country has recognized its independence
claim. Moscow insists the territory remains part of Russia.
	   Maskhadov also planned to meet field commanders loyal to his
government on Thursday, Vachagayev said. The talks may deal with
plans to the many hostages who have been seized in Chechnya since
the end of the war, he said.
	   Police from the neighboring Russian republic of Dagestan have
freed an officer who was held captive in Chechnya since his
kidnapping on Sept. 12, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported
Thursday.
	   Also, two Latvian citizens have been freed by police from
Russia's Caucasus republics of North Ossetia and Ingushetia, the
report said.
	   Russia's Caucasus regions have been plagued by violence spilling
over from Chechnya as well as their own ethnic conflicts.

Russia advertising plunges due to crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Advertising in Russia has plunged at least 50
percent as a result of the economic crisis and the exodus of
western investors, the head of Russia's Association of Advertising
Agencies said Thursday.
	   The crisis has forced many Russian businesses to cut all but
essential expenses in order to stay afloat.
	   Russia's newspaper and television stations have reported
suffering big losses because of the shrinking advertising.
	   Vladimir Yevstafyev, president of the Russian Association of
Advertising Agencies, said the advertising market has shrunk 50
percent to 60 percent since the crisis began in mid-August, the
Interfax news agency reported.

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ North Korea's protest over planned U.S. military
exercises with South Korea hung over negotiators Thursday as
efforts resumed to reach a permanent peace treaty for the Korean
peninsula.
	   But delegates from North and South Korea, China and the United
States had little or nothing to say to reporters as they began a
second day of talks after a break of more than six months.
	   Park Kun-woo, leader of the South Korean delegation which is
chairing the current round, said he was unable to go into detail
about what the the four sides were discussing.
	   The North's official Korean Central News Agency said U.S. and
South Korean officials were ``seriously provoking'' by scheduling
the maneuvers to begin the day after the current round of talks
ends Sunday.
	   ``The war exercises are patent proof that the United States and
the South Korean authorities have no interest in discussing an
issue of ``ensuring peace on the Korean peninsula,'' it said.
	   This year's maneuvers will be the 37th the two countries have
held since 1961. U.S. and South Korean officials termed them
``routine and defensive.''
	   Most of the exercises, involving the 650,000-strong South Korean
military and the 37,000 U.S. troops stationed there, will be held
well south of the border with the North, U.S. officials have said.
	   Their border is the world's most heavily armed, with nearly 2
million troops deployed on both sides.
	   North and South Korea have been in a technical state of war
since the 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armistice, not a peace
treaty. The United States and China, the other two parties to the
talks, were the other main combatants in the war.
	   Diplomats said the first round of the talks Wednesday appeared
to be making progress, but they declined to elaborate.
	   The South's Yonhap news agency reported that the negotiators
were still bogged down in conflicting stands on the agenda and
other procedural matters.
	   South Korea has proposed forming committees to deal with
different issues, but the North has demanded that the agenda be
arranged first, Yonhap said.
	   Officials said North Korea also insists that the United States
withdraw its troops and reach a peace treaty with Pyongyang,
excluding South Korea.
	   The United States and South Korea have indicated willingness to
discuss the troop withdrawal, but the South opposes having it as a
formal agenda item.
	   Both also have ruled out discussions on a Washington-Pyongyang
peace treaty. The United States maintains that any Korean peace
treaty should be signed between the two Koreas.
	   The first two rounds _ last December and March _ failed to
overcome the procedural differences.

U.N. inspectors block journalists from monitoring missions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. weapons monitors prevented journalists
on Thursday from accompanying them on missions to suspected
chemical and biological weapons sites, saying the U.N. monitoring
is confidential.
	   The incident developed at the inspectors' headquarters in
Baghdad after the journalists were apparently encouraged by Iraq,
which has been trying to picture the monitors as spies rather than
neutral U.N. employees.
	   An Iraqi colonel at the scene suggested the U.N. Special
Commission in charge of arms inspections didn't want the
journalists to see ``the procedure to collect intelligence
information and military information.''
	   The weapons inspection chief in Baghdad, Nils Carlstrom, also
told reporters that he had reported to U.N. officials in New York
about Iraqi complaints that a U.N. monitor had taken personal
photos last week against the agency's rules. This is the second
such incident this month.
	   UNSCOM's inspectors must verify that Iraq has eliminated its
weapons of mass destruction before sanctions imposed after its 1990
invasion of Kuwait can be lifted. The inspectors have long been the
subject of a dispute between Iraq and the United Nations because
the Iraqi government maintains it has destroyed all its lethal
weapons.
	   Before Thursday's incident, journalists including television
crews had applied for permission from UNSCOM and Iraq to go along
on the monitoring missions, despite long-standing rules by the U.N.
agency against such news coverage.
	   Carlstrom refused permission for the journalists to accompany
teams of chemical and biological experts.
	   ``UNSCOM's policy (is) not to give permission to follow our
work. The work is confidential for both Iraq and UNSCOM,'' he said.
	   Two Iraqi military officers told the reporters their government
would agree to have them cover the monitoring, but could not
override the U.N. objection.
	   ``I have no objections to follow all teams. The objection comes
from UNSCOM through New York,'' Col. Abdul-Razak Tarish said.
	   ``This is to prevent taking videotape about the procedure to
collect intelligence information and military information about the
site, not about the monitoring,'' he said, speaking in English for
the benefit of cameramen from Western TV agencies.
	   The second officer, Col. Mazen Zakaria, said Iraq had a
``gentlemen's agreement'' not to allow coverage by journalists
unless both sides approved.
	   Two teams, one chemical and one biological, left their
headquarters at the Canal Hotel after the incident.
	   Iraq has since Aug. 5 blocked U.N. nuclear inspectors and those
in charge of investigating chemical and biological weapons from
visiting new suspected arms sites and limited them to monitoring
sites previously inspected.
	   ``This is a monitoring inspection we are doing because all
disarmament inspections are suspended,'' Carlstrom said.
	   Concerning the inspector whom Iraq accused of taking personal
photos earlier this week, Carlstrom said that he had passed along
Iraq's complaint to U.N. officials in New York and was awaiting a
reply.
	   He added that a similar incident happened on Oct. 8, in which an
inspector used a private camera and broke UNSCOM rules. This
inspector was sent out of Iraq on the first plane, he said.
	   Iraq has frequently accused the inspectors of being spies,
particularly former American inspector Scott Ritter, who further
fueled the charges by saying after he resigned that he got some
information about Iraqi weapons from Israeli intelligence.
	   On Wednesday, Iraqi officials accused the the International
Atomic Energy Agency, in charge of monitoring the nuclear weapons
program in Iraq, of trying to get military information by asking
for details on Iraq's water supplies. The U.N. agency made no
comment in reply.

Heavy losses at Rover threaten British car plant
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with trade secretary meets BMW, Rover bosses &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ Trade Secretary Peter Mandelson met
Thursday with bosses of the BMW-owned car manufacturer Rover Group
over its decision to staunch heavy losses by axing 2,400 British
jobs.
	   BMW chairman Bernd Pischetsrieder and Rover chairman Walter
Hasselkus said they had not asked Mandelson to bail out the company
during an hour of discussions at the Department of Trade and
Industry in London.
	   ``It was a good meeting.'' Pischetsrieder told reporters as he
left. ``We informed the government of what the situation is.'' No
one was immediately available for comment at Mandelson's office.
	   BMW has set a six-week deadline for gaining union agreement to
cut 2,400 jobs from Rover's 39,000 British workforce, mostly at the
auto maker's giant Longbridge plant in Birmingham, central England,
which employs 14,000 people.
	   Several unions have held urgent talks with BMW to avert the
closure of the Longbridge plant.
	   ``Without major surgery to cut costs immediately, via
significant job losses alongside cuts to employment-related and
other costs, there will not be a supportable survival plan to place
before the BMW board,'' the unions said Wednesday, adding that the
future of the plant remained ``in the balance.''
	   The company has become more productive since BMW bought it from
British Aerospace PLC in 1994, but the high value of the pound has
made its automobiles far less competitive in other markets, while
making imported cars cheaper for British consumers.
	   Mandelson told the House of Commons on Wednesday that Rover's
fate rested in its own hands.
	   ``Ultimately it is for the company to rise to the challenge and
to ensure that Rover continues to thrive in the global
marketplace,'' Mandelson said.

Bicycles rule in China, but for how long? Beijing starts a ban
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ While cities in other parts of the world are
trying to encourage bicycle commuting, China's capital is
backpedaling.
	   Bicycles long ruled the road in Beijing. But this week Beijing
for the first time bowed to rising car traffic and declared one
busy street a bicycle-free zone.
	   Police said freeing East Xisi Street from bicycles would give
cars an extra lane and untie daily traffic jams, Beijing newspapers
reported on their front pages this week.
	   Chinese, grown used to arbitrary rules and the rapid change of
breakneck economic growth, were slightly bewildered, but mostly
resigned to the ban.
	   ``We used to be able to turn right here. It's not fair to
cyclists, but it is a regulation and we have to abide by it,'' one
young cyclist, who gave only his surname, Wang, said after two
police officers turned him away Wednesday, when the ban started.
	   East Xisi (pronounced shee-suh) was known until 1965 as Horse
Market Street after a Yuan dynasty (1279-1368) market. Today the
street in central Beijing is lined with one-story shops and
remnants of traditional courtyard houses with rounded tile roofs
and gray brick walls.
	   Up to 6,000 bicycles per hour traveled the street in peak
periods, according to city statistics. The 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. ban
forces them to detour down a nearby street, but gives East Xisi
Street two lanes in each direction instead of one for cars and one
for bikes.
	   Beijing's 9 million bicycles are still the most popular mode of
transportation _ from one-speed black ``Flying Pigeon'' or
``Forever'' brand traditional bikes to newer models that are more
sleek and sporty. The average Beijing resident cannot afford a car.
	   Still, taxis, company cars and private vehicles owned by the
newly affluent have crammed Beijing's streets in rising numbers in
the last few years _ 1.2 million vehicles at last count.
	   Cars often scoot into bike lanes to cut through traffic jams,
forcing bikers to hug the curbs. Intersections are jammed with cars
and bicycles all trying to slide through at once.
	   Bicycles took over Beijing's flat streets from rickshaws in the
1950s, and except for overly packed public buses for the next
couple of decades there were almost no motor vehicles.
	   The government is trying to promote car ownership to boost the
national auto industry while also trying to clean up severe air
pollution. China's autos still do not have up-to-date pollution
control devices, but new vehicle emission standards are planned in
2000.
	   Police on Thursday refused to comment about whether other
bike-free streets were planned.
	   By Thursday morning, bicycle riders were still looking
bewildered at East Xisi. A police officer with a bullhorn and two
middle-aged women with red arm bands shouted orders to detour.
	   A small blackboard propped up at the side of the street with a
message in colored chalk announced the bike ban and added, `` Hope
you will cooperate.''

Lawmakers may withhold support for Tung's governing plans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa got an earful
Thursday over Hong Kong's recession _ and pro-democracy lawmakers
could embarrass him further if they make good on threats to
withhold support from his plans for governing the territory.
	   Tung has come under sharp fire from politicians debating over
whether they should back the governing strategy he has outlined for
the next 12 months.
	   ``This government has insulated itself from the public. It's
completely out of touch,'' opposition Democratic Party lawmaker Lee
Wing-tat said Thursday as the legislature wrapped up a two-day
debate on Tung's annual policy speech.
	   The debate is symbolic, because the elected lawmakers can't tell
the Beijing-appointed Tung what to do. But the symbolism is
important because it could illustrate Tung's crumbling popular
support as Hong Kong struggles through hard times that have thrown
thousands of people out of work and seen property prices collapse.
	   Calling Tung ``incompetent,'' Democratic Party Chairman Martin
Lee said Wednesday that the chief executive failed to address the
concerns of Hong Kong citizens during their worst economic downturn
in 15 years.
	   Three activists, including a former legislator, are on a hunger
strike that entered its eighth day Thursday. They hope to pressure
Tung _ a former shipping tycoon _ to step down. Tung has said they
should find ``more constructive ways'' to make their point.
	   Tung ``was not elected by the Hong Kong people. That's why he
doesn't think he needs to be responsive to the needs of the Hong
Kong people,'' Martin Lee said.
	   The legislature will vote Nov. 7 on a traditional motion of
thanks for Tung's policy address, which was delivered two weeks
ago. Local newspapers have reported that the pro-democracy faction
will likely succeed in blocking the motion.
	   Despite the pointed criticisms of Tung, two pro-Beijing parties
and the conservative Liberal Party have supported his plans.
	   Outside of the legislative chambers, several Beijing-friendly
city councilors led about 80 people in a rally to show their
support Thursday.
	   ``Hong Kong people unite to rebuild Hong Kong. Support the
government,'' the activists chanted.
	   Jasper Tsang, chairman of the Democratic Alliance for the
Betterment of Hong Kong, a pro-Beijing grassroots party, said the
government was heading ``in the right direction'' in pulling Hong
Kong out of the doldrums. Tung had already done everything he could
to revive the economy, Tsang said.
	   ``If the government could solve economic problems just by
announcing a set of policy measures, there would not be recessions
in this world,'' he said.
	   In 1996, when former governor Chris Patten delivered the last
policy address under British colonial rule, the legislature voted
to express ``deep regret'' that Britain failed to pursue full
democratization during its 155 years in Hong Kong.

Price Waterhouse Coopers wins tender to audit Ukraine's phone
</HEADLINE>
giant &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ The international accounting firm Price
Waterhouse Coopers won a tender to audit Ukraine's
telecommunications monopoly in preparation for its planned
privatization, officials said Thursday.
	   The company is to prepare a financial report on Ukrtelecom for
the first half of the year, and then for the full year, Ukrtelecom
said in a statement cited by the Interfax news agency.
	   Price Waterhouse Coopers is to begin work with Ukrtelecom at the
end of October and plans to complete the audit next May, Ukrtelecom
said.
	   Other participants in the tender, which was announced last July,
included the firms Arthur Andersen, Deloitte and Touche, Ernst and
Young and KPMG.
	   The audit of Ukrtelecom is part of Ukrainian government's plan
to prepare the fully state-owned giant for privatization.
	   President Leonid Kuchma said earlier this week the Cabinet was
about to submit to parliament a bill permitting the privatization
of Ukrtelecom. The legislature needs to approve the measure because
under the current law, telecommunications companies in Ukraine are
barred from privatization.
	   Ukrainian Prime Minister Valery Pustovoitenko has said the
government hopes to raise at least dlrs 2 billion from selling a 25
percent stake in the telecommunications firm.
	   Ukrtelecom includes 35 subsidiaries and 738 branches throughout
Ukraine, and owns large stakes in five joint ventures. The company
employs 130,000 people.

Indonesian police kill two men suspected in mystery murders
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Police shot dead two men linked to a
killing spree in which some victims have been accused of
witchcraft, newspapers reported Thursday.
	   The two men were suspected in a wave of mysterious murders of
more than 150 people over the past three months in the eastern end
of the main island of Java. Some of those who died were Muslim
clerics accused of sorcery.
	   Vigilante groups formed to strike back at the alleged
assailants, and at least nine murder suspects have been killed.
Several were beheaded and triumphant mobs paraded their heads on
sticks in village streets.
	   Police on Wednesday reportedly killed two suspected attackers,
Buki and Surahmad, while raiding their houses in Jember, about 800
kilometers (500 miles) east of the capital, Jakarta.
	   Surahmad had refused to leave his home despite police warning
shots and attacked officers with a knife, the newspaper Jawa Pos
reported.
	   On Thursday, 50 youths briefly demonstrated outside the
presidential palace in Jakarta to demand a thorough investigation
of the killings in East Java province.
	   Dozens of soldiers and police with sticks and guns pushed the
protesters back to their bus parked nearby. Officers detained one
demonstrator.
	   Some victims of the mysterious killings that began in August in
the regency of Banyuwangi were preachers or members of the 30
million-member Nahdlatul Ulama, Indonesia's largest Muslim
organization.
	   The government has rejected a claim by Nahdlatul Ulama leader
Abdurahman Wahid that an unidentified Cabinet minister was behind
the killings.

Ukraine's parliament approves state privatization chief
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's parliament on Thursday approved
the state privatization chief, signaling the possible end to a
long-running dispute between the government and lawmakers over
privatization in the country.
	   Lawmakers voted 230-112 to appoint President Leonid Kuchma's
nominee, Oleksandr Bondar, to head the State Property Fund.
	   Under Ukraine's constitution, parliament approves the state
privatization chief nominated by the president.
	   Kuchma has been in a non-stop feud with parliament over how to
conduct privatization since he was elected president in 1994.
	   Lawmakers, whose vote on Thursday followed their rejection of
Bondar last month, earlier turned down Kuchma's previous nominee
for the top privatization post, Volodymyr Lanovy, four times.
	   Lanovy served only as an acting State Property Fund chairman,
which allowed the legislators to frequently find fault with his
work and limit his authority.
	   In addition, parliament has introduced a number of measures in
the past that seriously hampered the State Property Fund's efforts
to quicken privatization.
	   Privatization in Ukraine, which showed signs of revival at the
beginning of 1998, has slowed down sharply. Foreign investors have
fled the region due largely to the continuing financial crisis in
neighboring Russia.
	   The State Property Fund has already canceled dozens of
privatization tenders this year that failed to draw at least one
bidder. The country's stock market has dried up in recent months
because there is no demand for shares in Ukrainian enterprises.
	   The former Soviet republic has earned about 360 million hryvna
(dlrs 99 million at the current rate) from privatization since the
beginning of the year, remaining far behind the 1998 target of 1
billion hryvna (dlrs 292 million).

Schroeder to skip WWI Armistice Day ceremony in France
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany's new leader isn't going to a World
War I Armistice Day ceremony in France because of scheduling
problems, not because he wants to avoid the past, his spokesman
said Thursday.
	   Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder informed French President
Jacques Chirac ``in all friendliness'' that he could not attend the
Nov. 8 ceremony because his calendar was already full, said
spokesman Michael Juerdens.
	   ``He's in the middle of the very difficult process of assuming
office,'' Juerdens said. Schroeder and his new Cabinet are to be
sworn in Oct. 27.
	   Juerdens dismissed as ``rubbish'' and ``simply nonsense''
reports from Paris that quoted a French official as saying
Schroeder turned down the invitation because he wanted ``a new
face'' for Germany that wasn't tied to the past.
	   But his failure to attend is likely to be perceived as a serious
snub in France. While France and Germany have worked together to
build a united Europe, fears of German economic domination still
haunt France.
	   About 3.2 million French and German soldiers were among the 10
million killed during World War I, which ended with a truce on Nov.
11, 1918.
	   Schroeder already has made trips to Paris and Washington since
the Sept. 27 elections, and Juerdens said he will visit Moscow on
Nov. 16-17 to meet with President Boris Yeltsin.
	   ``No topics in a broad sense have been established yet,'' he
said.
	   Schroeder also will attend an informal European Union summit in
Austria on Saturday, and his first trip as chancellor is scheduled
Nov. 2 to London.

Cambodia's king declines to chair political summit

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ King Norodom Sihanouk has declined
requests to chair a summit of Cambodia's top political leaders,
saying the meeting would not bring any progress in deadlocked
negotiations to form a government.
	   Cambodian leader Hun Sen's ruling party and the two-party
opposition had called on the monarch to lead top-level talks, but
disagreed on its location.
	   ``Papa will not preside over any summit meeting between the
three parties, whether it is held in Phnom Penh or Beijing, because
such a meeting will certainly achieve no result,'' Sihanouk wrote
in an Oct. 17 letter to his son, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, leader
of the senior opposition FUNCINPEC party.
	   A copy of the letter was obtained Thursday.
	   In it, the king called on the three parties to make compromises
to end the stalemate: ``Papa would like to ask all three parties to
take responsibility before the nation and the people.''
	   Hun Sen used Thursday's anniversary of a peace agreement ending
the country's civil war to pressure the opposition to form a
coalition government with his party.
	   ``Only those who want to prolong the anarchy and instability
prevent efforts to set up a new government,'' Hun Sen said in a
televised speech marking the anniversary of the 1991 Paris Peace
Accords.
	   Hun Sen's party won 64 of the 122 seats in parliament in July's
national election, but not the two-thirds majority necessary to
form a government on its own.
	   Opposition parties led by Ranariddh and former finance minister
Sam Ram Rainsy have refused to enter into a coalition with Hun Sen
until their allegations of election fraud have been thoroughly
investigated.
	   International monitors said the election was relatively free and
fair. Hun Sen said his current government would remain in power as
long as the opposition refused to form a new one.
	   Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy have remained outside the country since
the Sept. 24 ceremonial convening of parliament.
	   Citing Hun Sen's threats to arrest opposition politicians
following two alleged attempts on his life, Ranariddh and Sam
Rainsy have said they do not feel safe negotiating inside the
country and asked the king to chair the summit at his residence in
Beijing.
	   Hun Sen has rejected the opposition's reservations, saying it
would be inappropriate to hold a summit outside the country.
	   Negotiations so far have proved fruitless except for the opening
of parliament after a Sept. 22 summit led by the king.
	   Hun Sen implied Thursday that the opposition failed to follow
through on promises made at the summit.
	   ``If those results are strictly respected, there seems no reason
to hold another summit,'' Hun Sen said in a speech on the
anniversary of the 1991 Paris Peace Accords.
	   Sihanouk is reportedly set to fly to Beijing next month to
receive medical treatment from his Chinese doctors.
	   The 75-year-old monarch suffers from a variety ailments and
periodically makes extended trips to Beijing. He was diagnosed with
colon cancer in 1993, but it has since gone into remission.
	   In September, thousands of people filled the streets of Phnom
Penh to protest against the alleged election fraud.
	   Hun Sen ordered police to break up the demonstrations. At least
four demonstrators were killed by police, but the discovery of more
than 20 bodies in the aftermath has prompted speculation that the
death tally could be much higher.
	   In his speech, Hun Sen blamed the violence on opposition
leaders, saying the demonstrations instigated social and economic
chaos.

Militant Muslim leader urges defending Islam without violence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The spiritual leader of Egypt's most violent
Muslim militant group was quoted in an Arabic newspaper Thursday as
urging formation of an international front to defend Islam without
the use of violence.
	   The statement by Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman, the blind Egyptian
cleric imprisoned in the United States on charges he conspired to
blow up New York landmarks, was carried in the London-based daily
Al-Hayat.
	   Abdel-Rahman's statement said the first mission of his proposed
international Islamic front should be ``facing the danger against
Islam by peaceful means and ways, and without any kind of
violence.''
	   The statement was smuggled from the U.S. prison where
Abdel-Rahman is serving a life sentence, Al-Hayat said. It added it
got a copy from ``a reliable person living in the United States.''
	   The 57-year-old sheik is the spiritual leader of al-Gamaa
al-Islamiya, or the Islamic group, which has been blamed for many
attacks in a campaign of violence waged in Egypt since 1992.
	   In his statement, Abdel-Rahman renewed his support for the July
1997 call for a cease-fire with Egypt's government by imprisoned
leaders of al-Gamaa. The call for a truce was rejected by some of
the leaders living abroad and by Egypt's Interior Ministry.
	   The sheik also said that a new strategy of al-Gamaa in dealing
with the future is crystallizing.
	   ``Islamic factions should unite and not disagree, and should
gather and not disperse,'' he said.
	   Abdel-Rahman ended the statement by saying ``this is an advice
from a brother ... behind the fences, and he repeats it even if you
are bored from the repetition.''
	   Al-Gamaa's campaign in Egypt was aimed at overthrowing the
government and replacing it with strict Islamic rule. More than
1,200 people have died in the violence.
	   The group's bloodiest operation was the Nov. 17 attack in the
southern city of Luxor that left 58 tourists and four Egyptians
dead. In recent months, however, the militant uprising has been
reduced to battles between police and militants in southern Egypt.

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ A bus hit an electric pole and caught
fire in southern India, killing at least 25 people and causing burn
injuries to 12 others in southern India on Thursday, Press Trust of
India news agency said.
	   The bodies were completely burned in Kottayam district in Kerala
state, 2,000 kilometers (1,250 miles) south of New Delhi.
	   On Wednesday night, 15 people were killed and 18 others were
injured when a bus plunged into a gorge in Sikkim state in
northeast India, PTI said. The driver tried to accelerate after the
bus wheels got stuck in mud in monsoon rain near Gangtok, the
capital of Sikkim state.
	   Gangtok is 1,050 kilometers (655 miles) east of New Delhi.

Militant Muslim leader urges defending Islam without violence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The spiritual leader of Egypt's most violent
Muslim militant group was quoted Thursday in an Arabic newspaper as
urging formation of an international front to defend Islam without
the use of violence.
	   The statement by Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman, the blind Egyptian
cleric imprisoned in the United States on charges that he conspired
to blow up New York landmarks, was carried in the London-based
daily Al-Hayat.
	   Abdel-Rahman's statement said the first mission of his proposed
international Islamic front should be ``facing the danger against
Islam by peaceful means and ways, and without any kind of
violence.''
	   The statement was smuggled from the U.S. prison where
Abdel-Rahman is serving a life sentence, according to Al-Hayat,
which said it got a copy from ``a reliable person living in the
United States.''
	   The 57-year-old sheik is the spiritual leader of al-Gamaa
al-Islamiya, or the Islamic group, which has been blamed for many
attacks in a campaign of violence waged in Egypt since 1992.
	   In his statement, Abdel-Rahman renewed his support for the July
1997 call for a cease-fire with Egypt's government by imprisoned
leaders of al-Gamaa. The call for a truce was rejected by some of
the leaders living abroad and by Egypt's Interior Ministry.
	   The sheik also said a new strategy of al-Gamaa in dealing with
the future is crystallizing.
	   ``Islamic factions should unite and not disagree, and should
gather and not disperse,'' he said.
	   Abdel-Rahman ended the statement by saying ``this is an advice
from a brother ... behind the fences, and he repeats it even if you
are bored from the repetition.''
	   Al-Gamaa's campaign in Egypt was aimed at overthrowing the
government and replacing it with strict Islamic rule. More than
1,200 people have died in the violence.
	   The group's bloodiest operation was the Nov. 17 attack in the
southern city of Luxor that left 58 tourists and four Egyptians
dead. In recent months, however, the militant uprising has been
reduced to battles between police and militants in southern Egypt.

Conservationists make emergency repairs at King Herod's Masada

<TEXT>
	   MASADA, Israel (AP) _ In the first century, the strategic
mountain-top location of King Herod's Masada fortress helped the
Jews ward off Roman legions for three years.
	   Now, nearly 2000 years later, that perch 1,000 feet (300 meters)
above the desert floor is making the stronghold vulnerable.
	   Once the luxurious quarters of the royal household, the northern
palace which overlooks the Dead Sea and the hills of present-day
Jordan, is crumbling. Wind, sand, water and salt have eaten away at
the soft limestone masonry of the ancient palace in the Negev
Desert.
	   Fearing an earthquake or heavy rains could destroy one of
Israel's best-known archaeological sites, a team of
conservationists is now combating the destructive force of the
elements with emergency repairs on the palace.
	   ``We're working against time now,'' John Ashurst, the British
conservation architect leading the team, said in an interview.
``It's a kind of war of attrition. In the end, it only takes one
small event.''
	   Slabs of stone look ready to slide off the cliff's eastern side
and the western side is already crumbling. The once-imposing outer
walls resemble honeycombs in spots, their weakness apparent in the
grapefruit-sized cavities in the stones.
	   The British team was brought in a week ago as part of emergency
efforts to repair the damage. Decorative stucco columns have been
battered by strong winds, and the frescoes are in danger of flaking
off. One corner of Herod's bathhouse has already slid off an
eroding precipice.
	   Colin Burns, a member of the British team, chiseled a stone and
fit it into an existing arch above the cold plunge room of the
bathhouse. Saving the arch is essential in order to keep the
surrounding cliff walls from sliding down and pulling the room down
with them.
	   When the British team departs Saturday, Israeli conservationists
will continue repairs to the palace masonry, frescoes and
decorative stucco.
	   ``It's one of the most daring conservation projects we've
started in Israel,'' said Asi Shalom, a conservation archaeologist
with Israel's National Park Protection Agency. ''Every hour is
important for us now.''
	   Work has been virtually non-stop at the site. One
conservationist performed delicate work Wednesday on frescoes with
geometric and floral patterns. Another filled in the hollowed
stones with slabs of similar material to preserve the original
facade of the walls. Others worked from scaffolds surrounding a
50-foot (15-meter) high wall.
	   ``The whole story of Masada is about sliding. We're trying to
gather it up and hold it up again,'' Ashurst said.
	   King Herod began building the Masada fortress around 10 A.D. It
became the last outpost of zealots during the Jewish revolt against
Rome that began in A.D. 66. The Romans were unable to take Masada
for three years _ until they completed a massive dirt ramp up the
cliff. But before they could reach their victims, the zealots chose
mass suicide over enslavement.

NATO chief condemns Yugoslav media restrictions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; with Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO Secretary General Javier Solana
added his voice Thursday to the growing international condemnation
of the latest restrictions imposed on the media in Yugoslavia.
	   ``The recent closure of newspapers and radio stations, measures
taken against the foreign press and the law on the media adopted by
the Serb parliament are a violation of basic democratic
principles,'' Solana said in a statement.
	   The Serb parliament voted Tuesday to ban broadcasts of
Serbian-language programs by foreign media and tighten restrictions
on working permits for media organizations.
	   Solana said the move ``will only isolate the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia further form the European family of nations.''
	   Serbia's autocratic government, loyal to Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic, has used NATO's threat of air strikes over
Kosovo to clampdown on the independent media and political
opponents.
	   Throughout the nearly eight-month-old Kosovo crisis, state
officials have accused the media of betraying Serbia's national
interests by reporting ethnic Albanian stands in the conflict or
carrying foreign news reports about the fighting.
	   Solana denounced the restrictions as ``a blatant attempt ... to
deprive the people of Yugoslavia of their rights to freedom of
thought and speech, and to hide the truth of what is happening both
inside and outside their country.''

Inmates set themselves afire in Turkish prisons
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Two inmates have died of burns after a
group of Kurdish prisoners set themselves afire to protest the
latest government crackdown on Kurdish rebels, human rights
organizations said Thursday.
	   Two inmates were in intensive care, while two others were
treated for minor burns, said Meryem Aydin, an official of
THAY-DER, a prisoners' families' solidarity group. The independent
Human Rights Association confirmed the report.
	   The prisoners, either awaiting trial or convicted on charges of
Kurdish separatism, were protesting government attempts to clamp
down on Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan and his group, which
is fighting for autonomy in southeastern Turkey.
	   Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz announced this week that Ocalan had
moved to Russia from Syria where he was believed to be in hiding.
Turkish and Syrian officials this week struck an agreement under
which Damascus pledged to brand the group illegal and stop its
activities on Syrian territory.
	   Turkey's prisons, which house some 9,000 prisoners linked to
leftist or Kurdish groups, are frequently rocked by riots and
hunger strikes.

Serbian hackers declare computer war on anti-Serb Web sites
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A group of Serbian hackers declared
a computer war against anti-Serb Web sites and claimed
responsibility for causing one Kosovo Albanian site to crash
recently, a Belgrade daily reported Thursday.
	   A young man who identified himself as member of a team of
hackers called Black Hand phoned the Blic daily and claimed the
group caused a system crash several days ago on the server of a
Swiss Internet provider which hosted an ethnic Albanian Web site.
	   ``We shall continue to remove (ethnic) Albanian lies from the
Internet,'' the young man told the daily. He declined to give his
name.
	   The first to suffer the impact of the Black Hand was the site
http:www.kosova.com. An announcement saying the site was hacked by
team Crna Ruka (Black Hand in Serbian) appeared on this site,
together with the slogan: ``Long Live Great Serbia!''
	   The unidentified Blic caller said the group next plans to remove
NATO's site but gave no details how it intended to go about it.
	   Also, Black Hand would not spare the sites of the Serbian regime
because of the regime's campaign against independent media, the
young man said.
	   Ethnic Albanian media and organizations in Serbia's troubled
Kosovo province have for several years used the Internet as a means
of distributing their information to the world audience. Recently,
the Serbian government has also opened up several Web sites.
	   According to the mysterious Blic phoner, Black Hand has five
members, computer wizards from Belgrade, the central Serbian town
of Nis and neighboring Macedonia.
	   ``We have fought (ethnic) Alabanian propaganda for the last
year,'' the young man said proudly, adding that no one has ever
been able to trace them.
	   He declined any political goals and said his group ``is against
weapons and has found another, suitable way to fight.''
	   At the turn of the century, a group of Serbian officers which
bore the name Black Hand conspired to a coup d'etat. The officers
are believed to have been behind the execution of a Serbian crown
prince and his comon-law wife.

U.S. hurricane aid boosts Puerto Rican statehood advocates
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo NY107 &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ When Hurricane Georges demolished
thousands of Puerto Rican homes, it also handed supporters of
statehood a valuable gift: a chance to prove that it pays
handsomely to be part of the United States.
	   The federal government's mighty relief effort _ at dlrs 1.5
billion and counting _ has been caught up in a political storm,
with critics accusing Gov. Pedro Rossello of exploiting it to boost
the statehood side in an upcoming vote on the island's status.
	   Statehood supporters, meanwhile, dismissed opposition calls that
the Dec. 13 vote be put off until the island recovers.
	   ``All relief work is politics,'' said James Lee Witt, the head
of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, when he visited the
island last week.
	   The Sept. 21 hurricane _ considered the worst to hit Puerto Rico
in 70 years _ came as the island is preparing for a referendum on
whether to continue its current status or opt for statehood or
independence.
	   The United States, which has controlled Puerto Rico since
driving out the Spanish a century ago, is not bound by the vote but
President Bill Clinton has said Congress should honor the result.
However, the current lawmaking body appears unlikely to approve of
expanding the union.
	   The last referendum, in 1993, was narrowly won by supporters of
the current ``commonwealth'' status, whereby Puerto Ricans are U.S.
citizens with limited rights and duties. Only a tiny minority
supports independence.
	   Statehood supporters deride commonwealth as colonial status,
noting that islanders cannot vote for president or for Congress,
which has ultimate control here.
	   Commonwealth supporters fear statehood would dilute their
Hispanic culture and make English the dominant language.
	   Last week, Witt detailed FEMA accomplishments that include:
	   _ Raising dlrs 1.5 billion from the government, making this the
organization's biggest storm-relief project ever.
	   _ Launching a five-year project to build 50,000 homes.
	   _ Registering and paying more victims more quickly than ever.
	   In addition, the U.S. military launched an ambitious relief
effort, transporting thousands of tons of cots, medicines, ice,
water and generators to aid victims.
	   Several hundred Marines from Camp Lejuene, North Carolina,
installed temporary bridges, power-generating stations and water
purification centers. Heavy-lift helicopters delivered the aid to
remote mountain towns.
	   The aid stood in sharp contrast to the situation in neighboring
countries.
	   The English-language San Juan Star daily noted that ``things are
sharply different'' in the devastated Dominican Republic and Haiti,
where ``they do not have the financial and expert support from
Washington that Puerto Rico does.''
	   Georges killed some 500 people in those two countries _ compared
to three in Puerto Rico _ and their governments have been unable to
cope with hundreds of thousands of homeless.
	   ``The governor's strategists believe they will reap a political
windfall from the outpouring of federal aid,'' wrote columnist Bob
Becker in the Star. ``The message will be crystal clear...
statehood assures the strong assistance of the United States in
times of natural catastrophe.''
	   A group led by opposition legislator Roberto Cruz Rodriguez has
demanded an investigation of Rossello's handling of aid, saying he
illegally withheld money from the opposition-controlled town of
Ponce until he could arrive and distribute it himself.
	   ``(That's) an abuse that borders on plain impudence,'' Cruz
Rodriguez charged.
	   Critics say Rossello allies have also distributed pro-statehood
literature at events where he has handed out relief checks.
	   But, most damning in the eyes of many in this music-mad society,
such events have featured louspeakers blaring ``The Cup Of Life,''
a hit song that has become associated with the governor's campaign.
	   ``It's a great way to bring comfort to people, to make them
cheerful,'' countered Rossello's chief of staff, Angel Morey.

Report: Daimler CEO expects auto industry recession, maybe soon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Magazin is cq &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Daimler-Benz chief Juergen Schrempp
expects the automobile industry to encounter a recession, possibly
soon, a German business magazine reported Thursday.
	   Manager Magazin cited Schrempp as its manager of the year in the
November issue for pulling off the megamerger of the German
industrial giant with the U.S. automaker Chrysler. The deal is
expected to be final by the end of the year.
	   In an advance copy of the interview, Manager Magazin quoted
Schrempp as saying he expects the ``dramatic concentration
process'' resulting from mergers in the auto industry to continue,
and that he wanted to be part of the that.
	   Schrempp said that he would like to increase significantly
Chrysler's position in Europe, with Asia as second priority,
according to the report.
	   ``We should be able to position Chrysler products against (those
of) VW and Audi,'' the magazine quoted Schrempp as saying. Audi is
Volkswagen's luxury auto subsidiary.
	   DaimlerChrysler AG, which will be formed by the merger of
Daimler and Chrysler announced in May, will begin operations in
1999.
	   The magazine's annual manager of the year award is chosen by
eight people from diverse areas in the business world.

Floods hit thousands of struck by famine in south Sudan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Heavy rains in war-ravaged southern Sudan
have flooded homes and crops in low-lying areas, endangering more
than 120,000 people already suffering from famine, the U.N. said
Thursday.
	   The U.N. World Food Program said flooding in three areas of
southern Sudan has destroyed crops and dealt another blow to
thousands already in the grip of famine caused by the 15-year civil
war.
	   WFP spokeswoman Lindsey Davies said Ajiep and Panthau in the
western Bahr-el Ghazal region were among the heavily flooded areas.
	   ``This was the epicenter of the (famine) crisis. People there
are extremely vulnerable and weak,'' Davies said. ``Although we
were beginning to see small signs of improvement, with this recent
flooding, they are back to square one.''
	   Six weeks ago, relief agencies had reported that the death rate
among famine victims had dropped from a peak of 120 deaths per week
to under 60, but since then there has been no further improvement,
she said.
	   Davies said the majority of the 46,000 people in the area
already receiving food assistance from WFP had lost their meager
crops to the floods and were now moving to higher ground.
	   Another 80,000 people were also affected by heavy rains in Bor
County in the Jonglei region in southeastern Sudan.
	   Aerial surveillance missions have ascertained that 70 percent of
the crops appear to have been damaged or destroyed and most people
were now moving eastward to highlands, Davies said.
	   She said renewed fighting between Sudan People's Liberation Army
rebels and government forces in the area has made the situation
worse.
	   ``There is a lot of insecurity in that area, and it is more
difficult for these people to find safe havens,'' she said.
	   In the Upper Nile region north of Jonglei, traditionally an
agricultural surplus area, floods have caused a 50 percent crop
loss, Davies said.
	   More than 1.5 million people have died in fighting and
war-induced famine in the 15-year civil war between rebels in the
mostly Christian and animist south and government troops from the
Muslim, Arabicized north.

Labor dissident's wife, mother appeal to Chinese president
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ The wife and mother of a jailed Chinese labor
activist appealed Thursday to President Jiang Zemin to order his
release on medical grounds, after officials said he wasn't sick
enough to deserve parole.
	   Chu Hailan and Wu Huifen accused authorities of concealing the
extent of Liu Nianchun's illnesses and of delaying medical
treatment for him.
	   Liu has been detained without trial for nearly 3 1/2 years and
is in a labor camp outside of Beijing. Chu, Liu's wife, has long
campaigned for his release, making her a target for frequent police
harassment.
	   In a statement addressed to Jiang and faxed to news agencies,
Chu and Wu, Liu's mother, claimed he has contracted more than seven
serious illnesses in detention that are progressively getting worse
for lack of effective treatment. They asked Jiang to order Liu's
parole on medical grounds.
	   Chu and Wu appealed on Sept. 21 to labor camp authorities in
Beijing for Liu's medical parole.
	   Authorities rejected the appeal this Tuesday, the wife and
mother said in their statement. The authorities said Liu's high
blood pressure has returned to normal with medication and denied
that he suffers swelling and ulcers of the colon and rectum, the
wife and mother said.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets ended lower Thursday,
although Tokyo blue chips were able to hold some gains for a fifth
straight session following the initial offering of shares in
Japan's largest cellular phone carrier.
	   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock
Average finished with a rise of 79.23 points, or 0.56 percent, at
14,295.56.
	   Traders said the 2.13 trillion yen (dlrs 18.6 billion) market
debut of NTT Mobile Communications Network Inc., better known as
NTT DoCoMo, boosted confidence. Sentiment was also lifted by hopes
that more troubled Japanese banks will receive government funds.
	   ``The listing of NTT DoCoMo was a success,'' said Yasuo Ueki,
general manager at Nikko Securities. But it was unclear whether
DoCoMo, a subsidiary of telecommunications giant Nippon Telegraph
and Telephone Corp. that went on sale in the world's biggest-ever
initial stock offering, would continue to support the market, he
added.
	   The dollar bought 117.72 in late afternoon, up 1.36 yen from
late Wednesday in Tokyo and also above its New York rate of 117.00
yen in late overnight trading.
	   In Hong Kong, the blue-chip Hang Seng Index shed 3.54 points, or
0.04 percent, closing at 9,658.58, after giving up early gains of
more than 100 points.
	   ``The market is quite sluggish. There's not much indication from
overseas markets,'' said Michael Ng, dealing director at Sassoon
Securities Ltd. Investors seem to think interest rates may have
bottomed out for the near term, which was putting a damper on the
market, he said.
	   Elsewhere in Asia:
	   BANGKOK: Shares ended mixed, with a decline in banking shares
and selective buying in cheaper priced commercial lenders. The SET
index lost 1.48 points, or 0.5 percent, closing at 321.57.
	   MANILA: Philippine currency and stock exchanges were closed
Thursday due to typhoon Babs.
	   JAKARTA: Shares closed lower as foreign investors sold major
shares that had rallied recently. The JSX Index closed down 5.526
points, or 1.7 percent, at 316.795.
	   KUALA LUMPUR: Share prices continued to dive as investors
prepared for the government's 1999 budget to be read in parliament
Friday. The Composite Index fell 2.81 points, or 0.66 percent,
closing at 421.56.
	   SINGAPORE: Shares closed lower in what appeared to be a
technical correction after the recent mini bull-run. The STI closed
down 23.41 points, or 2.1 percent, at 1,117.50.
	   TAIPEI: Shares ended lower, following a rally Wednesday. The
Weighted Price Index closed down 33.63 points, or 0.47 percent, at
6,987.79.
	   SEOUL: Shares closed slightly higher, buoyed by lower interest
rates. The KOSPI was up 1.72 points, or 0.4 percent, at 382.52.
	   SYDNEY: Shares ended slightly higher, as a steep drop in global
media heavyweight News Corp. blunted market movement. The All
Ordinaries index was up 2.2 points, or 0.09 percent, closing at
2,545.2.
	   WELLINGTON: Shares finished narrowly mixed as interest in
second-tier stocks prevented the market from further declining. The
NZSE-40 capital index was up 0.50 points, or 0.03 percent, closing
at 1,842.08.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ With Kosovo's cease-fire still
mostly holding, Western officials pressed both Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic and the ethnic Albanians on Thursday to do more
to achieve lasting peace in the embattled province.
	   The French foreign minister warned that Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic still must pull out more troops, and U.S. envoy
Christopher Hill and European ambassadors began new talks in
Pristina with political leader Ibrahim Rugova.
	   Ten days after the breakthrough agreement on Kosovo brokered by
American diplomat Richard Holbrooke, there are scattered reports of
shelling and shooting incidents at night in the separatist province
of Serbia.
	   The Kosovo Information Center said four members of an ethnic
Albanian family _ three of them children _ were killed and two
wounded early Thursday when the Yugoslav army opened fire near
Djakovica on the Albanian border. The center, close to the
province's ethnic Albanian leadership, said the Sylmetaj family
members were refugees who were crossing back over from Albania to
return to their homes.
	   The report could not be confirmed.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A government-backed team will postpone
undyawan, a Roman Catholic priest. The
results were originally scheduled for release on Friday.
	   President B.J. Habibie formed an 18-member fact-finding team to
explore the turmoil in Jakarta that helped oust President Suharto
after 32 years of authoritarian rule. The panel includes human
rights activists, police generals and community leaders.
	   The report is likely to address sensitive issues, including
reports of systematic rape of ethnic Chinese women as well as
allegations that elements in the military instigated some of the
unrest.

Ethnic Albanian family reported killed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Four members of an ethnic Albanian
family _ three of them children _ were killed and two wounded early
Thursday by the Yugoslav army, the Albanians' Kosovo Information
Center reported.
	   The center, close to the province's ethnic leadership, quoted
surviving members of the Sylmetaj family as saying the army opened
fire at them around 4 a.m.
	   The family members were among refugees who fled the fighting in
Kosovo and were returning Thursday from Albania.
	   They were on foot, heading for their native village Grcina, near
the border town of Djakovica, 75 kilometers (47 miles) southwest of
the provincial capital Pristina.
	   When the army opened fire, the family was inside the border
strip between Kosovo and Albania, on Serbian territory, the center
said. The strip along the border is controlled by the
Serb-dominated Yugoslav army.
	   The four dead were identified as Ramiz, 28, Mazllum, 2,
Muharrem, 6, and Leonora, 12. Among the two wounded was the mother
of the killed children, Ajsha.
	   The report could not immediately be confirmed. Yugoslav and Serb
forces say guerrillas of the Kosovo Liberation Army go back and
forth from Albania and they are defending both themselves and the
border against them.

EU Commission President Santer to visit China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Amid a slew of visits by European leaders,
European Commission President Jacques Santer will travel to China
next week on a trip Beijing said Thursday would further improve
ties.
	   Santer's six-day visit, which begins next Thursday, will add to
the momentum in relations between China and Europe, Chinese Foreign
Ministry spokesman Tang Guoqiang said.
	   Over the past two years, China has aggressively wooed European
countries to improve trade and investment and counteract the
predominance of the United States.
	   Relations especially picked up after most EU countries ended
support for motions to censure China before the U.N. Human Rights
Commission. In the past four weeks, the British and French prime
ministers have visited Beijing. Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc
Dehaene will come at month's end.
	   Tang noted that with a global economy and a multipolar world, it
made good sense for Beijing to strengthen cooperation with Europe.
	   ``We're ready to join efforts with the EU and its member states
for the development of a long-term stable friendly relationship of
cooperation,'' Tang said at a routine media briefing. ``We believe
this visit by President Santer will help to move forward
China-Europe relations.''
	   Although Tang did not comment on the agenda, senior EU officials
have previously tried to coax Beijing into concessions to further
its bid to enter the World Trade Organization. Washington and other
trading partners want China to open its domestic markets wider to
win membership in the trade rule-making body.

NATO chief condemns Yugoslav media restrictions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana
added his voice Thursday to the growing international condemnation
of the latest restrictions imposed on the media in Yugoslavia.
	   ``The recent closure of newspapers and radio stations, measures
taken against the foreign press and the law on the media adopted by
the Serb parliament are a violation of basic democratic
principles,'' Solana said in a statement.
	   The Serb parliament voted Tuesday to ban broadcasts of
Serbian-language programs by foreign media and tighten restrictions
on working permits for media organizations.
	   Solana said the move ``will only isolate the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia further form the European family of nations.''
	   Serbia's autocratic government, loyal to Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic, has used NATO's threat of air strikes over
Kosovo to clampdown on the independent media and political
opponents.
	   Throughout the nearly 8-month-old Kosovo crisis, state officials
have accused the media of betraying Serbia's national interests by
reporting ethnic Albanian stands in the conflict or carrying
foreign news reports about the fighting.
	   Solana denounced the restrictions as ``a blatant attempt ... to
deprive the people of Yugoslavia of their rights to freedom of
thought and speech, and to hide the truth of what is happening both
inside and outside their country.''

Floods hit thousands of struck by famine in south Sudan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Heavy rains in war-ravaged southern Sudan
have flooded homes and crops in low-lying areas, endangering more
than 120,000 people already suffering from famine, the United
Nations said Thursday.
	   The U.N. World Food Program said flooding in three areas of
southern Sudan has destroyed crops and dealt another blow to
thousands already in the grip of famine caused by the 15-year civil
war.
	   WFP spokeswoman Lindsey Davies said Ajiep and Panthau in the
western Bahr-el Ghazal region were among the heavily flooded areas.
	   ``This was the epicenter of the (famine) crisis. People there
are extremely vulnerable and weak,'' Davies said. ``Although we
were beginning to see small signs of improvement, with this recent
flooding, they are back to square one.''
	   Six weeks ago, relief agencies reported that the death rate
among famine victims dropped from a peak of 120 deaths per week to
less than 60, but since then, there has been no further
improvement, she said.
	   Davies said the majority of the 46,000 people in the area
already receiving food assistance from WFP lost their meager crops
to the floods and were now moving to higher ground. Another 80,000
people were also affected by heavy rains in Bor County in the
Jonglei region in southeastern Sudan.
	   Aerial surveillance missions have ascertained that 70 percent of
the crops appear to have been damaged or destroyed and most people
were now moving eastward to highlands, Davies said.
	   She said renewed fighting between Sudan People's Liberation Army
rebels and government forces in the area has made the situation
worse.
	   ``There is a lot of insecurity in that area, and it is more
difficult for these people to find safe havens,'' she said.
	   In the Upper Nile region north of Jonglei, traditionally an
agricultural surplus area, floods have caused a 50 percent crop
loss, Davies said.
	   More than 1.5 million people have died in fighting and
war-induced famine in the 15-year civil war between rebels in the
mostly Christian and animist south and government troops from the
Muslim, Arabicized north.

Singapore, Australian navies to conduct joint military exercise
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore and Australia will start an eight-day
exercise Friday involving more than 600 men and seven ships from
their two navies.
	   Code-named Singaroo 98, the exercise in waters off northern
Australia will involve training in anti-submarine, anti-surface and
anti-air warfare.
	   The two countries' air forces will provide air support for the
exercise.
	   Meanwhile, since Oct. 1, Singapore has been conducting a
six-week military exercise in Queensland, Australia. About 4,200
men have been involved in live-firing exercises and helicopter
transport training, supported by Singapore's Super Puma
helicopters.
	   Singapore and Australia have extensive military cooperation,
both bilaterally and under the Five Power Defense Arrangement,
which also includes Britain, Malaysia and New Zealand.
	   Australia has also allowed the tiny island nation to conduct
large-scale military training in a realistic environment, which is
impossible in Singapore given its shortage of land and air space.

RFE may start broadcasting to Iran, Iraq this month
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ U.S.-sponsored Radio Free
Europe/Radio Liberty has announced plans to start its broadcast to
Iran and Iraq from the Czech territory next week, an official said
Thursday.
	   Interior ministry spokesman said the radio station sent a letter
to the ministry announcing its plan to start the the broadcasts
Oct. 31.
	   Earlier this month, the Czech government allowed the broadcast
into Iraq but insisted the station's location should change to
avoid security risks. The Farsi-language service into Iran was
approved by the government in August.
	   The radio station originally said it intends to expand to new
offices in Prague's sixth residential district, a plan which drew
concern from the government.
	   Decker said the station apparently scrapped that plan and said
it would keep the two new programs in its headquarters in the
downtown building that once housed the Czechoslovak Parliament.
	   It was not immediately clear whether the government would agree
to the decision.
	   ``According to the government's resolution, the radio should
discuss all possible security risks with the police presidium
before the broadcasts start,'' Decker said.
	   No one could immediately be reached for comment at RFE/RL.
	   RFE/RL began transmitting from Munich, Germany, in 1951,
spreading uncensored news to Soviet-controlled countries behind the
Iron Curtain during the Cold War between the Americans and the
Soviets.
	   It moved its headquarters to Prague in 1995 following the
collapse of communism six years earlier.
	   The Iraq and Iran broadcasts were originally planned out of a
residential area in northern Prague, near a nursery school and
several embassies.

Kabul's poorest hit by shortages
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Afghanistan-UN
 &UR; By AMIR SHAH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ In the bakeries that cater to Kabul's
poorest there is no flour and in the hospitals doctors are turning
away the sick because there is no food or medicine.
	   ``There is no food for the patients . . . I pray to God `please
don't bring any more sick people to the doors of my hospital,'''
Abdul Rahim Lodin said Thursday in an interview outside the
tattered Aliabad Hospital in heart of the beleaguered capital.
	   A wheat shortage has suspended production of bread at bakeries
run by the World Food Program, said a WFP official who didn't want
to give his name.
	   Separate bakeries run by widows to supply bread only to widows
also have been shut down, although the WFP promises they will
reopen before the week's end.
	   Lodin said the departure of the international aid workers from
the war-weary city in July has hit the poorest the hardest. The
United Nations pulled out in August after the U.S. missile attack
and a retaliatory shooting death of an Italian U.N. worker.
	   ``We tell people they have to buy their medicines from the
market because we don't have any,'' he said.
	   The International Red Cross, the only international aid group
still operating in Kabul supplies two hospitals.
	   Red Cross officials say they do not have the capacity to provide
medicines and supplies for the city's other hospitals.
	   Previously international aid organizations like Pharmacies
without Borders was supplying hospitals with medicines. They left
behind a one-month stockpile, but that has run out, said Lodin.
	   ``Doctors who have money they provide food for the patients,''
says Lodin, the hospital's chief surgeon.
	   ``Condition are very very bad. . . even patients have to bring
their own soap,'' he said.
	   The non government organizations left Kabul after the Taliban
announced they would have to relocate to abandoned dormitories.
Several aid groups have been holding negotiations with the Taliban
to find a way to end the standoff, but so far there seems to be
little hope of a breakthrough.
	   ``Since, the aid people left Afghanistan we are facing many
problems,'' said Lodin.
	   The United Nations is hoping to return to Afghanistan in the
next month once it receives security guarantees from the Taliban.
Neither the U.N. nor the Red Cross was required to relocate to the
war- damaged dormitories.
	   ``Beggars are knocking on the doors of people who have no money
. . . who have nothing,'' said Lodin.

Gerashchenko: Russia has to avoid sharp currency fluctuations
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MITCH STACY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Central Bank of Russia must avoid sharp
fluctuations in the ruble and tighten supervision of the country's
banks to stabilize the economy and restore public trust, its
chairman said Thursday.
	   Victor Gerashchenko said Russia's foreign exchange market has
been restructured to try to control the exchange rate.
	   One strategy involves requiring exporters to sell a proportion
of their foreign exchange earnings, he told potential investors at
the Moscow International Business Association conference
	   The conference is seeking to interest foreign businesses in more
than 200 investment opportunities in the Russian capital.
	   ``It is important to mitigate panic-driven demand for foreign
currency,'' Gerashchenko told his audience.
	   Russia's banks also are being restructured by being divided into
four categories, depending on their level of solvency, Gerashchenko
said. Most will get varying degrees of restructuring help from the
central bank, with some being put out of business, he said.
	   It is critical, he said, that basic banking services be
available to people in every region of the country.
	   Gerashchenko, chairman of the central bank since 1992, said
foreign investment also is critical in the ongoing revitalization
of the the country's economy.
	   ``We shall welcome foreign banks to Russia,'' he said.
	   Allowing foreign banks into the country is likely to bring
private savings into the economy, because Russians tend to trust
them more.
	   Gerashchenko has said in the past, however, that the government
worries Russian banks would lose out in competition with foreign
banks and that deposits would simply be taken out of the country
through the foreign banks' channels.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   QUEENSTOWN, Maryland (AP) _ President Bill Clinton watched from
the White House as his top aides scurried to salvage Middle East
peace talks, roiled after a week of hard bargaining by an Israeli
threat to bolt in the middle of the night unless they won more
Palestinian concessions. In the end, Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, who had packed his bags and ordered his plane
on standby, agreed to stay and work with Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and CIA Director George Tenet on a West Bank
security proposal that Israel could accept. The Palestinians
claimed Wednesday to have ``closed the security file'' and agreed
with Israelis on an anti-terrorism plan, but Israeli and U.S.
officials said there still was serious work to be done before
signing off on a deal. Clinton could rejoin the talks Thursday, but
only if there was enough progress among Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators. (US-MIDEAST TALKS)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ With Kosovo's cease-fire still
mostly holding, Western officials pressed both Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic and the ethnic Albanians on Thursday to do more
to achieve lasting peace in the embattled province. The French
foreign minister warned that Milosevic still must pull out more
troops, and U.S. envoy Christopher Hill and European ambassadors
began new talks in the provincial capital Pristina with moderate
ethnic Albanian political leader Ibrahim Rugova. Ten days after the
breakthrough agreement on Kosovo, there are scattered reports of
shelling and shooting incidents at night but no apparent fighting
in the separatist province of Serbia, the dominant of the two
republics that make up Yugoslavia. Still threatening airstrikes,
NATO has given Milosevic until Tuesday to withdraw more military
and special police forces from Kosovo and return others to garrison
in the province where he launched an offensive against ethnic
Albanian guerrillas eight months ago. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   GENEVA (AP) _ North Korea's protest over planned U.S. military
exercises with South Korea hung over negotiators Thursday as
efforts resumed to reach a permanent peace treaty for the Korean
peninsula. But delegates from North and South Korea, China and the
United States had little or nothing to say to reporters as they
began a second day of talks after a break of more than six months.
Park Kun-woo, leader of the South Korean delegation which is
chairing the current round, said he was unable to go into detail
about what the the four sides were discussing. The North's official
Korean Central News Agency said U.S. and South Korean officials
were ``seriously provoking'' by scheduling the maneuvers to begin
the day after the current round of talks ends Sunday. (KOREAN

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Typhoon Babs swept across the central
Philippines toward Manila on Thursday, ripping roofs off bamboo
houses, triggering landslides and forcing widespread evacuations.
Disaster officials said at least two people were killed and two
others were injured. In Camarines Sur province, three fishermen
were missing after they were washed away by surging waves. About
28,500 people were evacuated from their homes in at least four
provinces, the officials said. Schools, government offices and
businesses were closed in Manila as the capital prepared for a
direct hit by the storm. The typhoon comes only a week after parts
of the northern Philippines were devastated by Typhoon Zeb, which
killed at least 74 people in the country. (PHILIPPINES-TYPHOON)
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A local court has ordered the
trial of 127 people who were arrested for participating in a
demonstration that demanded the resignation of Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad, news reports said Thursday. They were produced
Wednesday before a magistrate and charged with unlawful assembly
and disobeying police orders to disperse from the streets of
downtown Kuala Lumpur on Saturday, The Star daily said. All 127
pleaded innocent. Another person, who pleaded guilty, was fined
2,000 ringgit (dlrs 526). Those going on trial, due to begin in
May, could be jailed for one year and fined 10,000 ringgit (dlrs
2,600) if convicted. Police have declared illegal all
demonstrations in support of jailed dissident leader Anwar Ibrahim,
and have arrested people each time such demonstrations have been
held. So far, authorities have detained 262 people who have been
released on bail pending trial. (MALAYSIA-POLITICS)

Report: police investigating claim that drug smugglers murdered
</HEADLINE>
infants &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ A suspect in a drugs-related murder claims
that smugglers have brought heroin into the country in the corpses
of murdered infants, the Dagbladet newspaper reported Thursday.
	   The newspaper said its report was based on a confidential
transcript of a police interrogation in Stavanger, a main port city
in Norway's southwest.
	   Police refused comment on the report.
	   The newspaper said the suspect claimed that smugglers of
Vietnamese origin bought infants from prostitutes in Paris and
Hamburg, Germany, and took them to Denmark where they were killed.
The corpses were then filled with bags of heroin, and brought to
Norway by women pretending to be the infants' mothers, the suspect
claimed, according to the report.
	   ``They left their own babies at home, and went to Denmark where
they were given a prepared baby,'' the newspaper quoted the police
transcript as saying. ``If customs officers started to look too
closely, the women would say the baby was ill and ask to be allowed
to immediately rush it to a doctor.''
	   The 26-year-old suspect, arrested for a drug-related murder this
year, claimed that the Vietnamese drug ring's leader had told him
about the practice.

Czech diplomat says Prague to act to stop flood of refugees
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By FRANK ELLMERS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DRESDEN, Germany (AP) _ The Czech Republic plans to tighten its
eastern border to try to stop a flood of refugees from Kosovo from
passing through on their way to Germany, a Czech diplomat said.
	   Some 30,000 refugees have been arrested on the Czech-German
border this year, most of them ethnic Albanians from Yugoslavia's
troubled Kosovo province, Jana Sebkova, the Czech general consul in
Dresden, said in an interview this week.
	   ``Among them were people of all age groups, including an
8-month-old baby,'' she said.
	   To try to stop the illegal migration, Sebkova said her country
intended to stop trains entering from Slovakia to check passports
and to increase border patrols.
	   An Interior Ministry spokesman in Prague had no immediate
comment.
	   Germany has increased patrols on its side of the border in
recent months. German officials said just last weekend they
apprehended 261 refugees near the German-Czech border, including 78
Kosovo Albanians who were crammed into the back of a small truck.
	   All 78 were sent back to the Czech Republic to apply for asylum
there.
	   Sebkova noted that refugees from eastern Europe and the former
Soviet Union don't need an entry visa for the Czech Republic, but
can stay for up to three months as tourists while waiting for a
chance to slip across the mostly rural border region with Germany.
	   ``So the Czech Republic becomes a transit land for these people
on the way to Germany,'' she said.
	   Prague is considering introducing a visa requirement for these
countries, she said, but it must be compatible with European Union
rules.
	   She said Prague also is trying to fight refugee smuggling
operations through education: ``Not all of our citizens know that
they can be prosecuted if they participate in such activities,''
she said.
	   Since 1990, 15,341 refugees from Yugoslavia, Romania,
Afghanistan and Bulgaria have applied for asylum in the Czech
Republic, Sebkova said. Only 1,800 were approved.

Parliament adopts new bill to control demonstrations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Parliament adopted a new bill Thursday
to control demonstrations in Indonesia, where violence and protests
helped end the 32-year authoritarian rule of President Suharto.
	   President B.J. Habibie, who succeeded Suharto in May, has moved
toward democratic reforms, but also has been the target of protests
amid Indonesia's worst economic crisis in three decades.
	   Unlike the original draft, which drew criticism from democracy
activists, the law does not limit numbers of protesters, but
requires the organizers to name those responsible for every 100
participants.
	   It also allows demonstrations, rallies and public gatherings
outside the presidential and vice presidential palaces, houses of
worship, military installations, hospitals, airports and seaports,
train stations and bus terminals, but sets distances.
	   Protesters are required to stay 100 meters (110 yards) from the
palace fences, 150 meters (165 yards) from military installations
and 500 meters (550 yards) from other strategic sites.
	   Police permits are not required, but organizers have to notify
police three days in advance at the latest, and one day before any
cancellation.
	   Police are obliged to guard the protests.
	   The law does not cover labor strikes, or religious and campus
activities, nor does it govern freedom of expression in the media.
	   Initial versions of the bill drew criticism that it would curb
newfound freedom of expression following the end of the Suharto
era.
	   After the law's passage by the 500-member parliament, Gen.
Wiranto, the defense minister and armed forces commander, said,
``It has gone through a long and grueling process. Finally it was
fully accepted by both the parliament and the government.''
	   In May, riots and protests against Suharto and his handling of
the economy left about 1,200 people dead.

Chechnya's president orders rebel commanders to surrender
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with rebel leader refusing to comply, grafs 4-7. &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Chechnya's President Aslan Maskhadov ordered rebel
field commanders Thursday to disband their units, threatening a
crackdown if they disobeyed, a news report said.
	   Since the end of Chechnya's 1994-6 war with Russia, many field
commanders have remained outside the control of the territory's
government, and are unlikely to comply with this latest order.
	   In a decree signed Thursday, Maskhadov also demanded that the
``military bases of these formations be eliminated immediately,''
the Interfax news agency reported.
	   One of the best known renegades, Salman Raduyev, immediately
announced that he had no plans to disband his troops, Interfax
reported.
	   Maskhadov has ordered the police and security forces to enforce
the decree and prosecute field commander who fail to comply, said
presidential spokesman Mairbek Vachagayev, according to Interfax.
	   But Maskhadov may have trouble enforcing the order, because
Raduyev and other field commanders control too many men to be
easily subdued, Interfax reported.
	   The rebel units were among those who fought the Russians. But
they have refused to lay down their arms now that the war is over.
These groups now discredit Chechnya's effort to be recognized as an
independent state, Maskhadov said in his decree.
	   Chechnya has been running its own affairs since the end of the
war against Russia, but no country has recognized its independence
claim. Moscow insists the territory remains part of Russia.
	   Maskhadov also planned to meet field commanders loyal to his
government on Thursday, Vachagayev said. The talks may deal with
plans to the many hostages who have been seized in Chechnya since
the end of the war, he said.
	   Police from the neighboring Russian republic of Dagestan have
freed an officer who was held captive in Chechnya since his
kidnapping on Sept. 12, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported
Thursday.
	   Also, two Latvian citizens have been freed by police from
Russia's Caucasus republics of North Ossetia and Ingushetia, the
report said.
	   Russia's Caucasus regions have been plagued by violence spilling
over from Chechnya as well as their own ethnic conflicts.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 1100 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets ended lower Thursday,
although Tokyo blue chips were able to hold some gains for a fifth
straight session following the initial offering of shares in
Japan's largest cellular phone carrier. The Tokyo Stock Exchange's
benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average finished with a rise of
79.23 points, or 0.56 percent, at 14,295.56. Traders said the 2.13
trillion yen (dlrs 18.6 billion) market debut of NTT Mobile
Communications Network Inc., better known as NTT DoCoMo, boosted
confidence. In Hong Kong, the blue-chip Hang Seng Index shed 3.54
points, or 0.04 percent, closing at 9,658.58, after giving up early
gains of more than 100 points. Elsewhere in Asia, share prices
closed lower in Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, Singapore and Taipei and
closed higher in Sydney and Seoul. Stocks prices were mixed in
Bangkok and Wellington. Philippine currency and stock exchanges
were closed Thursday due to Typhoon Babs. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's biggest brokerage, Nomura Securities Co.,
said Thursday it lost dlrs 1.76 billion in the first half of fiscal
1998 as global financial turmoil took a toll, especially on its
overseas operations. Nomura posted a group loss of 207.2 billion
yen (dlrs 1.76 billion) for the half year ended Sept. 30, compared
to a net profit of 49.71 billion yen (dlrs 422 million) in the same
period a year earlier. The company lost hundreds of millions of
dollars on its holdings of Russian bonds. The losses will prompt
Nomura to cut between 1,000 and 2,000 jobs worldwide, a news report
said. Japan's second- and third-largest securities companies also
announced big losses Thursday. Daiwa Securities Co. posted a group
net loss of 66.84 billion yen (dlrs 568 million) for the half-year,
compared to a net profit of 15.53 billion yen (dlrs 132 million)
last year. Nikko Securities, Co. suffered a group net less of 57.72
billion yen (dlrs 491 million) compared to a net profit of 283
million yen (dlrs 2.4 million) a year earlier.

	   LONDON (AP) _ The Central Bank of Russia must avoid sharp
fluctuations in the ruble and tighten supervision of the country's
banks to stabilize the economy and restore public trust, its
chairman said Thursday. Victor Gerashchenko said Russia's foreign
exchange market has been restructured to try to control the
exchange rate. One strategy involves requiring exporters to sell a
proportion of their foreign exchange earnings, he told potential
investors at the Moscow International Business Association
conference. The conference is seeking to interest foreign
businesses in more than 200 investment opportunities in the Russian
capital. Russia's banks also are being restructured by being
divided into four categories, depending on their level of solvency,
Gerashchenko said. Most will get varying degrees of restructuring
help from the central bank, with some being put out of business, he
said. (BRITAIN-RUSSIA-GERASHCHENKO)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. and Seagram Co. are
talking again about a sale of PolyGram's film library to MGM,
according to a source close to the negotiations. Seagram, the owner
of Universal Studios, wants to sell PolyGram's film division to pay
for its dlrs 10.4 billion purchase of the Dutch entertainment group
and was reportedly near a deal to sell the library to MGM for dlrs
400 million. Those talks broke off talks nearly two weeks ago amid
differences over price and which assets would be included in the
sale. But they have restarted and the two sides are trying to
determine how to structure the deal, the source said Wednesday on
condition of anonymity. PolyGram's library has 1,500 films,
including ``Dead Man Walking'' and ``When Harry Met Sally,'' as
well as television programming. It was unclear if Seagram had
lowered its asking price for the library. Officials from MGM,
Seagram and PolyGram declined to comment on the resumed talks,
which were first reported Wednesday in Daily Variety and the Los
Angeles Times. (US-SEAGRAM-POLYGRAM)
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Daimler-Benz chief Juergen Schrempp
expects the automobile industry to encounter a recession, possibly
soon, a German business magazine reported Thursday. Manager Magazin
cited Schrempp as its manager of the year in the November issue for
pulling off the megamerger of the German industrial giant with the
U.S. automaker Chrysler. The deal is expected to be final by the
end of the year. In an advance copy of the interview, Manager
Magazin quoted Schrempp as saying he expects the ``dramatic
concentration process'' resulting from mergers in the auto industry
to continue, and that he wanted to be part of the that. Schrempp
said that he would like to increase significantly Chrysler's
position in Europe, with Asia as second priority, according to the
report. (GERMANY-DAIMLER CHIEF)

Vietnam's oldest person dies at age 118
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Le Thi Co, believed to be the oldest
person in Vietnam and one of the oldest in the world, has died at
age 118, local newspapers reported Thursday.
	   Co died Wednesday at her home in suburban Ho Chi Minh City, the
newspaper Liberated Saigon said. Funeral services are to be held
next Tuesday.
	   The reports did not specify the cause of death.
	   When she visited a hospital last month for the first time ever,
doctors found that Co's inner organs were in the wrong places _
heart and spleen on the right, liver and stomach on the left. Her
hospital visit was for a lung infection, and she had herself
released shortly afterward.
	   Identity papers dating back to the French occupation of Vietnam
say Co was born in 1880. She was married at age 19 and had 12
children who survived birth, seven of whom are still alive.
	   Her extended clan consists of more than 500 people, with 300
expected to attend her funeral.
	   Co's 10th child, Pham Van Lo, was quoted as telling the Vietnam
News Service that as recently as five years ago, her mother still
made her own food and carried her own water to cook.

D'Alema urges lawmakers for support to give Italy stability
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VANIA GRANDI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ A day after taking office, Premier Massimo D'Alema
urged lawmakers Thursday to support his center-left government in a
planned vote of confidence to give Italy stability and see it
through the launch of Europe's single currency.
	   The required vote of confidence is expected Friday, at the end
of parliamentary debate.
	   D'Alema was sworn in Wednesday, along with a Cabinet composed of
centrist and leftist forces which includes the first Communist
minister in half a century. It is Italy's 56th government since
World War II.
	   A former Communist, D'Alema outlined a program based on
continuing the strict economic policies carried out by his
predecessor, Romano Prodi, which allowed Italy to qualify for the
European Monetary Union.
	   ``This country has lived very difficult moments in recent
days,'' D'Alema said in his address to the Chamber of Deputies, the
lower house of Parliament. ``The crisis which provoked Prodi's fall
abruptly ended the work of a government which acted on behalf of
Italy's best interests.''
	   The new premier asked Carlo Azeglio Ciampi to stay on as
treasury and budget minister to help guide Italy through the Jan. 1
launch of the euro.
	   D'Alema said passing the 1999 deficit-cutting budget would be
the government's priority. He also said he aimed to stimulate
economic growth, develop the lesser developed south and create
jobs.
	   ``Only the center-left knows how to balance competition with
equality,'' said D'Alema.
	   D'Alema said he would honor Italy's commitments to international
organization such as NATO and the United Nations.
	   The NATO issue has been in the forefront because the new
government includes two ministers from a far-left party that is
opposed to NATO in general and any intervention in Kosovo.
	   Prodi resigned Oct. 9 after the hard-line Communist Refoundation
party refused to back him in a confidence vote brought on by a
dispute over the budget. Refoundation splintered as a result and
one faction, now called the Italian Communists, is now part of
D'Alema's government.

Prime minister's daughter lashes out against anti-gay group
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALVIN UNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The daughter of Malaysia's prime
minister on Thursday condemned the launch of the country's first
anti-homosexual movement, warning that it could spur violence
against the nation's gay community.
	   Marina Mahathir, daughter of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad,
said such ``hate campaigns'' would further inflame harassment and
prejudice against citizens who have been ostracized due to their
sexual orientation.
	   ``We are particularly alarmed to note that Pasrah's stated
intention is to wipe out homosexuals,'' Ms. Mahathir, who is also
president of the Malaysian AIDS Council, said in a statement.
	   The formation Wednesday of the People's Voluntary
Anti-Homosexual Movement, or Pasrah, followed a series of sodomy
charges against ousted deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim, who
faces trial Nov. 2.
	   Mahathir sacked Anwar as his deputy and finance minister on
Sept. 2, calling him ``immoral'' and unfit to rule Muslim-dominated
Malaysia, where homosexual acts are banned. Anwar has called the
charges false and politically motivated.
	   The leaders of Pasrah, many of whom appear to be Mahathir
supporters, have demanded stiffer legislation against
homosexuality.
	   ``Sodomy is absolutely despicable,'' said the group's deputy
chairman, Tamrin Tun Ghafar. ``The people of Malaysia must be
shielded from such a disgusting practice.''
	   To stamp out homosexuality, the fledgling committee of lawyers,
teachers and businessmen said they would call for the government to
crack down on transvestites, gays and lesbians found loitering in
public places.
	   They also plan to mobilize volunteer groups to counter
homosexuality through road rallies and religious speeches. Other
plans include supervising the construction of boys' toilets in
boarding schools to prevent them from having sex with other boys.
	   Elizabeth Wong, a spokeswoman for human rights group Suaram,
called the group's efforts ``a misguided form of political support
for the prime minister in the midst of his current political
crisis.''
	   Ms. Mahathir also denounced Pasrah's efforts as chicanery.
	   ``Although we are not advocating homosexuality as a way of
life,'' she said, ``campaigns to condemn and discriminate against
particular groups of people have never been shown to bring any
benefit.''

Greek, Russian foreign ministers discuss Kosovo, Cyprus
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS, UPDATES with Ivanov's comments on Kosovo. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's foreign minister on Thursday warned
separatists in Kosovo not to attack Yugoslav troops, saying it
could undermine a fragile cease-fire.
	   Igor Ivanov, the Russian minister made his comment following a
meeting with his Greek counterpart Theodoros Pangalos.
	   Despite a cease-fire reached 10 days ago, there have been
scattered reports of shelling and shooting in the separatist
province of Serbia.
	   ``I would like to remind you of the fact that Resolution No.
1199 passed by the U.N. Security Council applies in full both to
Belgrade and the Albanians,'' Ivanov said, referring to a
resolution designed to end the Kosovo crisis.
	   Russia opposes proposed NATO airstrikes on the Yugoslav
province. Pangalos has said Western powers have blown the conflict
out of proportion and warned that airstrikes would cause serious
problems for the whole Balkan peninsula.
	   Pangalos and Ivanov also discussed the divided island of Cyprus
during their Thursday meeting and were to sign cooperation
agreements, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   The Russian Foreign Ministry has said that Pangalos' talks would
not address military cooperation between Russia and Greece.
	   Russia has delayed the delivery of S-300 anti-aircraft missiles
to the Greek Cypriots for several months following warnings from
Turkey that the move would escalate tensions. Cyprus, an
independent country, has been divided into ethnic Greek and ethnic
Turkish sectors for almost a quarter-century.
	   Pangalos plans to stay in Moscow through Friday.

Russian Prime Minister supports ban on import of foreign alcohol
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov voiced support
Thursday for a proposal to temporarily ban imports of foreign
alcohol, a news agency reported.
	   The initiative, proposed by Trade Minister Georgy Gabunia at a
Cabinet session discussing alcohol regulation, would seek to limit
illegal alcohol imports to Russia, the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   The Russian government has said greater control over the alcohol
industry will be a crucial way of collecting more taxes. The
industry is rife with fake spirits and illegal imports, and profit
on about half of Russia's alcohol escapes tax officials each year.
	   Still, Primakov opposed a suggestion by Gabunia to allow only
one Russian company to carry out all import and export of alcohol.
``We cannot agree to that,'' he said, adding that stricter control
over trade would be sufficient.
	   Primakov also suggested ending all truck transport of alcohol
through Russia, limiting it to railroads instead, Interfax said.

Report: Charges to be pressed against Nigerian pipeline vandals

	   JESSE, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigeria's state petroleum corporation will
press charges against anyone implicated in vandalizing the gasoline
pipeline that erupted into an inferno over the weekend, a newspaper
report said Thursday.
	   Authorities have not said whether they intend to press charges
in the explosion and fire, which reportedly killed at least 700
people, but no arrests have been made.
	   The explosion occurred Saturday while up to 1,000 people were
trying to collect gasoline that was spilling from the damaged
government-owned pipeline.
	   ``Anyone implicated in the vandalisation of the oil pipeline
leading to last Saturday's fire tragedy is to be arraigned,''
Dalhatu Bayero, chief executive of the Nigeria National Petroleum
Corportation, told the Vanguard newspaper.
	   The article indicated that the state-owned company would press
charges against people implicated in initially opening the
pipeline, not the hundreds who later came to scoop up the gasoline.
	   Meanwhile, medical teams were being ferried to Jesse on Thursday
to help deal with the hundreds who were wounded in the inferno.
State radio said the death toll had reached 700 _ and local
officials expected it to go higher.
	   ``I'm afraid there could be 1,000'' dead, said J.I. Ogude, the
village chief of Jesse.
	   Concerned that many of the injured were refusing medical help
out of fear that they would be blamed for the explosion,
authorities sent a bell-ringing town crier to urge the injured to
go to hospitals.
	   The town crier was to tell people they would not be arrested and
to promise free medical treatment, officials said. But whether some
of those people could actually be arrested _ with the petroleum
company's announcement _ was not immediately clear.
	   One Red Cross health team already arrived in Jesse, 300
kilometers (180 miles) southeast of Lagos, to assist hospitals
short on both medicines and physicians. Supplies began arriving
from the U.N. children's organization and Israeli doctors were also
flying in.
	   Counting the dead as well as the injured remained a frustrating
task. Many people were burying their family members secretly,
fearing the possibility of arrest for either causing the fire or
for scavenging gas.
	   It remains unclear what caused the explosion. Government
officials have said they believe scavengers' tools set it off,
while some news reports have blamed a lit cigarette.
	   Red Cross medical worker Collins Ezewu said his team was trying
to help treat the wounded in hospitals and convince those suffering
at home to seek professional care.
	   Some of the injured were being treated at home, without benefit
of medicine or painkillers.
	   Many people in this farming community refused to talk to
reporters and fled when strangers stopped at their homes. Those
that would talk denied involvement in the scavenging.
	   ``I did not go to take petrol,'' said Samuel Aminone, who has
burns over 60 percent of his body and was being comforted by nurses
at Eku General Hospital. He said he was searching for his sister _
who died in the explosion _ when the blast occurred.
	   At least 400 people have been buried in mass graves dug about
100 yards from the blast scene, authorities said.
	   Firefighters have stopped battling the flames, and were waiting
nearby for the thousands of gallons of fuel to burn out in the
Jesse section of the pipeline. The entire pipeline runs about 600
kilometers (380 miles), from the southeastern city of Warri to the
northern city of Kano.
	   For the poverty-stricken people of the Niger River delta region,
the spilling gas appeared a chance for quick profits.
	   Despite being the world's sixth-largest oil producer, Nigeria
remains a fuel-starved country and its petroleum industry is
hobbled by corruption and mismanagement. Refineries are in
desperate need of repair, black-market gasoline is often marked up
1,000 percent. Lines at gas pumps can last for days.

Thailand's combat readiness declining, top officer says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Budget constraints brought on by
Thailand's economic crisis will continue to erode the military's
combat readiness unless serious measures are taken, the supreme
commander of the armed forces said Thursday.
	   ``If the crisis keeps on its current course, our combat
readiness will continue to decline,'' said Gen. Mongkol
Ampornpisit. ``We have to find ways to cope with the situation.''
	   At a news conference following a meeting with commanders from
all the armed forces and the head of the national police, Mongkol
also said, ``The military must share the burden alongside the
people in the midst of this crisis.''
	   Most of the army's motor vehicles have reportedly been
mothballed to save on fuel expenses, and soldiers have been
encouraged to grow their own food on their bases.
	   Mongkol suggested one way the military could save money is by
refurbishing old equipment.
	   Mongkol also vowed to keep the military out of politics and told
reporters that it will not be a tool for any political parties.
	   Gen. Sorayudh Julanont, the recently installed commander of the
army _ the country's most powerful military leader _ has taken a
strong stand that he will reform the army and keep it out of
politics, in which it has traditionally had a strong influence.

Floods hit thousands of struck by famine in south Sudan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS graf 5 figure of 120 per day sted per week as WFP
erroneously supplied &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Heavy rains in war-ravaged southern Sudan
have flooded homes and crops in low-lying areas, endangering more
than 120,000 people already suffering from famine, the U.N. said
Thursday.
	   The U.N. World Food Program said flooding in three areas of
southern Sudan has destroyed crops and dealt another blow to
thousands already in the grip of famine caused by the 15-year civil
war.
	   WFP spokeswoman Lindsey Davies said Ajiep and Panthau in the
western Bahr-el Ghazal region were among the heavily flooded areas.
	   ``This was the epicenter of the (famine) crisis. People there
are extremely vulnerable and weak,'' Davies said. ``Although we
were beginning to see small signs of improvement, with this recent
flooding, they are back to square one.''
	   Six weeks ago, relief agencies had reported that the death rate
among famine victims had dropped from a peak of 120 deaths per day
in Ajiep to about eight, but since then there has been little
improvement, she said.
	   Davies said the majority of the 46,000 people in the area
already receiving food assistance from WFP had lost their meager
crops to the floods and were now moving to higher ground.
	   Another 80,000 people were also affected by heavy rains in Bor
County in the Jonglei region in southeastern Sudan.
	   Aerial surveillance missions have ascertained that 70 percent of
the crops appear to have been damaged or destroyed and most people
were now moving eastward to highlands, Davies said.
	   She said renewed fighting between Sudan People's Liberation Army
rebels and government forces in the area has made the situation
worse.
	   ``There is a lot of insecurity in that area, and it is more
difficult for these people to find safe havens,'' she said.
	   In the Upper Nile region north of Jonglei, traditionally an
agricultural surplus area, floods have caused a 50 percent crop
loss, Davies said.
	   More than 1.5 million people have died in fighting and
war-induced famine in the 15-year civil war between rebels in the
mostly Christian and animist south and government troops from the
Muslim, Arabicized north.

Russian official: IMF wants to see long-term economic plan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with report banks need 61 billion rubles to overcome
crisis, Gerashchenko comments on ruble rate, Zadornov on foreign
debt. &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A visiting International Monetary Fund teams wants
to see a long-term economic recovery plan from Russia, but the
country doesn't have one and is therefore unlikely to get new loan
installments soon, a senior Russia official said Thursday.
	   The government has spent this week working on a budget plan for
the final three months of the year, and more extended forecasts are
still in the making, Deputy Finance Minister Oleg Vyugin said in an
interview published in the daily liberal Vremya (Time).
	   The IMF, meanwhile, has been asking to see the government's plan
through the end of 1999, Vyugin said.
	   ``There is no official budget plan for next year, and that will
complicate our talks with the IMF,'' Vyugin said. ``We can't offer
them any document. To speak the truth, we don't even have a final
version for ourselves (in the Finance Ministry).''
	   The IMF organized a dlrs 22.6 billion bailout package with
Russia in July, a month before the country's economic crisis hit
with full force. Russia received the first installment of dlrs 4.8
billion, but the IMF has frozen additional money.
	   In the meantime, the Russian government is scrambling to come up
with money to pay its bill.
	   The government plans to spend 130 billion rubles (dlrs 7.6
billion) in the final three months of the year, but expects
revenues of only around 70 billion rubles (dlrs 4.1 billion),
officials said earlier this week.
	   Meanwhile, the chairman of the Central Bank said he was trying
to prevent sharp fluctuations in the ruble's exchange rate and
tighten supervision of commercial banks to stabilize the economy
and restore public trust.
	   ``It is important to mitigate panic-driven demand for foreign
currency,'' Viktor Gerashchenko told a meeting of potential
investors in London.
	   The ruble has plummeted to about 17 to the U.S. dollar, from its
pre-crisis level of 6 to the dollar. In the early weeks of the
crisis there was especially high demand for U.S. dollars and other
foreign currency, which soon became scarce.
	   A first deputy chairman of the central bank said at least 61
billion rubles (dlrs 3.6 billion) is needed to restructure Russia's
commercial banking system which was all but paralyzed by the
financial crisis.
	   ``The Russian banking system will need long-term support to cope
with the amassed problems,'' Andrei Kozlov told parliament's
finance committee.
	   The government has said that if it does not receive foreign
help, it will have to make up most of the shortfall by printing
money, a move that would drive inflation higher.
	   ``If they come (foreign lenders), we will have to print less
money to cover the deficit,'' Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov
told reporters Thursday.
	   Zadornov also reiterated the government would not default on its
debts to other countries and international lenders. He said he
expected Russia to pay about dlrs 2 billion on its debts in the
fourth quarter of this year.

Swiss government eyes shutting down nuclear power plants
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ The Swiss government Thursday announced
that it is planning the country's eventual exit from nuclear power.
	   But environmental campaigners criticized the lack of a timeframe
for closing the country's four nuclear power plants.
	   Government officials will work with representatives of the power
industry, environmental groups and local governments to discuss a
timetable and removal of nuclear waste, a government statement
said. It is ``unrealistic'' to build more power stations because of
environmental concerns, the government has said.
	   Should the discussions between concerned parties fail to produce
an agreed timetable, the federal cabinet will make the decision,
said the statement.
	   ``We have set out on a new course,'' said Federal Energy
Minister Moritz Leuenberger. ``Details have yet to be decided.''
	   However, the government also announced that in the meantime, it
is authorizing an overall 15 percent rise in the output of
Switzerland's Leibstadt nuclear power station and lengthening the
service of the country's Muehleberg atomic power plant by 10 years
to 2012.
	   The management of the Leibstadt station welcomed the decision,
but environmental group Greenpeace and Switzerland's Green Party
branded it scandalous. Greenpeace criticized the government for not
setting a firm timetable for closures, saying it was using the
announcement to avoid making any ``real decision.''
	   In a related move, the federal cabinet ordered energy officials
to draw up a discussion paper on changing laws governing the
domestic electricity market.
	   The government envisages the creation of a national company to
own the power infrastructure.
	   A timeframe for carrying out liberalization of the electricity
market itself remains to be determined, the cabinet said.
	   The cabinet said it wants to support hydroelectric plants. It
ordered a study of the possibility of tax breaks for hydroelectric
plants and how to encourage upgrades of those plants.

Gerashchenko: Russia has to avoid sharp currency fluctuations

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Central Bank of Russia must avoid sharp
fluctuations in the ruble and tighten supervision of the country's
banks to stabilize the economy and restore public trust, its
chairman said Thursday.
	   Victor Gerashchenko said Russia's foreign exchange market has
been restructured to try to control the exchange rate.
	   One strategy involves requiring exporters to sell a proportion
of their foreign exchange earnings, he told potential investors at
the Moscow International Business Association conference
	   The conference is seeking to interest foreign businesses in more
than 200 investment opportunities in the Russian capital.
	   ``It is important to mitigate panic-driven demand for foreign
currency,'' Gerashchenko told his audience.
	   Russia's banks also are being restructured by being divided into
four categories, depending on their level of solvency, Gerashchenko
said. Most will get varying degrees of restructuring help from the
central bank, with some being put out of business, he said.
	   It is critical, he said, that basic banking services be
available to people in every region of the country.
	   Gerashchenko, who became head of the central bank earlier this
year, said foreign investment also is critical in the ongoing
revitalization of the the country's economy.

Despite mounting pressure, Germany's bankers leave interest rates
</HEADLINE>
unchanged &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Germany's central bank, the
Bundesbank, left key interest rates unchanged Thursday, despite
growing international and domestic pressure to cut rates to aid
flagging growth.
	   In a widely expected move, a regular meeting of the central
bank's council reconfirmed the country's key rate at 3.3 percent.
The rate has held steady since October 1997.
	   Germany's interest rates are already among the lowest in the
world, but two recent rate cuts in the United States have increased
pressure on the Bundesbank to follow suit.
	   Germany's central bankers, who fiercely guard the independence
of their respected institution, say a rate cut will only be made if
Europe's economy needs it.
	   Recently, some senior members of the bank have indicated they
believe a cut may be possible, but it's believed unlikely to happen
at least until Europe launches its common currency, the euro, on
Jan. 1.
	   Politically, pressure is growing on the bank to cut rates too.
Finance minister-designate Oskar Lafontaine and incoming Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder have both said they consider a rate cut
desirable.
	   Germany's growth this year is likely to be about 2.6 percent.
	   Growth in the European Union will amount to 2.9 percent in 1998,
the European Commission, executive arm of the EU, said Wednesday.
	   As Europe's most powerful economy, rate cuts in Germany could
trigger cuts elsewhere in the European Union.

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ The designated chairman of the Christian
Democrats on Thursday nominated outgoing Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
environment minister for the job of party general secretary.
	   Angela Merkel, 44, is head of the Christian Democrats in the
eastern Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania state, and would be the first
former East German to hold the key party post.
	   Wolfgang Schaeuble, whom Kohl has designated as his successor,
made the nomination during a meeting of the party's steering
committee. Kohl announced he would step down as party chief after
25 years following last month's election loss to the Social
Democrats.
	   The party will vote on both the Schaeuble and Merkel
appointments during its congress Nov. 7. Both were sure to be
confirmed.
	   Merkel would replace Peter Hintze, who ran the party's campaign
and also announced after the election that he would step down.
	   The steering committee also decided that outgoing Transport
Minister Matthias Wissmann would be in charge of party finances.
Party members were to decide later on who would be named to the
four posts of vice chairman.

Marine charged with murder in death of fellow Marine

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A U.S. Marine was charged with murder Thursday in
the bludgeoning death of another Marine on the southern Japanese
island of Okinawa.
	   Lance Cpl. Brian C. Gordon, 21, of West Palmetto, Florida, will
face an Article 32 hearing, the military equivalent of a civilian
grand jury, on Nov. 4 in the death of Lance Cpl. Irvin Harper, said
Marine spokesman Maj. Dan Ryan.
	   Gordon, a heavy equipment mechanic, is accused of hitting Harper
with a metal pipe on the back of the head following a fight outside
Camp Foster on Sept. 18, according to a preliminary military
investigation.
	   The hearing will decide the next action against Gordon, which
could result in a court-martial.
	   Gordon, who was arrested Sept. 19, is now being held in military
detention at Camp Hansen. He has not entered a plea and will not be
required to enter one at the hearing.
	   Harper, a switch operator from Parker, Arizona, was pronounced
dead Sept. 22 at a naval hospital. He died of massive head
injuries, Ryan said.

EU envoy, Albanian leader call for halt to guerrilla attacks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A European envoy to Kosovo said
Thursday that attacks by Albanian separatist guerrillas could put
efforts to reach a peaceful political solution in ``serious
jeopardy.''
	   Wolgang Petrisch, the Austrian ambassador in Yugoslavia and
European Union envoy to Kosovo, said after meeting with ethnic
Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova that the war-torn Serbian province
had a ``historic chance'' to solve its problems peacefully.
	   Violence in some regions of Kosovo increased last weekend and
earlier this week, with the guerrilla Kosovo Liberation Army blamed
for several attacks, including one that killed three Serb
policemen.
	   ``We ... ask Kosovo people and especially the armed forces,
Kosovo forces, to stop any provocations as they happened over the
last weekend as this puts in serious jeopardy the political process
that is now under way and the historic chance for Kosovo to ...
establish its self-rule and finally come to a political settlement,
to a peaceful settlement,'' Petrisch said.
	   Rugova, who distances himself from the KLA, also called for a
halt to the guerrilla attacks.
	   ``We urge also all groups of people to demonstrate
self-restraint so any act of theirs is not used as a provocation,
namely as a pretext for new assaults on Kosovo,'' he said.
	   Serb police and Yugoslav forces have continued shelling in some
areas and maintain a heavy presence, with tanks and other armored
vehicles, along the former front line of fighting.

Russian government again denies involvement in Iraqi gyroscope
</HEADLINE>
deal &QL; 
 &UR; By NICK WADHAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government was never involved in the
delivery of hundreds of high-tech missile homing systems to Iraq,
and continues to obey U.N. sanctions against the country, a top
official said Thursday.
	   ``The question is closed,'' said Foreign Ministry spokesman
Vladimir Rakhmanin, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
``Russia was and remains loyal to international norms of
nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery
systems.''
	   Rakhmanin was responding to a recent report in The Washington
Post that said the Russian government probably took part in the
1995 sale of missile homing devices, or gyroscopes, to Iraq, even
though such sales would defy U.N. sanctions.
	   The sanctions were imposed following Iraq's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait, which touched off the Gulf War.
	   Russia repeatedly denied the gyroscope deal when it came to
light more than two years ago. Initially, officials blamed other
former Soviet republics, but then claimed the equipment had come
from Russia without government knowledge.
	   The gyroscope story was first reported after U.N. weapons
inspectors pulled 10 gyroscopes from the Tigris River near the
Iraqi capital of Baghdad in 1995 after acting on a tip. A shipment
of gyroscopes from Russia was later intercepted by Jordanian
authorities.
	   The Russian government investigated the sales, in which The
Washington Post said Iraqi missile specialists met with top Russian
military leaders to purchase more than 800 gyroscopes.
	   But the investigators never brought any charges at the military
plant that some westerners claim later sold the sophisticated
devices to a Palestinian middleman working for Iraq.
	   The government's conclusion now is shared by the United Nations,
and ``there have been no further inquiries'' from the body,
Rakhmanin said.
	   There were ``no deliveries along government channels,'' he
repeated.
	   The gyroscopes were part of the guidance systems for the SS-18
intercontinental ballistic missiles, The Washington Post reported.
The SS-18 is supposed to be dismantled under the 1993 Strategic
Arms Reduction Treaty, which Russia's parliament has yet to ratify.
	   Western countries have criticized Russia for selling weapons and
nuclear technology to some of the world's most troubled areas, but
the sales infuse much-needed cash into the country's ailing
economy.
	   Russia also says the nuclear technology it has sold to India and
Iran serve only peaceful purposes.

Guinea-Bissau rebels demand more than president's offer of new
</HEADLINE>
cease-fire &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Rebels in Guinea-Bissau say they want
more concessions than the government's unilateral cease-fire
declaration before entering into proposed peace talks in this small
west African nation.
	   President Joao Bernardo Vieira said in a radio broadcast
Wednesday that he had ordered government forces to stop firing and
that he was ready to meet with rebel chief Brig. Ansumane Mane.
	   ``We have no solid reasons to believe'' in the announcement,
rebel spokesman Silvestre Alves said on Portuguese state radio
Antena 1.
	   ``Vieira took a step forward but he has to go further'' toward
meeting rebel conditions for a peace pact, Alves said.
	   The rebels' top demands is the withdrawal of Senegalese troops
from the former Portuguese colony. The Senegalese forces have been
crucial in buttressing Vieira's rule against the rebellion by most
of his own army.
	   Sporadic automatic weapons fire could be heard in the capital,
Bissau, at dawn Thursday after a quiet night, the Portuguese news
agency Lusa reported.
	   The insurgents have held the main army garrison and airport in
the western outskirts of Bissau for almost five months.
	   The breakaway military faction, mostly army veterans angered by
poor pay and conditions, controls most of the country after seizing
the second-largest city Bafata on Wednesday.
	   The fighting reignited Sunday after a three-month truce,
creating a new wave of displaced people.
	   The Red Cross said thousands of people were streaming along
roads out of the capital, which had a population of 300,000 before
the fighting.
	   The military rebellion started June 7, following Mane's
dismissal as the military chief of staff after being accused of
running guns to Senegal's Casamance separatists.
	   Mane said Vieira was running the arms scam and accused him of
corruption.
	   The foes had entered a cease-fire July 26. The mediators, west
African and Portuguese-speaking countries, discussed the deployment
of a peacekeeping force and military observers, but no deal was
reached.

Japan's Nomura reports huge loss
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with figures, comments on Russian losses, grafs 4-8 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's biggest brokerage, Nomura Securities Co.,
said Thursday it lost dlrs 1.76 billion in the first half of fiscal
1998 as global financial turmoil took a toll, especially on its
overseas operations.
	   Two other Japanese brokerages also reported losses, although on
a smaller scale than Nomura's.
	   Nomura posted a group loss of 207.2 billion yen (dlrs 1.76
billion) for the half year ended Sept. 30, compared to a net profit
of 49.71 billion yen (dlrs 422 million) in the same period a year
earlier.
	   A Nomura official told reporters the company lost about dlrs 600
million on Russian bonds and another dlrs 600 million on U.S.
mortgage-backed securities.
	   The parent company also had a 33.72 billion yen (dlrs 288
million) valuation loss on its domestic securities holdings for the
six months.
	   Although Nomura expects no further losses from the Russian
market, the official said the outlook for U.S. mortgage-backed
securities is ``severe,'' and Nomura hopes for an orderly reduction
of its assets in this sector.
	   Nomura announced a restructuring plan intended to cut costs at
its overseas operations by 20 percent. It also plans to inject dlrs
1.2 billion in capital into its U.S. unit, Nomura America Holding
Inc.
	   This injection ``shows Nomura's clear commitment to the U.S.,''
said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   The losses will prompt Nomura to cut between 1,000 and 2,000
jobs worldwide, a news report said.
	   The cuts will include layoffs at Nomura's U.S. and British
subsidiaries, according to Kyodo News service. In Japan, Nomura cut
as many as 1,000 jobs from a work force of 10,000 by freezing new
hiring and encouraging some employees to retire early, the report
said.
	   Japan's second- and third-largest securities companies also
announced big losses Thursday.
	   Daiwa Securities Co. posted a group net loss of 66.84 billion
yen (dlrs 568 million) for the half-year, compared to a net profit
of 15.53 billion yen (dlrs 132 million) last year.
	   Nikko Securities, Co. suffered a group net less of 57.72 billion
yen (dlrs 491 million) compared to a net profit of 283 million yen
(dlrs 2.4 million) a year earlier.

More than 2 million amphetamine tablets seized in Myanmar last
</HEADLINE>
month &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Officials seized more than 2 million
amphetamine tablets and more than 1,600 kilograms (3,520 pounds) of
other drugs in Myanmar in September, state-run newspapers reported
Thursday.
	   The large quantity of amphetamines seized reflects the
burgeoning production of the drug, most of which is apparently
exported to neighboring Thailand.
	   In August, narcotics police seized 5 million methamphetamine
tablets in a truck coming from the Golden Triangle region, the
largest shipment of the drug ever seized in Myanmar, official
reports said.
	   Narcotics rings in the Golden Triangle _ where the borders of
Myanmar, Laos and Thailand converge _ traditionally have made and
smuggled heroin, but have turned to easier-to-make amphetamines as
a side business.
	   The final destination of the August shipment _ five times larger
than the previous record haul seized in June _ was unknown. The
drug has become a scourge in neighboring countries in recent years
and, increasingly, in Myanmar, also known as Burma.
	   Last month, police, military and customs officials seized
2,108,748 stimulant tablets, 292 kilograms (642 pounds) of opium,
25 kilograms (55 pounds) of heroin, 37 kilograms (81 pounds) of
marijuana, 499 kilograms (1,098 pounds) of ephedrine and nearly
4,000 gallons (15,200 liters) of precursor chemicals, the state
press reported.
	   Altogether 366 people were charged in 251 drug-related cases,
including 51 people for failure to register as a drug addict, the
report added.
	   Myanmar has about 60,000 registered drug addicts.

Turkmen president invites Shell to participate in gas development
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ASHGABAT, Turkmenistan (AP) _ President Saparmurat Niyazov
invited Royal Dutch Shell on Thursday to take part in the
development of gas fields in the Central Asian country.
	   Henk Deygraaf, chief of the Anglo-Dutch oil giant, met with
Niyazov on Thursday to present results of a Shell evaluation of two
possible routes for exporting Turkmen gas _ across the Caspian Sea
or through Iran. Both would go through Turkey and on to Europe.
	   Both routes were feasible, and the choice must be made by the
Turkmen government, Deygraaf told reporters after the meeting.
	   The United States favors the route across the Caspian Sea
because it considers Iran unreliable.

Turkey asks Russia to extradite Kurdish rebel leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz on Thursday
urged Russia to extradite a rebel Kurdish leader who reportedly
left Syria after Turkey struck a deal with Damascus to clamp down
on his rebel organization.
	   ``It has been confirmed that the head of the separatist
organization is in Russia and the necessary steps have been taken
on the issue,'' Yilmaz told a news conference.
	   ``I hope that Russia will prevent the separatist organization's
leader from commanding terrorist activists from its territory
against our country and will return this person to us,'' he said.
	   Russia has denied that Ocalan entered the country.
	   Turkish newspapers claimed Ocalan was in hiding in a suburb,
some 30 kilometers (18 miles) west of Moscow. Ocalan himself
claimed in a press statement earlier in the week that he was
somewhere in Kurdistan, a region that stretches over parts of
Turkey, Iraq, Iran and Syria.
	   Ocalan's PKK has been fighting for autonomy since 1984. The war
has claimed 37,000 lives.

China says military ties with Russia good for world peace
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Closer military relations between Russia and
China serve regional and world peace, China's defense minister was
quoted as telling his visiting Russian counterpart Thursday.
	   The two defense ministers, China's Chi Haotian and Russia's Igor
Sergeyev, reviewed a military honor guard before starting a day of
talks, Chinese state-run television reported.
	   China Central Television did not provide details of the meeting
but said Chi noted that closer ties between the once hostile
militaries followed improving diplomatic ties and would benefit
peace and stability.
	   Although once fierce rivals for the allegiances of the communist
world, China and the then-Soviet Union began repairing relations a
decade ago. Annual summits between the Russian and Chinese
presidents, Boris Yeltsin and Jiang Zemin, started in 1994, and
Jiang is due to visit Russia before the year's end.
	   Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang Guoqiang expected
Jiang's trip to further boost ties that have ``developed smoothly
in all fields.''
	   Tang defended increased military exchanges but added that ``this
kind of cooperation is not directed against any third country.''
	   China has used the warming ties and Russia's relative penury to
purchase arms and military technology for the large but low-tech
Chinese army. Russia's Itar-Tass news agency estimates that China
bought dlrs 6 billion worth of Russian weapons between 1991 and
1997, including 74 Su-27 fighter jets and two Sovremenny
destroyers.
	   Russian Defense Minister Sergeyev was due to meet with President
Jiang and address China's National Defense University.

More than 800 on death row in Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's justice minister said Thursday there are
839 prisoners on death row in the country.
	   Russia promised to abolish the death penalty when it joined the
Council of Europe in 1996, but has not yet done so. The courts
continue to hand down death sentences, although none has been
carried out for about two years.
	   Justice Minister Pavel Krasheninnikov also said there are 15,000
foreigners in Russian prisons, the Interfax news agency reported.
Most are citizens of other former Soviet republics.
	   He said the government can afford to spend only 67 kopeks (about
4 cents) a day to feed prisoners. Conditions in Russia's
overcrowded prisons are abysmal, and disease, especially
tuberculosis, is rife, human rights groups say.
	   Camps for prisoners suffering from TB are overcrowded,
Krasheninnikov said. The number of HIV-infected prisoners has
soared to about 2,000, he said.
	   Russia has one of the highest incarceration rates in the world.
More than 1 million people are held in prisons and other
facilities.

Thatcher free Pinochet appeal angers left-wing lawmakers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MAUREEN JOHNSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ An appeal Thursday by Margaret Thatcher for the
release of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, Chile's former dictator under
arrest in London, angered left-wing lawmakers, underlining a
political dilemma for the Labor Party government.
	   Lady Thatcher, Conservative prime minister from 1979-1990, said
Pinochet should be returned home forthwith both because he
supported Britain during the 1982 war against Argentina to reclaim
the Falkland Islands and because his arrest endangers Chile's new
democracy.
	   ``There were indeed abuses of human rights in Chile and acts of
violence on both sides of the political divide,'' Lady Thatcher
wrote in a letter to The Times of London. ``However, the people of
Chile, through successively elected democratic governments, have
determined how they should come to terms with their past.''
	   Pinochet, 82, remains under police guard in the expensive London
clinic where he was arrested Oct. 16 at the instigation of a
Spanish magistrate.
	   The judge is seeking to extradite him on charges of murder,
genocide and torture pertaining to 4,000 people, including
Spaniards, who were killed or disappeared during his 17-year rule.
	   Pinochet, who had back surgery Oct. 9, remained commander of
Chile's army until March.
	   The crisis has soured British and Spanish relations with Chile
and pushed Chile's government into defending Pinochet on the
grounds that the arrest is straining a democracy built up since
Pinochet stood down in 1990.
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair insists the arrest is a legal, and not
political, matter. But a British Cabinet minister will have the
final say on extradition, and Labor legislators have hailed the
arrest while Conservatives accuse their rival party members of
``gesture'' politics.
	   Lady Thatcher, who entertained Pinochet in her home shortly
before he was hospitalized, noted that President Carlos Menem of
Argentina, which invaded the Falklands while under a military
dictatorship, is due on an official visit to Britain next week.
	   ``It would be disgraceful to preach reconciliation with one,
while maintaining under arrest someone who, during that same
conflict, did so much to save so many British lives,'' she wrote.
	   Ann Clwyd, a Labor legislator who heads Parliament's Human
Rights Group, said the former prime minister is discounting the
rule of law.
	   ``I am surprised to hear Lady Thatcher, who was always keen on
promoting the law, is actually suggesting that we should do
something which is illegal,'' said Ms. Clwyd, who supports an
attempt by Amnesty International to have Pinochet tried in Britain
if he escapes extradition.

Former Japan Highway official gets prison term for accepting
</HEADLINE>
bribes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A Japanese court sentenced a former senior official
of the state-run highway authority Thursday to two years in prison
for accepting 10.51 million yen (dlrs 89,220) in bribes from 12
companies.
	   The Tokyo District Court also ordered Nobuaki Mizukoshi, 45, a
former executive of Japan Highway Public Corp., to return the money
as a fine, said a court spokesman, speaking on the customary
condition of anonymity.
	   Presiding Judge Yukihiko Imasaki said it was a ``vicious
crime,'' in which Mizukoshi repeatedly used his position to request
bribes from the companies, including Omron Corp., a major Japanese
electronics company.
	   Mizukoshi took bribes in cash between April 1996 and February
this year in return for providing information on the highway
corporation's equipment purchase or construction plans, the judge
said.
	   Mizukoshi was arrested on March 3.
	   Twelve company officials involved in the bribery case were given
suspended prison terms.
	   The highway corporation builds and operates expressways
throughout Japan.

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Massimo D'Alema, a former communist who now leads
Italy's 56th postwar government, was steeped in Marxist dogma from
childhood.
	   When he was 13, his father Giuseppe D'Alema, a longtime
communist lawmaker, brought him to a party congress. Young D'Alema
gave flowers to Palmiro Togliatti, one of the founders of Italy's
Communist Party, and got a pat on the cheek in return.
	   Togliatti served as a Cabinet minister in 1947, the last time
the Communists were part of an Italian government.
	   D'Alema went on to carry the communist torch during student
protests of the 1960s and later filled various party positions,
before being elected to Italy's legislature.
	   After the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union, D'Alema helped
transform the West's largest communist party into a more moderate
group. The party changed its name in 1991 to the Democratic Party
of the Left, relegated the hammer-and-sickle to the edge of the new
party flag, and accepted privatization of state industry and other
free-market ideas.
	   The 49-year-old D'Alema, a pragmatist with a dry wit and sharp
tongue, is prone to unusually frank words for an Italian
politician. But he also has the diplomacy to iron out problems when
political backrooms get thick with tension, a trait that wins
praise even from rivals.
	   ``He has the tendency to know how to reconcile the
irreconcilable, to put together the devil and holy water,'' was the
recent assessment by Luciano Sardelli, a conservative who lost to
D'Alema in 1996 parliamentary elections in their district in
Gallipoli in southeastern Italy.
	   The key to D'Alema's success in forming a government lay in his
ability to get former Christian Democrats together with a group of
hard-liners who stuck to Marxism when the new leftist party was
formed.
	   He was called on to form a government after Premier Romano
Prodi's center-left government fell Oct. 9.
	   Born in Rome in 1949, D'Alema joined in the youth protests of
the late 60s while a philosophy student at Pisa University.
	   In 1975, party leader Enrico Berlinguer tapped the young D'Alema
to lead its youth federation, his first prominent party post.
	   From there, D'Alema's rise was steady. In 1986, he became part
of the secretariat and the next year was elected to his first seat
in the Chamber of Deputies.
	   He directed the party's newspaper, L'Unita, raising Marxist
eyebrows when he began publishing stock tables.
	   Though D'Alema led his party's transformation in 1991, he had
clearly discarded such Marxist precepts as class struggle and
revolution before that. He does believe in the welfare state, but
tempers his views with the knowledge that Italy can't afford it.
	   Re-elected to Parliament in 1992, he became the Democratic Party
of the Left's Chamber whip and two years later captured the party's
No. 1 post, secretary.
	   D'Alema's party has been loyal to NATO and backed Italy's
peacekeeping role in Albania and Bosnia, although his Cabinet
includes two Communists whose far-left party has opposed such
operations and have voted against NATO expansion.
	   A widower, he married Linda Giuva, who works in the state
archives. The couple has two children.
	   After politics, perhaps D'Alema's next passion is sailing his
52-foot (16-meter) boat Ikarus. Pasta and fish lunches at a seaside
trattoria have been a favorite setting for his political chats.

Robin Cook says government shouldn't intervene in Pinochet
</HEADLINE>
extradition &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook
said Thursday it would be wrong for his government to politically
intervene in the extradition of Gen. Augusto Pinochet.
	   Cook was responding to a call by former British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher to allow the former Chilean dictator to return
home. Pinochet supported Britain during the 1982 Falklands War
against Argentina.
	   He said Britain had received a request from a Spanish official
for Pinochet's extradition but ``it would be quite wrong for us to
seek to intervene in the due legal process under political or
diplomatic pressure.''
	   Cook was speaking to reporters in Bucharest on the last leg of
his tour of the Balkans.
	   ``I am sure that Lady Thatcher when she reflects upon it will
realize the great importance of Britain's constitution of having
courts that are free from influence,'' he said.
	   The foreign secretary, who has also visited Bulgaria and
Macedonia this week, has been trying to garner support among Balkan
leaders for an agreement the West hopes will end the conflict in
the restive Serbian province of Kosovo.
	   He praised Romania for its support of the West's position on the
crisis. Romania is an old ally of Serbia that is torn by its desire
to join NATO.
	   Last week Parliament voted to offer its airspace to the military
alliance in emergency situations if there are airstrikes against
Yugoslavia.

Taiwan navy launches patrol boat
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAOHSIUNG, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan's navy launched a third 500-ton
coastal patrol boat Thursday as part of a fleet modernization
program aimed at countering the threat of China's growing sea
power.
	   The Fengchiang, a Chinchiang class vessel, will guard fisheries
and patrol against smuggling, illegal immigration and infiltration
by Chinese agents, the navy said in a news release.
	   In the event of war, the vessel can lay mines, attack enemy
landing operations, protect ports, and aid in near-sea
anti-submarine warfare, the release said. It can also be fitted
with missile systems for ship-to-ship warfare, the navy said.
	   The ship, named after a river in northern Taiwan, was christened
at China Shipbuilding Corp.'s yard in the southern port city of
Kaohsiung.
	   The statement said the Chinchiang class combines high
performance with low maintenance, and can operate with much smaller
crews than similar ships _ an important feature for Taiwan's
manpower-strapped armed forces. Taiwan plans to build up to 12 of
the boats.
	   Despite a warming trend in relations between the sides, China's
continued threat of force against Taiwan _ backed up by its naval
upgrading program _ poses a threat to all its neighbors, the navy
said.
	   China has claimed Taiwan as a renegade province to be reunited
with the mainland by force if necessary since the Nationalists
retreated to the island amid civil war in 1949.
	   Along with the rest of the armed forces, Taiwan's navy is
undergoing a massive upgrade, allowing it to retire World War II
era Gearing class destroyers and other antiquated vessels.

Swazi king visits as Taiwan looks to buttress ties with allies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ King Mswati III of Swaziland arrived for a
state visit Thursday amid moves by Taiwan to safeguard ties with
its allies against renewed Chinese efforts to woo them away.
	   Accompanied by a delegation of economics officials and business
leaders, the king will meet with officials including Taiwan
President Lee Teng-hui before leaving for home Oct. 27, the Foreign
Ministry said.
	   His visit follows official warnings that the diplomatic war of
attrition between Taiwan and China will heat up again following a
recess during watershed meetings between negotiators in China last
week.
	   Diplomatic pressure from Beijing, which claims Taiwan as a
breakaway province, has reduced the island's diplomatic allies to
just 27, most of them poor nations in Africa, Central America and
the Caribbean. Taiwanese Foreign Minister Jason Hu warns that
China's goal is to win away all of those allies before the end of
the century.
	   Taiwan attempts to keep those countries close through aid and
investment. Central Bank Governor Perng Fai-nan flew to Argentina
Monday for talks on providing economic aid to Taiwan's crucial
Central American allies.

New German leader to skip WWI Armistice Day ceremonies in France
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with additional quotes and details, Queen Elizabeth to
attend, Kohl background; CLARIFIES dates of invitation; ADDS

 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC;

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany's new leader isn't going to World
War I Armistice Day events in France because of scheduling
problems, not because he wants to avoid the past, his spokesman
said Thursday.
	   Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder informed French President
Jacques Chirac ``in all friendliness'' that he could not attend the
Nov. 11 ceremony because his calendar was already full, said
spokesman Michael Juerdens.
	   ``He's in the middle of the very difficult process of assuming
office,'' Juerdens said. ``Chirac understands that taking over a
government isn't something one can do by-the-by.''
	   Schroeder and his new Cabinet are to be sworn in Oct. 27, and
intends to deliver his inauguration speech the week of Nov. 9.
	   Juerdens dismissed as ``rubbish'' and ``simply nonsense''
reports from Paris that quoted a French official as saying
Schroeder turned down the invitation because he wanted ``a new
face'' for Germany that wasn't tied to the past.
	   About 3.2 million French and German soldiers were among the 10
million killed during World War I, which ended with a truce on Nov.
11, 1918.
	   Chirac had initially planned a ceremony in the Ardennes on Nov.
8 to mark the 80th anniversary of the final battle between German
and French soldiers. That was dropped in favor of a commemoration
in Paris on Armistice Day itself.
	   Chirac's Nov. 11 ceremony will still go on, with Britain's Queen
Elizabeth coming.
	   But Schroeder's failure to accept is likely to be perceived as a
serious snub in France _ even though Paris was the first world
capital he visited after his Sept. 27 election.
	   While France and Germany have worked together to build a united
Europe, fears of German economic domination still haunt France.
	   Long-serving Chancellor Helmut Kohl made soothing French
concerns a priority, highlighted by his 1984 visit to a World War I
cemetery where he held hands with then-President Francois
Mitterand, symbolizing a coming to terms.
	   Schroeder, who has promised continuity in foreign policy, has
been on the road twice already _ to Paris and Washington _ and will
be at an informal European Union summit in Austria on Saturday.
	   His first trip as chancellor is scheduled Nov. 2 to London, and
Juerdens said he will visit Moscow on Nov. 16-17 to meet with
President Boris Yeltsin.
	   ``No topics in a broad sense have been established yet,'' he
said.

	   GENEVA (AP) _ North Korea's protest over planned U.S.-South
Korean military exercises hung over peace talks Thursday, but
negotiators claimed they achieved minor successes.
	   The four parties _ the two Koreas, China and the United States _
are still laying the groundwork for talks to reach a permanent
peace treaty for the Korean peninsula.
	   ``We had a constructive meeting, and I underline the word
`constructive,''' said Park Kun-woo, leader of the South Korean
delegation which is chairing the current round. But he gave no
details.
	   His North Korean counterpart, Vice Foreign Minister Kim Gye
Gwan, declined to comment, but heads of the U.S. and Chinese
delegations indicated the talks were advancing.
	   ``We've made quite a bit of progress in narrowing the
differences, but the North Korean position remains quite firm,''
said U.S. Ambassador-at-Large Charles Kartman.
	   Chinese Ambassador Qian Yong-nian said the four sides would
continue ``probing.''
	   The North's official Korean Central News Agency said U.S. and
South Korean officials were ``seriously provoking'' them by
scheduling the maneuvers to begin the day after the current round
of talks ends Sunday.
	   ``The war exercises are patent proof that the United States and
the South Korean authorities have no interest in discussing''
ensuring peace on the Korean peninsula, it said.
	   This year's maneuvers will be the 37th the two countries have
held since 1961. U.S. and South Korean officials termed them
``routine and defensive.''
	   Most of the exercises, involving the 650,000-strong South Korean
military and the 37,000 U.S. troops stationed there, will be held
well south of the border with the North, U.S. officials have said.
	   The border is the world's most heavily armed, with nearly 2
million troops deployed on both sides.
	   North and South Korea have been in a technical state of war
since the 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armistice, not a peace
treaty. The United States and China, the other two parties to the
talks, were the other main combatants in the war.
	   The remarks of the delegation chiefs confirmed that they still
are trying to resolve conflicting stands on the agenda and other
procedural matters.
	   South Korea has proposed forming committees to deal with
different issues, but the North has demanded that the agenda be
arranged first.
	   Officials said North Korea also insists that the United States
withdraw its troops and reach a peace treaty with Pyongyang,
excluding South Korea.
	   The United States and South Korea have indicated willingness to
discuss the troop withdrawal, but the South opposes making it a
formal agenda item.
	   Both also have ruled out discussions on a Washington-Pyongyang
peace treaty. The United States maintains that any Korean peace
treaty should be signed between the two Koreas.
	   The first two rounds _ last December and March _ failed to
overcome the procedural differences.

Turkish-Syrian deal renews security links, Syrian minister says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Syria's new deal with Turkey on Kurdish
guerrillas reinstates security cooperation between the two
countries that Turkey canceled three years ago, Syrian Foreign
Minister Farouk al-Sharaa said Thursday.
	   ``Now the situation has returned to its normal state concerning
the security cooperation between Syria and Turkey,'' al-Sharaa told
reporters after briefing Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on the
pact.
	   Al-Sharaa's comments were the first by a senior Syrian official
on the pact negotiated after Mubarak shuttled between Damascus and
Ankara. The deal ended a stand off between the two countries that
sparked fears a war in the region.
	   The Syrian foreign minister did not give details of the pact,
nor explain why Turkey discontinued security cooperation in the
past. He said the new agreement was between security committees of
the two countries ``whose meetings the Turks suspended three years
ago.''
	   ``This agreement is balanced,'' al-Sharaa said. ``We will follow
up on the implementation of what has been agreed upon ... and we
hope the Turkish side will also abide by the agreement.''
	   The agreement was reached after two days of negotiations in the
southern Turkish town of Seyhan on Tuesday.
	   Turkey has said that Syria pledged under the agreement to shut
down camps of the militant Kurdistan Workers Party, known as the
PKK, on Syrian territory and in the Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley
of Lebanon, and to brand the group terrorists.
	   Ankara says the Kurdish rebels stage cross-border attacks on
Turkey in its war for autonomy that has claimed 37,000 lives since
1984.
	   In the past, Syria has denied it supported the PKK. In a first
step in implementing the agreement, Syria's official news agency
Tuesday called the militant Kurdish group an ``illegal and
unlicensed party.''
	   The Syrian Arab News Agency also said that in the pact, Turkey
pledged it would ``not also allow any activity that aims at Syrian
security and stability.''
	   Al-Sharaa returned to Damascus after the meeting with Mubarak.

Police seize second largest amount of `ecstasy'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Two men were remanded in custody
Thursday after their arrest in connection with the attempted import
of almost 5 million Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 3 million) worth
of the drug known as ecstasy.
	   Police seized thousands of tablets of the drug hidden in a crate
when it arrived Wednesday at Sydney airport on a Cathay Pacific
flight. The haul is the second largest of its kind in Australia,
Justice Minister Amanda Vanstone said.
	   Art importer Mordechai Cohen, 36, of no fixed address, and
importer Andrea Rocco, 31, of South Africa appeared in Sydney's
Central Local Court on drug importation charges.
	   Neither man entered a plea or applied for bail. Both were
remanded in custody and ordered to reappear on Dec. 3.
	   Vanstone said the seizure, by the Australian Federal Police and
the Customs Service, had prevented 70,000 ecstasy tablets from
reaching the streets.
	   ``Excellent work by customs (officers) identified the drugs
concealed in a wooden crate labeled water pumps,'' Vanstone said.
	   ``Customs officers X-rayed the crates and identified what they
believed to be the drugs inside the pumps.
	   ``Later tests confirmed that the substance found was ecstasy.''
	   Federal agent Steve Simpson said early indications suggested the
importers were part of a highly organized operation.
	   He said the consignment had come from France.
	   The tablets were pale green and speckled with a butterfly
imprint, he said.
	   The largest ecstasy haul ever in Australia was a 70-pound
(32-kilogram) seizure in Sydney in March 1989.
	   Last week, authorities seized 900 pounds (400 kilograms) of
heroin in New South Wales state, the largest single amount of that
drug captured entering Australia.

Twenty-eight illegal immigrants found in Prague
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ A group of illegal immigrants was
found in a truck parked in a suburb of Prague, police said
Thursday.
	   Out of 28 refugees discovered by the police Wednesday night,
nine were from Afghanistan, fourteen from Kosovo and five from Sri
Lanka, police spokeswoman Eva Brozova told the CTK news agency.
	   The immigrants, who had no passports or money, asked for
political asylum and left for a refugee camp.
	   The Czech Republic is becoming a popular transit destination for
refugees.
	   More than 32,000 illegal immigrants have been caught in the
Czech Republic this year, about a third of them coming from Kosovo.
But only a fraction have asked for asylum, as the final destination
for most of them is Germany.

Ukraine's parliament approves state privatization chief

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's parliament on Thursday approved
the state privatization chief, signaling the possible end to a
long-running dispute between the government and lawmakers over
privatization in the country.
	   Lawmakers voted 230-112 to appoint President Leonid Kuchma's
nominee, Oleksandr Bondar, to head the State Property Fund. Under
Ukraine's constitution, parliament approves the state privatization
chief nominated by the president.
	   Bondar, whose candidacy was rejected by parliament last month,
won support of the leftist-dominated parliament Thursday by saying
he might annul the privatization of some enterprises that lawmakers
said went into private hands illegally.
	   Some of these enterprises would be privatized anew, through
proper procedures, and others would be re-nationalized, he said.
	   Thursday's approval of the permanent head of the State Property
Fund follows a non-stop feud between parliament and the government
over how to conduct privatization, which has been raging since
Kuchma was elected president in 1994.
	   Lawmakers earlier turned down Kuchma's previous nominee for the
top privatization post, Volodymyr Lanovy, four times.
	   Lanovy served only as an acting State Property Fund chairman,
which allowed the legislators to frequently find fault with his
work and limit his authority.
	   In addition, parliament has introduced a number of measures in
the past that seriously hampered the State Property Fund's efforts
to quicken privatization.
	   Privatization in Ukraine, which showed signs of revival at the
beginning of 1998, has slowed down sharply. Foreign investors have
fled the region due largely to the continuing financial crisis in
neighboring Russia.
	   The State Property Fund has already canceled dozens of
privatization tenders this year that failed to draw at least one
bidder. The country's stock market has dried up in recent months
because there is no demand for shares in Ukrainian enterprises.
	   The former Soviet republic has earned about 360 million hryvna
(dlrs 99 million at the current rate) from privatization since the
beginning of the year, remaining far behind the 1998 target of 1
billion hryvna (dlrs 292 million).

Bulgaria tries suspected Turkish underworld boss and three
</HEADLINE>
associates &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Four Turks, including a suspected
underworld boss who had escaped from prison, went on trial Thursday
in eastern Bulgaria on charges of entering the country illegally
and possessing an unlicensed gun, state radio reported.
	   The report identified the defendants as Kursat Yilmaz, Ali
Oymak, Suleyman Kavrak and Behcet Hasanov, a Bulgarian ethnic Turk.
	   Yilmaz and Oymac escaped from a Turkish prison last February.
Yilmaz has been serving a sentence for ordering his men to kill a
mayor and a businessman in southwestern Turkey. He had previously
also been convicted on charges of extortion.
	   Bulgaria accuses the three Turkish nationals of entering the
country with false passports. Hasanov is charged of helping them.
Oymac is also accused of possessing an illegal gun.
	   Each of the charges carries punishment of up to five years in
prison if convicted. A separate trial on extraditing Yilmaz and
Oymac to Turkey is scheduled next month.
	   Bulgarian police arrested Yilmaz and his co-defendants last July
at a resort near the Black Sea town of Varna, 470 kilometers (300
miles) northeast of Sofia, where they stayed at a posh hotel.
	   The court sessions were taking place under tight security in
Varna prison, the radio said.
	   The Turkish Anatolia news agency reported that Yilmaz told the
court he had managed to smuggle into his custody a cellular phone
that was sent to him inside a tin can.

Philippine lawyers plan final bid to save rapist from execution
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JIM GOMEZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Lawyers for the first man sentenced
to die in the Philippines in two decades said Thursday they will
file a final appeal next week to try to prevent his execution.
	   Leo Echegaray, a poor house painter convicted of raping his
10-year-old stepdaughter five times, is the first of more than 700
death-row inmates scheduled to die under a law that restored
capital punishment in 1994.
	   His impending execution by lethal injection has triggered a
debate on the death penalty that has divided many Filipinos.
	   Maria Socorro Diokno, secretary-general of the Free Legal
Assistance Group, which represents Echegaray, said it will argue at
the Supreme Court that the government failed to execute him within
the time frame prescribed by law.
	   ``It's ironic that the law that should have caused his death
could now be used to save him from it,'' Diokno said.
	   Under the 1994 law, an execution should be carried out not
earlier than one year or later than 18 months after a death
sentence has been declared final by the Supreme Court.
	   The Supreme Court, which automatically reviews all death
sentences, declared Echegaray's death sentence final on Feb. 27,
1997, thereby setting the date of his execution between Feb. 27 and
Aug. 27 this year.
	   Echegaray's lawyers tried to stop the execution with several
petitions to the Supreme Court, including one that questioned the
constitutionality of lethal injections.
	   The Supreme Court imposed a ``status quo order,'' which
prevented a lower court from fixing a date for Echegaray's
execution, while it resolved the petitions.
	   On Tuesday, it ruled that lethal injections are a constitutional
method of carrying out the death penalty, removing the last
obstacle to Echegaray's execution.
	   Raul Palabrica, a legal expert and columnist for the Philippine
Daily Inquirer, said that based on past court rulings, Echegaray
should not be allowed to benefit from delays he himself caused
through appeals filed by his lawyers to delay the execution.
	   ``Nothing short of a miracle can make the justices postpone
Echegaray's early appointment with the Almighty,'' he said.
	   The 1987 constitution abolished the death penalty but gave
Congress the option to restore it for crimes such as murder,
kidnappings for ransom, rape and drug trafficking.
	   Philippine Roman Catholic Church leaders and other civic groups
oppose the death penalty, arguing there is no concrete proof that
it deters crime. Opponents also say the poor are disadvantaged
because they cannot afford good lawyers for their defense.
	   Proponents say it is too early for the death penalty to serve as
a deterrent to crime because no one has been executed under the new
law.
	   President Joseph Estrada has said he will not pardon Echegaray.

Burgers with touch of class put woman in jail
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The burgers were worth their weight in
gold.
	   Customs officials who caught a woman with an unusually big horde
of hamburgers in her luggage found that instead of meat the
sandwiches were packed with gold pieces _ 277 grams (9.69 troy
ounces) in all.
	   The al-Zawra weekly reported on Thursday that the woman was
arrested a few days ago at the Iraqi-Jordan border checkpoint of
Trabil with contraband gold worth 4.5 million dinars (dlrs 2,700).
	   Al-Zawra did not say how many burgers were confiscated or in
what form the gold was concealed. The woman, who faces an
undetermined prison term, was not identified.
	   Gold is cheaper in Iraq than in other countries: about dlrs 280
a troy ounce (dlrs 9.74 per gram) compared to about dlrs 295 a troy
ounce (dlrs 10.53 per gram) in international markets.
	   Iraq prohibits taking out of the country more than 5 grams (0.17
ounce) of gold as part of regulations to prevent the flight of
wealth at a time when the country has been impoverished by U.N.
economic sanctions.
	   Al-Zawra said 964 customs violations were prevented by
authorities in the last eight months, including attempts to smuggle
hard currency, historical seals and gold.
	   The punishment for smuggling archeological items is life in
prison or death.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's financial situation is difficult, but the
country does not need humanitarian aid from the West and will not
default on its foreign debt, the finance minister said Thursday.
	   ``I would express gratitude for such proposals, but I think that
food imports will continue in a normal market mode,'' Mikhail
Zadornov said at a news conference, when asked about Western offers
of food aid to help Russia through the winter.
	   Zadornov said that Russia may eventually need such assistance,
but only for some isolated regions or in case of natural disasters.
	   He also insisted that no matter how hard-pressed the government
is, it will pay its debts. He indicated, however, the government
may try to renegotiate the payment schedule.
	   ``Payments on foreign debt will be carried out in the fourth
quarter in the amount agreed with our creditors,'' Zadornov said.
``We have recently paid dlrs 500 million and plan to pay another
dlrs 2 billion'' through the end of the year.
	   Zadornov expressed hopes for reaching an agreement on further
loans with a visiting International Monetary Fund team.
	   ``I think that our partners can't but recognize that the
government is taking strong efforts to radically cut spending,'' he
said in a reference to a fourth-quarter budget plan approved by the
Cabinet on Tuesday.
	   The IMF wants to see a longer-term program to deal with the
crisis, but the government has dragged its feet on working it out,
saying it needs to concentrate on urgent action.
	   Zadornov's deputy, Oleg Vyugin, said in an interview published
in the daily liberal Vremya (Time) on Thursday, that the lack of an
economic plan through the end of 1999 would hamper the talks with
the IMF.
	   ``There is no official budget plan for next year, and that will
complicate our talks with the IMF,'' Vyugin said. ``We can't offer
them any document. To speak the truth, we don't even have a final
version for ourselves (in the Finance Ministry).''
	   The IMF organized a dlrs 22.6 billion bailout package with
Russia in July, a month before the country's economic crisis hit
with full force. Russia received the first installment of dlrs 4.8
billion, but the IMF has frozen additional money.
	   In the meantime, the Russian government is scrambling to come up
with money to pay its bill.
	   The government plans to spend 130 billion rubles (dlrs 7.6
billion) in the final three months of the year, but expects
revenues of only around 70 billion rubles (dlrs 4.1 billion),
officials said earlier this week.
	   Zadornov acknowledged on Thursday that the government would have
to print money to cover the shortfall, but pledged to limit it to
prevent high inflation.
	   ``We will certainly be forced to print new money to finance our
spending,'' he said. ``There is no sense in concealing it, but we
must keep it to a minimum,'' he said.
	   The government still hopes that loans from the IMF and other
international lenders will allow it to reduce the amount of new
money to be printed. ``If they come, that will help finance the
deficit,'' Zadornov said.
	   Meanwhile, the chairman of the Central Bank said he was trying
to prevent sharp fluctuations in the ruble's exchange rate and
tighten supervision of commercial banks to stabilize the economy
and restore public trust.
	   ``It is important to mitigate panic-driven demand for foreign
currency,'' Viktor Gerashchenko told a meeting of potential
investors in London.
	   The ruble has plummeted to about 17 to the U.S. dollar, from its
pre-crisis level of 6 to the dollar.

	   GENEVA (AP) _ North Korea's protest over planned U.S.-South
Korean military exercises hung over peace talks Thursday, but
negotiators claimed they achieved minor successes.
	   The four parties _ the two Koreas, China and the United States _
are still laying the groundwork for talks to reach a permanent
peace treaty for the Korean peninsula.
	   ``We had a constructive meeting, and I underline the word
`constructive,''' said Park Kun-woo, leader of the South Korean
delegation that is chairing the current round. But he gave no
details.
	   His North Korean counterpart, Vice Foreign Minister Kim Gye
Gwan, declined to comment, but heads of the U.S. and Chinese
delegations indicated the talks were advancing.
	   ``We've made quite a bit of progress in narrowing the
differences, but the North Korean position remains quite firm,''
said U.S. Ambassador-at-Large Charles Kartman.
	   Chinese Ambassador Qian Yong-nian said the four sides would
continue ``probing.''
	   The North's official Korean Central News Agency said U.S. and
South Korean officials were ``seriously provoking'' them by
scheduling the maneuvers to begin the day after the current round
of talks ends Sunday.
	   ``The war exercises are patent proof that the United States and
the South Korean authorities have no interest in discussing''
permanent peace on the Korean peninsula, it said.
	   This year's maneuvers will be the 37th the two countries have
held since 1961. U.S. and South Korean officials termed them
``routine and defensive.''
	   Most of the exercises, involving the 650,000-strong South Korean
military and the 37,000 U.S. troops stationed there, will be held
well south of the border with the North, U.S. officials have said.
	   The border is the world's most heavily armed, with nearly 2
million troops deployed on both sides.
	   North and South Korea have been in a technical state of war
since the 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armistice, not a peace
treaty. The United States and China, the other two parties to the
talks, were the other main combatants in the war.
	   The delegation chiefs are trying to resolve conflicting stands
on the agenda and other procedural matters.
	   South Korea has proposed forming committees to deal with
different issues, but the North has demanded that the agenda be
arranged first.
	   Officials said North Korea also insists that the United States
withdraw its troops and reach a peace treaty with Pyongyang,
excluding South Korea.
	   The first two rounds _ last December and March _ failed to
overcome the procedural differences.

Philippine president plans to discuss Anwar's arrest with Mahathir
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada said
Thursday he will remind Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
in a meeting next month to grant due process of law to jailed
dissident Anwar Ibrahim.
	   The two leaders are to meet in Kuala Lumpur during the annual
summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
	   Estrada told reporters he wanted to meet Mahathir ``so that I
can at least have a good dialogue with him about giving due process
to Mr. Anwar.''
	   Mahathir fired Anwar, 51, as deputy prime minister on Sept. 2
after they differed on economic policy. Anwar began rallying
opposition to Mahathir and was arrested Sept. 20.
	   Estrada said he still is hoping Mahathir will allow him to visit
Anwar, whom he describes as a personal friend.
	   Estrada and Indonesian President B.J. Habibie have both spoken
out against Anwar's arrest and treatment in jail.
	   Remarks by Estrada and other Philippine officials in support of
Anwar have angered some Malaysians and threatened relations between
the countries.
	   On Tuesday, Malaysian protesters demonstrated in front of the
Philippine Embassy in Kuala Lumpur, demanding that Estrada
apologize for allegedly meddling in their country's domestic
affairs. A spokesman said Estrada would not apologize.
	   Anwar has been charged with sexual misconduct and corruption,
but has denied the charges, calling them politically motivated. He
appeared at recent court hearings with a black eye, bruises and a
neck brace, saying he was beaten in police custody.
	   Estrada initially said he was considering boycotting the APEC
meeting to protest Anwar's treatment, but later said he would
attend.
	   Estrada said Tuesday he has decided to reduce his criticism of
Malaysia on the advice of his predecessor, Fidel Ramos.
	   ``We have to be friendly with Malaysia,'' Estrada said. ``I've
expressed my feelings and that's enough.''
	   Malaysia is an important trading partner of the Philippines. It
also is host to hundreds of thousands of Filipino workers.

French sperm banks launch appeal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ With stocks of eggs and sperm low, French centers
for artificial reproduction launched an appeal Thursday for donors
to give a bit of themselves to help childless couples.
	   Each of France's 22 Centers for the Study and Conservation of
Human Eggs and Sperm will hold a two-day open house starting Friday
to allow potential donors to learn about different reproductive
techniques.
	   The centers will allow visitors to look at spermatozoids under a
microscope and see how they are frozen as well as meet and talk
with doctors and technicians.
	   About 2,000 couples seek help each year at the centers, but the
availability of eggs and sperm no longer meets demand. The average
wait is 12 months and can last several years for some couples.
	   The centers said that in 1997 only 419 volunteers offered sperm
or eggs, down from 630 five years ago.
	   Because of stricter health and quality control measures and
rules limiting the number of children allowed to be born from a
single donor, the centers reject about 40 percent of volunteers.
	   Donors in France must be less than 45 years old, have at least
one child, have the consent of spouse or companion and submit to
various medical tests.

Islamic Jihad activists warned not to engage in violence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Leaders of the militant group Islamic Jihad
were summoned to Palestinian security headquarters and warned not
to carry out attacks in Israel, a security official said Thursday.
	   The warning was delivered Wednesday when 20 leading members of
Islamic Jihad reported to the Palestinians' Preventive Security
Service office in the West Bank town of Bethlehem, said the
official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The official said there was concern that Islamic Jihad might try
to engage in violence to mark the recent anniversary of the
assassination of their leader, Fathi Shekaki.
	   Shekaki was gunned down Oct. 16, 1995 outside a hotel in Malta,
and the assassination was widely attributed to Israel.
	   Islamic Jihad is planning to hold a number of rallies in
Shekaki's memory.
	   The group is the smaller of two Islamic militant groups in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip and has carried out a number of shootings
and bombings in Israel in hopes of wrecking Mideast peacemaking.
	   Israel has demanded that the Palestinian Authority do more to
fight terrorism, and a new security agreement is being negotiated
at the Mideast summit at Wye Plantation in Maryland.
	   The Palestinian security official said the summoning of the
Islamic Jihad leaders was routine procedure and not an attempt to
step up anti-terrorism efforts during the summit.

cricket, removed the Waugh brothers _ Mark (30) and Steve (0) _ in
his ninth over. He then had the wicket of left-handed Darren
Lehmann as the batsman got a thick inside edge and rolled the ball
back onto his stumps.
	   On a dry and bare wicket, Australia suffered a major blow in the
last half an hour when opener Michael Slater was stumped by Moin
Khan for 96. Slater, who twice lifted Arshad Khan over long off for
two big sixes, tried to bring his century with another big hit off
Khan.
	   However, he completely misjudged the line of the off-spinner and
was smartly stumps by Moin. Slater hammered nine four and two sixes
in his five and a half hour vigil at the crease during which he
faced 257 balls.
	   Australia which was comfortably placed at 141 for two at tea
slumped to 189 for six in eight overs before ;g3
was undefeated on four.
	   Afridi was the pick of Pakistan bowlers with three-wicket burst
for 37 while Khan bowled 34 overs and conceded 58 runs for two
wickets. Another debutante 32-year-old left-arm spinner Shakeel
Ahmed yet to get his first Test scalp although he bowled a tidy
21.4 overs for 43 runs.
	   Ahmed completed paceman Akhtar's 10th over when the bowler was
hit by Mark Waugh's handle of the bat in his follow through which
badly bruised the forearm of bowler's right hand after tea.
	   Earlier, after electing to bat first, Australia crawled to 65 in
the first session for the loss of skipper Mark Taylor (16).
	   The Aussie captain, who made 334 and equaled Sir Don Bradman's
highest individual innings for Australia in the drawn second Test
at Peshawar, got the top edge of Khan's fifth ball of the match and
skied it to Inzamamul Haq at midwicket.
	   Wasim Akram, back in the side after missing the Peshawar Test
due to flu, hit Slater's temple off two successive short
deliveries, but with the wicket giving little assistance to seam
bowlers, he bowled only 11 overs in the day without a wicket.
	   Australians added another 76 runs in the second session as the
home team could get only the wicket of Justin Langer (30), trapped
leg before by paceman Shoaib Akhtar's low full toss.
	   After putting 67 runs with Langer, Slater compiled another 64
runs for the third wicket with Mark Waugh (26) before Afridi hit
back with three wickets inside 13 balls after tea.
	   Pakistan, down by one in the three-match series, made four
changes from the drawn second Test at Peshawar.
	   Opening batsman Saeed Anwar had a pain in his stomach and was
forced to sit out Thursday morning. He was replaced by Afridi, who
made his Test debut after playing in 67 one-day Internationals.
Muhammad Zahid, who had aggravated a groin injury at Peshawar, was
replaced by Wasim Akram, while injured leg-spinner Mushtaq Ahmed
made way for Arshad Khan.
	   Ahmed is nursing a knee injury.
	   Pakistan also awarded Test cap to 32-year-old Rawalpindi
left-arm spinner Shakeel Ahmed, who came in place of all-rounder
Azhar Mahmood.
	   Australia brought back their in-form left-handed batsman Darren
Lehmann, who missed the second Test due to groin injury. He
replaced Ricky Ponting.
	   Off-spinner Gavin Robertson, who did not feature in the first
two Tests, was included in place of medium fast Damien Fleming.

Floods hit thousands of struck by famine in south Sudan

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Heavy rains in war-ravaged southern Sudan
have flooded homes and crops in low-lying areas, endangering more
than 120,000 people already suffering from famine, the United
Nations said Thursday.
	   The U.N. World Food Program said flooding in three areas of
southern Sudan has destroyed crops and dealt another blow to
thousands already in the grip of famine caused by the 15-year civil
war.
	   WFP spokeswoman Lindsey Davies said Ajiep and Panthau in the
western Bahr-el Ghazal region were among the heavily flooded areas.
	   ``This was the epicenter of the (famine) crisis. People there
are extremely vulnerable and weak,'' Davies said. ``Although we
were beginning to see small signs of improvement, with this recent
flooding, they are back to square one.''
	   Six weeks ago, relief agencies reported that the death rate
among famine victims dropped from a peak of 120 deaths per day to
less than 60, but since then, there has been no further
improvement, she said.

Two stowaways stuck on boat from Iran arrive in Japan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Two Iraqi stowaways are stranded on a freighter
that has gone halfway around the world and it is unclear when they
will be able to disembark, Japanese officials said Thursday.
	   The Cyprus-registered New Horizon, carrying the two, arrived in
Kagoshima, southwestern Japan, last week after stops in South
Africa, Brazil, Argentina and Singapore, said immigration officer
Masanao Goto.
	   The Iraqis, aged 25 and 30, sneaked aboard July 5 in the Iranian
port town of Bandar Abbas, where they had lost their jobs. They
told Japanese authorities they had wanted passage to Fiji to find
work, Goto said.
	   The stowaways, who weren't identified by name, were discovered
by crew members days after the ship sailed from Iran. They have
been denied permission to disembark wherever the boat has docked.
	   Goto said the two won't be arrested in Japan even though they
violated Japanese law by entering the country's territorial waters.
He said he did not know if the boat is headed for Fiji or when it
will approach their homeland.
	   ``They'll probably just stay aboard until one day the ship makes
its way near their home,'' said Goto.

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Efforts to organize a team to verify
compliance with the Kosovo peace deal appeared stalled Thursday
because would-be contributor nations want the U.N. Security Council
to endorse the plan before they will commit personnel.
	   Work on the U.N. resolution hit a snag Wednesday night because
Russia and China oppose including language threatening Serbs and
ethnic Albanians with force if they disregard the agreement.
	   As permanent members, China and Russia could veto the
resolution.
	   Under the Oct. 12 deal with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke,
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic agreed to allow up to 2,000
unarmed ``verifiers'' to ensure that the terms of the deal are
carried out.
	   The operation is to be directed by the Vienna-based Organization
for Security and Cooperation, which must ask its 54 member states
to provide personnel for the mission.
	   On Thursday, the OSCE permanent council met in Vienna's Hofburg
Palace to work out details for the operation. But representatives
said no final decisions were taken because many members first
wanted the Security Council to approve the mission.
	   The American head of the operation, William G. Walker, said
there was concern among the would-be contributors about the safety
of personnel, especially from countries whose nationals were taken
hostage by Bosnian Serbs during the 1992-95 Bosnian war.
	   Under the agreement, the Yugoslav government guarantees the
safety of the verifiers.
	   ``Obviously, the physical security of 2,000 people in a zone of
turmoil, of conflict, is of utmost importance,'' Walker said. ``I
feel very strongly that I will be sort of personally responsible
for the well-being of these 2,000 people, for their lives.''
	   Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy said his government was
ready to provide 50-100 personnel but did not want to rely
exclusively on Milosevic for their safety. Axworthy suggested that
armed bodyguards accompany verifiers.
	   ``We raised clearly the importance of providing robust
protection for anyone who is going to Kosovo,'' Axworthy told
reporters. ``We think it is very important that the U.N. Security
Council has a resolution that clearly authorizes measures to
protect anybody who is in Kosovo.''
	   He said Canada was holding out hope that the council would
authorize ``all necessary measures'' to protect the mission,
wording which diplomatic sources at the United Nations say is
unlikely to win approval.
	   Walker saaid he would leave for Kosovo on Friday and spend about
a week or 10 days helping set up the operation.

	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ Visiting U.S. officials said future aid
and cooperation with Nigeria's government depends partly on whether
the West African country is committed to fighting international
drug trafficking.
	   Randy Beers, acting assistant secretary of state for narcotics
affairs, told journalists Wednesday he was impressed by the new
military government's willingness to cooperate with U.S. officials.
	   ``We want Nigeria to succeed. It is in the best interests of
both of our countries that the U.S. and Nigeria join together to
combat transnational narcotics trafficking and crime,'' Beers said.
	   A 12-year-old program by the United States requires its
president to certify annually whether countries that feed illegal
drug markets in the U.S.
	   are cooperating in anti-drug efforts. Countries that fail
certification are denied aid, unless the president waives
penalties.
	   Nigeria, a key international transit point for narcotics, was
decertified
	   earlier this year. Beers said U.S. officials were reviewing the
decision in the wake of Nigeria's changeover of government
leadership in June, when the late dictator Gen. Sani Abacha died
and was succeeded by a reformist general,
	   Abdulsalami Abubakar.
	   --
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ The Economic Community of West African
States said it was sending an envoy to Guinea Bissau, where
fighting between loyalist and rebel forces broke out again this
week.
	   Guinea-Bissau's President Joao Bernardo Vieira on Wednesday
ordered a unilateral cease-fire, hours after the west African
nation's second-largest city fell into rebel hands, and said he was
ready to hold talks with the leader of a breakaway army faction.
	   ECOWAS will dispatch a special envoy ``with the view to bringing
the two parties to reason and making them respect a ceasefire,''
said Nigerian military leader Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar.
	   ECOWAS' military arm, known as ECOMOG, has been involved in
fighting in both Liberia and Sierra Leone.
	   --
	   BRAZZAVILLE, Republic of Congo (AP) _ A bus ran off a road and
plunged into a river, killing 16 people and seriously injuring
several more, state radio reported.
	   Police in Zambi, 150 kilometers (90 miles) south of Brazzaville,
said they expected the death toll to rise as more bodies were
recovered from the river.
	   The bus was speeding, according to the Wednesday report. It said
the crash happened on Sunday but gave few further details.
	   --
	   SANNIQUELLIE, Liberia (AP) _ Returning members of Liberia's
Mandingo tribe have complained to President Charles Taylor about
the seizure of their properties by other ethnic groups.
	   Outlining their concerns in a letter to President Charles
Taylor, representatives for the Mandingos complained that many had
returned from refugee camps in neighboring Ivory Coast and Guinea
and found their homes taken over.
	   The new owners refused to leave on the grounds that they
rightfully ``captured'' the properties during the war when the
original owners fled, or insist they be compensated for preserving
the properties during the seven-year war, the letter said.
	   ``The illegal occupation of our houses in Nimba county poses a
serious threat to the reconciliation and reconstruction process of
the government,'' said the letter, which was given to Taylor on
Tuesday during his visit to Nimba county, in eastern Liberia near
the border with Guinea.
	   The Mandingos also complained about harassment by security
forces and marginalisation by the local administration.
	   In response, Taylor called on local authorities to stop unjust
treatment of Mandingos and ordered them to handle property
disputes.
	   Mandingos fled the country by the thousand after the outbreak of
civil war in 1990, and were targeted by Taylor _ then a warlord _
for supporting the regime of late dictator Samuel Doe.
	   --
	   SAO TOME, Sao Tome and Principe (AP) _ Some 60,000 students
remained at home Thursday as a nationwide strike by teachers over
pay and conditions entered its second day.
	   The strike closed all the island group's preschools, as well as
primary and high schools and the Sao Tome university.
	   The country's more than 300 teachers are demanding increased
state investment in school equipment and higher pay. Each teacher
generally teaches several different classes of students.
	   A high school teacher earns an average of 60,000 dobras (dlrs
12) per month. A pair of new shoes costs 200,000 dobras (dlrs 29).
	   Most state employees in the impoverished islands about 240
kilometers (150 miles) west of Gabon hold several jobs in order to
survive.
	   Jeronimo Salvaterra, the Education Ministry's chief negotiator
with the teachers' union, said the pay demand would place ``very
high and impossible costs'' on the state budget.

Hyundai chief to visit North Korea with 501 cattle
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ The founder of South Korea's largest
conglomerate plans to visit his native North Korea again next week
with a gift of 501 cattle, company officials said Thursday.
	   The visit has been delayed a month because of a dispute over 500
cattle donated by Chung Ju-yung, founder of the Hyundai group,
during a trip to the North in June.
	   North Korea claimed 71 of those cattle died because Seoul
government agents force-fed them indigestible vinyl strips and
lumps of rope before shipping them to the North.
	   Calling the North's claim nonsense, Seoul's Ministry of National
Unification ordered Hyundai to check thousands of other cattle
being raised at its ranch on the west coast.
	   The ministry later acknowledged that lumps of rope were found in
the stomachs of some cattle on the ranch, but said the material
didn't kill the animals donated to North Korea.
	   It blamed the deaths on stress caused by the long shipment by
truck to the North.
	   The South Korean government said it would not authorize a second
shipment of cattle unless the North retracted its accusations.
	   On Thursday, South Korean Unification Minister Kang In-duk said
North Korea sent a letter to Hyundai last week, saying that ``the
misunderstanding with the southern authorities on the issue of the
dead cattle is cleared.''
	   Kang said the North's letter ``cleared a stumbling block for
Hyundai's additional cattle donation.''
	   During his visit, Chung is expected to reach agreement on
details of Hyundai's plan to start sightseeing tours of a scenic
mountain in the North.
	   The tours, originally scheduled to begin in September, have been
delayed because of cost, security and other matters.
	   Hyundai hopes to send by ship up to 2,000 tourists a week for
four-day tours of Diamond Mountain on the North's east coast
beginning in November.
	   Animosity and distrust between the two Koreas run deep. The
Korean states were separated into the communist North and the
capitalist South in 1945. They fought a three-year war in the early
1950s.

Moscow detains alleged spy from Estonia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's Federal Security Service has detained a
man it accuses of spying for Estonia, a news agency reported
Thursday.
	   Estonian citizen Ville Sonn was arrested at a military facility
in the western Russian city of Pskov, where he was allegedly doing
``visual reconnaissance,'' the Interfax news agency said, citing an
unidentified source in the Federal Security Service (FSB).
	   The FSB did not say when he was arrested.
	   The FSB, one of many successors to the Soviet Union's KGB, said
Sonn confessed that he had been on a mission with Estonia's secret
service. Estonian embassy officials in Moscow have been informed,
Interfax said.
	   But Maj. Riho Uhtegi, the head of Estonia's Department for
Intelligence and Counterintelligence, denied that Sonn was
connected with the Estonian military intelligence services.
	   The FSB said it would simply expel Sonn and not press charges
against him.
	   ``The Russian side, taking into account insignificant damage (by
the alleged spy) and wishing to maintain good-neighborly relations
with Estonia, has made the decision not to initiate criminal
proceedings,'' the FSB spokesman said, according to Interfax.

EU Parliament votes to unblock 1999 aid funds
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Parliament agreed Thursday
to release the European Union's humanitarian aid budget for 1999
despite recent fraud allegations.
	   The EU assembly, meeting in Strasbourg, France, voted 421-81 to
unblock 330 million European currency units (dlrs 396 million) in
humanitarian aid for next year. There were eight abstentions.
	   Recent fraud allegations have focused the disappearance of
540,000 ecu (dlrs 594,000) from aid contracts earmarked for
ex-Yugoslavia and Rwanda in 1993-1994.
	   Last month, the Parliament's committee on budgetary controls
voted in favor of freezing 1999 funding for the EU's Humanitarian
Office until the fraud suspicions had been cleared up.
	   But the Parliament eased its stance after it received assurances
by Jacques Santer, president of the European Commission, that
further efforts would be made to monitor spending.
	   Santer proposed to create an anti-fraud unit that would be
independent from the Commission. The EU Parliament had raised
suspicions that the EU executive body's in-house fraud unit helped
hide corruption.

12 Vietnamese officials injured in land-compensation dispute
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ A dozen Vietnamese officials were injured
in a second major clash with villagers over a land-compensation
dispute involving a new golf course, a local official said
Thursday.
	   Five were hospitalized, and two were still being treated a week
after the incident, said the official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   The clash occurred over a two-hour period at Kim No village,
some 20 kilometers (12 miles) north of Hanoi, when 15 men and five
women attacked local officials with spears, swords and hoes and
vandalized public property, he said.
	   The officials were surveying the land to compensate villagers
for development of a proposed 18-hole golf course. The villagers
tried to halt clearing of the site.
	   No arrests have been made, although five people have been
identified as suspects, the official said. He described some of the
participants as drunks, drug addicts and people who had been
stripped of Communist Party membership.
	   Of the 443 families with land in the proposed golf course
project, 341 already have been compensated, he said.
	   The rioters issued unreasonable demands for the remaining 18
hectares (45 acres), including changes to the project and direct
negotiation with the investor, South Korea's Daewoo Corp., he said.
	   The dispute began in March 1996 when villagers clashed with
authorities over land compensation, leaving an unspecified number
of officials injured.
	   Three attackers were jailed but have since been released, the
official said. Police also suspended investigation of 25 other
people.
	   The official said the local government is trying to persuade the
villagers to hand over the land by this weekend.

the list, drawn up by 10 film critics and experts to mark the
publication of ``The Guinness Book of Film.''
	   Al Jolson's first words _ ``Wait a minute! Wait a minute! You
ain't heard nothin' yet!'' _ in the first talkie, 1927's ``The Jazz
Singer,'' set the stage for the greatest movie quotes. That means
compilers had 71 years and thousands of movies from which to glean
the top 10.
	   ``We were looking for quotations that were accessible and that
had popular appeal on a global scale,'' said Karen O'Brien, the
book's editor. ``We were also looking for wit and delivery.
Delivery is important.''
	   Picking No. 1 was easy, she said, not only because Bond's
introduction was the first utterance by Connery as 007, but also
because it is repeated in the 17 subsequent Bond films.
	   The compilers reached back to Hollywood's early history for most
of the screen gems _ six of the 10 are from the 1930s and '40s _
and flipped ahead to 1994 for the most recent, Tom Hanks' Forrest
Gump noting how ``Life is like a box of chocolates ...''
	   The earliest is Greta Garbo in 1930's ``Anna Christie'': ``Gimme
a visky with a ginger ale on the side _ and don't be stinchy,
beby'' _ her first words in her first talkie.
	   ``The Guinness Book of Film'' summarizes 1,000 movies by
decades, and is available now in Britain, Australia, New Zealand,
South Africa, Singapore and India. It may be published in other
countries later.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; The Top 10 Movie Quotes
	   1. ``Bond _ James Bond.'' _ Sean Connery, ``Dr. No.''
	   2. ``Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world,
she walks into mine.'' _ Humphrey Bogart, ``Casablanca.''
	   3. ``It's not the men in your life that counts, it's the life in
your men.'' _ Mae West, ``I'm No Angel.''
	   4. ``I'll be back.'' _ Arnold Schwarzenegger, ``The
Terminator.''
	   5. ``Would you be shocked if I changed into something more
comfortable?'' _ Jean Harlow, ``Hell's Angels.''
	   6. ``Life is like a box of chocolates: you never know what
you're gonna get.'' _ Tom Hanks, ``Forrest Gump.''
	   7. ``I could dance with you till the cows come home. On second
thoughts, I'd rather dance with the cows until you came home.'' _
Groucho Marx, ``Duck Soup.''
	   8. ``Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn.'' _ Clark Gable,
``Gone With The Wind.''
	   9. ``You talkin' to me?'' _ Robert De Niro, ``Taxi Driver.''
	   10. ``Gimme a visky with a ginger ale on the side _ and don't be
stinchy, beby.'' _ Greta Garbo, ``Anna Christie.''

Businesswoman kidnapped in southern Philippines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) _ The wife of a bakery owner was
abducted Thursday, becoming the 14th kidnap victim this year in
Zamboanga and nearby provinces in the southern Philippines, police
said.
	   Elizabeth Arquiza was on her way to pick up her children at
school when she called her husband from a shopping center to tell
him that three men were following her, Zamboanga police chief Karib
Muammil said.
	   The husband rushed to the shopping center but found her gone.
Witnesses said they saw three men leading her away but did not see
where they went, Muammil said.
	   No ransom demand has been received, he added.
	   Thirteen other people were kidnapped earlier, including Italian
priest Luciano Benedetti and two Hong Kong and one Malaysian
Chinese.
	   One victim, a businessman, was released after his kidnappers
received 300,000 pesos (dlrs 7,100) for his ``board and lodging.''
Another, a hotel owner, was found beheaded several days after he
was abducted.
	   In central Cebu City, four men dragged Regan King, manager of a
heavy equipment company owned by his Chinese-Filipino father, at
gunpoint to a waiting car Wednesday, police said.
	   The abductors demanded 50 million pesos (dlrs 1.2 million) in
ransom, police sources said.
	   Presidential National Security Adviser Alexander Aguirre
admitted that the kidnappings, including numerous others in
metropolitan Manila, have become an embarrassment for the
government of President Joseph Estrada.
	   Estrada promised to solve the kidnapping problems within six
months from taking office June 30.
	   In this year's first seven months, 81 people were kidnapped, an
average of about 12 victims per month, said Alejandro Melchor III,
a member of the Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Commission.
	   The number jumped to an average of 20 victims per month during
the first three months of the Estrada administration, Melchor said.
	   A report prepared by the Citizens' Action Against Crime and the
Movement for Restoration of Peace and Order shows that the number
of victims and ransom payments have increased rapidly over the past
five years.
	   In 1993, the groups recorded 170 people kidnapped and 69.13
million pesos (dlrs 1.6 million) paid in ransom.
	   That jumped to 241 victims and 109.92 million pesos (dlrs 2.56
million) in 1996, and to 249 victims and 306.4 million pesos (dlrs
7.13 million) in 1997.

Germany's highest court to decide whether teen can be deported
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KARLSRUHE, Germany (AP) _ Germany's highest court said Thursday
it would decide soon whether to block the deportation of a Turkish
teen-ager, born and raised in Germany, who is accused of more than
60 offenses.
	   A Constitutional Court spokesman said Judge Berthold Sommer was
reviewing the 14-year-old's case and would rule in the next few
days.
	   Officials in Bavaria began proceedings this summer to deport the
boy, known simply as Mehmet, and his parents to Turkey. The case
became an election-year symbol for conservatives demanding a
crackdown on foreigners who commit crimes here.
	   Although the parents have lived and worked in Munich for 30
years without problems, Bavarian officials accused them of
endangering society by failing to properly raise their son.
	   Courts in Bavaria have blocked efforts so far to deport the
parents, but on Tuesday upheld the state's refusal to renew the
boy's residency permit.
	   State officials had said Mehmet could be put on a plane to
Turkey as early as next week.
	   Guido Westerwelle, general secretary of the liberal Free
Democrats, accused Bavarian officials Thursday of seeking to deport
Mehmet as a ``diversionary tactic'' to cover up the failure of
social services there to help a problem child.

Japan's Nomura reports huge loss
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments from Nomura president on restructuring &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's biggest brokerage, Nomura Securities Co.,
said Thursday it lost dlrs 1.76 billion in the first half of fiscal
1998 as global financial turmoil took a toll, especially on its
overseas operations.
	   Two other Japanese brokerages also reported losses, although on
a smaller scale than Nomura's.
	   Nomura posted a group loss of 207.2 billion yen (dlrs 1.76
billion) for the half year ended Sept. 30, compared to a net profit
of 49.71 billion yen (dlrs 422 million) in the same period a year
earlier.
	   After the results were released, Nomura President Junichi Ujiie
announced large-scale restructuring measures that include job cuts,
consolidation of international operations, and reductions in
executives' salaries.
	   Nomura said the company lost about dlrs 600 million on Russian
bonds and another dlrs 600 million on U.S. mortgage-backed
securities.
	   The parent company also had a 33.72 billion yen (dlrs 288
million) valuation loss on its domestic securities holdings for the
six months.
	   Although Nomura expects no further losses from the Russian
market, a Nomura official said the outlook for U.S. mortgage-backed
securities is ``severe,'' and Nomura hopes for an orderly reduction
of its assets in this sector.
	   Under the company's restructuring plan, Nomura intends to cut
costs at its overseas operations by 20 percent. It also plans to
inject dlrs 1.2 billion in capital into its U.S. unit, Nomura
America Holding Inc.
	   Ujiie told reporters that Nomura will cut 2,000 jobs through
hiring freezes or early retirement by the year 2001. Kyodo News
service said the cuts would likely affect Nomura's U.S. and British
subsidiaries.
	   The Nomura president also said that previously independent
trading and investment banking operations around the world would in
the future be controlled in Tokyo.
	   That will allow the parent company to deal more successfully
with unpredictability in emerging markets, such as the financial
crisis that erupted in Russia, Ujiie said.
	   The company will also scale down or withdraw from some of its
overseas proprietary trading, such as in Russian bonds, Ujiie said.
	   By restructuring, Ujiie said Nomura hopes to achieve group
pretax profit of 240 billion yen (dlrs 2.03 billion) in the fiscal
year ending March 2001.
	   Japan's second- and third-largest securities companies also
announced big losses Thursday.
	   Daiwa Securities Co. posted a group net loss of 66.84 billion
yen (dlrs 568 million) for the half-year, compared to a net profit
of 15.53 billion yen (dlrs 132 million) last year.
	   Nikko Securities, Co. suffered a group net less of 57.72 billion
yen (dlrs 491 million) compared to a net profit of 283 million yen
(dlrs 2.4 million) a year earlier.

Strange goings-on prompt French villagers to call exorcist
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ When the villagers of Delain saw vases explode and
candlesticks soar through the town church this weekend, first they
called police _ then, just to be cautious, the local exorcist.
	   About 50 people saw the goings-on, which began last weekend as
townspeople were rearranging the church for an orchestra concert.
Moving the altar a few inches seemed to trigger the flotation and
explosion of holy objects, witnesses said.
	   ``Believe me, I'm not someone who's really interested in the
supernatural,'' said Thierry Marceaux, the mayor of the tiny valley
village in eastern France. ``But when you see it in front of you
...''
	   The exorcist, Rev. Max de Wasseige, was called in by the
archbishop of nearby Besancon _ but he didn't hold a seance.
	   ``It was more like a prayer session where people testified to
what they saw,'' Marceaux said.
	   Since the initial events, villagers have found a decapitated
Virgin Mary statue and an overturned St. Francois-Xavier rolling on
the ground, even though the church has been locked for an
investigation.
	   Marceaux doesn't believe the strange goings-on could be a prank
played by some local youngsters getting ready for Halloween.
	   ``They'd have to be pretty talented,'' he said.

Hong Kong opens long-distance phone market
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ After months of talks, Hong Kong will open the
territory's international direct dial telephone market to
competition, officials said Thursday.
	   Beginning in January, an ``unlimited number of operators'' can
try to sell long-distance services to telephone users in the
territory, said K.C. Wong, secretary for information technology and
broadcasting.
	   Hong Kong Telecommunications Ltd., which formerly held a
monopoly over the services, recently agreed to surrender its lock
on the market for 6.7 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 858
million) in compensation.
	   Any new operators will use infrastructure set up by Hong Kong
Telecom.

Turkish-Syrian deal renews security links, Syrian minister says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Syria's new deal with Turkey on Kurdish
guerrillas reinstates security cooperation between the two
countries that Turkey canceled three years ago, Syrian Foreign
Minister Farouk al-Sharaa said Thursday.
	   ``Now the situation has returned to its normal state concerning
the security cooperation between Syria and Turkey,'' al-Sharaa told
reporters after briefing Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on the
pact.
	   Al-Sharaa's comments were the first by a senior Syrian official
on the pact negotiated after Mubarak shuttled between Damascus and
Ankara, which sought Syria's commitment to stop sheltering
separatist Kurdish guerrillas from Turkey. The deal ended a
standoff between the two countries that sparked fears a war in the
region.
	   The Syrian foreign minister did not give details of the pact,
nor explain why Turkey discontinued security cooperation in the
past. He said the new agreement was between security committees of
the two countries ``whose meetings the Turks suspended three years
ago.''
	   ``This agreement is balanced,'' al-Sharaa said. ``We will follow
up on the implementation of what has been agreed upon ... and we
hope the Turkish side will also abide by the agreement.''
	   The agreement was reached after two days of negotiations in the
southern Turkish town of Seyhan on Tuesday.
	   Turkey has said that Syria pledged under the agreement to shut
down camps of the militant Kurdistan Workers Party, known as the
PKK, on Syrian territory and in the Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley
of Lebanon, and to brand the group terrorists.
	   Ankara says the Kurdish rebels stage cross-border attacks on
Turkey in its war for autonomy that has claimed 37,000 lives since
1984.
	   In the past, Syria has denied it supported the PKK. In a first
step in implementing the agreement, Syria's official news agency
Tuesday called the militant Kurdish group an ``illegal and
unlicensed party.''
	   The Syrian Arab News Agency also said the pact also included
Turkey's pledge not to ``allow any activity that aims at Syrian
security and stability.''
	   Al-Sharaa returned to Damascus after the meeting with Mubarak.

Philips: Sale of Polygram to Seagram completed next month
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Royal Philips Electronics NV said
Thursday it will finalize the sale of its 75 percent stake in
entertainment group Polygram NV to Canada's Seagram Co. next month.
	   At the presentation of Philips' third-quarter results, President
Cor Boonstra said the deal will be concluded ``sometime in
November.''
	   Boonstra also dismissed market rumors that Philips may have to
lower the selling price again, following a June price cut.
	   ``We have said that it will be 115 guilders (dlrs 61.83) a
share, and there is no reason to suggest that there will be any
change in the deal,'' Boonstra stressed.
	   In June, Seagram lowered its bid to 115 guilders a share share
from 117 (dlrs 62.90). Philips said the price cut reflected ``the
lower-than-expected financial results of PolyGram during the second
quarter of the year.''
	   Polygram results have been disappointing, mainly because of its
money-losing film division, whose third-quarter operating loss
widened to 77 million guilders (dlrs 41.39 million) from a loss of
42 million guilders (dlrs 22.58 million) in the same period in
1997.

New government at odds about slashing German military
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Not even formally in power yet, Germany's
new government is squabbling about the future of the army.
	   Talk by the Greens party about slashing Germany's troop strength
was angrily rejected as premature Thursday by their coalition
partner, Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder's Social Democrats.
	   Reflecting their antiwar roots, the Greens' platform calls for
halving the army's size by 2002 and ending compulsory military
service. This week's coalition deal with the dominant Social
Democrats, who have promised continuity in defense and foreign
policy, referred the topics to a panel on military reform.
	   But Greens defense spokeswoman Angelika Beer was quoted
Wednesday as saying that reducing Germany's 340,000-soldier army to
200,000 was ``quite realistic.'' The reform commission is sure to
call for a ``significant'' cuts in the armed forces, she told the
Kieler Nachrichten newspaper.
	   Fewer soldiers are needed to defend Germany but rapid reaction
forces for foreign missions are likely to be beefed up and
modernized, said Beer, who is considered on the left wing of her
party.
	   The Social Democrats' defense spokesman, Walter Kolbow, said in
an interview published Thursday that Beer was not speaking for the
new government.
	   ``The future structure of the Bundeswehr remains open,'' he told
the Flensburger Tageblatt. ``It's not acceptable to pre-empt the
planned commission with unilateral political statements.''
	   The new government's tone contrasts with outgoing Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's strong support for the army even after the end of the
Cold War.
	   At a military farewell ceremony last week that brought tears to
his eyes, Kohl talked about feeling a special bond with the
military and warned against ending conscription.
	   The new defense minister, Social Democrat Rudolf Scharping, took
the job only reluctantly under pressure from Schroeder. Scharping,
who wanted to stay the party's leader in parliament, says he has
Schroeder's pledge for no immediate cuts in the defense budget and
troop strength.
	   Outgoing Defense Minister Volker Ruehe will turn over the
ministry to Scharping on Wednesday.
	   The Christian Democrats also took sides against the Greens on
Thursday. Lawmaker Paul Breuer said the proposed cut would leave
Germany unable to meet its commitments to NATO.
	   ``Germany would lose its role as a stabilizing factor in the
European Union and NATO,'' he said.

Acreage up but production about the same
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Sugar cane acreage is up in Vietnam, but
production is expected to be roughly the same as last year due to
serious drought earlier this year, an Agriculture Ministry official
said Thursday.
	   The official declined to detail financial damage from the
drought, but the newspaper Investment estimated it at about 300
billion dong (dlrs 21.4 million).
	   He said the total area under sugar cane cultivation this year
rose to 270,000 hectares (667,000 acres) from 250,000 hectares
(618,000 acres) for the last crop, but the increase barely makes up
for the drought-related losses. Overall production is estimated at
just over 10 million tons of cane.
	   This will probably worsen the situation of excess sugar mill
capacity around the country. The mills already face chronic
shortages of raw sugar cane to process.
	   Vietnam expects to put more mills in operation, bringing the
number to 41 by the end of this year, up from 37 in 1997. Most
mills, which produced 330,000 tons of sugar from the last crop,
already are running well below capacity.

McCartney says stance on animal testing has softened
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Paul McCartney says he has softened his stance on
animal testing after his wife had to take such drugs to treat her
breast cancer.
	   ``I'm finding out now that there is quite a lot of animal
experimentation _ some of it I suppose absolutely necessary when
you come down to the final tests before people,'' the former Beatle
said in a British Broadcasting Corp. radio interview to be aired
Friday.
	   Linda McCartney, who died in April, was a strict vegetarian and
campaigner for animal rights, as is her husband.
	   ``I suppose a limited thing is unavoidable, but it is very
difficult for me to think like that because I favor the rights of
the animals,'' McCartney said in the interview.
	   Referring to the medication used to treat his wife's cancer, he
said, ``If a drug has got to be used on humans, then legally it has
to be finally tested on an animal. ... This was difficult for Linda
when she was undergoing her treatment.''
	   He came close to tears in describing how hard life is without
his wife.
	   ``We fancied each other something rotten,'' he said. ``That's
all it was. To me, she was always still my girlfriend.''

<TEXT>
	   BREMEN, Germany (AP) _ Felix Magath was hired and Wolfgang Sidka
fired Thursday as coach of Werder Bremen, the Bundesliga's
last-place club that was a league powerhouse until three years ago.
	   Magath, a 45-year-old former German World Cup player, was signed
until June 30, 2000 and will be on the bench Friday against
Hamburger SV, a club he once coached.
	   Sidka's release had been widely expected because of the club's
desolate Bundesliga performances, and came despite a well-played
1-1 draw against Olympique Marseille Tuesday in the UEFA Cup.
	   Magath, known as a strict disciplinarian, is expected to receive
far-reaching authority to run the club, with management hoping he
can reverse the slide of a team that was the Bundesliga's best in
the early 1990s.
	   ``Bremen is one of the most solid best-run clubs in the
league,'' said Magath. ``I see rosy times approaching.''
	   Sidka, who held the job since September of last year, is the
third coach in as many years for the troubled club, whose problems
began after Otto Rehhagel resigned in 1995.
	   Rehhagel, now FC Kaiserslautern coach, was a towering presence
at Werder Bremen.
	   He led the regional club up from the second division to several
Bundesliga titles and a regular presence in international
competition during his 14-year-stint.
	   Magath, a player on Germany's 1982 and 1986 World Cup runner-up
teams, carried Hamburg into the UEFA Cup during his two years with
the Bundesliga club.
	   He gained Bundesliga promotion with FC Nuremberg last year, but
resigned as coach after a squabble with the club president.

Staying at Leicester, O'Neill plots Villa's demise
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Now that Martin O'Neill's decided he's staying at
Leicester City he now has to work out how to stop unbeaten Aston
Villa.
	   Having turned down the chance to replace George Graham at Leeds,
the much sought-after former Northern Ireland international can
concentrate on turning modest Leicester into a force in English
soccer.
	   What better than to become the first team to beat John Gregory's
Villa?
	   O'Neill has agreed to sign a new contract to stay at Filbert
Street for the next two seasons and takes his workmanlike team to
Villa Park on Saturday to try and break down one of the strongest
defenses in the league.
	   The Villains, who are four points clear of second place
Manchester United, have conceded only two goals in nine league
games and look almost certain to gain the last 16 of the UEFA Cup
after a 1-0 shutout at Celta Vigo Tuesday night.
	   With either Australian international Mark Bosnich or understudy
Michael Oakes in goal, Villa looks just as secure behind a back
line of England center-back Gareth Southgate, the towering Ugo
Ehiogu and 17-year-old Gareth Barry, who is getting rave reviews.
	   Villa's midfield is well organized and Gregory can recall Paul
Merson, who was ineligible against Celta Vigo, to partner Stan
Collymore in attack.
	   It's a tough task for O'Neill's team although, in powerful
striker Emile Heskey and veteran goalscorer Tony Cottee, Leicester
has the firepower to cause an upset.
	   Manchester United goes to mid-standings Derby knowing that, if
Villa slips up at home to O'Neill's men, it still has a game in
hand.
	   Beaten only by defending titlist Arsenal, the Reds have won five
out of eight Premier League games and easily lead the scorers' list
with 18 goals.
	   Dwight Yorke has six goals and strike partner Andy Cole four and
the two are likely to team up against Jim Smith's Derby at Pride
Park.
	   Third place Middlesbrough goes to sliding Wimbledon, which was
trounced 5-1 by Manchester United last week. After that loss Dons
manager Joe Kinnear admitted there was a huge gulf between his team
and Alex Ferguson's stars and, in terms of spectator support and
financial muscle, few would disagree.
	   Because it was in European Cup Winners Cup action on Thursday,
fifth place Chelsea doesn't play again until Sunday, when it visits
Leeds. Defending champion Arsenal, which stayed fifth after a
disappointing 1-1 tie at home to last place Southampton last week,
also plays Sunday at third from last struggler Blackburn.
	   Sixth place Newcastle goes to lowly Tottenham while Liverpool,
which has taken only three points from its last five league games
and was held to a scoreless tie at home by Valencia in the UEFA Cup
on Tuesday, hopes to improve on its seventh place position with a
home victory over lowly Nottingham Forest.
	   Last place Southampton hosts next-to-last Coventry but can't
climb even with a win. The Saints are six points behind the Sky
Blues even after its encouraging tie at Arsenal.
	   In other games Saturday it is Charlton vs. West Ham and
Sheffield Wednesday vs. Everton.
	   After their 1-1 tie Wednesday, division one Huddersfield still
holds a two-point lead over second place Sunderland. On Saturday,
Huddersfield goes to Norwich while Sunderland another mid-standings
team, Bury.
	   With Scottish Premier League leader Glasgow Rangers playing a
League Cup semifinal against division one Airdrie, second place
Kilmarnock has the chance to go top by beating St. Johnstone at
home.

Official: No arrests to be made for Nigeria pipeline explosion

<TEXT>
	   JESSE, Nigeria (AP) _ No arrests will be made in connection with
the gasoline pipeline that erupted into an inferno over the
weekend, a top state official said Thursday, but Nigeria's state
petroleum corporation has reportedly said it will demand that
charges be pressed.
	   ``There is absolutely no truth in rumors that anybody will be
arrested in connection with this,'' Walter Fejhabo, the military
administrator of Delta State, told local leaders in Jesse.
	   The explosion and fire tore through Jesse on Saturday while up
to 1,000 people were trying to collect gasoline spilling from the
damaged government-owned pipeline. At least 700 people were killed,
state radio has said.
	   A newspaper report said, however, that Nigeria's state petroleum
corporation would ask for charges to be filed.
	   ``Anyone implicated in the vandalisation of the oil pipeline
leading to last Saturday's fire tragedy is to be arraigned,''
Dalhatu Bayero, chief executive of the Nigeria National Petroleum
Corporation, told the Vanguard newspaper.
	   The article indicated the company would demand that charges be
pressed against people implicated in initially opening the
pipeline, not the hundreds who later came to scoop up the gasoline.
	   It was not immediately clear whether the powerful petroleum
company could force the military administrator _ the equivalent of
a governor in Nigeria's military regime _ to reverse his decision.
	   Nigeria's ruling junta has not said if it has plans to file
charges, though it issued a statement Wednesday saying the incident
was sparked because of ``the greed of some of the people in the
community.''

Prosecutor questions retired naval officer charged with treason
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALICE LAGNADO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ A prosecutor on Thursday
questioned a retired naval officer who is on trial for treason
after giving a foreign environmental group information about how
Russia disposes of nuclear wastes.
	   Details of the proceedings against Alexander Nikitin, 46, are
sketchy, because the judge has closed the court to the media and
most other observers.
	   But Nikitin and his lawyers said they were cautiously optimistic
he would get a fair trial.
	   Nikitin is accused of giving secret documents to a Norwegian
environmental group, the Bellona Foundation, on the handling of
nuclear waste and reactors in the Russian navy's Northern Fleet.
	   Both Nikitin and Bellona say the information came from public
records. Nikitin's lawyers also argue that he was charged under
secret Defense Ministry laws, in violation of the Russian
Constitution.
	   Nikitin faces seven counts of treason. Prosecutors have asked
that he be sent to prison for 12 to 20 years.
	   ``I have a very good impression of today's proceedings,'' Yuri
Schmidt, a defense lawyer, said after the third day of proceedings.
	   Schmidt said prosecutor Alexander Gutzan ``asked very good and
clear questions.''
	   He said he was impressed with the way both judge and prosecutor
seemed to understand the case.
	   ``I don't know how the case will end, but it is always pleasant
to work with a judge who is able to get to the crux of the issue,''
he said.
	   The first three witnesses are expected to be called Friday:
Sergei Fillipov, a former employee of Bellona's Murmansk office,
retired navy officer Yevgeny Chernov, and a third unidentified
witness.
	   Yuly Rybakov, a Russian lawmaker who observed the trial Tuesday
and Wednesday, said Thursday that it seemed to be going well.
	   ``I think the result will be a positive one and I think Nikitin
will be freed,'' he said. ``I had the impression that the judge was
being rather calm and was looking at the case from an independent
point of view.''

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Share prices slipped but turnover rose
slightly on the stock exchange this week because of the improved
political climate in the Middle East, brokers said Thursday.
	   Brokers said the easing of tension between Syria and Turkey, as
well as U.S.-brokered peace talks between Israel and the
Palestinians, encouraged activity.
	   The market report, reflecting activity for five business days
ended Wednesday, said the 60-company general share prices index
declined 1.72 percent to 161.14 points.
	   Shares of commercial banks dropped 1.92 percent, industrial
companies 1.56 percent, insurance firms 0.25 percent and the
services sector 0.2 percent.
	   Turnover increased 12.5 percent to 4.5 million Jordanian dinars
(dlrs 6.3 million), the report said.
	   It said stocks of 93 firms were traded during the week.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Trading on the Baghdad Stock Exchange

Iraqi dinars (dlrs 204,175).

continued a downward trend this week closing at 2,007.8 points, or
1.65 percent lower than the previous week, a report said Thursday.
	   If it weren't for demand for the stocks of two local banks and
the good prices of several Gulf companies, the index would have

Interpol needs to revamp strategy to keep abreast of crime
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TAREK EL-TABLAWY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Interpol must adopt a new strategy for
combating increasingly sophisticated crime syndicates if it wants
to remain viable in the coming century, the organization's
president said Thursday.
	   The criminal environment has changed at ``much greater pace''
than Interpol itself, Toshinori Kanemoto told the opening session
of the 67th general assembly of the Interpol or the International
Criminal Police Organization.
	   A failure to change Interpol's strategy means the organization
``risks being displaced against a backdrop of international
organized crime,'' he said.
	   Kanemoto said the new Interpol strategy would be discussed at
the six-day meeting and, if adopted, would be put into effect next
January.
	   The former Japanese police official said the meeting also would
discuss terrorism, which he called one of the ``new forms of
criminality,'' as well as the illegal drug trade and money
laundering.
	   With crime becoming increasingly sophisticated, Kanemoto said,
it has become harder for police officials to gather evidence for
prosecution. He said these new challenges require increased
cooperation, particularly through Interpol.
	   Up for discussion by international police officials attending
the conference is a strategic development plan aimed making
Interpol more ``proactive'' by re-examining the needs of the
group's 177-member states, Kanemoto said.
	   The plan ``is our future, our road map for the 21st century,''
he said.
	   Details of the plan were not available, but officials said it
would call for more exacting selection procedures for staff of
Interpol and increasing the focus on analysis.
	   The strategy could also seek to target outside sources of
funding, such as from the private sector, since increased funding
is key to Interpol's continued viability, Kanemoto said.
	   Interpol officials would not discuss in detail their strategy
for combatting terrorism.
	   In his address to the delegates, Egypt's Interior Minister Habib
el-Adli urged Interpol member states to cooperate in combating what
he called the global phenomenon of terrorism, and added that
``hesitation in the face of terrorism is impossible.''
	   The issue is of prime importance to Egypt, where 67 foreign
tourists were murdered in two terrorist attacks within three months
last year.

Zimbabwean reinforcements headed to Congo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Soldiers, armored personnel carriers and
artillery pieces left Harare on Thursday, apparently headed for
Congo for a promised new offensive against Congolese rebels.
	   Congo President Laurent Kabila's allies Angola, Namibia and
Zimbabwe agreed Wednesday to attack the rebels in their stronghold
_ the dense jungles of eastern Congo. Rwanda and Uganda reportedly
back the rebels.
	   Civilian hospital officials in Harare reported being asked to
assist in an inoculation program over coming days for soldiers
believed destined for the steamy, insect-infested jungles.
	   Coming rains are expected to close many roads and hamper the
allies' advantage of air support.
	   The announcement of the offensive is expected to lead to a major
escalation of the conflict that began on Aug. 2 when rebels started
their drive to topple Kabila.
	   Harare-based defense analyst Michael Quintana said the allied
troops that fended off rebel advances on the western Congolese
capital of Kinshasa will have to contend with extended supply lines
in their offensive. The rebels will be closer to their supply
bases.
	   ``The rebels ... are likely to roll with the allied punch, bide
their time and then come back with a sting,'' he said.
	   Quintana said allied reinforcements would be needed to hold
Kinshasa and other government-controlled areas as the offensive
proceeds toward rebel-held territory.
	   Residents on the main route to Harare's Manyame military airbase
reported seeing convoys of troops, munitions, armored cars and
trucks towing artillery headed toward the base Thursday.
	   Military transport airplanes were seen taking off, witnesses
said.
	   There was no official word on how many reinforcements were on
their way to join about 3,000 troops already in the Congo.
	   ``We are working in line with what the heads of government
decided yesterday,'' said Col. Chancellor Diye, spokesman for the
Zimbabwe National Army. He would not elaborate.
	   Rwandan Vice President Gen. Paul Kagame, meanwhile, met with
South African President Nelson Mandela on Thursday in Pretoria,
South Africa's capital.
	   Mandela has been trying to broker a peace accord for Congo. No
details about the discussions would be released to the media, said
Mandela's spokesman, Parks Mankahlana.

Food: what to export to Asia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Ostrich meat to Japan, sports drinks
and yogurt to China, spanner crabs to Taiwan, live eels to South
Korea and lettuce and frozen mackerel to the Philippines are some
of more than 350 opportunities for food exports identified in an
Australian government study issued Thursday.
	   The study was undertaken by the government's Australian Trade
Commission and Supermarket to Asia Ltd., which has a brief from
Prime Minister John Howard to expand food exports to Asia.
	   Despite serious economic challenges confronting some Asian
nations, ``the bottom line is that there are still good profitable
growth opportunities for sales of Australian food to Asia,'' Trade
Minister Tim Fischer said.
	   Food is a major export from Australia, worth about 10 billion
Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 6.5 billion).
	   Asian nations are Australia's major customers for meats, grains,
dairy products, sugar, seafood, fruits, vegetables and processed
foods.
	   The study focused on opportunities in China, Hong Kong, India,
Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, South
Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam, which collectively import 130
billion Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 81 billion) of food a year.
	   Japan is the biggest market, with food imports of around 70
billion Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 44 billion) a year.
	   Key factors driving expected medium-term growth of this export
trade include increasing dependency on food imports by many Asian
nations because of population growth and urbanization, the study
said.
	   The study also cited an increased Westernization of Asian diets,
modernization of food retailing and service sectors, a need for
specialized imported ingredients for local manufacture and an
easing of trade barriers.
	   Demand also has risen for quality, fresh and healthy
Western-style food among middle- and upper-class groups in Asia.
	   Some markets in Asia might take longer to recover than others,
but the study indicated ``food exports should begin to increase
strongly again within two years.''

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Western officials pressed both
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and the ethnic Albanians on
Thursday to do more to achieve lasting peace in the embattled
province.
	   The French foreign minister warned that Milosevic must still
pull out more troops, and U.S. envoy Christopher Hill and European
ambassadors pressed their political initiative in new talks with
ethnic Albanian political leader Ibrahim Rugova.
	   Concerned by continuing sporadic violence, a European envoy said
attacks by the Albanians' Kosovo Liberation Army could put efforts
to reach a peaceful political solution in ``serious jeopardy.''
	   ``We ask Kosovo people and especially the armed forces, Kosovo
forces, to stop any provocations,'' said Wolfgang Petrisch, the
Austrian ambassador to Yugoslavia and European Union envoy in
Kosovo, after meeting with Rugova.
	   Ten days after the breakthrough agreement on Kosovo brokered by
American diplomat Richard Holbrooke, there are still reports of
shelling and shooting incidents at night in the separatist province
of Serbia.
	   The Kosovo Information Center said four members of an ethnic
Albanian family _ three of them children _ were killed and two
wounded early Thursday when the Yugoslav army opened fire near
Djakovica on the Albanian border. The center, close to the
province's ethnic Albanian leadership, said the victims were
refugees who were crossing back over from Albania to return to
their homes.
	   The report could not be confirmed.
	   Still threatening airstrikes, NATO has given Milosevic until
Tuesday to withdraw more military and special police forces from
Kosovo and return others to garrison in the province where he
launched an offensive against ethnic Albanian guerrillas eight
months ago.
	   ``The withdrawal of forces is very advanced, but that is not
enough,'' French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said on France's
RTL radio Thursday, warning that the conflict could explode again.
NATO must ``not let go'' now, he said.
	   Milosevic also must cooperate with war crimes investigations and
efforts to aid and return the 300,000 people displaced from their
homes, and agree on a specific timetable for talks giving Kosovo
Albanians self-government and their own local police.
	   But the ethnic Albanians must consent to such political
negotiations, and many remain reluctant to give up their goal of
outright independence, which the West opposes for fear of
triggering similar demands elsewhere in the Balkans.
	   While the KLA has been fighting for independence, the West
considers the moderate Rugova and his negotiating team the
legitimate representatives of Kosovo Albanians, who account for
about 90 percent of the province's 2 million people.
	   Rugova said his team was working out what he called an ``interim
solution'' with Hill.
	   He also made clear he does not support the recent attacks by the
KLA, over which he has no control.
	   ``We urge also all groups of people to demonstrate
self-restraint so any act of theirs is not used as a provocation,
namely as a pretext for new assaults on Kosovo,'' Rugova said after
meeting the European envoys.
	   Meanwhile, efforts to organize a 2,000-strong team to verify
compliance with the peace deal appeared stalled because would-be
contributor nations are concerned about safety and want the U.N.
Security Council to endorse the plan first.
	   The operation is to be directed by the Vienna, Austria-based
Organization for Security and Cooperation, which must ask its 54
member states to provide the Kosovo monitors.
	   ``Obviously, the physical security of 2,000 people in a zone of
turmoil, of conflict, is of utmost importance,'' said the American
head of the operation, William G. Walker.

Hand grenade kills two children, injures nine in Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD Iraq (AP) _ A hand grenade exploded on a school yard in
Baghdad, killing two children and seriously wounding nine others, a
state-run magazine reported Thursday.
	   Al-Zawra said the grenade was in a parcel given to a child
outside the school by an unidentified driver as a present to the
headmaster. The grenade exploded as the boy was on his way to
deliver the package.
	   The weekly did not say when the incident took place. It said the
authorities were ``investigating this horrible act.''
	   Incidents such as the explosion are rarely reported by the
official media.

	   JESSE, Nigeria (AP) _ No arrests will be made in connection with
the gasoline pipeline that erupted into an inferno over the
weekend, a top state official said Thursday, but Nigeria's state
petroleum corporation has reportedly said it will demand that
charges be pressed.
	   ``There is absolutely no truth in rumors that anybody will be
arrested in connection with this,'' Walter Fejhabo, the military
administrator of Delta State, told local leaders in Jesse.
	   The explosion and fire tore through Jesse on Saturday while up
to 1,000 people were trying to collect gasoline spilling from the
damaged government-owned pipeline. At least 700 people were killed,
state radio has said.
	   A newspaper report said, however, that Nigeria's state petroleum
corporation would ask for charges to be filed.
	   ``Anyone implicated in the vandalisation of the oil pipeline
leading to last Saturday's fire tragedy is to be arraigned,''
Dalhatu Bayero, chief executive of the Nigeria National Petroleum
Corporation, told the Vanguard newspaper.
	   The article indicated the company would demand that charges be
pressed against people implicated in initially opening the
pipeline, not the hundreds who later came to scoop up the gasoline.
	   It was not immediately clear whether the powerful petroleum
company could force the military administrator _ the equivalent of
a governor in Nigeria's military regime _ to reverse his decision.
	   Nigeria's ruling junta has not said if it has plans to file
charges, though it issued a statement Wednesday saying the incident
was sparked because of ``the greed of some of the people in the
community.''

KLA confirms it holds two Serb journalists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The Kosovo Liberation Army confirmed
Thursday it was holding two Serb journalists captive, and said they
might soon be released.
	   Vladimir Dobricic and Nebojsa Radosevic, a reporter and
photographer for state-run Tanjug news agency, disappeared Sunday
near the village of Magura, 25 kilometers (15 miles) southwest of
the capital Pristina.
	   The ethnic Albanian guerrillas, fighting Serb and Yugoslav
government forces for independence of Kosovo, said in a statement
distributed to ethnic Albanian media that the two were detained
after a KLA patrol ran across them.
	   ``An investigation has been conducted on whether they had taken
part in the Serb regime's war against the Albanian people and they
will most probably be released,'' the KLA said. Their release would
probably be organized through the International Committee of the
Red Cross, it said.
	   Since the clashes in Kosovo started eight months ago, the Serbs
have accused the KLA of kidnapping more than 100 Serb civilians,
allegedly killing some. Last August, another Serb journalist and
his driver disappeared. They have not been found.

EU Parliament votes to unblock 1999 aid funds
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Parliament agreed Thursday
to release the European Union's humanitarian aid budget for 1999
despite recent fraud allegations.
	   The EU assembly, meeting in Strasbourg, France, voted 421-81 to
unblock 330 million European currency units (dlrs 396 million) in
humanitarian aid for next year. There were eight abstentions.
	   Recent fraud allegations have focused the disappearance of
540,000 ecu (dlrs 594,000) from aid contracts earmarked for
ex-Yugoslavia and Rwanda in 1993-1994.
	   Last month, the Parliament's committee on budgetary controls
voted in favor of freezing 1999 funding for the EU's Humanitarian
Office until the fraud suspicions had been cleared up.
	   But the Parliament eased its stance after it received assurances
by Jacques Santer, president of the European Commission, that
further efforts would be made to monitor spending.
	   Santer proposed to create an anti-fraud unit that would be
independent from the Commission. The EU Parliament had raised
suspicions that the EU executive body's in-house fraud unit helped
hide corruption.

China's policy change allows Japanese media to open Taiwan bureaus
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan on Thursday welcomed plans by
Japanese media to open bureaus here, made possible by a relaxation
of China's position on media contacts with the island it considers
a breakaway province.
	   Requests have been approved for the newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun
and Kyodo, Japan's largest news agency, to set up bureaus in
Taipei, said the Government Information Office, which oversees
media. The newspapers Asahi and Nihon Keizai Shimbun have also
filed applications, it said.
	   Previously, Sankei Shimbun was the only Japanese newspaper that
maintained a bureau in Taiwan, for which it was barred from
operating in Beijing. China's decision to permit it to have bureaus
on both sides of the Taiwan Strait opened the door for those other
publications to open Taiwan offices, augmenting their part-time
news-gathering activities here.
	   China claims Taiwan as a renegade province belonging to it, and
seeks to stifle the island's voice in the international community.
Without representation in the United Nations, and with only 27
countries that formally recognize it, Taiwan relies heavily on the
international media to get its message across.
	   ``Increased reporting on developments in the Republic of China
will substantially aid exchanges and understanding between the two
countries,'' government spokesman Chen Chien-jen said in a
statement, referring to Taiwan's government by its official name.

Billionaire Anschutz buys Galaxy for dlrs 26 million
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Denver-based billionaire Philip Anschutz
added the Los Angeles Galaxy to his list of holdings and now owns
control of three Major League Soccer teams.
	   The dlrs 26 million sale was completed Wednesday with unanimous
approval by the MLS management committee in New York. Formal
announcement was planned for Friday, the Los Angeles Times reported
on Thursday.
	   Anschutz also owns the league's Colorado Rapids and the Chicago
Fire.
	   The Galaxy will continue to play at the Rose Bowl for at least
one more season, the newspaper reported. After that, it could share
a stadium with a future National Football League team in Los
Angeles or build its own soccer-specific stadium.
	   The Galaxy has been called MLS' glamour team, having attracted
such name players as Mexican goalkeeper Jorge Campos and forward
Carlos Hermosillo. It also has led the league in attendance two of
the league's three years of existence.
	   It had this season's best record but was eliminated by the
Chicago Fire in the playoff semifinals.
	   The dlrs 26 million is the most paid for an MLS team, dwarfing
the dlrs 5 million cost for an charter team. Ken Horowitz paid dlrs
20 million for the expansion Miami Fusion and earlier this year
Alan Rothenberg led a consortium including 1984 Olympic head Peter
Ueberroth and Japanese advertising firm Dentsu that purchased the
San Jose Clash for dlrs 25 million.
	   Antschutz is purchasing the club from Los Angeles Soccer
Partners, a group of a dozen or more investors led by investment
banker Marc Rapaport.
	   ``My heart and my head are in different places,'' Rapaport said
of the sale, adding that owning the Galaxy had been a positive
experience.
	   ``Our investors are happy, and the ones who have come to the
games and gotten involved with the team I think share our emotional
attachment to the team,'' he said. ``But at the end of the day, if
we wanted Los Angeles' team to continue to grow and prosper, I
think we needed to get it in deeper pockets.''
	   Rapaport said that ownership by Anschutz is logical, given his
already substantial holdings in Los Angeles.
	   Anschutz owns Los Angeles Kings of the North American National
Hockey League and Staples Center, which will be the home of the
Kings next year.
	   Galaxy president and general manager Danny Villanueva also was
one of its owners.
	   He gives way to Tim Leiweke, president of the Kings and the new
president of the Galaxy. Leiweke, who along with his brothers Todd
and Terry were involved in the old Major Indoor Soccer League, said
he will meet with the Galaxy staff and players on Thursday to
outline plans for the future.
	   ``We want to do this quickly so that we don't leave people
hanging,'' he said. ``We want to keep the good talent. If there are
those who aren't focused or have no burning desire to take this
organization to the next level, they won't make it through the
process.''

Gadhafi leaves Tunisia after hip surgery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi left Tunisia for home
Thursday after convalescing for four days in a desert oasis
following a hip injury, Tunisian state radio said.
	   Gadhafi traveled from the Tozeur oasis by road to Libya because
of 1992 U.N. Security Council sanctions that ban direct flights to
and from his country.
	   The sanctions are aimed at forcing Gadhafi to surrender two
Libyans wanted in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jetliner of
Lockerbie, Scotland that killed 270 people.
	   Gadhafi was in Tunisia at the invitation of President Zine El
Abidine Ben Ali for a visit ``of brotherhood and rest.'' The
Tunisian leader was on hand to bid his Libyan neighbor farewell.
	   It was Gadhafi's first known trip abroad since officials said he
injured his hip while exercising in June.
	   During Gadhafi's visit, the Tunisian leader expressed his
``solidarity'' with Libya over its refusal to hand over the two
Lockerbie suspects.
	   Tunisia on Tuesday also reiterated its call to lift the embargo
that has isolated Libya.
	   The U.N. Security Council has agreed to end the sanctions once
Libya turns the men over for a trial by Scottish judges according
to Scottish law in the Netherlands, under a U.S.-British proposal.
	   Gadhafi has said he would hand them over but demands any
sentences be served in prisons in the Netherlands or Libya.

Talks to return UN to Kabul in final stage
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with talks to resume Friday, quotes from Taliban
negotiator. &QL; 
 &UR; With Afghanistan-Suffering Poor &QL; 
 &UR; By KATHY GANNON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ The United Nations and Afghanistan's
Taliban religious army moved closer Thursday to an agreement to
restart U.N. operations in the war-ravaged nation after a
disruption of nearly two months.
	   ``We're finished 95 percent of the agreement and tomorrow
(Friday) we will sign a joint agreement,'' said Sher Mohammed
Stanikzai, a chief negotiator for the Taliban.
	   The Taliban and U.N. negotiators have been holding talks in
neighboring Pakistan since Tuesday. It had been believed an
agreement would be finalized Thursday, but Stanikzai said meetings
began late and the final details are being hammered out.
	   ``Our aim is to assure the Unite Nations about its security
concerns,'' said Stanikzai, who also is deputy public health
minister in the Taliban's government.
	   The Taliban, which control about 90 percent of Afghanistan, are
locked in a fierce battle with its northern-based enemies on
several fronts, including barely 20 kilometers (12 miles) north of
the capital of Kabul.
	   The core of the United Nations' concerns has been security
following the killings of three of its staff members in July and
August.
	   Carmine Calo, of Italy, a military advisor for the United
Nations was shot and killed in Kabul on Aug. 21 in apparent
retaliation for the U.S. missile attack on suspected terrorist
camps in eastern Afghanistan.
	   In late July the bodies of two Afghan U.N. workers, Mohammed
Hashim Bahsaryar and Mohammed Nasser Habibi, were found bound in
eastern Nangarhar province, also controlled by the Taliban.
	   The United Nations wants guarantees and proof from the Taliban
that they are making progress on their investigations into the
killings, said Sarah Russell, a spokeswoman for the United Nations
in Pakistan.
	   An estimated 50 international U.N. workers have been pulled out
of Afghanistan affecting programs, like the clearing of land mines,
repairs to crucial water systems and the distribution of emergency
program.
	   ``The U.N. is keen to go back and we are keen to have them
back,'' said Stanikzai.
	   The United Nations also wants the Taliban to release arrested
U.N. staff within 24 hours if no charges are brought. It also wants
security guarantees for U.N. premises, vehicles and equipment.
	   ``We need to get back ... winter is coming,'' said Russell.
	   But an agreement does not mean an immediate resumption of U.N.
programs.
	   ``The next step will be to assess the security situation on the
ground,'' she said.
	   As well the U.N. wants to be sure that the Taliban can deliver
on the security guarantees.
	   It is expected to take about one month to get U.N. operations up
and running, said Russell.

Poland's president signs screening law
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ President Aleksander Kwasniewski
reluctantly signed a controversial law Thursday that could uncover
communist-era secret service collaborators running for public
office.
	   Despite legal objections to the law, Kwasniewski, an
ex-communist, was left no choice but to sign it after the nation's
highest court on Wednesday ruled it constitutional. He had appealed
to the Constitutional Tribunal to review the draft, claiming it
encroached on citizens' rights.
	   The law requires elected officials to state whether they
collaborated with the communist secret service and allows a special
prosecutor appointed by the Supreme Court to investigate the
truthfulness of the statements. Those proven to have lied could be
evicted from office, and would be barred from top state posts.
	   The law also allows Poles access for the first time to their own
files.
	   It renewed debate in Poland about whether communist-era files,
widely believed to contain lies entered by the feared secret
police, should be opened, and whether those who collaborated with
the former communist regime should be exposed.
	   Poland toppled the communist-regime in 1989. Communist-era
leaders, however, participated in the transformation to democratic
reforms and only this year did Poland's center-right parliament
issue a formal condemnation of communists who ruled Poland for four
decades.
	   The screening bill, supported by center and right-wing parties
that control parliament, has come under fire from the ex-communist
parliamentary minority who argue their political opponents want to
use it against them.
	   Under the law, an Institute of National Remembrance will be set
up to collect communist files from 1944-89, as well as documents of
Stalinist and Nazi crimes, which will make the files available to
victims of the totalitarian regimes and reveal who informed on
them.
	   The screening process is expected to start next year as there
have been no funds assigned for it in this year's budget.

Australia's Labor Party turns on former leader over rumors
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with reaction from Keating and Hayden &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australia's main opposition Labor
Party turned Thursday on one of its elder statesmen, accusing him
of spreading malicious gossip about former Prime Minister Paul
Keating.
	   Bill Hayden, a former Labor leader and governor-general, told a
court Wednesday about false rumors that Keating had an extramarital
affair and liked young boys.
	   Hayden said he told the tales as an example of how false rumors
can damage politicians' reputations and haunt their careers.
	   Labor leaders past and present condemned Hayden's comments about
Keating, suggesting they were motivated by a desire for revenge.
	   In 1983, Keating helped oust Hayden as Labor leader on the eve
of an election in which his replacement, Bob Hawke, became prime
minister. Keating succeeded Hawke and Hayden was later appointed
governor-general, the Queen's representative and titular head of
state in Australia.
	   Hayden was giving evidence in a defamation case in which
conservative Treasurer Peter Costello, his wife Tanya, and
Employment Services Minister Tony Abbott and his wife, Margaret,
are suing publisher Random House over the book ``Goodbye
Jerusalem,'' by Labor Party author and speechwriter Bob Ellis.
	   The book falsely accused the two ministers of changing their
political allegiances to the Liberal Party _ now in government _
after they slept with a woman whom one of them later married.
	   The book was withdrawn from sale and Ellis has offered an
apology.
	   Former Labor minister Bob Collins said Hayden's comments were a
deliberate tactic to publicize rumors about Keating.
	   ``What he did was to cold-bloodedly promulgate absolutely
vicious and completely untrue, ludicrous in fact, rumors that have
been doing the rounds for years,'' Collins told Australian
Broadcasting Corp. radio.
	   ``And why? Bill obviously considers himself being cheated of the
prime ministership of Australia.''
	   Current Labor leader Kim Beazley said Hayden's comments were
totally unnecessary.
	   Other Labor members of Parliament also said they were a vicious
attempt at revenge.
	   Keating declined to comment directly, instead thanking his
colleagues for their reaction.
	   ``Everything that should be said about Bill Hayden has probably
been said, eloquently, by the media and some of my Labor
colleagues,'' Keating said.
	   One newspaper report Thursday said Hayden was a cowardly ``rat''
whose words had the effect of plunging ``a knife dipped in venom
into Mr. Keating's back.''
	   In court, lawyers told Judge Terence Higgins that Hayden had
informed them that he was dismayed at the publicity his remarks had
received.

Report: police investigating claim that drug smugglers murdered

infants &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: ADDS details of one reported incident. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ A suspect in a drugs-related murder claims
that smugglers have brought heroin into the country in the corpses
of murdered infants, the Dagbladet newspaper reported Thursday.
	   The newspaper said its report was based on a confidential
transcript of a police interrogation in Stavanger, a main port city
in Norway's southwest.
	   Police on Thursday afternoon declined comment on the report.
	   The newspaper said the suspect claimed that smugglers of
Vietnamese origin bought infants from prostitutes in Paris and
Hamburg, Germany, and took them to Denmark where they were killed.
The corpses were then filled with bags of heroin, and brought to
Norway by women pretending to be the infants' mothers, the suspect
claimed, according to the report.
	   ``They left their own babies at home, and went to Denmark where
they were given a prepared baby,'' the newspaper quoted the police
transcript as saying. ``If customs officers started to look too
closely, the women would say the baby was ill and ask to be allowed
to immediately rush it to a doctor.''
	   The 26-year-old suspect, arrested for a drug-related murder this
year, claimed that the Vietnamese drug ring's leader had told him
about the practice.
	   According to the newspaper, the suspect said he was at the ring
leader's Oslo apartment on one occasion when a woman arrived with a
baby, went into a back room with the ring leader and emerged with
two bags of heroin stained with blood. She did not take the baby
when she left the apartment, the suspect reportedly said.

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Outgoing Chancellor Helmut Kohl will be
named honorary chairman for life of his Christian Democratic Union,
the departing party chairman said Thursday.
	   The party's steering committee also nominated Kohl's environment
minister, Angela Merkel, to replace Peter Hintze as party general
secretary.
	   The party was expected to pass both nominations, as well as
Wolfgang Schaeuble as the new party chairman, during its congress
Nov. 7.
	   Merkel, 44, is head of the Christian Democrats in the eastern
state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, and would be the first
former East German to hold the key party post.
	   Hintze, who ran the party's campaign, announced after last
month's election loss to the Social Democrats that he would step
down.
	   Kohl also announced he would step down as party chief, a post he
held for 25 years. Schaeuble, the party's parliamentary faction
leader, had been hand-picked by Kohl as his desired successor.
	   The steering committee also decided that outgoing Transport
Minister Matthias Wissmann would be in charge of party finances.
Party members were to decide later on who would be named to the
four posts of vice chairman.

Ronaldo returns to Serie A action for Juventus showdown
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Ronaldo is back, and Internazionale of Milan could
be back in business.
	   The big-spending club, whose stated objective this season is its
first Italian League title in 10 years, had alternated poor outings
with poorer ones while its Brazilian star was sidelined for five
weeks with tendinitis in both knees.
	   But the two-time FIFA Player of the Year played 72 solid minutes
Wednesday, setting up one goal and scoring the other in a 2-1
Champions League win over Spartak Moscow.
	   He returns to Serie A action Sunday night and the timing could
not be better: Inter travels to Turin for a showdown with two-time
defending champion Juventus.
	   ``I want to be there in Turin. Two games in four days doesn't
seem prohibitive,'' Ronaldo said. ``Physically, I'm fine. I just
need to polish my game and I can do that only by playing
regularly.''
	   That is one of two games pitting clubs perched near the top of
the table, with AC Milan hosting hot AS Roma in the other.
	   Fiorentina, which hosts last-place Salernitana, leads the
standings with 12 points. Juventus, Inter and Roma all have 10,
while Milan and AC Parma are just one more point back.
	   Other games Sunday are Bologna vs. Piacenza, Cagliari vs. Bari,
Lazio of Rome vs. Vicenza, Perugia vs. Parma, Sampdoria of Genoa
vs. Empoli, and Udinese vs. Venezia.
	   Inter blew a chance to move into sole possession of first place
last week, when it was demolished by Lazio 5-3 in a game that was
even more lopsided than the score.
	   The fallout from that game will be felt Sunday.
	   The rout prompted Inter to push Ronaldo back onto the field,
even if he still is not 100 percent. Coach Luigi Simoni also
appears to have given forgotten Portuguese midfielder Paolo Sousa
another opportunity.
	   Nicola Ventola, a 20-year-old striker who has made the most of
his chances as a substitute, was moved into the starting lineup
Wednesday and should stay there against Juventus, in part also
because French World Cup striker Youri Djorkaeff has a strained
right thigh muscle.
	   Ventola earned his shot to play regularly by putting the ball in
the net. His average of one goal for every 42 minutes played leads
the league.
	   Also, Argentine midfielder Diego Simeone stomped on a Lazio
opponent and begins serving a two-game suspension this week.
Juventus defender Alessandro Birindelli is also suspended.
	   Juventus could use a convincing performance, and French standout
Zinedine Zidane was quite critical of the club.
	   ``We need to improve our conditioning, ball possession and
aggressiveness,'' the playmaker said after a 0-0 draw against
Athletic Bilbao in Champions League play.
	   Roma goes to Milan looking to build on last week's miraculous
2-1 upset of Fiorentina.
	   It won't be easy without midfielder Luigi Di Biagio, who must
serve suspensions in three competitions (league, Italian Cup, UEFA
Cup). Czech coach Zdenek Zeman is reportedly considering giving
Daniele Conti, son of 1970s and 1980s star Bruno, his first career
Serie A start.

Heavy losses at Rover threaten British car plant
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Mandelson comment &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ Trade Secretary Peter Mandelson told
bosses of the BMW-owned car manufacturer Rover Group on Thursday
that he will not intervene in the crisis over heavy losses which
may force the company to cut 2,400 British jobs.
	   During an hour-long meeting in his London office, Mandelson told
BMW chairman Bernd Pischetsrieder and Rover chairman Walter
Hasselkus that the government will provide only ``goodwill and
support.''
	   In a statement, Mandelson said there are ``both immediate
decisions to be taken about costs at Longbridge'' _ the auto
maker's giant plant near Birmingham, central England, where most
jobs will go _ ``and long-term investment decisions for the company
as a whole.''
	   ``But without the immediate problems being solved it will be
very difficult for the future to fall into place,'' said Mandelson,
who told Parliament on Wednesday that the company's future is in
its own hands.
	   Pischetsrieder and Hasselkus called the meeting constructive.
``We informed the government of what the situation is,''
Pischetsrieder told reporters as he left.
	   BMW has set a six-week deadline for gaining union agreement to
cut 2,400 jobs from Rover's 39,000 British workforce, mostly at
Longbridge, which employs 14,000 people.
	   Several unions have held urgent talks with BMW to avert the
closure of the plant.
	   ``Without major surgery to cut costs immediately, via
significant job losses alongside cuts to employment-related and
other costs, there will not be a supportable survival plan to place
before the BMW board,'' the unions said Wednesday, adding that the
future of the plant remained ``in the balance.''
	   The company has become more productive since BMW bought it from
British Aerospace PLC in 1994, but the high value of the pound has
made its automobiles far less competitive in other markets, while
making imported cars cheaper for British consumers.
	   Union leader Tony Woodley said Wednesday that ``the company have
made it clear that they are sustaining losses that are completely
unacceptable and ... it is their intention to try and cut costs in
a number of areas as soon as possible.''

Interpol needs to revamp strategy to keep abreast of crime
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TAREK EL-TABLAWY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Interpol must modernize if it wants to
effectively fight increasingly sophisticated crime syndicates in
the next century, the police organization's president said
Thursday.
	   The criminal environment has changed at ``much greater pace''
than Interpol, Toshinori Kanemoto told the opening session of the
67th general assembly of the International Criminal Police
Organization.
	   A failure to modernize Interpol could mean the organization
``risks being displaced against a backdrop of international
organized crime,'' he said.
	   Kanemoto said a new Interpol strategy will be discussed at the
six-day assembly and, if adopted, would be put into effect next
January.
	   The former Japanese police official said the assembly also will
discuss terrorism, which he called one of the ``new forms of
criminality,'' as well as the illegal drug trade and money
laundering.
	   With crime becoming increasingly sophisticated, Kanemoto said,
it has become harder for police officials to gather evidence for
prosecution. He said these new challenges require increased
cooperation, particularly through Interpol.
	   The police officials are expected to discuss a strategic
development plan aimed making Interpol more proactive by
re-examining the needs of the group's 177-member states, Kanemoto
said.
	   Details of the plan were not available, but officials said it
would call for more exacting selection procedures for staff of
Interpol and increasing the focus on analysis.
	   The strategy could also seek to target outside sources of
funding, such as from the private sector, since increased funding
is key to Interpol's continued viability, Kanemoto said.
	   Egypt's Interior Minister Habib el-Adli urged Interpol member
states to cooperate in combating what he called the global
phenomenon of terrorism, and added that ``hesitation in the face of
terrorism is impossible.''
	   The issue is of prime importance to Egypt, where 67 foreign
tourists were murdered in two terrorist attacks within three months
last year.

	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ The Bank of Cyprus, the largest financial
institution on this Mediterranean island, said Thursday it would
issue subordinated bonds worth 25 million Cyprus pounds (dlrs 51.5
million) to boost the banking group's capital.
	   It said the issue would be due 2003-2008. The bonds are to be
issued in December with an interest rate of 7.25 percent, and the
rate will be reviewed at six-month intervals, it said.
	   ``The purpose of the issue is to strengthen the group's capital
base and to support the group's projects, both in Cyprus and
abroad,'' it said.
	   News of the issue pushed up the bank's share price on the Cyprus
bourse by 6.5 Cypriot cents (3.1 cents) to close Thursday at 3.63
pounds (dlrs 7.47).
	   The Bank of Cyprus, which celebrates 100 years in business in
1999, had a market capital of 423.1 million pounds (dlrs 871.5
million) at the end of last month, accounting for nearly 35 per
cent of the bourse's capitalization.

	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Tourist arrivals were 11.2 per cent
higher in August than in the same month a year earlier, giving
further support for expectations that 1998 will be a record year.
	   The Department of Statistics and Research said Thursday that a
total of 326,854 tourists arrived in August, compared with 293,887
in August 1997.
	   Britons accounted for 44.2 percent of them. Russian tourists
were a distant second, accounting for 12.2 percent.
	   Foreign exchange receipts from tourism reached dlrs 1.85 billion
in 1997, when a total of 2.08 tourists visited the island. The
tourism industry is expected to bring in close to dlrs 2 billion in
hard currency this year.

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ A delegation of 83 American businessmen
arrived here Thursday to discuss investing in postwar Lebanon.
	   The group, which is touring the region, flew in from Jordan. It
also will visit Syria.
	   During the two-day visit here, the American executives and
economists will meet Lebanese officials, including Prime Minister
Rafik Hariri, to discuss investment opportunities.
	   Lebanon has launched a multibillion-dollar program to rebuild
from its devastating 1975-90 civil war.

Greek jets hit mock targets in Cyprus war games
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HAMZA HENDAWI &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) - Greek warplanes hit mock targets in the
Nicosia area Thursday, the third day of joint Greek and Cypriot war
games that have raised new tensions on this divided Mediterranean
island.
	   The Cypriot Defense Ministry also accused Turkish aircraft of
violating Cypriot air space for the second time since the joint
maneuvers with Greece began Tuesday.
	   The Defense Ministry said four F-16 fighter jets and two A-7
Corsair bombers from Greece's air force took part in the drill over
Nicosia.
	   It did not say whether the planes returned to Greece or landed
at a controversial military field near Paphos in western Cyprus. It
added that the jets would take part in further exercises Friday.
	   The six-day war games, held under the provisions of a 1993
defense pact between Cyprus and Greece, will end Sunday with a
military parade in the southern resort town of Larnaca. They
maneuvers have raised tension on the island, where Greek Cypriot
and Turkish Cypriot community are divided by a U.N. buffer zone.
	   The Defense Ministry statement Thursday said Turkish jets
invaded Cyprus air space between 11:40 a.m. and 12:35 p.m.
(0940-1035gmt), flying over Larnaca and Paphos. It gave no details.
	   Both Cyprus and Greece accused Turkish craft of buzzing Greek
military aircraft and violated Greece's air space Tuesday. One of
the planes allegedly buzzed was a Greek Air Force transport plane
flying to Paphos.
	   Turkey, both Greece's NATO partner and traditional enemy, denied
it invaded Cypriot airspace on Tuesday. It had no immediate
response Thursday.
	   Turkey's forces have occupied the northern third of Cyprus since
its invasion of the island in 1974 following a coup by Greek
Cypriots who wanted to unite the island with Greece.
	   The air base in Paphos, completed in February, was built for the
use of Greek warplanes in the case of an outbreak of hostilities on
the island.
	   The Cypriot Defense Ministry said Wednesday that five Greek
naval vessels _ a submarine, a frigate, a destroyer and two torpedo
boats _ also would take part in the war games.
	   Such high-profile Greek military presence in Cyprus invariably
triggers swift response from Turkey. It dispatched fighter jets to
the northern third of the island last March in response to the
landing of Greek warplanes for the first time at the Paphos base.
	   The Greek Cypriot government is the only internationally
recognized administration on the island. A breakaway state in the
Turkish-occupied north was declared in 1983 but is recognized only
by Ankara.

Depression in Caribbean Sea could become storm
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MIAMI (AP) _ A tropical depression over the Caribbean Sea was
expected to strengthen into a tropical storm Thursday.
	   An advisory was in effect for the North Atlantic, Caribbean Sea
and the Gulf of Mexico, forecasters at the National Hurricane
Center said.
	   A large area of disturbed weather changed little in organization
overnight but was beginning to interact with a frontal system,
increasing the system's potential to become a tropical storm.
	   Sustained wind near the center was blowing at about 35 mph and
was likely to reach tropical storm strength of at least 39 mph
Thursday afternoon, forecaster Ed Rappaport said.
	   At 5 a.m. EDT, the center of the poorly organized depression was
located about 380 miles south-southwest of Kingston, Jamaica.
	   A reconnaissance plane was scheduled to fly into the area
Thursday if necessary, Rappaport said.
	   The combination of the depression and a cold front was forecast
to continue producing rain and gusty winds over northeastern Mexico
and portions of the southern Texas coast.

Drug company says nine-month group sales rise
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ Novartis, the Swiss drug giant, said
its nine-month group sales rose 3 percent to 24.6 billion Swiss
francs (dlrs 18.2 billion) from the same period last year.
	   In another important barometer of the company's performance,
sales before translation from the local currencies of its various
markets rose 6 percent in the first nine months.
	   The sales percentages for the third quarter alone rose 7 percent
in francs and 12 percent in local currencies.
	   Turning to the full-year outlook, Novartis said it expects a
``marked'' increase in net income for the year, provided that
``additional, unforeseen economic or financial disturbances'' don't
occur.
	   Novartis attributed the improvement to higher productivity and
high volume growth in the health care division, its largest.
Nine-month sales there rose 4 percent in francs and 7 percent in
local currencies.
	   These factors ``are expected to result in an even higher group
operating profitability,'' the company said, without providing
specific estimates.
	   The one blot on the profit outlook, Novartis said, will be net
financial income, which ``will reflect the turbulence in the
financial markets in the second half of the year.'' It wasn't more
specific.
	   In the first half, the company had reported net financial income
of 516 million francs (dlrs 382.2 million), up from 95 million
francs (dlrs 70 million) in last year's first half. The company's
total net profit in the first half rose 14 percent to 3.55 billion
francs (dlrs 2.62 billion).
	   For all of last year, the company had net profit of 5.21 billion
francs (dlrs 3.85 billion), up 43 percent.
	   Novartis is one of the world's largest life sciences groups,
with strong positions in its fields of activity: pharmaceuticals,
crop protection, animal health and clinical nutrition.

French pensioners protest against loss of purchasing power
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Tens of thousands of retired people took to the
streets Thursday in French cities to protest a drop in their
standard of living and to demand more money from the government.
	   Some of the aging protesters carried banners that said ``Money
for retired people.''
	   Unlike two nationwide high school student protests that have
turned violent in the past week, the elderly demonstrators were
calm, orderly and good-natured.
	   Officials at Prime Minister Lionel Jospin's office were
scheduled to meet with delegates of unions representing retired
people on Thursday afternoon.
	   The pensioners say their purchasing power has dropped over the
last several years, and they want the French government to
compensate them for their losses.

Sierra Leone rebel leader says his prosecution is illegal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ The mysterious leader of a feared
rebel group ended his defense Thursday in a Freetown courtroom,
arguing that a 1996 peace treaty made his prosecution illegal.
	   Foday Sankoh, the leader of the Revolutionary United Front, has
pleaded innocent to a wide array of charges, including murder,
treason and crimes against humanity.
	   On Thursday, though, he claimed that the 1996 peace accord he
signed in Ivory Coast promised him immunity from prosecution.
	   ``My standing in this courtroom is illegal'' Sankoh told the
courtroom.
	   While the 1996 treaty did offer some immunity to the rebels,
later fighting left the treaty largely ignored by both the
government and the rebels.
	   Many Sierra Leoneans blame Sankoh for the country's descent into
civil war in 1991. That fighting briefly came to an end with the
1996 treaty, but in 1997, a military junta allied with Sankoh
overthrew the elected government and ruled until the junta was
toppled early this year. The elected president, Ahmed Tejan Kabbah,
was returned to power.
	   In the more than six months since the junta fell, rebels and
ousted coup soldiers have been waging an intensifying war of terror
against civilians. Human rights groups and aid workers say
thousands of people have been killed, tortured or disfigured.
	   The rebels' goals have never been clear, but many observers say
the latest violence may be intended to force the release of Sankoh,
who returned to Sierra Leone in July after being held for more than
a year in Nigeria on gun-smuggling charges.
	   The trial against Sankoh continues Friday.
	   Sierra Leone is trying dozens of people in connection with the
coup and the junta regime.
	   On Monday, 24 military officers were executed by a firing squad
of soldiers. Among those executed were Col. F.Y. Koroma, brother of
ex-junta leader Lt. Col. Johnny Paul Koroma, who went into hiding
after Kabbah was returned to power.
	   On Wednesday, eleven people, including a a 75-year-old woman,
were sentenced to death for collaborating with the junta.

over 6 1/3 innings in his first appearance of this series. He was
7-5 with a 4.05 ERA in the regular season.
	   The Lions scored their first two runs in the second inning with
no hits. The first two batters walked. One scored on a wild throw
to second in a double play attempt by the BayStars' Robert Rose,
who formerly played for the California Angels. The other scored on
a ground ball.
	   BayStars starter and loser Daisuke Miura, who was 12-7 with a
3.18 ERA in the regular season, gave up four walks in that inning
alone. Over 2 1/3 innings, he yielded two hits and six walks.
	   In the third, the first two batters again walked and were
singled home by Hiroyuki Takagi and Satoshi Nakajima.
	   In the fifth, Kazuo Matsui doubled home three runs after the
bases were loaded with an infield hit and two walks.
	   After four at-bats Thursday, the Lions' Domingo Martinez, a .283
hitter with 30 home runs in the regular season, still was hitless
in the series. He formerly played for the Triple-A Rochester team.
	   The BayStars scored their runs in the fourth inning, on a walk
to Takanori Suzuki and singles by Norihiro Komada and Hiroshi
Nakane, and in the seventh, on catcher Motonobu Tanishige's first
home run of the series.
	   The BayStars reached the best-of-seven series by winning their
first Central League Pennant in 38 years, and only their second
ever. They won the Japan Series in 1960.
	   The Pacific League champion Lions have won the Japan Series
eight times, but lost last year to the Yakult Swallows, four games
to one.
	   Game 4 is scheduled Friday at Seibu Dome.

Barcelona needs victory against cross-town rival to keep on
</HEADLINE>
Madrid's tail &QL; 
 &UR; By MAR ROMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ FC Barcelona travels across town to face
Espanyol on Sunday night, under pressure to bite into Spanish
league leader Real Madrid's three point edge.
	   Morale in the Catalan powerhouse is low, its pride wounded from
Wednesday's 1-0 loss in the Champions League against German team
Bayern Munich, and last week's 1-1 draw against 12th-placed
Salamanca in the domestic league.
	   Meanwhile, Barcelona's cross-town rival, 18th-placed Espanyol,
has only managed to win one game and draw two, losing the other
three games played so far this season.
	   For Sunday's 7th-round match, Argentine Miguel Angel Brindisi
makes his debut as Espanyol's new coach, replacing fellow
countryman Marcelo Bielsa who has taken charge of the Argentine
national squad.
	   After six rounds, Real Madrid stands atop the table with 13
points, followed by Zaragoza and Mallorca with 12. Atletico de
Madrid is in fourth place with 10 points.
	   Madrid's 6-1 trashing of Sturm Graz in Wednesday's Champions
League has boasted the white-clad team as it prepares for Sunday's
face off at home against 8th-placed Racing de Santander.
	   Elsewhere, No.2 Zaragoza travels to meet 5th-place Celta in the
only match of the round scheduled for Saturday.
	   Since the season's beginning, No. 2 Zaragoza has kept near the
top of the table, snatching the top spot for a week after the 5th
round. A win against Celta would open the possibility of overtaking
Real Madrid, if the league leader is defeated.
	   Also a main contender, Mallorca hosts a theoretically tricky
draw against Atletico de Madrid.
	   Atletico has returned to form in its latest matches, and has
jumped to a respectable No.4 in the standings. The squad also
notched up a spectacular 4-2 win at CSKA Sofia in the second round
of the UEFA Cup Tuesday.
	   But the Madrid club will be missing Brazilian ace Juninho on
Sunday who is to serve a one match ban.
	   Other 7th-round games Sunday are: Tenerife vs. Deportivo de La
Coruna, Oviedo vs. Villareal, Real Sociedad vs. Valladolid,
Salamanca vs. Athletic de Bilbao, Valencia vs. Betis, Alaves vs.
Extremadura.

Philips ends loss-making cellular phone joint venture with Lucent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Royal Philips Electronics NV said
Thursday it has agreed to end its loss-making telecommunications
joint venture with U.S. company Lucent Technologies Inc.
	   The announcement was made as the Dutch electronics giant
unveiled third-quarter income from normal operations that was down
38 percent to 449 million guilders (dlrs 241.4 million) from the
same period last year.
	   Rumors about the possible ending of the cellular telephone joint
venture with New Jersey-based Lucent had been rife since Philips
issued a profit warning in late September and put most of the blame
for the lowered expectations on the venture.
	   The venture, called Philips Consumer Communications, was formed
Oct. 1, 1997, and the two companies said Thursday that they agreed
to end their cooperation Sept. 25 1998.
	   It was not immediately clear exactly how much money the joint
venture had lost, but in this year's first quarter alone it lost
250 million guilders (dlrs 134.4 million).
	   Philips, which owned 60 percent of PCC, said it will take a
restructuring charge for an undisclosed amount related to PCC in
the fourth quarter.
	   Philips announced that its third quarter net profit had plunged
to 425 million guilders (dlrs 228.5 million) from 1.43 billion
guilders (dlrs 768.8 million) in the same period last year as sales
dropped from 16.13 billion guilders (dlrs 8.67 billion) to 18.88
billion guilders (dlrs 10.1 billion).
	   Last year's figures were boosted by a 711 million guilder (dlrs
382.2 million) extraordinary gain, while Philips took a 24-million
guilder (dlrs 12.9-million) charge in this year's third quarter.

Typhoon Babs sweeps across Philippines toward Manila

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Typhoon Babs neared Manila Thursday
night after sweeping across the central Philippines, halting sea
transport, triggering landslides, and forcing tens of thousands of
people from their homes.
	   Disaster officials said at least three people were killed and
scores of others were injured. In Camarines Sur province, three
fishermen were missing after they were washed away by surging
waves.
	   Babs' strong winds knocked over trees and power lines,
disrupting communications in many remote regions. Damage reports
from many areas were sketchy.
	   More than 28,500 people were evacuated from their homes in at
least four provinces, officials said.
	   Schools, government offices and businesses were closed in Manila
as the capital prepared for the storm. President Joseph Estrada
called on slum dwellers living in makeshift houses along river
banks in the capital to move to safer ground.
	   Weather forecasters originally predicted the storm would hit
Manila directly. However, it shifted course slightly and was
expected to pass about 80 kilometers (50 miles) to the north by
Friday morning, sparing the city a direct hit.
	   After passing Manila, the storm was expected to threaten several
northern provinces surrounding the Mount Pinatubo volcano.
Pinatubo's eruption in 1991 left millions of tons of volcanic
debris on its slopes _ material that may cause landslides and
floods during heavy rains.
	   Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado said officials discovered
Thursday that a large portion of a major dike in Pampanga province
had been destroyed by quarry operators, leaving several villages
without protection from the volcanic mudflows.
	   As of Thursday evening, the typhoon was centered over Lamon Bay
in Quezon province, 160 kilometers (100 miles) southeast of Manila.
It had sustained winds of 150 kph (94 mph), with gusts of up to 186
kph (116 mph), weather officials said.
	   All sea vessels were banned from leaving Manila, and ferry
service was halted in many ports, stranding thousands of
passengers.
	   Two passenger ships en route to Manila with 1,300 people aboard
sought shelter near islands in the central Philippines.
	   The typhoon also prevented three Indian naval ships from making
a scheduled port call in Manila, the Indian Embassy said.
	   Thursday's fatalities included a man who was hit by a falling
coconut tree in Laguna province south of Manila.
	   Landslides, flooding and widespread damage to houses were
reported in various areas, officials said.
	   The typhoon comes only a week after parts of the northern
Philippines were devastated by Typhoon Zeb, which killed at least
74 people and left 37 missing in the Philippines. About 415,000
Filipinos fled their homes at the height of the typhoon.
	   Zeb then struck Taiwan, killing 31 people, before cutting across
Japan, where it killed at least 12 others.

Finance minister: thanks, but no thanks, to Western food aid

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Despite an economic crisis, disappointing harvest
and forecasts of a particularly frigid winter, Russia's finance
minister said Thursday the country does not yet need foreign food
or other humanitarian aid.
	   At the same time, Mikhail Zadornov expressed hope that more
cold, hard cash will be forthcoming from the International Monetary
Fund.
	   However, Zadornov's deputy said that was unlikely to happen
because the Russian government still has no long-term plan for
coping with the latest economic crisis that erupted in mid-August.
	   The Russian government has appealed for humanitarian aid from
the European Union and is holding talks with the United States for
subsidized grain. But Zadornov suggested such plans were premature.
	   ``Russia's financial situation is not such that it requires
direct humanitarian aid,'' Zadornov told reporters. ``I would
express gratitude for such proposals, but I think that food imports
will continue on the normal market basis.''
	   Zadornov said he hoped a visiting IMF team would recommend
disbursing more of a dlrs 22.6 billion loan package negotiated
before the crisis hit. It was frozen in September after the first
dlrs 4.8 billion installment was paid.
	   ``I think that our partners can't but recognize that the
government is taking strong efforts to radically cut spending,'' he
said in a reference to a fourth-quarter budget plan approved by the
Cabinet on Tuesday.
	   Zadornov's deputy, Oleg Vyugin, said that the lack of a more
comprehensive economic plan through the end of 1999 would hamper
the talks with the IMF.
	   ``It is very important to the IMF what kind of budget Russia
will have in 1999,'' Vyugin said, according to the Interfax news
agency. ``The Fund wants to understand whether it will be a leap
into the abyss or over the abyss.''
	   Zadornov said the government hoped to finish its draft 1999
budget by mid-November.
	   The Russian government has said it is counting on IMF money to
help pay its bills for the rest of the year.
	   It plans to spend 130 billion rubles (dlrs 7.6 billion) in the
final three months of the year, but expects revenues of only around
70 billion rubles (dlrs 4.1 billion).
	   It is planning to print more rubles to cover at least some of
the shortfall. Zadornov said it might also raise money by
increasing excise taxes by 25 percent or selling 5 percent of its
shares in the national gas monopoly, Gazprom.
	   ``We will certainly be forced to print new money to finance our
spending,'' Zadornov said. ``There is no sense in concealing it,
but we must keep it to a minimum.''
	   Former Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko noted that an increase in
the money supply will lead to high inflation, and said the
government should concentrate instead on cutting spending and
boosting tax collection.
	   ``If water is pouring from your faucet, you should close it, not
wipe the water from the floor,'' he said on Echo Moscow radio.
	   Zadornov insisted that no matter how hard-pressed the government
is, it will pay its foreign debts, although he indicated Russia may
try to renegotiate the payment schedule.
	   He said Russia has already paid dlrs 500 million interest on its
foreign debt this quarter and plans to spend another dlrs 2
billion.

Serbian hackers declare computer war on anti-Serb Web sites
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comment from webmaster in graf 5. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A group of Serbian hackers declared
a computer war against anti-Serb Web sites and claimed
responsibility for causing one Kosovo Albanian site to crash
recently, a Belgrade daily reported Thursday.
	   A young man who identified himself as member of a team of
hackers called Black Hand phoned the Blic daily and claimed the
group caused a system crash several days ago on the server of a
Swiss Internet provider which hosted an ethnic Albanian Web site.
	   ``We shall continue to remove (ethnic) Albanian lies from the
Internet,'' the young man told the daily. He declined to give his
name.
	   The first to suffer the impact of the Black Hand was the site
http:www.kosova.com. An announcement saying the site was hacked by
team Crna Ruka (Black Hand in Serbian) appeared on this site,
together with the slogan: ``Long Live Great Serbia!''
	   By Thursday the site was up again, but its webmaster Edmond
Hajullaaga confirmed that it had been crashed ``several times in
the past three days.'' He said the site had been moved to a new
server, but they were unable to update its contents.

Western officials push both sides to achieve peace in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS, UPDATES with quotes from Albanian leader, European
envoy, OSCE mission creation delayed. &QL; 
 &UR; By TOM COHEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Western officials pressed Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic and the ethnic Albanians who oppose
him to do more Thursday to achieve lasting peace in the embattled
separatist province of Kosovo.
	   The French foreign minister warned that Milosevic must pull out
more troops, and U.S. envoy Christopher Hill and European
ambassadors pressed their political initiative in new talks with
ethnic Albanian political leader Ibrahim Rugova.
	   Concerned by continuing sporadic violence, a European envoy said
attacks by the Albanians' Kosovo Liberation Army could put efforts
to reach a peaceful political solution in ``serious jeopardy.''
	   ``We ask Kosovo people and especially the armed forces, Kosovo
forces, to stop any provocations,'' said Wolfgang Petrisch, the
Austrian ambassador to Yugoslavia and European Union envoy in
Kosovo, after meeting with Rugova.
	   Ten days after Milosevic's agreement to work toward peace in
Kosovo, brokered by American diplomat Richard Holbrooke, there were
still reports of shelling and shooting incidents at night in the
separatist province of Serbia.
	   The Kosovo Information Center said four members of an ethnic
Albanian family _ three of them children _ were killed and two
wounded early Thursday when the Yugoslav army opened fire near
Djakovica on the Albanian border. The center, close to the
province's ethnic Albanian leadership, said the victims were
refugees who were crossing back over from Albania to return to
their homes.
	   The report could not be confirmed.
	   Still threatening airstrikes, NATO has given Milosevic until
Tuesday to withdraw more military and special police forces from
Kosovo and return others to garrisons in the province where he
launched an offensive against ethnic Albanian guerrillas eight
months ago.
	   ``The withdrawal of forces is very advanced, but that is not
enough,'' French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said on France's
RTL radio Thursday, warning that the conflict could explode again.
NATO must ``not let go'' now, he said.
	   Milosevic also must cooperate with war crimes investigations and
efforts to aid and return the 300,000 people displaced from their
homes, and agree on a specific timetable for talks giving Kosovo
Albanians self-government and their own local police.
	   But the ethnic Albanians must consent to such political
negotiations, and many remain reluctant to give up their goal of
outright independence, which the West opposes for fear of
triggering similar demands elsewhere in the Balkans.
	   While the KLA has been fighting for independence, the West
considers the moderate Rugova and his negotiating team the
legitimate representatives of Kosovo Albanians, who account for
about 90 percent of the province's 2 million people.
	   Rugova said his team was working out what he called an ``interim
solution'' with Hill.
	   He also made clear he does not support the recent attacks by the
KLA, over which he has no control.
	   ``We urge also all groups of people to demonstrate
self-restraint so any act of theirs is not used as a provocation,
namely as a pretext for new assaults on Kosovo,'' Rugova said after
meeting the European envoys.
	   Meanwhile, efforts to organize a 2,000-strong team to verify
compliance with the peace deal appeared stalled because would-be
contributor nations are concerned about safety and want the U.N.
Security Council to endorse the plan first.
	   The operation is to be directed by the Vienna, Austria-based
Organization for Security and Cooperation, which must ask its 54
member states to provide the Kosovo monitors.
	   ``Obviously, the physical security of 2,000 people in a zone of
turmoil, of conflict, is of utmost importance,'' said the American
head of the operation, William G. Walker.

	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ The United Nations and Afghanistan's
Taliban religious army moved closer Thursday to an agreement to
restart U.N. operations in the war-ravaged nation after a
disruption of nearly two months.
	   ``We're finished 95 percent of the agreement and tomorrow
(Friday) we will sign a joint agreement,'' said Sher Mohammed
Stanikzai, a chief negotiator for the Taliban.
	   The Taliban and U.N. negotiators have been holding talks in
neighboring Pakistan since Tuesday. It had been believed an
agreement would be finalized Thursday, but Stanikzai said meetings
began late and the final details are being hammered out.
	   ``Our aim is to assure the United Nations about its security
concerns,'' said Stanikzai, who also is deputy public health
minister in the Taliban's government.

China, Russia criticize U.S., Japan over missile defense system
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES throughout with defense ministers
criticizing U.S., Japan on anti-missile defenses &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's and Russia's defense ministers warned
Thursday that a U.S.-Japanese plan to develop an anti-missile
defense system could provoke a regional arms race, the official
Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   Xinhua's account of the meeting between China's Chi Haotian and
his visiting Russian counterpart, Igor Sergeyev, did not mention
the United States and Japan by name.
	   The defense ministers were quoted as criticizing ``certain
countries'' whose ``plans to develop a theater missile defense
system will arouse a new arms race and threaten world and regional
peace and stability.''
	   U.S. and Japanese foreign and defense ministers announced last
month a project to jointly research an anti-missile weapons system.
Talk of such a system has drawn previous criticism from China,
whose world's largest military lags technologically behind
Northeast Asia's other powers _ the United States, Japan and
Russia.
	   Russia has become China's foremost supplier of sophisticated
weaponry. China bought dlrs 6 billion worth of Russian weapons
between 1991 and 1997, including 74 Su-27 fighter jets and two
Sovremenny destroyers, Russia's Itar-Tass news agency has reported.
	   Sergeyev arrived in China from Vietnam late Wednesday. He and
China's Chi also discussed other international and regional
security issues during their meeting Thursday, Xinhua reported
without elaborating.
	   Chi told Sergeyev that closer ties between the once hostile
militaries followed improving diplomatic ties and would benefit
world peace and stability, state television reported.
	   Although once fierce rivals for the allegiances of the communist
world, China and the then-Soviet Union began repairing relations a
decade ago. Annual summits between the Russian and Chinese
presidents, Boris Yeltsin and Jiang Zemin, started in 1994, and
Jiang is due to visit Russia before the year's end.
	   Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang Guoqiang expected
Jiang's trip to further boost ties that have ``developed smoothly
in all fields.''
	   Tang defended increased military exchanges but added that ``this
kind of cooperation is not directed against any third country.''

Report: police investigate claim that drug dealers murdered infants
</HEADLINE>
in smuggling plot &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ A suspect in a drug-related murder claims
that smugglers brought heroin into the country in the corpses of
murdered infants, a newspaper reported Thursday.
	   The Dagbladet newspaper said its report was based on a
confidential transcript of a police interrogation in Stavanger, a
main port city in Norway's southwest.
	   Police declined Thursday afternoon to comment on the report.
	   The newspaper said the suspect claimed that smugglers of
Vietnamese origin bought infants from prostitutes in Paris and
Hamburg, Germany, and took them to Denmark where they were killed.
The corpses were then filled with bags of heroin, and brought to
Norway by women pretending to be the infants' mothers, the suspect
claimed, according to the report.
	   ``They left their own babies at home, and went to Denmark where
they were given a prepared baby,'' the newspaper quoted the police
transcript as saying. ``If customs officers started to look too
closely, the women would say the baby was ill and ask to be allowed
to immediately rush it to a doctor.''
	   The 26-year-old suspect, arrested for a drug-related murder this
year, claimed that the Vietnamese drug ring's leader had told him
about the practice.
	   According to the newspaper, the suspect said he was at the ring
leader's Oslo apartment on one occasion when a woman arrived with a
baby, went into a back room with the ring leader and emerged with
two bags of heroin stained with blood. She did not take the baby
when she left the apartment, the suspect reportedly said.

Hong Kong's reserves down dlrs 4 billion due to market
</HEADLINE>
intervention &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The Hong Kong government spent U.S. dlrs 4.4
billion of the territory's foreign exchange reserves in a massive
stock-buying spree aimed at driving out market speculators,
officials said Thursday.
	   The Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the territory's de facto
central bank, announced that Hong Kong's foreign currency assets
stood at U.S. dlrs 88.4 billion at the end of September, a sharp
fall from U.S. dlrs 92.1 billion at the end of August.
	   Thomas M.K. Chan, spokesman for the HKMA, told Dow Jones
Newswires that the dlrs 4.4 billion was used ``to fund investment
in Hong Kong stocks.''
	   Hong Kong's reserves, however, remain the third largest in the
world after Japan's and China's, an official statement said.
	   In August, the Hong Kong government intervened in the markets,
scooping up shares and futures contracts in an effort to drive up
share prices to levels at which speculators _ who bet the market
would fall _ would be stuck with huge losses.
	   The climax of the unprecedented intervention came Aug. 28, when
turnover at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange hit a high of 79 billion
Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 10.1 billion).
	   Economists, analysts and politicians sharply criticized the
intervention, saying it damaged Hong Kong's reputation as a free
market and wasted taxpayers' money. The government claimed victory
and later introduced a series of regulations to restrict
speculative activity and stabilize the markets.
	   ``There will be no need for them to intervene again since
they've put other measures in place to safeguard the integrity of
the Hong Kong dollar,'' said John P. Sevilla, vice president for
credit research at Salomon Smith Barney.
	   Since existing regulations on disclosure do not apply to the
government, officials have held out on details of the government's
massive stock and futures holdings accumulated during the
stock-buying spree.
	   The HKMA said any premature disclosure could wreak further havoc
in the markets and that it would disclose the details only after
speculators have left the Hong Kong markets. Holdings will be
disclosed only in late October by an independent company
established by the government to manage the accumulated securities.

Moldova wants to import Caspian oil and invest in Romanian

refinery &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KISHINEV, Moldova (AP) _ Moldovan President Petru Lucinschi said
Thursday he wants to buy Caspian Sea oil and invest in a
neighboring Romanian refinery so he can reduce energy imports from
Russia and Ukraine.
	   Lucinschi made his remarks during a two-day summit in the
Moldovan capital with the leaders of Romania and Ukraine. The talks
were focusing on peace and stability in the region and the Caspian
oil pipeline.
	   After meeting Romanian President Emil Constantinescu, Lucinschi
said he supported his neighbor's desire for the Caspian oil
pipeline to pass through the Romanian Black Sea port of Constanta.
	   Constantinescu offered Moldova the opportunity to buy a stake in
the Onesti refinery, 150 kilometers (94 miles) away from Moldova's
border. Moldova has no refinery of its own.
	   Moldova's state-run Ascom Group company said it was interested
in investing in the Onesti refinery.
	   The two countries also decided to simplify two border crossings
at Sculeni and Albita by allowing people traveling abroad to be
checked only once by a team of Romanian and Moldovan custom
officers.
	   Later in the day all three presidents planned to meet for a
common session. Lucinschi and Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma
were scheduled to meet for bilateral talks Friday.

ILO signs pact to end child labor in carpet industry
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Heavily criticized for its use of
child labor, Pakistan's carpet weaving industry took a step
Thursday toward improving its image with an agreement to phase out
child labor.
	   The agreement, signed by the United Nation's International Labor
Organization and Pakistan's carpet manufacturing industry, plans to
take small children off the weaving looms, put them in school and
train others, preferably women, to do the job and earn an income.
	   The agreement allocates dlrs 300,000 toward this program, much
of that coming from the U.S. Department of Labor.
	   ``This agreement reflects a commitment on the part of the carpet
manufacturers in Pakistan to address child labor ... not by
removing the children from the workplace, but rather by
transferring them from the weaving looms to the educational
centers,'' Kari Tapila, ILO's deputy director, said during the
agreement signing ceremony.
	   Pakistan's carpet weavers have been strongly criticized
internationally for the use of child labor.
	   Human rights organizations estimate millions of Pakistani
children are working in a variety of industries ranging from carpet
weaving, to more dangerous occupations in garages and at industrial
sites.
	   In poor Pakistan, where the average annual income is barely dlrs
400, children often are put into the labor market at a young age
and often by their parents.
	   The goal of the new agreement is to get children under 14 years
old out of the carpet weaving industry. It will begin with at least
8,000 children currently making carpets, according to an ILO
release.
	   To ensure the program works, the ILO will conduct random and
unannounced visits to work sites. Already 14 manufacturers have
given the ILO a list of its work places, many of them rural homes
with two or three looms.
	   It's estimated that 30 different work sites will be targeted _ a
small number in Pakistan where there are at least 450 sites, said
Tariq Mahmood, an industry spokesman.
	   The carpet weaving industry is Pakistan's largest cottage
industry exporting carpets valued at roughly dlrs 150 million. In
rural Pakistan, particularly in the country's most populous Punjab
province, children spend long hours weaving carpets in their home
for sale abroad, said the ILO release.

Romanian lesbian granted asylum in Germany
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Germany has granted asylum to a Romanian woman who
was persecuted in her home country because she is a lesbian, her
attorney said Thursday.
	   The case of Mariana Cetinar marks the first time Germany has
recognized claims of persecution in Romania based on sexual
orientation, lawyer Dirk Siegfried said.
	   The Romanian Helsinki Committee for Human Rights reported in
January that 57 people were in Romanian jails for violating laws
against homosexuality. Cetinar was the only woman.
	   She was convicted in 1996 in Romania of making a pass at another
woman and sentenced to three years in prison. She was released
March 25 after receiving a presidential pardon and came to Germany.
	   Germany previously granted asylum to a lesbian from Iran, where
homosexuality is a capital crime, but only after a court battle.

Australian leader says new steps needed to avert `credit crunch'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALAN THORNHILL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Special ``standfast'' measures may be
needed to bolster the world's financial systems to prevent lenders
stampeding out of developing Asian countries, Australian Prime
Minister John Howard said Thursday.
	   In a speech to an international conference of banking
supervisors, Howard said Australia would also push hard at the Asia
Pacific Economic Cooperation forum meeting in Kuala Lumpur next
month for advances in free trade.
	   Howard said many Asian countries had been ill equipped to handle
the big capital flows that had triggered the present crisis, but
that careless lenders had also contributed to the region's
troubles.
	   ``It is not the case that these economies got what they
deserved,'' he said. ``Rather they got a whole lot more than they
deserved.
	   ``We must focus on what can be done now to ensure that growth
resumes to avoid a major credit crunch,'' he said.
	   Howard suggested a three-step approach to Asia's problems.
	   The first was ``better targeted'' disclosure requirements; the
second, development of measures to better manage future crises; and
the third, involving the private sector in crisis management.
	   ``These (measures) might include standfast arrangements to
prevent lenders from exiting economies in a destructive stampede,''
Howard said.
	   They might also include collective action clauses, orderly
workouts involving rollovers, reschedulings and debt-equity swaps.
	   Howard said he was not in favor of ``unnecessarily burdensome
controls,'' but the private sector must be included in discussions
on how to improve the international financial system.
	   He called for better international understanding of what he
called the huge and sometimes devastating problems that Australia's
regional neighbors now face.
	   ``I continue to be astonished sometimes by the lack of
comprehension of the scale of the impact of the crisis on a country
like Indonesia,'' Howard said.
	   He said that countries in the region now face a long and
difficult task to rebuild their prosperity and much international
help would be needed.
	   He said the region's troubles would increase protectionist
pressures, but these must be resisted.
	   ``APEC must stand against that view. Open markets provide the
opportunity for economic growth and the enormous benefits from
it,'' Howard said.
	   On Friday, Howard will head the first meeting of a special task
force he has set up to devise measures for Australia to pursue in
international forums, with the aim of boosting growth in the
region.
	   ``The international debate about the ways to return to higher
growth, improve standards of living, create jobs and prevent future
crises must be brought to practical conclusions as soon as
possible,'' Howard said in a statement issued before his speech.
	   The group includes senior Australian banking and financial
services figures as well as the heads of several government
departments and Reserve Bank Governor Ian Macfarlane. It will
consider issues such as transparency and accountability in the
private sector, improved financial sector monitoring and
supervision, and measures to strengthen international financial
institutions.
	   ``It is a key part of my government's efforts to address the
international financial crisis,'' he said.

Philippines awaiting better market conditions for bond issue
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippines is awaiting favorable
market conditions before issuing government bonds on the global
market, an official said Thursday.
	   Plans to raise at least dlrs 500 million with government bonds
to help close a yawning budget deficit were shelved a few months
ago as interest rates rose for developing countries following the
Russian debt crisis.
	   Acting Finance Secretary Solomon Cua gave no indication of the
timing of the launch of dollar- and euro-denominated bonds, but
indicated that the plan remains on hold and has not been abandoned.
	   In a speech prepared for a business function, Cua reiterated the
government's determination not to rely on domestic borrowing to
fund the budget deficit since that would cause local interest rates
to rise.
	   Cua acknowledged that financing the budget deficit, which is
expected to reach 40 billion pesos (dlrs 935 million) in 1998, is a
``ticklish'' problem.
	   He said that if interest rates are allowed to rise, the
non-performing loans of banks could increase and delay the
country's economic recovery.
	   Therefore, ``the most logical thing to do is tap foreign
borrowing,'' he said.
	   The delay in the issuance of government bonds caused the
government to recently arrange a dlrs 610 million loan with a group
of banks to raise funds.
	   Cua said the government is in various stages of talks with
multilateral and bilateral financial institutions for program loans
totaling dlrs 1.7 billion, which will be drawn over the next two to
three years.
	   This year, the government expects to tap dlrs 225 million from
the Manila-based Asian Development Bank and a further dlrs 110
million from the World Bank.
	   The balance will be sourced from the ADB, World Bank and the
Japan Export-Import Bank.
	   In addition to program loans, the government recently concluded
negotiations for a dlrs 1 billion loan package from Japan to be
used for infrastructure projects. Cua said Japan pledged another
dlrs 1 billion in 1999.

Tribunal President urges Security Council action to ensure Serb
</HEADLINE>
cooperation

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The president of the Yugoslav war
crimes tribunal Thursday urged the Security Council to press
Yugoslavia to cooperate with the court which is trying to
investigate alleged atrocities in Kosovo.
	   In a letter to the Security Council President, Jeremy
Greenstock, U.S. judge Gabrielle Kirk McDonald said she is
``gravely concerned that the agreements concluded on the situation
in Kosovo lack an explicit recognition of the FRY's obligation
towards the international tribunal.''
	   McDonald was referring to the deal hammered out by U.S. mediator
Richard Holbrooke with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to end
a Serb crackdown on secessionist ethnic Albanians in the Kosovo
province.
	   Nowhere in the deal does the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
(FRY) make explicit commitments to cooperate with the U.N. court,
McDonald wrote. She urged the Security Council, which set up the
tribunal in 1993, to take ``such action as is necessary'' to make
Yugoslavia cooperate with the court.
	   McDonald was reiterating comments made recently by Tribunal
Chief Prosecutor Louise Arbour. The tribunal has no police force of
its own and has to rely on the cooperation of local authorities or
help from NATO forces to arrest suspects and secure crime scenes.
	   Belgrade authorities have long stymied the work of the tribunal.
They refuse to extradite three former army officers indicted for
allegedly organizing a 1991 massacre of 260 Croats and recently
began refusing to issue visas for tribunal staff investigating
atrocities in Kosovo.
	   ``In an era characterized by an increased emphasis on the human
rights of individuals, the FRY's continued flouting of the will and
the law of the international community jeopardizes all efforts to
bring peace to the peoples of the former Yugoslavia,'' McDonald
wrote.
	   Arbour is planning to lead a team of prosecutors and
investigators to Kosovo on a mission starting Nov. 5.

French students call for new demonstrations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ One of France's two main high school student unions
on Thursday rejected the education minister's proposed reforms and
called for new demonstrations beginning Nov. 5.
	   In response to protests over the last 10 days, Education
Minister Claude Allegre on Wednesday pledged to hire more
personnel, increase security and reduce class size.
	   The Interacademic High School Coordination, as the union calls
itself, was unimpressed.
	   ``Claude Allegre hasn't responded to high schoolers,'' group
members said at a Paris press conference. ``He has no plan to
create positions for full-fledged teachers and has made no real
effort to increase the budget.''
	   For the last two days, protests have been smaller than they were
last Thursday, when they drew about half a million students
demanding better schooling conditions.
	   School officials face tough spending choices with the government
trying to keep the deficit within 3 percent of the gross domestic
product, as required by the euro single currency that takes effect
at the end of the year.

Independent media pledge to fight government crackdown in Serbia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOVANA GEC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Defying a government crackdown,
Serbia's independent media pledged Thursday to fight a repressive
information law by taking it to court.
	   The editors of several newspapers, news agencies and electronic
media said their editorial policies would remain the same despite
large fines envisioned to punish those critical of the authorities.
	   ``The law was adopted to frighten the journalists and thus cause
self-censorship,'' the media representatives were quoted by the
Beta news agency as saying. They called the move unacceptable and
pledged to continue their work professionally.
	   But Aleksandar Vucic, Serbia's information minister from the
ultranationalist Radical Party, warned Thursday that media were
under non-stop scrutiny by ``expert services,'' indicating that
government pressure could only heighten.
	   The law passed by the Serbian parliament on Tuesday bans
broadcasts of Serbian language programs by foreign news outlets. It
calls for fines of 400,000-800,000 dinars (dlrs 41,000-82,000)
against editors and media owners who violate it.
	   It also gives broad powers to the authorities to determine which
reports break the law, and further restricts working permits for
media organizations.
	   Independent legal experts and journalists say the law
reintroduces censorship, which Serbia formally abandoned in the
late 1980s, and leads the country back to single-party
dictatorship.
	   The Serbian government, loyal to Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic, has faced a wave of domestic and international criticism
over the law, but to no effect.
	   The United States condemned as ``draconian'' new media
restrictions and alleged they were designed to hide the truth of
Serb atrocities in Kosovo, where hundreds of people have been
killed and 300,000 driven from their homes in this year's
crackdown.
	   The law superseded a decree which had banned three newspapers _
Danas, Nasa Borba and Dnevni Telegraf _ last week, citing the
danger of NATO military intervention. The ban was lifted Wednesday
and the journalists were back in their offices Thursday.
	   Slavko Curuvija, owner and editor of Dnevni Telegraf, said his
daily suffered ``great damage'' because of the one-week closure.
	   Curuvija and his colleagues from other media said they would
take the information law to the Constitutional Court and organize a
one-day protest strike. But courts in Serbia are also controlled by
Milosevic's government and the move is expected to have little
effect.
	   Vucic said the new law also applied to newspapers published in
Montenegro, Serbia's junior partner in the Yugoslav federation. His
comment came after some Serbian papers hinted they would move to
Montenegro to avoid media restrictions.
	   The leadership of Montenegro is pro-reform, and President Milo
Djukanovic has clashed with Milosevic over several political and
economic issues.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Red Star coach Milorad Kosanovic has
resigned following his team's 2-1 loss to Lyon in the UEFA Cup, the
Belgrade soccer club announced Thursday.
	   Kosanovic, who has been training Red Star for 18 months, was
replaced by his aide and the team's former forward Vojin Lazarevic.
	   Red Star was forced to play its second-round, first-leg UEFA Cup
home game against France's Lyon in Bucharest, Romania, on Tuesday
due to security concerns related to the threat of NATO airstrikes
on military targets in Yugoslavia.
	   The best-known Yugoslav team, which was the 1991 Champions' Cup
winner, is also struggling in the weak domestic league, lagging in
fourth place with 10 points fewer than rival Partizan Belgrade.
	   Kosanovic, who was highly unpopular among Red Star fans, said he
couldn't endure their pressure.
	   ``The negative atmosphere among the fans reflected badly on the
team's play,'' he said. ``I had no choice but to leave.''

EU parliament divided over salaries, travel expenses
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STRASBOURG, France (AP) - The European Parliament failed
Thursday to carry through proposals to reform its members' salaries
and curb excessive claims for travel allowances.
	   The proposal to reimburse deputies for actual travel costs,
instead of handing out a fixed-rate expense, was put forward after
European Union regulators found expenses paid out sometimes
exceeded actual costs by 30 percent.
	   Despite appeals for parliament to improve it's free-spending
image, the bill failed to gain a majority of the 626 deputies in
the EU assembly. Although 224 voted in favor and only 74 against,
218 abstained.
	   A second proposal to pay euro-deputies an equal salary from the
EU budget was also thrown out, as only 219 voted in favor.
One-hundred-seventy-five voted to keep the current system under
which EU deputies are paid by national governments at the same rate
as their counterparts in national parliaments. There were 113
abstentions.
	   Parliament spokesman Georgios Ghiatis said a legal committee
will now prepare a new proposal. The full assembly will vote on the
revised proposal in December.
	   In the meantime, a working group headed by Parliament President
Jose Maria Gil-Robles try to lower travel expense costs, Ghiatis
said.
	   The Parliament's travel allowance budget totals 45.1 million
European currency units (dlrs 54.2 million) a year, out of a total
budget of around 923 million ecu (dlrs 1.1 billion), Ghiatis said.

Protests continue in Bali against Cabinet minister
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Balinese protested in three cities
Thursday against a Muslim Cabinet minister accused of insulting the
Hindu minority when he criticized the daughter of Indonesia's
founding president.
	   The official Antara news agency said several thousand students,
youths and others protested in Bali's capital of Denpasar and two
other cities.
	   Last week, Food Minister A.M. Saefuddin reportedly dismissed the
chances of popular opposition faction leader Megawati Sukarnoputri
being elected president next year, saying she was a Hindu.
	   ``Are the Indonesian people willing to have a Hindu president?''
he was quoted as saying.
	   Megawati's paternal grandmother came from the predominantly
Hindu island of Bali. However, both her parents, including the late
President Sukarno, followed Islam, Indonesia's main faith.
	   Saefuddin, a leader of the Muslim-based United Development
Party, apologized Tuesday, saying he had no intention of harassing
any religion.
	   ``We are not satisfied yet with Saefuddin's halfhearted apology,
and it was not clear to whom he apologized,'' said Ida Bagus Putu
Manuaba, an organizer of the protest in Karangasem.
	   At least 3,000 protesters joined a rally in front of the local
council building there.
	   They demanded that Saeffuddin be fired over his remarks.
	   Indonesia plans to stage parliamentary elections next May under
promised democratic reforms. Legislators are to select a new
president by the end of next year.
	   About 90 percent of Indonesia's 202 million people are Muslim,
making it the world's most populous Islamic nation.
	   However, religious tolerance is enshrined in the national
philosophy and constitution.

The Herminator is back; Tomba, Seizinger, Street missing
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   The Herminator is back.
	   The same can't be said of retired Alberto Tomba _ or injured
Katja Seizinger and Picabo Street _ as the Alpine season opens this
weekend.
	   The Herminator is Hermann Maier, the fearless Austrian skier who
won everything in sight last season: two Olympic golds, the overall
World Cup championship (the first Austrian since 1970) and World
Cup titles in super-G and giant slalom.
	   He'll be among 200 racers _ and 500 reporters _ this weekend at
Soelden, the 2,800-meter-high (9,200-foot) Austrian glacier where
the season begins.
	   ``The conditions are wonderful with more than a meter (40
inches) of snow powder _ almost too much,'' said Peter Vorst, head
of the organizing committee.
	   Maier is reported to have turned down 150 requests for
interviews this weekend, admitting to quote-starved reporters,
``This is going to be my toughest season yet because everyone is
going to chase me.''
	   Austrian team coach Toni Giger, hearing complaints from other
team members who think Maier is getting too much attention,
admitted the same.
	   ``All of them only want to beat Maier,'' he said.
	   Tomba, the three-time Olympic and two-time world champion,
announced his retirement earlier this month after 12 seasons and
more than 50 World Cup wins.
	   Seizinger, another three-time Olympic gold medalist and the
women's overall World Cup winner, is out after injuring both knees
in summer training and is doubtful for the world championships
opening Jan. 31 in Vail.
	   Street, Olympic super-G gold medalist and Seizinger's flamboyant
American downhill rival, will miss the entire season after injuring
both legs in a spill in March in Crans Montana, Switzerland.
	   The 26-year-old Maier, best remembered for walking away from a
spectacular, somersaulting crash in Nagano Olympics, leads the
world's deepest ski team.
	   Last season, Austria's men became the first to win all of the
World Cup titles with Andreas Schifferer winning downhill and
Thomas Sykora slalom.
	   Schifferer practiced this week in Soelden and has recovered
quickly from a severe leg injury suffered in summer training.
	   Even without Seizinger, the German women are almost as strong
with Martina Ertl defending her World Cup giant slalom title.
Seizinger, Ertl and Hilde Gerg won 17 of 33 World Cup races last
season.
	   Sweden's Ylva Nowen is the defending slalom champion.
	   The 26-year-old Seizinger is no cinch to ever return.
	   ``I don't think she'll come back this season,'' her coach
Wolfgang Maier said in an interview. ``She will surely be able to
compete again, but it will depend on how much she wants to do
that.''
	   With Seizinger out, Sweden's Pernilla Wiberg _ an Olympic and
world champion who will retire after this season _ will be a strong
favorite to repeat the overall title she won in '97.
	   Wiberg, who underwent her fifth knee surgery following the
Nagano Olympics, has set lofty goals.
	   ``My knee is OK and I'm in great shape,'' said the 28-year-old
Swede. ``My goal is to make the top three in all disciplines on the
World Cup tour and win two or three medals in the world
championships.''
	   After the weekend races, the season takes almost a month off
before resuming for three weekends of racing in North America
beginning in Park City, Utah, Nov. 19-22 with men's and women's
giant slalom and slalom.
	   The circuit returns to Europe Dec. 10-13 in Val d'Isere, France,
for men's downhill and super-G and women's super-G and giant
slalom.
	   The FIS, the world governing body of the sport, has increased
the minimum purse for each men's and women's race this season from
60,000 Swiss francs (dlrs 44,000) to 100,000 (dlrs 74,000).

<TEXT>
	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ The third round of all-party peace
negotiations aimed at ending years of ethnic and political strife
in Burundi concluded Thursday after 10 days of what a spokesman
called encouraging and positive talks.
	   A fourth round was set to begin Jan. 18.
	   Hashim Mbita, spokesman for former Tanzanian President Julius
Nyerere who is mediating the talks, said the third round had been
``very encouraging and positive.''
	   But Burundi's Peace Process Minister Ambroise Niyonsaba told
reporters he had not received a clearcut answer on Burundi's call
for a lifting of sanctions imposed by neighboring countries after
President Pierre Buyoya staged a coup in July 1996.
	   He would not comment on what the government would do if the
sanctions were not lifted before the next round of talks got
underway.
	   ``That decision will be taken by the government back home,'' he
said.
	   Boyoya insists that he and his government have satisfied all the
conditions Burundi's neighbors imposed and that the all-party peace
talks are proof of this.
	   Nyerere _ and Tanzania _ are believed to be the most reticient
about lifting the sanctions, which have already been partially
breached by some countries.
	   The talks ended Thursday after representatives from 18 factions
in the Burundi conflict concluded all the items on the agenda,
including the appointment of chairmen to head the three committees
established to discuss major issues.
	   On Thursday, delegates nominated Italian Mathias Zuppi, a Roman
Catholic priest who was involved in conflict resolution in Angola
and Mozambique, to head the key security and peace committee,
critical to forging an agreement among the rival factions in
Burundi.
	   Participants had already chosen Armando Guebuza of Mozambiqe to
head the committee on the nature of the conflict and Professor
Nicola Hayson of South Africa, a legal adviser to President Nelson
Mandela, to head of the committee on democracy and good governance.
	   Participants also agreed on the need to restructure Burundi's
armed forces now dominated by the country's Tutsi minority.
	   Tutsis account for 14 percent of Burundi's population of 6
million, and Hutus account for 85 percent.
	   Among key participants in the talks were the Burundi government
and the Hutu opposition Council for the Defense of Democracy. Not
invited was the CNDD's armed wing, Forces for Defense of Democracy,
the largest Hutu rebel group fighting to topple the Tutsi
government of President Pierre Buyoya.
	   The first round of all-party talks opened in June and was
followed by another in July when a cease-fire took hold in most of
the country.
	   Mbita said that until fourth round of talks begins, the three
committees will meet periodically in Arusha and prepare reports on
their progress.
	   At least 200,000 people have been killed in the violence that
broke out after Tutsi paratroopers assassinated Burundi's first
democratically elected president, Hutu Melchoir Ndadaye, in October
1993.
	   Buyoya, a retired general and a Tutsi, took power in a bloodless
coup in 1996 saying he was the only leader who could stanch the
bloodshed.
	   On Wednesday, more than 50 delegates, including Niyonsaba,
attended a memorial service at St. Theresa Catholic Church in
Arusha to mark the fifth anniversary of Ndadaye's death.

Nearly 6,000 minks set free from fur farm
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ About 5,700 minks were set free from a
western Sweden fur farm overnight by unknown vandals, police said
Thursday. It was at least the third such incident in a month.
	   No immediate arrests were made, but suspicion fell on
animal-rights activists.
	   The release from the fur farm near Vaenersborg, some 350
kilometers (220 miles) west of Stockholm, was discovered after a
motorist reported a large number of dead minks along a highway.
	   ''The driver told me that it was 'like driving through a plowed
field','' Stig Eriksson of the Vaenersborg police was quoted as
saying by the Swedish news agency TT.
	   In September, about 3,000 minks were released in Sweden in two
incidents. In one of the cases, the vandals painted a building door
with DBF, the Swedish acronym for Animal Liberation Front.
	   Also in September, about 8,000 minks were released in Britain
and another 4,000 in Finland.

Swiss government eyes shutting down nuclear power plants
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ The Swiss government Thursday announced
that it is planning the country's eventual exit from nuclear power,
saying it wants to support instead hydroelectric plants.
	   But environmental campaigners criticized the lack of a timeframe
for closing the country's four nuclear power plants.
	   Government officials will work with representatives of the power
industry, environmental groups and local governments to discuss a
timetable and removal of nuclear waste, a government statement
said. It is unrealistic to build more power stations because of
environmental concerns, the government has said.
	   Should the discussions between concerned parties fail to produce
an agreed timetable, the federal cabinet will make the decision,
said the statement.
	   ``We have set out on a new course,'' said Federal Energy
Minister Moritz Leuenberger. ``Details have yet to be decided.''
	   In a related move, the federal cabinet ordered energy officials
to draw up a discussion paper on changing laws governing the
domestic electricity market.
	   The government envisages the creation of a national company to
own the power infrastructure.
	   A timeframe for carrying out liberalization of the electricity
market itself remains to be determined, the cabinet said.
	   The cabinet said it wants to support hydroelectric plants. It
ordered a study of the possibility of tax breaks for hydroelectric
plants and how to encourage upgrades of those plants.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Western officials pressed both
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and the ethnic Albanians on
Thursday to do more to achieve lasting peace in the embattled
province.
	   The French foreign minister warned that Milosevic must still
pull out more troops, and U.S. envoy Christopher Hill and European
ambassadors pressed their political initiative in new talks with
ethnic Albanian political leader Ibrahim Rugova.
	   Concerned by continuing sporadic violence, a European envoy said
attacks by the Albanians' Kosovo Liberation Army could put efforts
to reach a peaceful political solution in ``serious jeopardy.''
	   ``We ask Kosovo people and especially the armed forces, Kosovo
forces, to stop any provocations,'' said Wolfgang Petrisch, the
Austrian ambassador to Yugoslavia and European Union envoy in
Kosovo, after meeting with Rugova.
	   Ten days after the breakthrough agreement on Kosovo brokered by
American diplomat Richard Holbrooke, there are still reports of
shelling and shooting incidents at night in the separatist province
of Serbia.
	   The Kosovo Information Center said four members of an ethnic
Albanian family _ three of them children _ were killed and two
wounded early Thursday when the Yugoslav army opened fire near
Djakovica on the Albanian border. The center, close to the
province's ethnic Albanian leadership, said the victims were
refugees who were crossing back over from Albania to return to
their homes.
	   The report could not be confirmed.
	   Still threatening airstrikes, NATO has given Milosevic until
Tuesday to withdraw more military and special police forces from
Kosovo and return others to garrison in the province where he
launched an offensive against ethnic Albanian guerrillas eight
months ago.
	   ``The withdrawal of forces is very advanced, but that is not
enough,'' French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said on France's
RTL radio Thursday, warning that the conflict could explode again.
NATO must ``not let go'' now, he said.
	   Milosevic also must cooperate with war crimes investigations and
efforts to aid and return the 300,000 people displaced from their
homes, and agree on a specific timetable for talks giving Kosovo
Albanians self-government and their own local police.
	   But the ethnic Albanians must consent to such political
negotiations, and many remain reluctant to give up their goal of
outright independence, which the West opposes for fear of
triggering similar demands elsewhere in the Balkans.
	   While the KLA has been fighting for independence, the West
considers the moderate Rugova and his negotiating team the
legitimate representatives of Kosovo Albanians, who account for
about 90 percent of the province's 2 million people.
	   Rugova said his team was working out what he called an ``interim
solution'' with Hill.
	   He also made clear he does not support the recent attacks by the
KLA, over which he has no control.
	   ``We urge also all groups of people to demonstrate
self-restraint so any act of theirs is not used as a provocation,
namely as a pretext for new assaults on Kosovo,'' Rugova said after
meeting the European envoys.
	   Efforts to organize a 2,000-strong team to verify compliance
with the peace deal appeared stalled because would-be contributor
nations are concerned about safety and want the U.N. Security
Council to endorse the plan first.
	   The operation is to be directed by the Vienna, Austria-based
Organization for Security and Cooperation, which must ask its 54
member states to provide the Kosovo monitors.
	   ``Obviously, the physical security of 2,000 people in a zone of
turmoil, of conflict, is of utmost importance,'' said the American
head of the operation, William G. Walker.
	   Also concerned about security and cooperation, the president of
the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal urged the U.N. Security Council to
press Yugoslavia to cooperate with the court in its efforts to
investigate alleged atrocities in Kosovo.
	   U.S. judge Gabrielle Kirk McDonald said in a letter to the
council that she is ``gravely concerned'' the Holbrooke-Milosevic
agreement lacks an explicit recognition of Yugoslavia's obligation
to cooperate.
	   Meanwhile, the KLA confirmed Thursday it was holding captive two
Serbian journalists from the state news agency Tanjug who
disappeared last Sunday in Kosovo. The rebels said they expected to
release them shortly.

Political turmoil could scuttle implementation of agreement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INCORPORATES Israel-Palestinians. &QL; 
 &UR; With US-Mideast Talks &QL; 
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli hard-liners believe they can delay a
handover of territory to the Palestinians for months even if Israel
signs a pullback agreement at the summit in the United States, a
leading legislator said Thursday.
	   The key to the plan is bringing down the government of Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and forcing early elections.
	   Hanan Porat, a member of the National Religious Party and a
legislator in Netanyahu's coalition, said it would be untenable for
Netanyahu to implement a withdrawal during an election campaign.
	   Israel's withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank is to be
gradual, stretching over a span of 12 weeks and making it more
vulnerable to disruptions caused by Israeli political turmoil.
	   If Netanyahu returns from the Mideast summit with an agreement
on a troop withdrawal, he will have to fight hard to win Cabinet
approval for the deal. Israeli media say Netanyahu can expect
support only from five of his 16 Cabinet ministers, with four
opposed and seven undecided.
	   Parliament approval will be easier, with opposition parties
saying they will back the agreement and thus cancel out the ``nay''
votes of hard-line members of Netanyahu's coalition.
	   However, this does not remove the threat to Netanyahu.
	   The opposition says that while it will support a peace
agreement, it will not back Netanyahu on domestic issues, like the
budget. In Israel, defeat of the national budget is the same as a
vote of no confidence.
	   Also, the Land of Israel Front _ 12 coalition legislators
opposed to a pullback _ says that once a withdrawal agreement is
signed, it would act like an opposition party and vote against the
government on all issues.
	   Israeli media on Thursday quoted Netanyahu aides as saying the
prime minister might call snap elections if he believes he cannot
get a withdrawal agreement passed in the Cabinet or in parliament.
	   In case of a new vote, Porat said a troop withdrawal would have
to be delayed. ``I hope the prime minister will not even consider
implementing the withdrawal during the 60 days of an election
campaign,'' Porat told The Associated Press.
	   ``This would seem quite absurd to me ... implementing a
withdrawal when he is involved in a struggle in the field, a
legitimate one, but including demonstrations and a lot of unrest,''
Porat said.
	   Jewish settlers on Thursday provided a first taste of what might
be in store for Netanyahu if he returns home with an agreement.
	   At more than a dozen West Bank roads, settlers stopped
Palestinian traffic near areas that might come under Palestinian
control.
	   In most of the protests, police did not interfere, rerouting
Palestinian motorists instead. However, at two junctions policemen
scuffled with demonstrators, and nine settlers were detained.

Independent media pledge to fight government crackdown in Serbia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOVANA GEC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Defying a government crackdown,
Serbia's independent media pledged Thursday to fight a repressive
information law by taking it to court.
	   The editors of several newspapers, news agencies and electronic
media said their editorial policies would remain the same despite
large fines envisioned to punish those critical of the authorities.
	   ``The law was adopted to frighten the journalists and thus cause
self-censorship,'' the media representatives were quoted by the
Beta news agency as saying. They called the move unacceptable and
pledged to continue their work professionally.
	   The Serbian government, loyal to Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic, has faced a wave of domestic and international criticism
over the new restrictions.
	   Media outlets said they would take the new information law to
the Constitutional Court and organize a one-day protest strike. But
courts in Serbia are also controlled by Milosevic's government and
the move is expected to have little effect.
	   Aleksandar Vucic, Serbia's information minister from the
ultranationalist Radical Party, warned Thursday that media were
under non-stop scrutiny by ``expert services,'' indicating that
government pressure would only heighten.
	   The law passed by the Serbian parliament on Tuesday bans
broadcasts of Serbian language programs by foreign news outlets. It
calls for fines of 400,000-800,000 dinars (dlrs 41,000-82,000)
against editors and media owners who violate it.
	   It also gives broad powers to the authorities to determine which
reports break the law, and further restricts working permits for
media organizations.
	   Independent legal experts and journalists say the law
reintroduces censorship, which Serbia formally abandoned in the
late 1980s, and leads the country back to single-party
dictatorship.
	   The United States condemned the new media restrictions as
``draconian'' and alleged they were designed to hide the truth of
Serb atrocities in Kosovo, where hundreds of people have been
killed and 300,000 driven from their homes in this year's
crackdown.
	   The law superseded a decree which had banned three newspapers _
Danas, Nasa Borba and Dnevni Telegraf _ last week, citing the
danger of NATO military intervention. The ban was lifted Wednesday
and the journalists were back in their offices Thursday.
	   Slavko Curuvija, owner and editor of Dnevni Telegraf, said his
daily suffered ``great damage'' because of the one-week closure.
	   Vucic said the new law also applied to newspapers published in
Montenegro, Serbia's junior partner in the Yugoslav federation. His
comment came after some Serbian papers hinted they would move to
Montenegro to avoid media restrictions.
	   The leadership of Montenegro is pro-reform, and its president,
Milo Djukanovic, has clashed with Milosevic over several political
and economic issues.

generosity &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ In a rare show of unity,
leaders from across the political and religious spectrums agreed
Thursday to a code of conduct, including respect for all peoples
regardless of their beliefs.
	   President Nelson Mandela opened a ``Morals Summit'' at the
Johannesburg Civic Center by calling on participants to eradicate
the ``moral malaise'' which remains after the demise of apartheid.
	   Symptoms of the malaise include corruption in the public and
private sectors and in the justice system, abuse of women and
children, tax evasion and refusal to pay for services, Mandela
said.
	   ``The time has come to do all we can to seek out, beyond the
political differences which we have, common ground as a basis for
national action,'' Mandela said.
	   Leaders of the governing African National Congress, the National
Party _ which ruled during apartheid, the right-wing Freedom Front,
the Inkatha Freedom Party and other parties signed a declaration
committing themselves to principles of respect, generosity,
integrity, incorruptibility, accountability and justice.
	   The unity shown at the summit will likely be shattered as the
opposing parties gear up for the 1999 general elections, the first
since the 1994 all-race elections which marked the end of
apartheid.
	   The summit was organized by religious leaders from traditional
African, Christian, Jewish, Muslim and Hindu faiths.
	   A second morals summit is planned for next year.

Chernomyrdin: Yeltsin's health underscores need for vice president
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS for AMs with Chernomyrdin remarks. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia needs a vice president who could take over
if President Boris Yeltsin's health continues to deteriorate,
former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said Thursday.
	   ``If a good vice president were working now, there would be no
concern over the health of the president or early presidential
elections,'' Chernomyrdin said, according to the Interfax news
agency.
	   Russia had a vice president previously, but the position was
abolished when the country revamped its constitution in 1993. The
last vice president, Alexander Rutskoi, led a rebellion against
Yeltsin in the fall of that year that failed and prompted the
constitutional changes.
	   Chernomyrdin was referring to growing speculation about the
health of Yeltsin, who had to cancel an upcoming trip abroad
because of a respiration infection.
	   Yeltsin, 67, has been dogged by health problems for years,
including bypass surgery in 1996. With every new illness comes a
flurry of rumors that he is unable to fill his post and may step
down.
	   In light of Yeltsin's health, Chernomyrdin said that scrapping
the vice presidency ``was probably not the right decision,''
according to Interfax.
	   Yeltsin met with aides on Thursday and was preparing for one-day
trip to Austria next week, said presidential spokesman Dmitry
Yakushkin.
	   The trip had originally been announced as a two-day visit, but
Yeltsin now plans to arrive and leave Austria next Tuesday.
Yakushkin insisted that the president would hold all his scheduled
meetings with European leaders.
	   Yeltsin and his doctors insist that the president will serve out
the two years remaining in his term, and they deny speculation that
he has serious health problems.

negotiations, and many remain reluctant to give up their goal of
outright independence, which the West opposes for fear of
triggering similar demands elsewhere in the Balkans.
	   While the KLA has been fighting for independence, the West
considers the moderate Rugova and his negotiating team the
legitimate representatives of Kosovo Albanians, who account for
about 90 percent of the province's 2 million people.
	   Rugova said his team was working out what he called an ``interim
solution'' with Hill.
	   He also made clear he does not support the recent attacks by the
KLA, over which he has no control.
	   ``We urge also all groups of people to demonstrate
self-restraint so any act of theirs is not used as a provocation,
namely as a pretext for new assaults on Kosovo,'' Rugova said after
meeting the European envoys.
	   Meanwhile, efforts to organize a 2,000-strong team to verify
compliance with the peace deal appeared stalled because would-be
contributor nations are concerned about safety and want the U.N.
Security Council to endorse the plan first.
	   The operation is to be directed by the Vienna, Austria-based
Organization for Security and Cooperation, which must ask its 54
member states to provide the Kosovo monitors.
	   ``Obviously, the physical security of 2,000 people in a zone of
turmoil, of conflict, is of utmost importance,'' said the American
head of the operation, William G. Walker.
	   Also concerned about security and cooperation, the president of
the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal urged the U.N. Security Council to
press Yugoslavia to cooperate with the court in its efforts to
investigate alleged atrocities in Kosovo.
	   U.S. judge Gabrielle Kirk McDonald said in a letter to the
council that she is ``gravely concerned'' the Holbrooke-Milosevic
agreement lacks an explicit recognition of Yugoslavia's obligation
to cooperate.
	   Meanwhile, the KLA confirmed Thursday it was holding captive two
Serbian journalists from the state news agency Tanjug who
disappeared last Sunday in Kosovo. The rebels said they expected to
release them shortly.

 &UR; Nearly 6,000 minks set free from fur farm &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ About 5,700 minks were set free from a
western Sweden fur farm overnight by unknown vandals, police said
Thursday. It was at least the third such incident in a month.
	   No immediate arrests were made, but suspicion fell on
animal-rights activists.
	   The release from the fur farm near Vaenersborg, some 350
kilometers (220 miles) west of Stockholm, was discovered after a
motorist reported a large number of dead minks along a highway.
	   ``The driver told me that it was 'like driving through a plowed
field','' Stig Eriksson of the Vaenersborg police was quoted as
saying by the Swedish news agency TT.
	   In September, about 3,000 minks were released in Sweden in two
incidents. In one of the cases, the vandals painted a building door
with DBF, the Swedish acronym for Animal Liberation Front.
	   Also in September, about 8,000 minks were released in Britain
and another 4,000 in Finland.

Convicted German neo-Nazi facing new charges
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SCHWERIN, Germany (AP) _ Convicted neo-Nazi terrorist Manfred
Roeder was charged Thursday with inciting racial hatred for
referring to the Holocaust as ``humbug'' during an election rally.
	   Roeder, 69, ran as a candidate for the extreme-right National
Party of Germany in the east German city of Stralsund, but failed
to make it into parliament.
	   Prosecutors charged that during an Aug. 22 rally, he said he
personally dined with the commander of Auschwitz after the war and
so knew that stories about the Holocaust were ``humbug.''
	   Denying the Holocaust is illegal in Germany.
	   Roeder, a well-known neo-Nazi figure, was convicted in 1982 of
arson attacks that killed two foreigners. He was released from
prison in 1990 after serving eight years of a 13-year sentence.
	   He was in the headlines again last winter after it came to light
that he had given a speech at a German army officer's academy in
1995.
	   Officers responsible for inviting Roeder to the Hamburg
officer's academy said they didn't know at the time that he was a
neo-Nazi, and didn't report the incident to authorities later,
fearing reprimands.

Japan's big three brokerages report huge losses

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Battered by financial turbulence abroad and
recession at home, Japan's top three brokerages on Thursday
announced hefty losses for the latest six months, prompting
restructuring drives that will include major job cuts.
	   Nomura Securities Co., Japan's biggest brokerage, was the worst
hit, posting losses of dlrs 1.76 billion _ much of that from
foreign operations _ for the half year ended Sept. 30. Daiwa
Securities Co. and Nikko Securities Co. also suffered heavily.
	   The earnings reports came amid deepening concern that the recent
wild volatility in global markets may severely strain financial
giants around the world.
	   Nomura President Junichi Ujiie announced sweeping restructuring
measures that will include reducing the brokerage's 10,000-strong
work force by 2,000 within three years.
	   Daiwa also said it will cut costs by downsizing. Nikko, hurt the
least by havoc in emerging markets, announced it would close its
offices in Malaysia and Thailand.
	   Many other Japanese financial institutions already had begun
restructuring to prepare for a series of deregulation measures that
will open up Japan's economy to greater competition.
	   Analysts fear, however, that these efforts are unlikely to bear
fruit soon enough to help stave off more pain in the near and
middle term.
	   ``Major securities companies are actively diversifying their
business operations, but it will take some time for these new
business structures to generate profits,'' said Hideyasu Ban, an
analyst at Morgan Stanley.
	   Nomura's group loss of 207.2 billion yen (dlrs 1.76 billion) for
the first half of the fiscal year compared to a net profit of 49.71
billion yen (dlrs 422 million) in the same period a year earlier.
	   Nomura said it lost about dlrs 600 million on Russian bonds and
another dlrs 600 million on U.S. mortgage-backed securities.
	   The parent company also had a 33.72 billion yen (dlrs 288
million) valuation loss on its domestic securities holdings for the
six months. At home, all three brokerages suffered from the weak
stock market, rules allowing more competitive commissions, and
securities valuation losses.
	   Daiwa Securities reported a group net loss of 66.84 billion yen
(dlrs 568 million) for the half-year, compared to a net profit of
15.53 billion yen (dlrs 132 million) a year earlier.
	   Nikko Securities suffered a group net less of 57.72 billion yen
(dlrs 491 million) compared to a net profit of 283 million yen
(dlrs 2.4 million) a year earlier.
	   Nikko didn't have large losses in emerging markets, but revenues
fell at its U.S., European and Asian operations, the company said.
	   Nomura's restructuring plan aims to cut costs at its overseas
operations by 20 percent. It also plans to inject dlrs 1.2 billion
in capital into its U.S. unit, Nomura America Holding Inc., which
posted a dlrs 1.16 billion pretax loss for the fiscal half.
	   Ujiie told reporters that Nomura will cut 2,000 jobs through
hiring freezes or early retirement by the year 2001. The cuts are
reported likely to affect Nomura's U.S. and British subsidiaries.
	   The Nomura president also said that previously independent
trading and investment banking operations around the world would in
the future be controlled in Tokyo.
	   That will allow the parent company to deal more successfully
with unpredictability in emerging markets, Ujiie said.
	   ``I don't think the current credit crisis will last too long,
but in the short term the business situation will remain very
tough,'' Ujiie said.

Greek jets hit mock targets in Cyprus war games
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HAMZA HENDAWI &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Greek warplanes hit mock targets in the
Nicosia area Thursday, the third day of joint Greek and Cypriot war
games that have increased tensions on this divided Mediterranean
island.
	   The Cypriot Defense Ministry also accused Turkish aircraft of
violating Cypriot air space for the second time since the joint
maneuvers with Greece began Tuesday.
	   The Defense Ministry said four F-16 fighter jets and two A-7
Corsair bombers from Greece's air force took part in the drill over
Nicosia.
	   It did not say whether the planes returned to Greece or landed
at a controversial military field near Paphos in western Cyprus. It
added that the jets would take part in further exercises Friday.
	   The six-day war games, held under the provisions of a 1993
defense pact between Cyprus and Greece, will end Sunday with a
military parade in the southern resort town of Larnaca. The
maneuvers have raised tension on the island, where Greek Cypriot
and Turkish Cypriot community are divided by a U.N. buffer zone.
	   Turkey's forces have occupied the northern third of Cyprus since
its invasion of the island in 1974 following a coup by Greek
Cypriots who wanted to unite the island with Greece.
	   The Greek Cypriot government is the only internationally
recognized administration on the island. A breakaway state in the
Turkish-occupied north was declared in 1983 but is recognized only
by Ankara.
	   The Defense Ministry said Turkish jets invaded Cyprus air space
about midday Thursday, flying over Larnaca and Paphos. It gave no
details.
	   Both Cyprus and Greece accused Turkish craft of buzzing Greek
military aircraft and violated Greece's air space Tuesday.
	   Turkey, A NATO partner but traditional rival of Greece, denied
it invaded Cypriot airspace on Tuesday. It had no immediate
response Thursday.

Two journalists sentenced to a year with labor for libel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Two Egyptian journalists were sentenced to a
year in prison with hard labor Thursday after being convicted of
libeling a pro-government politician.
	   Their convictions bring to six the number of editors and
reporters who have been sentenced to prison for libel this year.
Human rights groups have condemned the cases as an attempt to
muzzle the press.
	   The Cairo Felony Court also fined Mustafa Bakry, editor-in-chief
of El-Osbou Nasserite newspaper, and his brother Mahmoud, a deputy
editor for the same newspaper, 501 Egyptian pounds (dlrs 147).
	   The Bakrys had published articles in the opposition daily
Al-Ahrar in 1996 accusing Mohammed Abdel-Aal of engaging
prostitutes and using his influence as a member of the Shura
Council to seize properties.
	   The brothers subsequently left Al-Ahrar over political
differences with the paper's directors.
	   A spokesman for the Cairo-based Center for Human Rights Legal
Aid, Gasser Abdel-Razek, said Thursday the Bakrys were preparing to
go to prison and file an appeal. Under Egyptian law, persons jailed
by felony courts can appeal only while serving their sentences.
	   Abdel-Aal voted with the government when he sat in the Shura, as
the Egyptian senate is called.
	   All four of the journalists imprisoned earlier this year have
been released, either because they were pardoned or have finished
their terms. Rights groups have urged judges to opt for fines
rather than jail sentences.
	   The Center for Human Rights Legal Aid says there are at least 34
journalists awaiting trial or under investigation for publication
offenses.

Assailant carried out attack in response to Israeli pressure

<TEXT>
	   JERICHO, West Bank (AP) - A Hamas activist who hurled grenades
at a crowded Israeli bus station, said in a pre-attack video tape
that he acted to atone for accepting money from Israel's Shin Bet
security service, a Palestinian official said Thursday.
	   In the video tape, delivered by a friend of 29-year-old Salem
Sarsour, to Jibril Rajoub, chief of Palestinian security, Sarsour
said he was approached several times by a man he identified as
Capt. Tamir from the Israeli intelligence who gave him money and a
cellular phone.
	   According to Rajoub, Sarsour regretted taking the money and felt
he ``disgraced his family and the group he identified with,'' and
decided to make-up for it by carrying out Monday's grenade attack
in which 64 Israelis were wounded.
	   Israeli media, citing sources in the secretive agency, reported
that Shin Bet agents had tried to recruit Sarsour two weeks before
the grenade attack, assuming him to be a low-level Hamas activist.
	   Rajoub said Sarsour had not thought he would live through the
attack. He was apprehended shortly after throwing a second grenade
into a crowded bus station in a southern Israeli city and has
confessed to Israeli police.
	   In the video, Sarsour admitted to stabbing to death an elderly
rabbi in the West Bank city if Hebron and throwing two grenades at
an Israeli army post there on Yom Kippur, Judaism's holiest day.
	   The militant Islamic group Hamas opposes Israeli-Palestinian
peace-making and has carried out dozens of deadly attacks against
Israelis.

Another bank employee fired after confirming first lady's account
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ A bank employee said he was fired after
admitting participation in the disclosure that President Franjo
Tudjman's wife has huge, undeclared assets.
	   Robert Horvat, a 32-year-old decorated veteran of the
Serbo-Croat 1991 war told state-run news agency HINA Thursday that
he willingly confirmed another employee's claims that Tudjman's
wife, Ankica, had deposited dlrs 140,000 in Zagrebacka Banka last
March.
	   Last week Ankica Lepej, a 50-year-old clerk at the bank told the
daily Jutarnji list about the money. Police then began a criminal
investigation, at the bank's request.
	   Horvat said police interrogated him on Tuesday and he was fired
from the bank 24 hours later. Police have also interrogated Lepej,
as well as two reporters and the chief editor of Jutarnji list.
	   Revelation of the huge amount, and the fact that Tudjman did not
declare it in a recent mandatory financial disclosure, has stirred
nationwide outrage. Tudjman had said his spouse had no considerable
valuables apart from a car.
	   The affair is still a hot topic in the country, where
independent papers have for years been claiming that Tudjman and
his associates enriched themselves through corruption and shadowy
deals.
	   Tudjman's legal experts have claimed he did not have to declare
liquid assets.
	   The scandal is a heavy blow to the president, whose popularity
is already steadily fading mainly due to the increased gap between
the rich and the majority of Croats who earn less than dlrs 500 a
month.

Heavy losses at Rover threaten British car plant
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ BMW-owned car manufacturer Rover
Group is suffering heavy losses and wants to eliminate 2,400 jobs
in Britain, labor union representatives said Wednesday.
	   In a joint message to workers, several unions said urgent talks
had been held with BMW to avert a closure of Rover's huge plant at
Longbridge in Birmingham, which employs 14,000 people.
	   ``Without major surgery to cut costs immediately, via
significant job losses alongside cuts to employment-related and
other costs, there will not be a supportable survival plan to place
before the BMW board,'' the unions said, and the future of the
plant remained ``in the balance.''
	   Rover Group could not be reached for comment late Wednesday.
	   The company has become more productive since BMW bought it from
British Aerospace PLC in 1994, but the high value of the pound has
made its automobiles far less competitive in other markets, while
making imported cars cheaper for British consumers.
	   Government Trade and Industry Secretary Peter Mandelson said he
would meet Thursday morning with Bernd Pischetsrieder, chairman of
BMW, and Rover chairman Walter Hasselkus, but that Rover's fate
rested in its own hands.
	   ``Ultimately it is for the company to rise to the challenge and
to ensure that Rover continues to thrive in the global
marketplace,'' Mandleson said in the House of Commons.
	   Union leader Tony Woodley said, ``The company have made it clear
that they are sustaining losses that are completely unacceptable
and ... it is their intention to try and cut costs in a number of
areas as soon as possible.''
	   Woodley, the Transport and General Workers Union motor industry
leader, said the unions were looking at ways to assist in cutting
costs but that they ``can't and won't accept,'' closure of
Longbridge.
	   In July, Rover said it would cut jobs by the end of the year in
all areas of its business except research, design and engineering.
It also said it was planning to start buying hundreds of millions
of dollars in components from abroad.
	   At the time, Rover said it hoped to reduce the work force
through voluntary and early retirements without resorting to forced
layoffs.
	   Rover has not specified how much money the unfavorable currency
rates has cost it, but British news reports have placed the figure
at around $330 million yearly.

	   MIAMI (AP) _ A tropical depression over the Caribbean Sea was
expected to strengthen into a tropical storm Thursday.
	   An advisory was in effect for the North Atlantic, Caribbean Sea
and the Gulf of Mexico, forecasters at the National Hurricane
Center said.
	   A large area of disturbed weather changed little in organization
overnight but was beginning to interact with a frontal system,
increasing the system's potential to become a tropical storm.
	   Sustained wind near the center was blowing at about 35 mph and
was likely to reach tropical storm strength of at least 39 mph
Thursday afternoon, forecaster Ed Rappaport said.
	   At 11 a.m. EDT, the center of the poorly organized depression
was located near 12.0 north latitude and 78.0 west longitude, or
about 420 miles south-southwest of Kingston, Jamaica.
	   A reconnaissance plane was scheduled to fly into the area
Thursday if necessary, Rappaport said.
	   The combination of the depression and a cold front was forecast
to continue producing rain and gusty winds over northeastern Mexico
and portions of the southern Texas coast.

The Herminator is back; Tomba, Seizinger, Street missing
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: DELETES reference ot Wiberg retirement &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   The Herminator is back.
	   The same can't be said of retired Alberto Tomba _ or injured
Katja Seizinger and Picabo Street _ as the Alpine season opens this
weekend.
	   The Herminator is Hermann Maier, the fearless Austrian skier who
won everything in sight last season: two Olympic golds, the overall
World Cup championship (the first Austrian since 1970) and World
Cup titles in super-G and giant slalom.
	   He'll be among 200 racers _ and 500 reporters _ this weekend at
Soelden, the 2,800-meter-high (9,200-foot) Austrian glacier where
the season begins.
	   ``The conditions are wonderful with more than a meter (40
inches) of snow powder _ almost too much,'' said Peter Vorst, head
of the organizing committee.
	   Maier is reported to have turned down 150 requests for
interviews this weekend, admitting to quote-starved reporters,
``This is going to be my toughest season yet because everyone is
going to chase me.''
	   Austrian team coach Toni Giger, hearing complaints from other
team members who think Maier is getting too much attention,
admitted the same.
	   ``All of them only want to beat Maier,'' he said.
	   Tomba, the three-time Olympic and two-time world champion,
announced his retirement earlier this month after 12 seasons and
more than 50 World Cup wins.
	   Seizinger, another three-time Olympic gold medalist and the
women's overall World Cup winner, is out after injuring both knees
in summer training and is doubtful for the world championships
opening Jan. 31 in Vail.
	   Street, Olympic super-G gold medalist and Seizinger's flamboyant
American downhill rival, will miss the entire season after injuring
both legs in a spill in March in Crans Montana, Switzerland.
	   The 26-year-old Maier, best remembered for walking away from a
spectacular, somersaulting crash in Nagano Olympics, leads the
world's deepest ski team.
	   Last season, Austria's men became the first to win all of the
World Cup titles with Andreas Schifferer winning downhill and
Thomas Sykora slalom.
	   Schifferer practiced this week in Soelden and has recovered
quickly from a severe leg injury suffered in summer training.
	   Even without Seizinger, the German women are almost as strong
with Martina Ertl defending her World Cup giant slalom title.
Seizinger, Ertl and Hilde Gerg won 17 of 33 World Cup races last
season.
	   Sweden's Ylva Nowen is the defending slalom champion.
	   The 26-year-old Seizinger is no cinch to ever return.
	   ``I don't think she'll come back this season,'' her coach
Wolfgang Maier said in an interview. ``She will surely be able to
compete again, but it will depend on how much she wants to do
that.''
	   With Seizinger out, Sweden's Pernilla Wiberg _ an Olympic and
world champion who is plans to ski through the 2002 Olympics _ will
be a favorite to repeat the overall title she won in '97.
	   Wiberg, who underwent her fifth knee surgery following the
Nagano Olympics, has set lofty goals.
	   ``My knee is OK and I'm in great shape,'' said the 28-year-old
Swede. ``My goal is to make the top three in all disciplines on the
World Cup tour and win two or three medals in the world
championships.''
	   After the weekend races, the season takes almost a month off
before resuming for three weekends of racing in North America
beginning in Park City, Utah, Nov. 19-22 with men's and women's
giant slalom and slalom.
	   The circuit returns to Europe Dec. 10-13 in Val d'Isere, France,
for men's downhill and super-G and women's super-G and giant
slalom.
	   The FIS, the world governing body of the sport, has increased
the minimum purse for each men's and women's race this season from
60,000 Swiss francs (dlrs 44,000) to 100,000 (dlrs 74,000).

Thatcher free Pinochet appeal angers left-wing lawmakers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with High Court hearing on motion to free Pinochet;
edits to tighten &QL; 
 &UR; By MAUREEN JOHNSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Lawyers for Gen. Augusto Pinochet filed a court
motion Thursday contending British police acted illegally in
accepting a Spanish warrant seeking the extradition of the former
Chilean dictator.
	   Lord Justice Konrad Schiemann set a Monday hearing on the High
Court motion and refused to let lawyers make any arguments during a
brief hearing.
	   A Spanish magistrate is seeking to extradite Pinochet to face
charges of murder, torture and genocide.
	   Earlier, an appeal by Margaret Thatcher for the release of
Pinochet angered left-wing lawmakers and underlined a political
dilemma for the Labor Party government.
	   Lady Thatcher, Conservative prime minister from 1979-1990, said
Pinochet should be returned home forthwith both because he
supported Britain during the 1982 war against Argentina to reclaim
the Falkland Islands and because his arrest endangers Chile's new
democracy.
	   ``Therovernments, have
determined how they should come to terms with their past.''
	   Pinochet, 82, remains under police guard in the expensive London
clinic where he was arrested Oct. 16 at the instigation of a
Spanish magistrate.
	   The judge is seeking to extradite him on charges of murder,
genocide and torture pertaining to 4,000 people, including
Spaniards, who were killed or disappeared during his 17-year rule.
	   Pinochet, who had back surgery Oct. 9, remained commander of
Chile's army until March.
	   The crisis has soured British and Spanish relations with Chile
and pushed Chile's government into defending Pinochet on the
grounds that the arrest is straining a democracy built up since
Pinochet stood down in 1990.
	   Lady Thatcher, who entertained Pinochet in her home shortly
before he was hospitalized, noted that President Carlos Menem of
Argentina, which invaded the Falklands while under a military
dictatorship, is due on an official visit to Britain next week.
	   ``It would be disgraceful to preach reconciliation with one,
while maintaining under arrest someone who, during that same
conflict, did so much to save so many British lives,'' she wrote.
	   But Ann Clwyd, a Labor legislator who heads Parliament's Human
Rights Group, said the former prime minister is discounting the
rule of law.
	   ``I am surprised to hear Lady Thatcher, who was always keen on
promoting the law, is actually suggesting that we should do
something which is illegal,'' said Ms. Clwyd, who supports an
attempt by Amnesty International to have Pinochet tried in Britain
if he escapes extradition.

China signals no change on human rights
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China closed an unprecedented human rights
conference by signaling it would not embrace Western definitions of
civil liberties, state media reported Thursday.
	   In a speech ending the two-day conference Wednesday, the Chinese
government's most senior spokesman, Zhao Qizheng, said Beijing
would hew to its own interpretations of human rights.
	   While acknowledging the universality of rights, Zhao said the
rights to subsistence and development come first, according to
accounts of his speech carried by the Xinhua News Agency and China
Daily.
	   Zhao's speech underscored that despite a greater willingness to
discuss human rights problems and the signing of key U.N. rights
treaties, China's policies remain little changed.
	   Chinese leaders have long argued that economic rights take
primacy over basic civil and political liberties in ruling a still
largely impoverished nation of 1.2 billion people.
	   Zhao chided some Westerners for only seeing ``certain social
systems as the embodiment of human rights.''
	   ``They always believe that China, under the leadership of the
Communist Party, is a country opposing human rights,'' Zhao was
quoted as saying.
	   The human rights conference in Beijing was the first-ever
multinational academic conference China has sponsored. More than 80
delegates came from 27 countries, but no known Chinese dissidents
were allowed to attend.
	   China has turned to dialogue instead of confrontation over the
past year in a compromise with Western governments anxious to
address economic, security and other issues with Beijing.
	   Critics charge that Chinese leaders are using the softer
approach to mask continued abuses and that Western governments keen
on clinching business deals have willingly to obliged.
	   ``It is not that China's stance or policies on the issue of
human rights have changed, as some international observers have
suggested,'' the China Daily said in an editorial. ``It is rather
that the belated favorable turn in the international atmosphere has
created an opportunity for China to elaborate its perspectives and
engage in constructive communication over a thorny issue.''

Turkish central bank chief probed over bank sell-off scandal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ The prime minister of Turkey has ordered
an investigation into why the Central Bank ignored police warnings
that a top mobster was involved in a bank privatization, Hurriyet
newspaper said Thursday.
	   The Turkbank privatization was canceled last week after the
release of a taped conversation in which mob boss Alaattin Cakici
assures bidder Korkmaz Yigit that he will fend off rival bidders.
	   Yigit, who bought the bank at a televised public auction in
August for dlrs 600 million, has said he did nothing wrong.
	   Hurriyet newspaper said police intelligence warned the Central
Bank that bidders were being threatened. In a statement Thursday,
the Central Bank said got the police report after the bidding for
Turkbank was over and did nothing because it expected Prime
Minister Mesut Yilmaz to take action on the report.
	   According to Hurriyet, Yilmaz has ordered an investigation into
bank chief Gazi Ercel. Officials at the Prime Minister's office
would not comment.
	   The widening scandal over Alaattin earlier this week prompted
Yigit to decide to sell off his recently acquired TV stations and
newspapers. Last month, a government minister resigned after a tape
linking him to Alaattin was released.

Serbian hackers declare computer war on anti-Serb Web sites
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A group of Serbian computer hackers
declared a cyber war against Internet sites the hackers say are
anti-Serb, a Belgrade newspaper reported Thursday.
	   A young man, who phoned and identified himself as member of a
team of hackers known as Black Hand, also claimed responsibility
for the crash of a Kosovo Albanian site on the World Wide Web.
	   ``We shall continue to remove (ethnic) Albanian lies from the
Internet,'' the young man was quoted by the newspaper Blic as
saying.
	   The site was up again Thursday, but its webmaster Edmond
Hajullaaga confirmed that it had been crashed ``several times in
the past three days.''
	   The caller said the five-member group next plans to hack NATO's
site, but gave no further details.
	   Ethnic Albanian media and organizations in Serbia's troubled
Kosovo province have for several years used the Internet to reach a
world audience. Recently, the Serbian government has also created
several Web sites.
	   At the turn of the century, a group of Serbian officers known as
Black Hand planned a coup. The officers are believed to have been
behind the execution of a Serbian crown prince and his common-law
wife.

Camera will show audience inside singer's larynx
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ Seeing voices? Now you can.
	   When singing teacher Paul Farrington belts out ``Some Enchanted
Evening'' at a charity concert Sunday, a large screen will show
live pictures of his larynx _ direct from a tiny camera positioned
inside his throat.
	   Organizers want to the audience to feel every tremor so they can
experience the wonders of the human voice.
	   Farrington will require no surgery; instead, a thin wire with a
minute camera on the end will be slid down his throat _ ``not as
difficult as it sounds,'' said Jo Barker, a spokeswoman for
Birmingham's University Hospital.
	   ``I don't know if this is the first time someone has performed
like this, but it's certainly rare,'' she said.
	   All proceeds from the ``Rejoice the Voice'' concert at
Birmingham's Adrian Boult Hall will go to the hospital's voice
clinic, where Farrington works.
	   Farrington said it has treated nearly 500 people with vocal
problems, including singers, broadcasters and lawyers.
	   ``When their voices give up for whatever reason, it is a crisis
for them,'' he said.

Williams powers through first match of Kremlin Cup

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW, Russia (AP) _ Venus Williams proved her top-seed placing
in the second round of the Kremlin Cup Thursday, trouncing Elena
Likhovtseva 6-3, 6-1.
	   The American faltered slightly in the first set when she dropped
two games after going up 4-1. But she quickly regained control and
powered through the rest of the match, taking only 50 minutes to
win.
	   Her only gift to Likhovtseva was in the sixth game of the second
set. Up 5-0, Williams double faulted and committed three unforced
errors to lose the game. It would be her only lost game in the
second set.
	   In other second round action of the dlrs 1 million tournament,
second seed Monica Seles of the United States downed Barbara Schett
of Germany, 6-3, 6-4.
	   In the first set, Seles broke Schett in the fourth game to go
ahead 3-1, but double-faulted and lost at love in the next game.
	   Seles regained her balance, however, sending a blistering
double-handed backhand down the line to clinch the sixth set.
	   Seles said she still has her eyes on the top ranking. ``I have
to improve a couple of things to be No. 1 and I'm trying to do
that, she said. ``The competition is very hard but that is one of
the reasons why I'm still playing.''
	   After two days of upsets, Thursday saw one more suprise defeat,
with WTA ninth-ranked Patty Schnyder losing to Magui Serna, ranked
29th, 6-7 (3-7), 4-6.
	   But the remaining seeded players showed their dominance, with
fifth-seed Mary Pierce of France making short work of Belgian
Sabine Appelmans, 6-2, 6-2.
	   Sandrine Testud, seeded seventh, defeated Natasha Zvereva 6-4,
6-3, and Sylvia Farina beat Henrieta Nagoya 6-3, 6-1. Katarina
Studenikova defeated Chanda Rubin in straight sets, 6-3, 7-5.
	   In continuing first round doubles matches, Manon Bollegraf Elena
Tatarkova beat Sabine Appelmans and Anke Huber, 6-3, 6-0.
	   Cara Black and Irina Selyutina defeated Katrina Adams and Larisa
Neiland, 6-3, 6-3.

Two journalists sentenced to a year with labor for libel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Two Egyptian journalists were sentenced to a
year in prison with hard labor Thursday after being convicted of
libeling a pro-government politician.
	   Their convictions bring to six the number of editors and
reporters who have been sentenced to prison for libel this year.
Human rights groups have condemned the cases as an attempt to
muzzle the press.
	   The Cairo Felony Court also fined Mustafa Bakry, editor-in-chief
of El-Osbou Nasserite newspaper, and his brother Mahmoud, a deputy
editor for the same newspaper, 501 Egyptian pounds (dlrs 147).
	   The Bakrys had published articles in the opposition daily
Al-Ahrar in 1996 accusing Mohammed Abdel-Aal of engaging
prostitutes and using his influence as a member of the Shura
Council to seize properties.
	   The brothers subsequently left Al-Ahrar over political
differences with the paper's directors.
	   A spokesman for the Cairo-based Center for Human Rights Legal
Aid, Gasser Abdel-Razek, said Thursday the Bakrys were preparing to
go to prison and file an appeal. Under Egyptian law, persons jailed
by felony courts can appeal only while serving their sentences.
	   The Center for Human Rights Legal Aid says there are at least 34
journalists awaiting trial or under investigation for publication
offenses.

Suspected war criminal goes on trial in military court
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ A former Rwandan mayor suspected of
murder and violations of the Geneva Convention will go on trial
before a Swiss military court in November, a senior army official
said Thursday.
	   Fulgence Niyonteze, 34, is also accused of inciting murder while
head of the community of Mushubati in the Rwandan province of
Gitirama, 50 kilometers south west of the capital Kigali, during
the country's 1994 genocide, army chief auditor Dieter Weber said.
	   Niyonteze applied for asylum after arriving in Switzerland in
1994. He lived with his family in the western city of Fribourg
before Swiss authorities arrested him in August 1996. If found
guilty of the charges, he could be sentenced to a maximum of life
in prison.
	   The trial begins on November 30 and is expected to last two
weeks. Several dozen witnesses will testify against Niyonteze and
some are expected to be flown from their homes in Rwanda. Members
of the court may visit the country to see the scene of the alleged
crimes and hear witnesses.
	   The case represents the first occasion on which a Rwandan
suspected of war crimes has gone before a national court.
	   Previously, such cases have only been heard by international
courts in Arusha, Tanzania and The Hague in the Netherlands.
	   More than 500,000 minority Tutsis and politically moderate Hutus
were massacred in the Hutu government-orchestrated genocide in
1994. The genocide ended when Tutsi-led rebels won power in July
1994.

Another bank employee fired after confirming first lady's bank

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ A bank employee said Thursday that he was
fired after admitting his part in disclosing that President Franjo
Tudjman's wife has undeclared bank assets, a revelation that has
caused a nationwide stir.
	   Robert Horvat, a 32-year-old decorated veteran of the
Serbo-Croat 1991 war told state-run news agency HINA that he
willingly confirmed another employee's claims that Tudjman's wife,
Ankica, had deposited dlrs 140,000 in Zagrebacka Banka last March.
	   Reports about the amount, and the fact that Tudjman did not
declare it in a recent mandatory financial disclosure, has stirred
outrage in Croatia, where most people make less than dlrs 500 a
month.
	   Tudjman reported that his spouse had no considerable valuables
apart from a car.
	   Last week Ankica Lepej, a 50-year-old clerk at the bank, told
the daily Jutarnji list about the money. At the bank's request,
police subsequently began a criminal investigation into whether
Lepej and other bank employees broke confidentiality rules.
	   Horvat said police interrogated him on Tuesday and that he was
fired from the bank 24 hours later. Police also have interrogated
Lepej, as well as two reporters and the chief editor of the
newspaper.
	   The affair is a hot topic in Croatia, where independent papers
have for years claimed that Tudjman and his associates enriched
themselves through corruption and shadowy deals. The scandal is a
heavy blow to the president, whose popularity is fading mainly due
to an increasing gap between rich and poor in Croatia.
	   Tudjman's legal experts have claimed he did not have to declare
liquid assets.

Tank shell injures civilian in south Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NABATIYEH, Lebanon (AP) _ A tank shell fired from the
Israeli-occupied zone injured a man in south Lebanon on Thursday,
the second case of civilians being injured by such shelling this
week, Lebanese security officials said.
	   Mohammed Naim Atewi, 38, was wounded in the shoulder by shrapnel
from a shell that exploded outside his house in the village of Kfar
Roumman near the market town of Nabatiyeh, the officials said.
	   Speaking on customary condition of anonymity, the officials said
the shell was fired from an outpost manned jointly by Israeli
forces and their allied Lebanese militiamen in the occupied zone.
	   It was not immediately clear whether the shell was fired by
Israeli troops or the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army militia.
	   On Monday, two Lebanese civilians, including a 12-year-old girl,
were injured when a shell from the occupied zone exploded near
their houses about a kilometer (half a mile) away.
	   Israel set up the zone in 1985 to shield its northern towns from
cross-border guerrilla attacks.

German state opposes building maglev train between Berlin-Hamburg
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SCHWERIN, Germany (AP) _ Industry leaders said they were still
behind plans for a high-tech, super-fast train link from Berlin to
Hamburg despite new opposition to the project Thursday from a state
government.
	   ``The light is green for the magnetic-levitation rail,'' said
Peter Jablonski, spokesman for the Transrapid Planning Group.
	   Partners in the incoming leftist government in
Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, one of five states through which the
maglev train is to pass, said Thursday they had agreed not to offer
any state money for the controversial project.
	   But Jablonski said that decision would have no effect on the
project, which is being paid for by the federal government and
private companies involved in building it _ Thyssen AG, Siemens AG
and Adtranz, a joint venture of Daimler-Benz and the Swiss-Swedish
electrical engineering group ABB.
	   Last weekend, the new center-left federal government also cast
doubt on the project, saying it would honor contracts signed by the
outgoing government, but would not pay for any cost overruns.
	   The federal railway office estimated last week that the project
will probably cost up to 2.8 billion marks (dlrs 1.75 billion) more
than the 6.1 billion marks (dlrs 3.8 billion) originally planned.
	   Industry leaders say they won't know if there are any cost
overruns until final plans for the 297 kilometer (185 mile) stretch
are approved following public hearings.
	   But Thyssen spokesman Werner Bechtel was optimistic, saying:
``We're sticking to the Transrapid.''
	   The Transrapid is to reduce the time it takes to ride between
Germany's two largest cities by two-thirds to about an hour.
	   Opponents have challenged the project because of its cost and
charge the powerful electromagnetic force that will drive the train
could have adverse health consequences for humans and animals.
	   Officials in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania say they want more
money invested in improving and expanding existing rail links.

Kohl warns Germans against flexing muscle in future
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ With Germany soon to be governed from the
prewar capital Berlin, outgoing Chancellor Helmut Kohl warned the
nation in an interview published Thursday against flexing its
muscle.
	   Kohl, who championed the idea of embedding Germany firmly in
Europe during his 16 years in power, said Germans must remain
committed to the goal.
	   ``We must take our task very seriously, but stay far away from
any fit of megalomania,'' he told the business monthly Capital.
	   The interview was conducted last month, before Kohl's resounding
defeat in Sept. 27 elections.
	   Kohl's successor, Gerhard Schroeder, is the first German
chancellor with no personal memory of World War II, feeding
speculation that he will view ties with other European nations,
especially France, less emotionally than Kohl.
	   Schroeder will lead the government's return to Berlin next year.
	   Kohl said young Germans are ``open to the world'' and view life
in a Europe without war or borders as normal.
	   But he acknowledged that a common European foreign policy is
still far off.
	   ``I wouldn't talk about years but decades, human nature being
what it is,'' he said.

Sri Lankan business leaders vow to try to end 15-year civil war
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NIRESH ELIATAMBY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Sri Lanka's most influential
businessmen Thursday launched a campaign to try to end the
country's 15-year-old civil war, vowing not be stalled by political
bickering which has scuttled previous attempts at peace.
	   ``We will lead, and politicians will have to follow,'' declared
Lalith Kotelawala, chairman of the powerful Ceylinco Group. ``We
will seek peace.''
	   The leaders, who include the heads of all six chambers of
commerce, are exasperated with the ruling Peoples Alliance and the
main opposition United National Party who have spent the last three
years disagreeing on the government's proposal to give ethnic
Tamils more powers to rule themselves.
	   Rebels among the Tamils are fighting for a separate homeland in
the country's north and east, claiming that they are discriminated
against by the majority Sinhalese who control the government and
the military.
	   The guerrillas, who have scuttled two previous attempts at
negotiations by staging surprise attacks on the military, are yet
to comment on the new peace initiative.
	   The war has reached a stalemate, with neither side gaining much
ground in the last year, drained of fighters.
	   ``We are doing this purely in order to stay competitive
economically,'' said Ken Balendra, who heads the Ceylon Chamber of
Commerce.
	   More than 55,000 people have died in the fighting, and defense
spending has drained the economy.
	   The initiative drew praise from many, but the businessmen made
it clear that they had a long way to go.
	   ``We fully endorse and commend business leaders for taking this
initiative, and encourage political leaders to identify the main
issues and work in a bipartisan way to solve them,'' said U.S.
Ambassador Shaun E. Donnelly.
	   The businessmen were optimistic, noting that both main political
parties have pledged their support.
	   ``We unreservedly welcome the initiative, but your task is
gargantuan,'' said Lakshman Peiris, the minister of constitutional
affairs and the architect of the government's stalled peace plan.

Hard-liners urge Iranians to vote to avoid embarrassment
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Polls open at 8 a.m. (0430gmt) Friday
 &UR; By SCHEHEREZADE FARAMARZI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Fearing an embarrassing low turnout in a key
election Friday, senior conservative clerics fervently urged
Iranians to vote in large numbers to show confidence in the
19-year-old Islamic regime.
	   The hard-line controlled state Tehran radio spent half its hour
long main news program Thursday broadcasting calls for people to
show their ``brave presence'' at polling stations to elect the
Assembly of Experts.
	   Besides the presidential polls, the election for the 86-member
assembly is the most important in Iran because the caucus elects
and supervises the country's supreme leader, who has the final say
in government decisions.
	   Among those urging people to vote was Grand Ayatollah Kazem
Lankarani, who called it a ``divine duty'' and warned that ``the
revolution's enemies are waiting to strike a strong blow at our
regime.''
	   Despite the urging, the lackluster election campaign has failed
to draw much excitement because of lack of competition: most of the
161 candidates _ all clergymen _ are hard-liners who were selected
by a supervisory Council of Guardians controlled by conservatives.
	   In vetting 396 aspirants, the council eliminated most supporters
of President Mohammad Khatami, a moderate clergyman with wide
popular support.
	   Khatami's followers want to make the supreme leader more
accountable to the people while the hard-liners prefer a much more
hands-off approach.
	   The conflict is the latest chapter in a pervasive power struggle
in the ruling clergy between Khatami and conservative clergymen who
control most of the major state institutions such as the judiciary
and security agencies.
	   Since his elections last year, Khatami has stunned the
hard-liners with bold and popular attempts to ease social,
political and media restrictions that were imposed after the 1979
Islamic Revolution installed the government of theologians.
	   By eliminating the moderates for Friday's assembly election, the
conservatives were hoping to prevent a repeat of the stinging
defeat in 1997 presidential election when 20 million out of 30
million people voted for Khatami against a hard-line rival.
	   But then the hard-liners began to fear a low turnout would look
bad after some moderate groups decided to boycott the vote to
protest the dumping of moderate candidates as well as to call into
question the legitimacy of the conservatives.
	   Other moderates believe that people must vote to at least keep
the most stringent hard-liners out of the assembly, such as
Mohammad Yazdi, head of the judiciary, and Ahmad Jannati, head of
the Council of Guardians.
	   The moderates also do not want their candidates _ few as they
are _ to suffer because of a low turnout.
	   Candidates linked to the moderate camp include former President
Hashemi Rafsanjani and Parliament member Majid Ansari, 44, who
wants the assembly to submit regular reports of its work and to
open its sessions to public.
	   Fewer than 10 million of a little more than 38 million eligible
voters are expected to take part. Even the hard-line Abrar daily
estimated that 15 million people will vote, a turnout of 39
percent.
	   Hoping to save the day, Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei
issued his final appeal Wednesday.
	   ``The people, by their huge turnout at the elections of the
Assembly of Experts will inject a new life into the revolution,''
he said.
	   Some 100,000 security forces will be deployed around the
country's 28 provinces for the voting in 33,312 polling stations.
First official results are not expected until Saturday.

	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _Soldiers, armored personnel carriers and
artillery pieces left Harare on Thursday, apparently headed for
Congo for a promised new offensive against Congolese rebels.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton's special envoy to the region called
for restraint and more impetus for peace talks.
	   ``We are anxious to get a cease fire in place...we do not want
to see the situation there get out of control,'' said the envoy,
Howard Wolpe, after meeting Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe on
Thursday.
	   Congo President Laurent Kabila's allies _ Angola, Namibia and
Zimbabwe _ agreed Wednesday to attack the rebels in their jungle
stronghold in eastern Congo.
	   Rwanda and Uganda reportedly back the rebels.
	   The proposed offensive represents a major escalation in the
conflict threatening the Great Lakes Region. Until now, Kabila's
allies have been defending the government in the western Congo,
where rebels started their drive against Kabila in August.
	   Civilian hospital officials in Harare reported being asked to
assist in an
	   inoculation program for soldiers believed destined for the
steamy, insect-infested jungles.
	   Coming rains are expected to close many roads and hamper the
allies' advantage of air support.
	   Harare-based defense analyst Michael Quintana said the allied
troops will be hampered by longer supply lines than the rebels, who
are close to their bases in the vast mineral rich country.
	   ``The rebels ... are likely to roll with the allied punch, bide
their time and then come back with a sting,'' he said.
	   Quintana said allied reinforcements would be needed to hold
Kinshasa and other government-controlled areas as the offensive
proceeds toward rebel-held territory.
	   Residents on the main route to Harare's Manyame military air
base reported seeing convoys of troops, munitions, armored cars and
trucks towing artillery headed toward the base Thursday.
	   Military transport airplanes were seen taking off, witnesses
said.
	   There was no official word on how many reinforcements were on
their way to
	   join about 3,000 Zimbabwean troops already in the Congo.
	   ``We are working in line with what the heads of government
decided yesterday,'' said Col. Chancellor Diye, spokesman for the
Zimbabwe National Army. He would not elaborate.
	   Namibia now has between 600 to 1,000 troops in Congo, according
to past media reports. Angola has about 1,000 troops. The number of
troops to be added in the new offensive was not known.
	   Rwandan Vice President Gen. Paul Kagame, meanwhile, met with
South African President Nelson Mandela on Thursday in Pretoria,
South Africa's capital.
	   Mandela has been trying to broker a peace accord for Congo. No
details about the discussions would be released to the media, said
Mandela's spokesman, Parks Mankahlana.

Greek officials seek origins of ancient text set for auction

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Christie's was preparing to take bids on
one of its rarest offerings: a one-of-a-kind copy of a
2,300-year-old text by the ancient Greek scientist and inventor
Archimedes.
	   Not so fast, Greek officials replied.
	   The Greek culture ministry is investigating how the medieval
manuscript came into the hands of its current owners following a
mysterious journey from Middle Eastern monasteries to a family in
France.
	   ``The origin of the manuscript is being examined,'' Milena
Apostolaki, advisor to the culture minister, told The Associated
Press on Thursday.
	   The scheduled Oct. 29 auction New York is expected to fetch
between dlrs 800,000 and dlrs 1.2 million for the 174-leaf text,
which includes writings on geometry and physics.
	   But if the ministry's investigation can prove the item was not
legally obtained, the auction could be called off.
	   ``If there is absolute proof, we will not put it up for sale,''
said Vredy Lytsman, spokeswoman for Christie's in New York.
	   Any challenge to the ownership would have to be further
investigated by the auction house, which has already conducted its
own research into the origin of the manuscript, known as the
Archimedes Palimpsest.
	   A palimpsest is a manuscript whose pages have been written on
twice. When writing materials were in short supply, the original
text would be washed away when no longer deemed useful.
	   ``Christie's are satisfied that the Archimedes Palimpsest has
been legitimately owned by a French family for the last three
quarters of a century,'' said Felix de Marez Oyens, the head of
Christie's Books and Manuscripts Department.
	   But its earlier history is steeped in mystery.
	   Archimedes' text was copied in Constantinople, modern-day
Istanbul, in the 10th century. Two centuries later, it was covered
by a Greek religious text but the original writings were still
legible.
	   In the Middle Ages, it was owned by a monastery in Palestine
whose manuscript collection was incorporated into the Greek
Patriarchate library in Jerusalem in the 19th century, de Marez
Oyens noted.
	   No one knows why it was transferred to another monastery in
Constantinople. All but four ancient texts _ including the
Archimedes volume _ were taken to Athens when the monastery's
library was dissolved after World War I.
	   The other three are now in libraries in France and the United
States. The Archimedes text was the only one to become privately
held.
	   The manuscript ``is the most significant and substantial Greek
palimpsest known, and one of the most important palimpsest
manuscripts of a classical text ever to come to light,'' a
Christie's statement said.
	   For some Greek officials, the manuscript represents a cherished
part of a cultural heritage that has been scattered across the
globe _ such as the Elgin marbles taken from the Parthenon in the
19th century and now on display at the British Museum in London.
	   ``(The manuscript's) acquirement by Greece has symbolic,
political and scientific value and I believe we must attempt it,''
said Culture Minister Evangelos Venizelos, who has appealed to
large Greek banking groups and charitable foundations to contribute
to help make a winning auction bid.
	   Archimedes, who explored physics, astronomy and engineering, is
credited with shouting ``Eureka!'' or ``I've found it?'' while
running naked through the streets after discovering the principle
of water displacement while sitting in his bath.
	   He also has been cited for inventions such as a planetarium that
demonstrated the movement of the stars, the compound pulley and
devices for raising water.
	   The manuscript contains ``the only known copy of the original
Greek text of his work `On Floating Bodies,''' Christie's said.
	   It also contains works such as ``On the Measurement of the
Circle'' and ``On the Sphere and the Cylinder'' and ``On Spiral
Lines.''
	   The fact that the text has not been accessible to study for
nearly a century adds to its significance.
	   Modern methods, such as high-resolution digital scanning and
ultraviolet light, could reveal previously unnoticed details and
text, Christie's noted.

Cancer-causing substances force closure of renowned university of
</HEADLINE>
music &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SALZBURG, Austria (AP) _ The Mozarteum school of music has been
temporarily closed after cancer-causing agents and other
life-threatening substances were found in the wallpaper, floors and
acoustic paneling at the internationally renown center.
	   More than a week after the closure on Oct. 15, it was still
unclear what exactly caused the contamination of the building.
Experts said the in-house ventilation system may have spread the
dangerous materials.
	   Interior Minister Caspar Einem ordered the entire building
closed, raising concern over the possible threat to teachers and
students after medical investigators found a hgh incidence of
leukemia among the Mozarteum staff.
	   Professors and students had to move out immediately and are
being gradually relocated in different university, government and
other public buildings around town in Salzburg, the birthplace of
Austria's best known composer, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.
	   Investigations into suspected health hazards began in July after
reports about a large number of leukemia cases among staff members.
	   Chemical and other experts discovered on the premises the
presence of PCBs, polychlorinated biphenils, a toxic substance
formerly used in insulating material.
	   The day the Mozarteum was closed, its rector, Klaus Ager, said
he was looking for 20,000 square meters of new floor space,
including sound-proof halls, for more than 1,500 students, 430
teachers and 80 other staff members.
	   Government officials in Salzburg said earlier this week blood
tests would be taken on 20 Mozarteum staff and students to
determine the extent of possible infestation with what experts said
are carcinogenic chemicals, including substances that can change a
person's genetic makeup.
	   The foundation of the famed music school dates back to the year
1841. Forty years later, the school was taken over by the
International Mozarteum Foundation. In 1914, the Mozarteum was made
a conservatory.
	   The school prospered in particular before and after World War II
under the directorship of Bernhard Paumgartner, a musicologist who
specialized in and conducted countless performances of music by
Mozart. Under Paumgartner, the Mozarteum became an Academy for
Music and Performing Arts, and in 1970 it was elevated to a
university of the arts.
	   Its most prominent graduate to date is the late Austrian
conductor Herbert von Karajan.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Western officials pressed both
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and the ethnic Albanians who
oppose him to do more Thursday to achieve lasting peace in the
embattled separatist province of Kosovo.
	   But the government repeated claims that it already has met a key
condition of the Oct. 12 agreement to defuse the Kosovo crisis. The
pro-government daily Vecernje Novosti quoted unnamed police sources
as saying all troops sent there during the crackdown had been
withdrawn and that only those who had been there beforehand
remained.
	   NATO and Western governments have challenged such claims.
	   France's foreign minister warned Thursday that Milosevic must
still pull out more troops. And U.S. envoy Christopher Hill and
European ambassadors pressed their political initiative in new
talks with ethnic Albanian political leader Ibrahim Rugova.

	   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Gunmen confronted a ``Dateline
NBC'' television crew in Haiti's capital and drove off with their
vehicle and equipment, the crew's interpreter said Thursday.
	   The robbery occurred about 1 p.m. Wednesday at a busy
intersection on Delmas Road in Port-au-Prince. Five or six men in a
pickup blocked a vehicle carrying ``Dateline NBC'' correspondent
Lea Thompson, two camera crew members and an interpreter.
	   The robbers forced them to get out at gunpoint, stole their
equipment and papers and escaped in their vehicle, said Kathie
Klarreich, the crew's interpreter and driver.
	   No one was hurt, and there were no immediate arrests.
	   The crew was continuing its assignment, said ``Dateline NBC''
executive producer Neal Shapiro.
	   A Haitian police officer witnessed the robbery, Klarreich said.
	   ``I feel enraged that something like this can happen in broad
daylight,'' she said. ``But I understand the policeman _ I wouldn't
have done anything either. What can one person do against a team of
well-armed criminals?''

Corretja survives second-set scare to oust Pavel
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) _ Looking for the form that took him to this
year's French Open final, Alex Corretja survived a tough second-set
scare Thursday to beat Romania's Andrei Pavel 6-4, 2-6, 6-3 at the
Lyon Grand Prix.
	   Spain's Corretja, seeded fourth here and ranked seventh in the
world, made a vital service break in the sixth game of the final
set, when Pavel put a powerful forehand return from his opponent
into the net.
	   In the next game, Pavel failed to covert on a break point, and
the Barcelona-born player held on in his remaining service games to
win the match, qualifying for the final eight.
	   In the first set, Corretja stormed back from 2-4 behind with a
series of blistering forehand returns.
	   But the 23-year-old Pavel, ranked 73rd in the world, was a
revelation in the second set, breaking the Spaniard's serve twice
to take the set 6-2.
	   ``It wasn't pretty tennis today,'' Corretja said. ``The match
was really tough for me, especially in the second set, when Pavel
hit four consecutive winners at one stage.
	   ``But it is the first time that I have won two successive
matches indoor on the tour, so I am very pleased.''
	   In the next round, Corretja will face surprise quarterfinalist
Olivier Delaitre.
	   The 31-year-old French qualifier, ranked a lowly 227th, lost the
first set to Gianluca Pozzi, but stormed back to take 10
consecutive games and win 1-6, 6-0, 6-4.
	   Germany's Tommy Haas squeezed past Fabrice Santoro, the
defending champion here and No. 8 seed, 2-6, 6-3, 7-5, in just
under two hours.

	   JESSE, Nigeria (AP) _ No one will be arrested in connection with
the gasoline pipeline that erupted into an inferno over the
weekend, a government official said Thursday, but Nigeria's state
petroleum corporation has reportedly demanded otherwise.
	   The explosion and fire tore through Jesse on Saturday, while up
to 1,000 people were trying to collect gasoline spilling from the
damaged government-owned pipeline. At least 700 people were killed,
state radio has said.
	   ``There is absolutely no truth in rumors that anybody will be
arrested in connection with this,'' Walter Fejhabo, the military
administrator of Delta State, told local leaders in Jesse.
	   A newspaper report, however, said Nigeria's state petroleum
corporation would ask for charges to be filed.
	   ``Anyone implicated in the vandalisation of the oil pipeline
leading to last Saturday's fire tragedy is to be arraigned,''
Dalhatu Bayero, chief executive of the Nigeria National Petroleum
Corporation, told the Vanguard newspaper.
	   The article indicated the company would demand that charges be
pressed against people implicated in opening the pipeline, not the
hundreds who later came to scoop up the gasoline.
	   It was not immediately clear whether the powerful petroleum
company could force the military administrator _ the equivalent of
a governor in Nigeria's military regime _ to reverse his decision.
	   Nigeria's ruling junta has not said if it has plans to file
charges, though it issued a statement Wednesday saying the incident
was sparked because of ``the greed of some of the people in the
community.''
	   State radio said Wednesday that the death toll had reached 700,
but local officials expected it to go higher. J.I. Ogude, the
village chief of Jesse, estimated that 1,000 people had been
killed.
	   Counting the dead and the injured remains a difficult task in
Jesse. Many people were burying family members secretly and
treating the injured at home, fearing arrest for either causing the
fire or scavenging gas.
	   But in Jesse, the situation appeared to be improving for the
injured _ whose numbers are believed to run well into the hundreds.
	   Eighteen patients had returned to the nearby Sapelele General
Hospital after a bell-ringing town crier had been sent into Jesse
on Wednesday promising people that they would not face arrest.
	   Officials said many more patients were believed to be heading to
other hospitals.
	   ``The town crier went out last night and the result has been
impressive,'' said Josiah Oyawiri, a senior chief of Jesse.
``People are coming back to hospital.''
	   Medical teams were setting up offices in Jesse to help deal with
the tragedy. Aid workers from a number of United Nations agencies,
the Red Cross and doctors from Israel were on their way or had
already arrived, local officials said.
	   For the people of Jesse, mostly poor cassava farmers and small
traders, the spilling gasoline offered an easy chance for a little
extra money, despite the obvious dangers of thousands of gallons of
fuel.
	   ``I heard people rushing to the scene where the fuel was leaking
and everbody was saying `God has brought wealth to Jesse,' and so I
joined,'' said Richard James, who was hospitalized with severe
burns. ``At the scene, I heard a deafening explosion ... and before
I could know what was happenning, I was already on fire.''
	   It remains unclear what caused the explosion. Government
officials have said they believe scavengers' tools set it off,
while some news reports have blamed a lit cigarette.
	   On Thursday, flames continued to occasionally flare from the
pipeline, while firefighters stood nearby waiting for the fuel to
burn itself out of the pipeline's Jesse section. The entire
pipeline runs about 600 kilometers (380 miles), from the
southeastern city of Warri to the northern city of Kano.
	   Despite being the world's sixth-largest oil producer, Nigeria
remains a fuel-starved country, its petroleum industry is hobbled
by corruption and mismanagement. Refineries are in desperate need
of repair, black-market gasoline is often marked up 1,000 percent
and lines at gas pumps can last for days.

Fighting subsides in Guinea-Bissau, aid groups overwhelmed

humanitarian situation &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Fighting between government forces and
rebels in Guinea-Bissau abated Thursday, allowing aid workers to
address the mounting humanitarian crisis in the small west African
nation.
	   The government announced a unilateral cease-fire late Wednesday.
The insurgents reacted cautiously, saying they wanted guarantees
before entering into peace talks. It was not immediately clear
whether they also had opened a truce.
	   Aid workers contacted by phone said the capital Bissau and
second-largest city Bafata, 140 kilometers (90 miles) to the east,
were quiet after sporadic firing at dawn.
	   The Red Cross and World Food Program said they were struggling
to care for tens of thousands of people fleeing the fighting in the
former Portuguese colony of some 1 million people.
	   ``We're completely overwhelmed by the situation,'' Wagdi Othman
of the WFP said from Abidjan, Ivory Coast, from where he is
coordinating the aid effort.
	   Some 1,000 people, including about 300 children, sought refuge
in the Notre Dame de Fatima missionary compound in Bissau where
there was no food or medicine, Othman said.
	   A further 5,000 gathered at an Italian mission in the city, he
said.
	   Michael Kleiner of the International Red Cross said thousands of
people were streaming out of the capital. About 20,000 people
arrived in Cumara, a small town 12 kilometers (seven miles) from
Bissau.
	   Many civilians were wounded in an artillery barrage by
government forces in Bissau on Wednesday, Kleiner said.
	   ``We have urged both sides to be very careful with targets, but
of course it's very difficult to escape civilian casualties in
fighting in cities,'' Kleiner said from the Red Cross headquarters
in Geneva.
	   The rebels Thursday were advancing on Gabu, about 200 kilometers
(125 miles) east of Bissau, according to aid workers who asked not
to be identified.
	   The insurgents _ mostly army veterans angered by poor pay and
conditions _ control most of the country after sweeping through the
countryside since fighting restarted on Sunday, ending a
three-month truce.
	   They have been fighting about 3,000 heavily-armed Senegalese
troops who crossed over the border to support President Joao
Bernardo Vieira when the military rebellion began June 7.
	   The foes had entered a cease-fire July 26 brokered by
negotiators from west African and Portuguese-speaking countries.
The mediators discussed the deployment of a peacekeeping force and
military observers, but no deal was reached.

Official: Ukraine meets requirements for next loan tranche
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine has met all requirements for the
next installment of an International Monetary Fund loan, but its
disbursement hinges on debt negotiations with a foreign bank, a top
official said Thursday.
	   The IMF director board has postponed its meeting on Ukraine from
Oct. 26 to Oct. 29 to look into the country's talks with Chase
Manhattan Luxembourg S.A. bank over restructuring the repayment of
its loan to Ukraine, President Leonid Kuchma's aide, Valery
Lytvytsky, said.
	   Ukraine was scheduled to pay off dlrs 109 million to Chase
Manhattan on Tuesday, but the cash-strapped government instead
offered the bank to pay only 20 percent of the sum immediately and
convert the rest into bonds with a 20 percent annual interest rate,
maturing in two years.
	   The scheme was similar to a debt conversion plan Ukraine offered
to foreign holders of its Treasury bills last month, when the
government's financial positions deteriorated following a financial
crisis in neighboring Russia.
	   The Finance Ministry has not yet made any announcements
concerning completion of its negotiations with Chase Manhattan.
	   ``There should be no other reasons for the IMF to delay
disbursement of its aid,'' Lytvytsky told a news conference.
	   The IMF disbursed the first, dlrs 257 million tranche of its
dlrs 2.2 billion loan to Ukraine in September, and the former
Soviet republic hopes to receive another dlrs 125 million from the
fund by the end of the year.
	   An IMF mission is due in Kiev this weekend to discuss with
government officials new measures in the framework of a joint
reform program that the fund agreed to support with its three-year
loan.
	   Lytvytsky said the government so far has successfully maintained
major economic indicators the fund looks at before disbursing aid.
	   He said the budget deficit the government pledged to keep this
year at 2.5 percent of gross domestic product was 349 million
hryvna (dlrs 102 million) less than the IMF's target as of
Wednesday.
	   The foreign currency reserves, currently at about dlrs 1
billion, are also dlrs 78 million more than the lower limit set by
the fund, Lytvytsky added.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Despite an economic crisis, disappointing harvest
and forecasts of a particularly frigid winter, Russia's finance
minister said Thursday the country does not yet need foreign food
or other humanitarian aid.
	   At the same time, Mikhail Zadornov expressed hope that more
cold, hard cash will be forthcoming from the International Monetary
Fund.
	   However, Zadornov's deputy said that was unlikely to happen
because the Russian government still has no long-term plan for
coping with the latest economic crisis that erupted in mid-August.
	   The Russian government has appealed for humanitarian aid from
the European Union and is holding talks with the United States for
subsidized grain. But Zadornov suggested such plans were premature.
	   ``Russia's financial situation is not such that it requires
direct humanitarian aid,'' Zadornov told reporters. ``I would
express gratitude for such proposals, but I think that food imports
will continue on the normal market basis.''
	   Zadornov said he hoped a visiting IMF team would recommend
disbursing more of a dlrs 22.6 billion loan package negotiated
before the crisis hit. It was frozen in September after the first
dlrs 4.8 billion installment was paid.
	   ``I think that our partners can't but recognize that the
government is taking strong efforts to radically cut spending,'' he
said in a reference to a fourth-quarter budget plan approved by the
Cabinet on Tuesday.
	   The IMF's chief representative in Moscow, Martin Gilman, told
Russian news agencies that the question of further loan
installments had not come up in the talks. He did not say what they
were talking about.
	   Zadornov's deputy, Oleg Vyugin, said that the lack of a more
comprehensive economic plan through the end of 1999 would hamper
the talks with the IMF.
	   ``It is very important to the IMF what kind of budget Russia
will have in 1999,'' Vyugin said, according to the Interfax news
agency. ``The Fund wants to understand whether it will be a leap
into the abyss or over the abyss.''
	   Zadornov said the government hoped to finish its draft 1999
budget by mid-November.
	   The Russian government has said it is counting on IMF money to
help pay its bills for the rest of the year.
	   It plans to spend 130 billion rubles (dlrs 7.6 billion) in the
final three months of the year, but expects revenues of only around
70 billion rubles (dlrs 4.1 billion).
	   It is planning to print more rubles to cover at least some of
the shortfall. Zadornov said it might also raise money by
increasing excise taxes by 25 percent or selling 5 percent of its
shares in the national gas monopoly, Gazprom.
	   ``We will certainly be forced to print new money to finance our
spending,'' Zadornov said. ``There is no sense in concealing it,
but we must keep it to a minimum.''
	   Former Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko noted that an increase in
the money supply will lead to high inflation, and said the
government should concentrate instead on cutting spending and
boosting tax collection.
	   ``If water is pouring from your faucet, you should close it, not
wipe the water from the floor,'' he said on Echo Moscow radio.
	   Zadornov insisted that no matter how hard-pressed the government
is, it will pay its foreign debts, although he indicated Russia may
try to renegotiate the payment schedule.
	   He said Russia has already paid dlrs 500 million interest on its
foreign debt this quarter and plans to spend another dlrs 2
billion.

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ North Korea sounded a protest Thursday over the
U.S. military in South Korea, but joined in day-long talks on the
nuts-and-bolts of drafting a permanent peace for the Korean
peninsula.
	   A U.S. official said after morning and afternoon sessions that
there is a possibility of a ``significant procedural'' agreement on
organizing the talks by the time the current round ends,
tentatively scheduled for Sunday.
	   The delegations from the two Koreas, China and the United States
have failed in two previous rounds _ last March and December _ to
overcome the hurdle.
	   Only then will they be able to begin talking about a peace
treaty to replace the armistice that has been in place since the
end of the 1950-53 Korean war.
	   Discussions Thursday were on the proposal of South Korea, which
is chairing the current round, to form two ``subcommittees'' to
deal with key issues, officials said.
	   North Korea has demanded that the four sides agree on an agenda
before they decide how to discuss it.
	   But U.S. officials said North Korean delegates participated
actively with the other sides in the talks Thursday even though
they stuck to their position.
	   Under the South Korean proposal, one panel would discuss
replacing the armistice while the other formulates
confidence-building measures.
	   Officials noted that the atmosphere was good enough for all
sides to attend an evening reception at the U.S. Mission to United
Nations offices in Geneva.
	   ``We've made quite a bit of progress in narrowing the
differences, but the North Korean position remains quite firm,''
said U.S. Ambassador-at-Large Charles Kartman.
	   Chinese Ambassador Qian Yong-nian said the four sides would
continue ``probing.''
	   To underscore its position, North Korea issued a statement on
its official Korean Central News Agency denouncing U.S. and South
Korean plans for joint military maneuvers to begin Monday.
	   The exercises have been held annually since 1961, but North
Korea said the timing the day after the current round is to end is
``seriously provoking.''
	   ``The war exercises are patent proof that the United States and
the South Korean authorities have no interest in discussing''
ensuring peace on the Korean peninsula, it said.
	   Park Kun-woo, leader of the South Korean delegation, said, ``We
had a constructive meeting, and I underline the word
`constructive.'' He gave no details.
	   His North Korean counterpart, Vice Foreign Minister Kim Gye
Gwan, declined to comment.
	   Chinese Ambassador Qian Yong-nian said the four sides would
continue ``probing.''
	   The border between the Koreas is the world's most heavily armed,
with nearly 2 million troops deployed on both sides.
	   A technical state of war has continued since the 1950-53 Korean
War ended in an armistice instead of a peace treaty. The United
States and China were the other main combatants in the war.

	   MOSCOW, Russia (AP) _ Venus Williams took only 50 minutes to
eliminate Russian Elena Likhovtseva 6-3, 6-1 Thursday, advancing to
the quarterfinals of the Kremlin Cup.
	   The American faltered slightly in the first set when she dropped
two games after going up 4-1. But she quickly regained control and
powered through the rest of the match.
	   Her only gift to Likhovtseva was in the sixth game of the second
set. Leading 5-0, Williams double-faulted and committed three
unforced errors to lose the game.
	   In other second-round matches at the dlrs 1 million tournament,
second seed Monica Seles of the United States downed Barbara Schett
of Germany, 6-3, 6-4.
	   In the first set, Seles broke Schett in the fourth game to go
ahead 3-1, but double-faulted and lost at love in the next game.
	   Seles regained her balance, however, sending a blistering
two-handed backhand down the line to clinch the set.
	   Seles said she still has her eyes on the No. 1 ranking on the
WTA Tour computer.
	   ``I have to improve a couple of things to be No. 1 and I'm
trying to do that, she said. ``The competition is very hard but
that is one of the reasons why I'm still playing.''
	   After two days of upsets, Thursday saw one more suprise defeat,
with ninth-ranked Patty Schnyder losing to Magui Serna of Spain,
6-7 (3-7), 4-6.
	   But the remaining seeds showed their dominance, with No. 5 Mary
Pierce of France beating Belgian Sabine Appelmans, 6-2, 6-2.
	   No. 7 Sandrine Testud defeated Natasha Zvereva of Russia 6-4,
6-3, and Italy's Sylvia Farina beat Henrieta Nagoya of Slovakia
6-3, 6-1. Katarina Studenikova of Slovakia defeated American Chanda
Rubin in straight sets, 6-3, 7-5.

 &UR; Chechnya's president orders rebel commanders to surrender &QL;

<TEXT>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ Chechnya's President Aslan Maskhadov
ordered rebel field commanders Thursday to disband their units,
threatening a crackdown if they disobeyed.
	   Since the end of Chechnya's 1994-96 war with Russia, many field
commanders have remained outside the control of the territory's
government, and are unlikely to comply with this latest order.
	   One of the best known renegades, Salman Raduyev, immediately
announced that he had no plans to obey, the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   In a decree signed Thursday, Maskhadov also demanded that the
``military bases of these formations be eliminated immediately.''
	   Maskhadov has ordered the police and security forces to enforce
the decree and prosecute field commanders who fail to comply, said
presidential spokesman Mairbek Vachagayev.
	   But Maskhadov may have trouble enforcing the order, because
Raduyev and other field commanders control too many men to be
easily subdued.
	   The rebel units were among those who fought the Russians. But
they have refused to lay down their arms now that the war is over.
These groups now discredit Chechnya's effort to be recognized as an
independent state, Maskhadov said in his decree.
	   Chechnya has been running its own affairs since the end of the
war against Russia, but no country has recognized its independence
claim. Moscow insists the territory remains part of Russia.
	   Maskhadov also met nine field commanders loyal to his government
on Thursday, Vachagayev said. The talks were to have dealt with
plans to free the many hostages who have been seized in Chechnya
since the end of the war, he said.
	   Police from the neighboring Russian republic of Dagestan have
freed an officer who was held captive in Chechnya since his
kidnapping on Sept. 12, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported
Thursday.
	   Also, two Latvian citizens have been freed by police from
Russia's Caucasus republics of North Ossetia and Ingushetia, the
report said.
	   Russia's Caucasus regions have been plagued by violence spilling
over from Chechnya as well as their own ethnic conflicts.

German court denies repayment of ransom paid to Stasi

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ A Dutch businessman who bought his freedom from an
East German jail in 1983 lost a bid Thursday to force the city of
Berlin to pay him back.
	   The man, now 77, was arrested by the East German secret police,
the Stasi, in 1983 on suspicion of spying. During his
interrogation, he told them he had access to 3 million marks (dlrs
1.9 million at today's rate) in a Swiss bank account belonging to a
likewise arrested employee at an East German export firm.
	   He was released after promising to return that money to the East
German government, but then was forced to pay an additional 1
million marks in cash of his own.
	   After German unification, Berlin courts cleared his record and
granted him the right to apply for restitution. But they denied his
claim for repayment of the 1 million mark ransom, saying it
couldn't be determined where the money had ended up.
	   The Federal Administrative Court upheld that ruling Thursday.

Suspected war criminal goes on trial in military court
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ A former Rwandan mayor accused of
murder and inciting his townspeople to murder during his country's
1994 genocide is to go on trial before a Swiss military court next
month, a senior army official said Thursday.
	   It will be the first time a Rwandan war crimes suspect goes
before a national court outside Rwanda. Such cases against Rwandan
exiles have until now been heard by international courts in Arusha,
Tanzania and The Hague in the Netherlands.
	   Fulgence Niyonteze, 34, was arrested by Swiss authorities in
August 1996. He had arrived in Switzerland in 1994, applied for
asylum and settled with his family in the western city of Fribourg.
	   Niyonteze is suspected of playing a role in ethnic killings
while head of the community of Mushubati in the Rwandan province of
Gitirama, 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of the capital Kigali.
	   If found guilty of the charges against him, Niyonteze could be
sentenced to a maximum of life in prison.
	   The trial is set to begin Nov. 30 and is expected to last up to
two weeks, army chief auditor Dieter Weber said.
	   More than 500,000 minority Tutsis and politically moderate Hutus
were massacred in the Hutu government-orchestrated genocide in
Rwanda in 1994. The genocide ended when Tutsi-led rebels won power
in July 1994.

	   MOSCOW, Russia (AP) _ Venus Williams proved her top-seed placing
in the second round of the Kremlin Cup Thursday, trouncing Elena
Likhovtseva 6-3, 6-1.
	   The American faltered slightly in the first set when she dropped

	   Her only gift to Likhovtseva was in the sixth game of the second
set. Up 5-0, Williams double faulted and committed three unforced
errors to lose the game. It would be her only lost game in the
second set.
	   Williams was pleased with the quick match, after playing well
past midnight Wednesday in a doubles match she won with her sister,
Serena.
	   ``It was nice to have an easy match like that because I had a
long match yesterday in the doubles,'' she said.
	   As for her number five ranking on the WTA tour and Lindsay
Davenport, who beat her last week in the finals of the European
Championships to retain her No. 1 spot: ``I have exactly what I
deserve right now. And she (Davenport) has exactly what she
deserves. What I deserve is No. 5.''
	   In other second round action of the dlrs 1 million tournament,
second seed Monica Seles of the United States downed Barbara Schett
of Germany, 6-3, 6-4.

	   After two days of upsets, Thursday saw one more suprise defeat,
with WTA ninth-ranked Patty Schnyder losing to Magui Serna, ranked
29th, 6-7 (3-7), 4-6.
	   But the remaining seeded players showed their dominance, with
third-seed Conchita Martinez dumping Natalya Petrova 6-0, 6-0.
Petrova, ranked 175 on the WTA tour, shocked Iva Majoli Tuesday
after earning a wild-card spot.
	   Fifth-seed Mary Pierce of France made short work of Belgian
Sabine Appelmans, 6-2, 6-2, and Sandrine Testud, seeded seventh,
defeated Natasha Zvereva 6-4, 6-3.
	   Sylvia Farina beat Henrieta Nagoya 6-3, 6-1, and Katarina
Studenikova defeated Chanda Rubin in straight sets, 6-3, 7-5.
	   In more first round doubles matches, Manon Bollegraf and Elena
Tatarkova beat Sabine Appelmans and Anke Huber, 6-3, 6-0.

Swaziland police arrest two, confiscate 3.25 tons of marijuana

	   MBABANE, Swaziland (AP)- Police arrested two men and confiscated
3.25 tons of marijuana, the second major drug haul in two months.
	   Packaging equipment used to compress the drug into cans was also
seized during Wednesday's raid.
	   The drugs had a street value of more than dlrs 2 million, police
said.
	   A syndicate that sold the illicit drug to foreign markets was
believed to be connected to Wednesday's arrests as well as the
seizure of dlrs 3.5 million worth of marijuana in August.
	   In 1997, police seized a total of 2.5 tons of marijuana and
destroyed ``thousands and thousands'' of acres of the plants, a
police spokesman said.
	   The growth of marijuana has long been a problem in Swaziland, a
landlocked kingdom sandwiched between South Africa and Mozambique.
A former member of Swaziland's Parliament has suggested the drug be
legalized so the kingdom can boost tax revenues, but police said
they would fight the proposal.
	   Marijuana factories that package the drug are a relatively new
phenomenon in the country, police said.
	   A woman charged with possessing almost dlrs 500,000 in marijuana
at her workplace was acquitted on Wednesday by a Mbabane
magistrate.

	   SAN SEBASTIAN, Spain (AP) _ It's hard to fathom bullets and
bombs in a place as pretty as San Sebastian, an affluent seaside
town with tree-lined avenues wrapped around a beach and harbor.
	   For that matter, violence is hard to imagine in any of Spain's
northern Basque country, its rolling green hills and picturesque
villages too perfect to be stalked by fear.
	   But this is the homeland of the extremist ETA armed commandos,
who have killed nearly 800 people in a 30-year campaign for a
separate homeland carved out of parts of Spain and France.
	   Fear exists, but tempered by cautious optimism as Basques
prepare to vote in elections Sunday for a regional president and
all 75 seats in the Basque Parliament.
	   The atmosphere changed five weeks ago, when the ETA declared an
open-ended cease-fire.
	   Every since, the group's political wing, Herri Batasuna, and the
Spanish government have been positioning themselves for the
elections and possible peace talks.
	   Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar has said the peace process
cannot begin in earnest until ETA lays down its weapons forever.
	   The latest voter-intention polls, released last week, suggested
that that the mainstream Basque Nationalist Party will win the most
seats but fall short of a majority, just like in the last
legislature. This will mean looking for parliamentary allies.
	   At issue is whether the ETA cease-fire will translate into
greater support for other Basque nationalist parties, like Herri
Batasuna, better known as HB, or for non-nationalist ones like the
Basque branches of Aznar's conservative Popular Party and Spain's
main opposition Socialist Party.
	   The Spanish government hopes that a strong showing by
non-nationalists will give it more leverage in future talks, either
with moderate Basque nationalists seeking more autonomy, or radical
ones seeking full independence.
	   Basque voters say they relish the idea of elections without the
threat of violence.
	   ``This is a great opportunity,'' said a 36-year-old woman
walking along San Sebastian's elegant seafront promenade. ``But
people wonder if the cease-fire is for real.''
	   Like just about everybody else out on the promenade enjoying the
warm autumn sun, she refused to give her name. That's the other
element of Basque politics these days, a lingering wariness of
saying the wrong thing to the wrong person.
	   ``After so many years of this, nobody talks about politics,''
said a 28-year-old Basque man who works for a construction company.
``It is fear.''
	   HB spokesman Josu Telleria Uriarte said for the peace process to
advance, the government must transfer more separatist prisoners
from jails scattered around the country to ones in the Basque
region.
	   Telleria said Herri Batasuna and the ETA share the goal of an
independent homeland for the Basque people.
	   ``The Madrid (national) government lets us run a few things. We
don't want that. We want to make our own decisions,'' Telleria
said, adding, ``Once we are a state (nation) we can have wonderful
relations with Spain.''

NATO pressing for ``coordination cell'' in Macedonia to support
</HEADLINE>
Kosovo mission &QL; 
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - NATO will wait until after Macedonia's
election to finalize plans for a ``coordination cell'' there in
support of the mission to verify compliance with the deal to end
the Kosovo crisis, Secretary-General Javier Solana said Thursday.
	   The Alliance wants to station a unit in Macedonia, which borders
Kosovo, to coordinate operations and provide back-up for the 2,000
unarmed ``verifiers'' who will make sure Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic and the ethnic Albanians honor the Oct. 12
agreement to defuse the crisis without NATO airstrikes.
	   But an opposition coalition opposed to a NATO role in Macedonia
finished ahead of the government in the first round of national
elections last weekend. The final balloting is set for Nov. 1.
	   Following a meeting with Macedonia's prime minister, Branko
Crvenkovski, Solana said NATO had received ``a positive answer for
the use of (air) space'' by NATO surveillance planes.
	   Earlier this week, Macedonia agreed to let NATO station spy
planes on its territory. But Solana said talks on allowing the
``coordination cell'' to be based in Macedonia would have to wait
until the elections were over.
	   ``I would prefer to wait and not interfere at this moment,'' he
said.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe will
supervise the ground verification mission. Envoys of several OSCE
member states, including Canada, have expressed concern over the
safety of unarmed personnel in Kosovo.
	   U.S. officials have said NATO will provide a rescue force in the
area, leading to speculation that the troops could be based in
Macedonia.
	   Late Wednesday, NATO ambassadors formally approved details of
the airborne surveillance operation, codenamed Eagle Eye, in which
unarmed NATO planes will fly over Kosovo to back up the ground
observers.
	   American U2 spy planes began test flights last Saturday, but
other Allies will start taking part in the next few days, said a
NATO official on condition of anonymity. He said Russia had
informally offered one plane for the operation.

Panionios beats Apollon 3-2
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Garry Haylock and Mark Robins, both
Britons, scored one goal each on Thursday as Panionios Athens beat
Apollon Limassol 3-2 in a second-round, first-leg game for the
Cupwinners Cup.
	   In the closing minutes, Panionios made desperate efforts to
increase the scoring and make the return match easier, but the
visitors' defense resisted well.
	   While fielding a defensive-minded team, Apollon had its own
scoring chance in the opening of the game.
	   Goalie Foto Strakosha made a decisive save on a shot from Florin
Christea in the 9th minute.
	   Four minutes later, Milenco Spoliaric gave Apollon a 1-0 lead
with a header.
	   Charalambos Pittas came close to a second goal, but Strakosha
made another key save in the 22nd.
	   Antonis Sapountzis levelled with a free-kick in the 24th, and
Haylock made it 2-1 with a header in the 39th.
	   One minute before the end of the first period, Spoliaric marked
the equalizer with a blistering shot from 30 meters (yards) out. It
was Spoliaric's 10th goal with Apollon in European games.
	   The winner came in the 57th by Robins off a center from Kent
Bergessen.
	   Apollon played with 10 players the last 27 minutes when Filippos
Filippou saw the red card for harsh play in the 63rd.

Ukrainian nuclear plants reporting fewer malfunctions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ The number of malfunctions at Ukraine's
nuclear power plants has been declining since July and was much
smaller than in the first and second quarter of 1998, the top
nuclear safety official said Thursday.
	   The reduction allowed the country's nuclear power facilities to
report about the same number of disruptions of work in the first
nine months of 1998 as in the corresponding period last year, said
Oleksandr Smyshliayev, head of the nuclear regulation
administration at the Environment Safety Ministry.
	   He did not say how many malfunctions were registered over the
period he mentioned.
	   The number of malfunctions is expected to drop even more by the
end of 1998, Smyshliayev said, according to the Interfax news
agency.
	   The former Soviet republic's nuclear power plants reported 37
malfunctions in the first half of 1998, which was 1.5 times more
than during the same period in 1997.
	   Officials blamed the increase at the time on outdated equipment
and disregard for safety rules.
	   Ukrainian government has recently started to look for a new type
of nuclear reactor, which would replace existing reactors after
their term of operation expires.

European bank boss says euro won't compete with dollar
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ European Central Bank President Wim Duisenberg
said Thursday that Europe's new single currency, the euro, won't
compete with the U.S. dollar as the currency of choice for foreign
reserves.
	   The Frankfurt-based European Central Bank does not plans to
encourage the use of the euro as a reserve currency, Duisenberg
said, speaking at a conference in Berlin.
	   The euro will be adopted by 11 of the European Union's 15
countries on New Year's Day, but won't go into circulation on the
streets until 2002. It is the key element of Europe's imminent
economic and monetary merger.
	   Speculation has surrounded the euro's launch, with some
economists predicting countries may switch the foreign reserves
from the U.S. dollar to the euro, which represents some of the
strongest economies of the world.
	   Duisenberg emphasized that the priority of the new economic zone
is price stability, adding that the bank does not plan to encourage
the euro's use as an investment or transaction currency, or to use
it as an instrument of foreign policy.
	   However, the bank would monitor carefully fluctuations of
international exchange rates, especially that of the dollar, since
``possible major dollar movements could have negative effects on
the euro zone's domestic economic situation,'' Duisenberg said.
	   The dollar has been weakening against European currencies in
recent months. Currency fluctuations could affect the movement of
money to or away from investment portfolios in Europe, and that was
something to be watched, Duisenberg said.
	   Countries taking part in the monetary merger are Germany,
France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, Luxembourg,
Ireland, Spain, Portugal and Finland _ creating an economic zone of
some 300 million people.

<TEXT>
	   JERICHO, West Bank (AP) _ A Hamas activist who hurled grenades
at a crowded Israeli bus station said he acted to atone for
accepting money from Israel's Shin Bet security service, a
Palestinian official said Thursday.
	   The activist, 29-year-old Salem Sarsour, made a videotape before
the attack in which he said he was approached several times by a
man he identified as Capt. Tamir from the Israeli intelligence who
gave him money and a cellular phone. The tape was delivered to
authorities by a friend of 29-year-old Salem Sarsour, to Jibril
Rajoub, chief of Palestinian security.
	   Rajoub said Sarsour regretted taking the money and felt he
``disgraced his family and the group he identified with,'' and
decided to atone for it by carrying out Monday's grenade attack in
which 64 Israelis were wounded.
	   Israeli media, citing sources in the secretive agency, reported
that Shin Bet agents had tried to recruit Sarsour two weeks before
the grenade attack, assuming him to be a low-level Hamas activist.
	   Rajoub said Sarsour had not thought he would live through the
attack. He was apprehended shortly after throwing a second grenade
into a crowded bus station in a southern Israeli city and has
confessed to Israeli police.
	   In the tape, Sarsour admitted to stabbing to death an elderly
rabbi in the West Bank city if Hebron and throwing two grenades at
an Israeli army post there on Yom Kippur, Judaism's holiest day.
	   The militant Islamic group Hamas opposes Israeli-Palestinian
peace efforts and has carried out dozens of deadly attacks against
Israelis.

Industry criticism of incoming government's tax plans snowballs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Germany's new finance minister
defended his cautious tax reform plans against growing criticism,
saying in an interview published Thursday that even he had wanted
bolder cuts.
	   Oskar Lafontaine blamed a 1,500 billion mark (dlrs 937 billion)
debt inherited from the outgoing center-right government.
	   ``Naturally we had hoped to put more on the table,'' but the
deficit had left ``little room for maneuver,'' he told the
Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper.
	   ``With every fourth mark going in interest payments, we had no
other choice.''
	   Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder, who takes office Tuesday,
faces the huge task of fulfilling his campaign promise to bring
down joblessness, currently stuck above 10 percent.
	   Industry has clamored for tax cuts, but the new coalition of
Social Democrats and the small Greens party has given priority to
leaving more money in the pockets of average wage earners.
	   At the same time, industry says it will be hurt by Schroeder's
plans for financing tax relief _ raising energy taxes and curbing
writeoff possibilities for businesses.
	   The National Association of Public Banks added its voice to
calls for sharper cuts Thursday, saying it would help fight
unemployment.
	   Little remained of the government's promised tax cuts, said the
Association of Retail Traders. It called on the new coalition to
save money to finance tax cuts for businesses and citizens.
	   The Rhineland-Westphalia Institute for Economic Research also
criticized tax reform plans, claiming that higher energy taxes
could cost up to 1 million jobs over the next 12 years under
certain conditions and hurt German competitiveness.
	   Lafontaine said that creating jobs depends not only on the
incoming government.
	   ``If it's not possible to bring order to the (world) financial
markets, then we have hardly any chance of fighting joblessness,''
the Social Democrat said.
	   Six major economic research institutes this week called for tax
cuts, but the government is hamstrung by its commitment to keep its
budget deficit to under the 3 percent, as demanded by the
Maastricht Treaty that governs the European single currency being
launched Jan. 1, Lafontaine said.
	   Adding to the government's predicament, five unions on Thursday
published a paper calling on the government to keep a campaign
promise to fight joblessness, and reiterated they want hefty wage
increases next year, which is raising industry's defenses.
	   The unions' paper accused industry of ``massively slashing
jobs'' in search of higher profits in recent years.
	   Employers federations have said they doubt a planned ``jobs
alliance,'' a roundtable of business and unions that the incoming
government hopes will brainstorm on jobs creation, will work if
unions don't modify wage increase demands.
	   Several key unions have said they want increases next year of
6.5 percent.

	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Palestinian police arrested 12
members of the militant group Islamic Jihad Thursday, the group
said, a day after its leaders were summoned to Palestinian security
headquarters.
	   The arrests were made in the Gaza Strip while the 12 men were
making preparations for a memorial rally for a former leader
assassinated in 1995.
	   In the West Bank, Islamic Jihad leaders were warned not to carry
out attacks in Israel.
	   The warning was delivered Wednesday when 20 leading members of
Islamic Jihad reported to the Palestinians' Preventive Security
Service office in the West Bank town of Bethlehem, said the
official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The official said there was concern that Islamic Jihad might try
to engage in violence to mark the recent anniversary of the
assassination of their leader, Fathi Shikaki.
	   Shikaki was gunned down Oct. 16, 1995 outside a hotel in Malta,
and the assassination was widely attributed to Israel.
	   Islamic Jihad is planning to hold a number of rallies in
Shikaki's memory.
	   In Gaza, a leader for the group, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, confirmed Thursday's arrests.
	   The group is the smaller of two militant Palestinian groups in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip and has carried out a number of
shootings and bombings in Israel in hopes of wrecking Mideast
peacemaking.
	   Israel has demanded that the Palestinian Authority do more to
fight terrorism, and a new security agreement is being negotiated
at the Mideast summit at Wye Plantation in Maryland.
	   The Palestinian security official said the summoning of the
Islamic Jihad leaders was routine procedure and not an attempt to
step up anti-terrorism efforts during the summit.

Georgia takes over presidency of Black Sea Economic Cooperation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Georgia's foreign minister said Thursday
his government was in full control of the country after an abortive
mutiny of the military on Monday.
	   ``We managed to cope with the problem the same day,'' the
minister, Irakli Menagarishvili said.
	   He added that the situation now is ``under full control'' and
promised that information about how the mutiny was plotted will be
made public soon.
	   Earlier this week, soldiers opposed to President Eduard
Shevardnadze, took over their garrison in the western part of the
country and advanced toward the capital. At least five people were
killed in clashes.
	   ``This event is for sure part of quite a large-scale provocative
action plan aimed to destabilize the Trans-Caucasian region. There
are quite large public forces who are against the positive
development in our region,'' the minister said.
	   Menagarishvili assumed presidency of the Black Sea Economic
Cooperation from Bulgarian Foreign Minister Nadezhda Mihailova on
Thursday.
	   At their meeting, senior diplomats of the member countries
signed an agreement with Greece on the functioning of a Black Sea
Bank of Trade and Development.
	   ``The bank is expected to start operating later this year after
attracting deposits from member countries and international
lenders,'' Menagarishvili said.
	   Eleven nations formed the Black Sea Economic Cooperation in 1992
to increase economic ties and eventually form a full-fledged
trading bloc. But disputes among member countries and lack of money
have blocked serious progress toward such goals.
	   BSEC members are Greece, Turkey, Bulgaria, Romania, Albania,
Russia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Moldova and Georgia.

Williams powers through first match of Kremlin Cup

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW, Russia (AP) _ Venus Williams proved her top-seed placing
in the second round of the Kremlin Cup Thursday, trouncing Elena
Likhovtseva 6-3, 6-1.
	   The American faltered slightly in the first set when she dropped
two games after going up 4-1. But she quickly regained control and
powered through the rest of the match, taking only 50 minutes to
win.
	   Her only gift to Likhovtseva was in the sixth game of the second
set. Up 5-0, Williams double faulted and committed three unforced
errors to lose the game. It would be her only lost game in the
second set.
	   Williams was pleased with the quick match, after playing well
past midnight Wednesday in a doubles match she won with her sister,
Serena.
	   ``It was nice to have an easy match like that because I had a
long match yesterday in the doubles,'' she said.
	   As for her number five ranking on the WTA tour and Lindsay
Davenport, who beat her last week in the finals of the European
Championships to retain her No. 1 spot: ``I have exactly what I
deserve right now. And she (Davenport) has exactly what she
deserves. What I deserve is No. 5.''
	   In other second round action of the dlrs 1 million tournament,
second seed Monica Seles of the United States downed Barbara Schett
of Germany, 6-3, 6-4.
	   In the first set, Seles broke Schett in the fourth game to go
ahead 3-1, but double-faulted and lost at love in the next game.
	   Seles regained her balance, however, sending a blistering
double-handed backhand down the line to clinch the sixth set.
	   Seles said she still has her eyes on the top ranking. ``I have
to improve a couple of things to be No. 1 and I'm trying to do
that, she said. ``The competition is very hard but that is one of
the reasons why I'm still playing.''
	   After two days of upsets, Thursday saw one more suprise defeat,
with WTA ninth-ranked Patty Schnyder losing to Magui Serna, ranked
29th, 6-7 (3-7), 4-6.
	   But the remaining seeded players showed their dominance, with
third-seed Conchita Martinez dumping Natalya Petrova 6-0, 6-0.
Petrova, ranked 175 on the WTA tour, shocked Iva Majoli Tuesday
after earning a wild-card spot.
	   Fifth-seed Mary Pierce of France made short work of Belgian
Sabine Appelmans, 6-2, 6-2, and Sandrine Testud, seeded seventh,
defeated Natasha Zvereva 6-4, 6-3.
	   Sylvia Farina beat Henrieta Nagyova 6-3, 6-1, and Katarina
Studenikova defeated Chanda Rubin in straight sets, 6-3, 7-5.
	   In more first round doubles matches, Manon Bollegraf and Elena
Tatarkova beat Sabine Appelmans and Anke Huber, 6-3, 6-0.
	   Cara Black and Irina Selyutina defeated Katrina Adams and Larisa
Neiland, 6-3, 6-3.

Judges plan strike in charged pre-election atmosphere
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RACHID KHIARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Algerian judges announced on Thursday
they plan a three-day strike next week to protest a newspaper
article calling them ``incapable.''
	   The planned strike, starting Monday, is the latest symptom of
the increasingly charged atmosphere dominating this North African
nation, with various groups jockeying for influence ahead of early
presidential elections next year.
	   In September, President Liamine Zeroual announced plans to cut
short his term and hold elections before the end of February.
	   Backbiting, smear campaigns and behind-the-scenes maneuvering
have taken precedence over substantive issues, including Algeria's
war against Islamic insurgents who have been trying to topple the
military-backed government since 1992.
	   The decision of the National Union of Algerian Magistrates to
strike was triggered by an Oct. 7 article in the privately-owned
daily El Watan, saying ``Eighty percent of (Algeria's judges) ...
are incapable of interpreting the law.''
	   The judges said they plan to file suit against El Watan and any
publication that repeats the remark.
	   The criticism of the judges follows press campaigns against top
presidential aide Mohamed Betchine and Justice Minister Mohamed
Adami, both of whom resigned this week.
	   Betchine, Zeroual's right-hand man, resigned Monday after a
five-month newspaper campaign attacking him for alleged abuse of
power. El Watan and another daily, Le Matin, recently published an
article by a group of magistrates alleging that the justice
minister had dissolute morals.
	   El Watan is among seven privately-owned newspapers on strike
since last Saturday to protest a demand by state-owned printers for
four papers, including El Watan, to immediately pay overdue bills.
	   The papers contend the order is a political decision that has
nothing to do with unpaid debts for 1996 and 1997. The government
has a monopoly on printing presses.
	   Strikes are becoming increasingly frequent as the atmosphere
heats up.
	   University teachers called a strike, only partially followed,
last Saturday. Airport employees ended a two-week strike on Monday.

Britain's surgeons introduce new standard checks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Royal College of Surgeons said Thursday it
will introduce new safeguards on the performance of its members
working in Britain after 29 children died following heart surgery
at Bristol Royal Infirmary.
	   The children's deaths, which took place in the late 1980s and
early 1990s, led to an eight-month inquiry in which three surgeons
were found guilty of serious professional misconduct.
	   The inquiry found that two of the surgeons performed operations
without sufficient regard to the children's safety, and that a
third failed to stop them from operating despite concerns about the
number of fatalities among their patients.
	   Barry Jackson, the Royal College's president, said his
profession recognized that ``there is a problem that needs to be
addressed.''
	   The college, which represents surgeons throughout Britain and
Ireland, said new measures would include performance assessments
for senior doctors every five years, similar to those undergone
annually by trainee surgeons.
	   ``What we are envisaging is there should be regular
revalidation,'' Jackson said.
	   Performances also will be scrutinized using a national database,
listing the types, numbers and outcomes of operations, the college
said.
	   The college also said it wanted to put in place a ``rapid
response'' team for quick investigation of complaints against
surgeons.
	   The General Medical Council, Britain's medical regulatory body,
had urged the surgeons to reform their working practices after the
heart surgery crisis.

<TEXT>
	   KARLSRUHE, Germany (AP) _ A convicted leftist terrorist serving
a life terms for murdering two Dutch customs officers and a German
industrialist has won a limited release from prison for health
reasons, a federal prosecutor's spokeswoman said Thursday.
	   Adelheid Schulz, 43, who has been imprisoned since her arrest in
1982, was freed Monday has been freed for a course of medical
rehabilitation, spokeswoman Eva Schuebel said. She did not say what
Schulz was suffering from.
	   Schulz was convicted in 1985 of taking part in the 1977
kidnaping and murder of industrialist Hanns-Martin Schleyer, a
crime that earned the gang worldwide notice.
	   She was also convicted in 1994 of killing two Dutch customs
police and wounding two others when she tried to escape arrest in a
Nov. 1978 border-crossing shootout.
	   Schulz was also accused of trying to kill Gen. Frederick
Kroesen, then commander of the U.S. Army Europe, in a bazooka
attack on his car in Heidelberg in Sept. 1981. However,
prosecutor's dropped the charges to speed up her 1994 trial.
	   Kroesen and his wife were slightly injured when the shell
exploded in the trunk of their armored-plated Mercedes.
	   The Red Army Faction terrorist gang grew out of the late 1960s
student uprising. The extreme leftist group carried out a string of
attacks against German politicians, businesses, and NATO targets
for more than 20 years before disavowing violence. The faction
announced earlier this year it was disbanding.
	   About 25 members of the gang remain jailed,

Ice skater Szewczenko injured, without sponsor and `broke'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) _ German ice skater Tanja Szewczenko,
bronze medalist at the European Championships, said Thursday she is
in financial trouble after a dispute with her former manager and
public relations firm.
	   Szewczenko, three-time German champion, is also injured entering
the new season and without a sponsor. But her biggest problem is
apparently financial.
	   ``I'm broke,'' she told SID, the German sports agency.
	   Szewczenko claims the problem is dlrs 125,000 her ex-manager,
Wolfgang-Peter Flohr, agreed to pay to Master Media after she
wanted to end their contract early in January.
	   Media Master balked at Szewczenko's plans to dissolve the
agreement, but both the Hamburg public relations firm and Flohr
said the terms of payment were decided in a court process.
	   ``We acted under Szewczenko's orders and with her signed power
of attorney in a court settlement to end her connection to Media
Master,'' said Flohr's attorney, Arno Schaefer.
	   Szewczenko also apparently doesn't have a sponsor after a
contract with Opel ended on Dec. 31, 1997.
	   The 21-year-old will miss the start of the skating season for
the fourth straight year, this time with a foot infection caused by
defective skates.
	   She will be sidelined for the Grand Prix opener ``Skate
America'' from Oct. 29-31 in Detriot, but is expected to take the
ice at Gelsenkirchen, Germany in mid-November.

Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands from
the National Weather Service.
	   A tropical wave has moved northwest into the Mona Passage this
morning, with moderate south to southeast winds now in the low
levels and spreading ample moisture across our area.
	   This southern flow is expected to continue throughout the day
and will bring scattered showers and thunderstorms from the
Caribbean waters north and northwest across the Virgin Islands and
much of Puerto Rico.
	   The local atmosphere remains very unstable, and very heavy
rainfall is possible anywhere across the area this afternoon and
this evening. The motion of showers and thunderstorms today would
favor the heaviest rainfall across south and interior sections of
Puerto Rico, shifting to the northern slopes and northwest late
this afternoon.
	   Soil remains saturated, and flash flooding potential is high.
	   Strong southerly winds associated with the tropical wave across
our southeast and eastern coastal waters overnight, with these
winds funneling between the mountains of east and southeast Puerto
Rico and the Anegada Passage. Due to the blocking effect of the
island of Puerto Rico, strong winds are expected to remain largely
confined to open water through this evening.
	   San Juan and the northern sections of Puerto Rico:
	   Today... Mostly cloudy. Showers likely. Chance for
thunderstorms. High around 85. Wind southeast 15 mph. Chance of

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Efforts to organize a team to verify
compliance with the Kosovo peace deal appeared stalled Thursday
because would-be contributor nations want the U.N. Security Council
to endorse the plan before they commit personnel.
	   But the council's efforts hit a snag Wednesday night when Russia
and China opposed including language threatening Serbs and ethnic
Albanians with force if they disregard the agreement. As permanent
members, China and Russia could veto the resolution.
	   Under the Oct. 12 deal with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke,
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic agreed to allow up to 2,000
unarmed ``verifiers'' to ensure that the terms of the deal are
carried out.
	   The operation is to be directed by the Vienna-based Organization
for Security and Cooperation, which must ask its 54 member states
to provide personnel for the mission.
	   On Thursday, the OSCE permanent council met in Vienna to work
out details for the operation. But representatives said no final
decisions were taken because many members first wanted the Security
Council to approve the mission.
	   The American head of the operation, William G. Walker, said
there was concern among the would-be contributors about the safety
of personnel, especially from countries whose nationals were taken
hostage by Bosnian Serbs during the 1992-95 Bosnian war.
	   Under the agreement, the Yugoslav government guarantees the
safety of the verifiers. Walker saaid he would leave for Kosovo on
Friday and spend about a week or 10 days helping set up the
operation.
	   ``Obviously, the physical security of 2,000 people in a zone of
turmoil, of conflict, is of utmost importance,'' Walker said. ``I
feel very strongly that I will be sort of personally responsible
for the well-being of these 2,000 people, for their lives.''
	   Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy said his government was
ready to provide 50-100 personnel but did not want to rely
exclusively on Milosevic for their safety. Axworthy suggested that
armed bodyguards accompany verifiers.
	   ``We raised clearly the importance of providing robust
protection for anyone who is going to Kosovo,'' Axworthy told
reporters. ``We think it is very important that the U.N. Security
Council has a resolution that clearly authorizes measures to
protect anybody who is in Kosovo.''
	   He said Canada was holding out hope that the council would
authorize ``all necessary measures'' to protect the mission,
wording which diplomatic sources at the United Nations say is
unlikely to win approval.
	   On suggestion has been to deploy a NATO rescue team in
neighboring Macedonia to withdraw OSCE personnel quickly in case of
trouble. NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana met Thursday in
Brussels, Belgium, with Macedonia's prime minister, Branko
Crvenkovski.
	   Solana said Macedonia had agreed to let NATO spy planes use its
air space but that further discussions would wait until after the
second round of Macedonian elections Nov. 1.
	   An opposition coalition opposed to a NATO role in Macedonia
finished ahead of the government in the first round of balloting
last weekend.

Rio racketeering boss killed; police fear gangland war
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Paulo de Andrade, the son and heir
of Rio de Janeiro's late racketeering boss, was shot to death in
what police say could be the start of a gangland war.
	   Andrade was in his car at a stoplight in Rio's upscale Barra da
Tijuca district Wednesday night when a gunman walked up and opened
fire, police said.
	   The man shot Andrade 10 times, then stole a truck and fled,
police said. Also killed was Andrade's bodyguard, Haroldo Bernardo.
Police fear a gangland war because the killing comes after a rival
of Andrade escaped from prison on Saturday.
	   Andrade, 47, was the successor of legendary numbers racketeer
Castor de Andrade, known as ``the godfather.'' The elder Andrade
died of a heart attack in 1997.
	   In 1993, father and son were among the top racketeers sentenced
to six years in prison for criminal association during a crackdown
on the animal game. The younger Andrade was released after two
years.
	   The younger Andrade also became a boss of the ``animal game,'' a
dlrs 2 billion-a-year numbers racket with daily drawings. When the
game was invented a century ago, the numbers were represented by
animals.
	   The Andrades controlled a large part Rio's poor west side, where
they sponsored carnival groups and soccer clubs and were widely
regarded as benevolent rogues. The Robin Hood image stuck despite
bloody gang wars and allegations of links with drugs, casinos and
murder-for-hire.

	   Here are excerpts from editorials in publications in various
countries:
	    &UR; ___
	   De Volkskrant, Amsterdam, Netherlands, on Pinochet arrest:
	   The arrest of the former Chilean dictator, General Augusto
Pinochet, shows great daring and appeals to one's imagination. For
many people, hearing the news have must summoned up contrasting
emotions of disbelief and joy.
	   There are enough reasons to summon Pinochet before the judge.
The fact that he has blood on his hands is beyond all doubt. On
Dec. 11, 1973, the army general used brute force to end Chile's
long democratic tradition. A period of fierce terror followed his
coup against the elected President Salvador Allende Gossens. More
than 100,000 opponents were jailed and tortured. More than 3,000
Chileans were murdered; around 1,200 people have disappeared
without a trace. Despite this, the expectation _ until this weekend
_ was that the now 82-year-old Pinochet would die a free man. ...
	   But the main question is whether British police and Spanish
judges should take over the tasks of the Chilean state. Pinochet's
crimes were predominantly committed against Chileans. It is,
therefore, up to the Chilean state and people, and not third
parties, to decide whether or not to prosecute the former dictator.

	   Daily Telegraph, London, on Pinochet arrest:
	   On Sunday, Trade Secretary Peter Mandelson brushed aside
objections that Pinochet enjoyed diplomatic immunity on the ground
that he was ``such a brutal dictator''. This comes dangerously
close to claiming that due process does not matter provided there
is sufficient outrage.
	   The notion that Britain is simply discharging its international
obligations is, in any case, highly questionable. It is true that
Pinochet's detention was requested by a judge, but Spanish judges
occupy a role similar to that of British prosecuting counsels. The
judge in this case has made his name through political
investigations and is acting on a case brought by, among others,
the Spanish Communist Party. No extradition request has yet been
made by the proper Spanish authorities.
	   Looked at from any angle, the general's arrest appears
political. ...

	   The Statesman, New Delhi, India, on Kashmir dispute:
	   There's arguably a Nobel Peace Prize waiting to be bestowed on
the subcontinent, if only someone would pluck up the courage to act
decisively instead of engaging in inane diplomatic chatter over
Kashmir. The valley is now bloody enough to qualify for the Nobel
Peace Prize. The recent addition of nuclear weapons in New Delhi's
and Islamabad's arsenal has made the conflict potentially even more
horrific. But as this year's Nobel Peace Prize for David Trimble
and John Hume showed, the sine qua non for negotiated peace is
sensible heads on both sides. They fashioned the peace
negotiations, which rested on the central idea that each side must
give up on some ``non-negotiable'' long-standing demands, in the
face of hostile reactions from their respective communities _ and
this is crucial _ with the full backing of London and Dublin.
	   For Kashmir, it is New Delhi's intransigence and Islamabad's
monomania that are the stumbling blocks. These attitudes preclude
any possibility of an Indo-Pakistani version of Trimble and Hume
emerging from the subcontinental political class.

	   Frankfurter Allgemeine, Frankfurt, Germany, on the Middle East
peace process:
	   The timing of the attack was purposely chosen. ... Arafat's
Palestinian opponents, who above all have a political and religious
home in the Hamas movement, would like to ruin the peace process
every time there is a positive development.
	   ... However, terrorism is not only an Arab problem. An Israeli
killed Arafat's partner, Rabin, and Baruch Goldstein initiated
other actions against Arabs.
	   Among the painful insights relating to relations in the Middle
East is that this region will suffer continually under terrorists
and violence for the foreseeable future. But should this warp the
full and well-deserved peace?
	    &UR; ___
	   The Sydney Morning Herald, Sydney, Australia, on China-Taiwan
talks:
	   The talks between officials from China and Taiwan last week
ought never have been expected to produce very tangible results.
But the six day encounter was undoubtedly a political coup for
Taiwan. Nothing could have shown the government in Taipei to better
advantage than to have it projected in such direct contrast with
the government in Beijing. Koo Cehn-fu, Taiwan's senior envoy, had
only to insist that reunification is impossible until China reaches
Taiwan's state of democratic development. Anything the Chinese
Vice-Premier Qian Qichen then said against Taiwan's preaching
``Taiwan-style democracy' was bound to look bad.
	   In fact Qian went a long way to accommodate Taiwan's legitimate
interests ... expressing a profound pragmatism unimaginable only a
few years ago when Beijing railed against the ``renegade province''
in the most strident terms and denouncing the Kuomintang
``brigands'' who ruled it.
	   Taiwan now is a democracy. It is not a perfect open society. ...
But Taiwan is, to all intents and purposes, an independent nation.
The independence of its 21 million people is strengthened by its
democratic system. It will not be dictated to by the present
oligarchy ruling China. There might well be reunification some time
in the future. But it will not come by force such as China has been
accustomed to threaten over the years. And it is more likely to
come when China embraces democracy _ that is, on Taiwan's terms.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Drivers taking commonly prescribed anti-anxiety
drugs such as Valium during the day are more than twice as likely
to be involved in traffic accidents as those not taking the drugs,
according to a new study.
	   The risk of accidents for people under the age of 45 is more
than three times greater if taking the drugs, according to the
study published in Friday's edition of The Lancet, a British
medical journal.
	   Thousands of lives could be saved worldwide every year and
hundreds of thousands of traffic accidents avoided if people who
use such drugs did not drive while on medication, the researchers
said.
	   ``The current warnings are that if you feel drowsy, don't drive.
That needs to be changed,'' said Dr. Tom MacDonald, the clinical
pharmacologist from the University of Dundee in Scotland who led
the study. ``I would say if you use these drugs, don't drive.''
	   Tranquilizers such as Valium, generically known as diazepam, are
commonly used to treat anxiety, other stress-related disorders and
muscle spasms.
	   They are the most commonly prescribed tranquilizers, with 18
million prescriptions in Britain alone in 1997. Worldwide figures
were not available.
	   Patients usually feel drowsy on those drugs in the first few
days of taking them, but accidents occur at the same rate
regardless of whether drowsiness occurs, MacDonald said.
	   Jeff Soper, spokesman for Hoffman LaRoche, the Swiss maker of
Valium, said his company's warning labels are very clear.
	   There are prescription label warnings ``that make it very clear
that folks should be very careful driving or operating heavy
machinery when under the influence of these products,'' said Soper,
who was not familiar with the Lancet study.
	   Dr. Desmond O'Neill, a geriatrician at the Center for Mobility
Enhancement at Adelaide and Meath Hospital in Dublin, Ireland,
viewed the study's conclusions with caution.
	   ``They've made us think hard, but it still isn't enough evidence
to tell people not to drive,'' he said. ``Is it the illness or the
medication? If you're that agitated that you need the drug, maybe
that's the problem.''
	   The researchers compared the records of all prescriptions
dispensed in the Dundee area with all 19,386 traffic accidents the
local police responded to between April 1992 and June 1995. A total
of 1,731 people involved in those accidents were taking one of the
drugs examined in the study.
	   Of the accidents involving those 1,731 people, four included
fatalities. Of those, three drivers were taking anti-anxiety drugs
on the day of the accident and the fourth driver had taken
anti-anxiety drugs during the study period.

	   MOSCOW, Russia (AP) _ Venus Williams took only 50 minutes to
eliminate Russian Elena Likhovtseva 6-3, 6-1 Thursday, advancing to
the quarterfinals of the Kremlin Cup.
	   The American faltered slightly in the first set when she dropped
two games after going up 4-1. But she quickly regained control and
powered through the rest of the match.
	   Her only gift to Likhovtseva was in the sixth game of the second
set. Leading 5-0, Williams double-faulted and committed three
unforced errors to lose the game.
	   Williams was pleased with the quick match, after playing well
past midnight Wednesday in a doubles match she won with her sister,
Serena.
	   ``It was nice to have an easy match like that because I had a
long match yesterday in the doubles,'' she said.
	   In other second-round matches at the dlrs 1 million tournament,
second seed Monica Seles of the United States downed Barbara Schett
of Germany, 6-3, 6-4.
	   In the first set, Seles broke Schett in the fourth game to go
ahead 3-1, but double-faulted and lost at love in the next game.
	   Seles regained her balance, however, sending a two-handed
backhand down the line to clinch the set.
	   Seles said she still has her eyes on the WTA Tour's No. 1
ranking.
	   ``I have to improve a couple of things to be No. 1 and I'm
trying to do that, she said. ``The competition is very hard but
that is one of the reasons why I'm still playing.''
	   After two days of upsets, Thursday saw one more suprise, with
ninth-ranked Patty Schnyder losing to Spain's Magui Serna, 6-7
(3-7), 4-6.
	   But the remaining seeded players showed their dominance, with
third seed Conchita Martinez dumping Russian Nadejda Petrova 6-0,
6-0. Petrova, ranked 175th, shocked Iva Majoli Tuesday after
earning a wild-card spot.
	   Fifth-seed Mary Pierce of France beat Belgian Sabine Appelmans,
6-2, 6-2, and No. 7 Sandrine Testud defeated Russian Natasha
Zvereva 6-4, 6-3.
	   Italy's Sylvia Farina beat Slovakian Henrieta Nagyova 6-3, 6-1,
and Katarina Studenikova of Slovakia defeated American Chanda Rubin
6-3, 7-5.

Venetian count robbed of Canaletto painting

<TEXT>
	   VENICE, Italy (AP) _ A Venetian count was robbed of the jewel of
his art collection: a painting by Canaletto valued at dlrs 2.5
million.
	   The ANSA news agency said Thursday that the oil painting was
stolen from Count Alvise Giustiniani's palazzo during the night,
along with several lesser works.
	   Canaletto (Giovanni Antonio Canal) was the most famous painter
of Venetian scenes of the 18th century and his works hang in many
of the world's major museums.
	   The stolen painting, Il Fonteghetto della Farina, was signed by
the artist and is one of Canaletto's well-known works, ANSA said.
It said the painting is worth around dlrs 2.5 million.
	   The report said the count's palazzo does not have an alarm
system. The theft is under investigation by Venetian authorities.
``It was a slick job,'' said the investigating magistrate, Bianca
Maria Cotronei.
	   Many of Canaletto's patrons were English collectors and from
1746 to 1755, he worked in Britain, where his paintings are in the
royal collection. In Britain, Canaletto expanded his repertory to
include scenes of London and English country manors.

UNDATED: Taiwan's terms.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	    &UR; ___
	   Mainichi Shimbun, Tokyo, on China-Taiwan dialogue:
	   The China-Taiwan dialogue, which had been suspended for three
years, has finally been restarted. The rebuilding of a channel of
communication between the two countries will help to restore trust
and reduce tensions in the Strait of Taiwan. That is a welcome
development.
	   As China and Taiwan are still not ready to engage in
government-to-government talks, the semi-official meetings ... take
on special meaning. ... Taiwan's decision to open up to China's
overtures and resume dialogue was not a spontaneous one. Rather, it
was prompted by pressure from the United States, which would like
to prevent the outbreak of a sudden conflict in the region. China
has asserted that it would exercise military force if Taiwan
asserts its independence.
	   Although (officials from the two countries) have helped to
restart the dialogue, few Taiwanese citizens support early
unification and continue to distrust China.
	   But there is no need to rush toward a settlement of this issue.
The first priority is to build mutual trust. ...
	    &UR; ___
	   The Straits Times, Singapore, on the grenade attack in Israel:
	   The grenade attack by a Palestinian in the southern Israeli town
of Beersheba on Monday was clearly meant to destroy crucial talks
in the United States aimed at breaking the 19-month deadlock in the
Middle East peace process. The only appropriate response to the
provocation is to ensure that its perpetrators, a Palestinian from
the West Bank, does not achieve his objective. That is easier said
than done because the attack will naturally incense Israeli public
opinion and provide an excellent opportunity to hard-liners to
justify their intransigent opposition to the land-for-peace
formula. The opponents of that formula will say again, and not
without cause, that it is but half of an equation whose other half
must be peace with security _ a security which has again been
imperiled by Palestinian terrorism.
	   The prospects of a breakthrough in Maryland, where U.S.
President Bill Clinton has brought together Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, are in
danger of being overshadowed by the interminable war between
terrorism and intransigence on the ground.''
	    &UR; ___
	   Der Bund, Bern, Switzerland, on Pinochet arrest:
	   Whether senator-for-life Augusto Pinochet will have to pay for
his evil deeds is not yet clear.
	   Punishing crimes against humanity is an extremely complicated
and time-consuming task. The ongoing investigations by the U.N.
tribunals for Bosnia, in The Hague, and Rwanda, in Arusha, where a
first sentence for genocide was only recently handed down, prove
this every day.
	   The Pinochet case is a complicated one.
	   First in legal terms, where two concepts collide: the immunity
of someone traveling on a diplomatic passport, and the punishment
of crimes against humanity, an idea which developed from World War
II but is still largely ignored. ...
	   In Chile, ideological opposites still divide the country. ...
	   The investigation against Pinochet launched by Spain is likely
at first to deepen the divisions in Chilean society, but finally to
force the nation to come to terms with the years of dictatorship.
	   (Maurice) Papon was old when he was brought to trial. Pinochet
is 82.
	   Age should never be used as a reason not to punish the kind of
crimes Pinochet stands accused of _ in the name of humanity.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Seattle Times, on death of Matthew Shepard:
	   A college freshman in Wyoming is dead because he was openly gay.
	   The murder of 21-year-old Matthew Shepard was savage. His
attackers reportedly kidnapped and robbed him, lashed his badly
beaten body to a fence in an open field, and then left him hanging
alone for 18 hours _ freezing and unconscious _ until found by a
passer-by. Two men, more animal than human in their alleged
conduct, have been charged with the crime. They may face the death
penalty. ...
	   Shepard's death has resurrected a stalled movement in Congress
to broaden federal jurisdiction over violent crimes motivated by
hate. ... Within hours of Shepard's death, President Clinton ...
called for speedy passage of the Hate Crimes Prevention Act.
	   More thoughtful consideration and less opportunism is the better
path to justice for Matthew Shepard.
	   Congress must take extra care when moving to federalize crimes _
such as murder _ traditionally prosecuted by the states. The
likelihood that this was a hate-inspired crime certainly makes it
all the more heinous, but do such crimes require federal
intervention? ...

	   Houston Chronicle, Houston, on Pinochet arrest:
	   The arrest in London of former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto
Pinochet may be gratifying to those who rightfully condemn the
atrocities of his brutal regime. Unfortunately, his arrest is
likely to result in less justice and rule of law in the world, not
more.
	   No one familiar with the history of Pinochet's 17-year rule can
argue that he does not deserve to be made to answer for that
regime's campaign of murder, torture and unjust detention following
the fatal overthrow of Chilean President Salvador Allende. Even
Chile's ambassador to Britain says that Chile has no wish to spare
Pinochet from ``the wrath of the law.''
	   Also, the retired dictator is not an accredited diplomat nor a
visitor to the United Kingdom on official business. He does not
warrant diplomatic immunity unless the British government chooses
to extend it, and even diplomats can be prosecuted for crimes as
gross as torture and mass murder.
	   But while the Spanish judge who requested Pinochet's detention
may have been within his rights in seeking to question Pinochet
about the murder and torture of Spanish citizens in Chile, he goes
too far in expanding the potential charges to the murder of Chilean
citizens, genocide and crimes against humanity.
	   Can any nation prosecute any person for crimes against humanity
committed in any country, as the Spanish judge states? The result
would be anarchy. ...
	    &UR; ___
	   The Stuart News, Stuart, Florida, on ending sanctions against
Cuba:
	   After 35 years of doing something that hasn't worked, maybe it's
time to rethink our sanctions on Cuba. ... The United Nations
General Assembly this past week voted 157-2 to urge the United
States to drop its embargo.
	   Only loyal Israel voted with us. Last year and in 1996 we could
muster three votes. ... Instead of re-examining a failed policy
then, we instead ratcheted up the sanctions with the 1996
Helms-Burton Act. That law was so intrusive in what other nations
deemed their own business that even our closest neighbors, Canada
and Mexico, feel free to ignore our sanctions.
	   The sanctions remain in place only because of domestic political
considerations and rigid, reflexive anti-communism, like that of
the act's two sponsors. ... The sanctions were politically easy:
While they hurt the Cubans a lot, they hurt us not at all. ...
	   If deposing Fidel Castro was (and still is) the goal, old age
probably will get him faster than our sanctions. Maybe the rest of
the world is wrong and we're right. Still, after 35 years and no
more international support, maybe it's time to try some other way
to spread the spirit of free-market freedom to Cuba.
	   How about trade and tourism?
	    &UR; ___
	   The Columbus (Ohio) Dispatch, on AIDS deaths:
	   The recent report on the incidence of AIDS in the United States
makes two significant points:
	   Deaths are falling at an amazing rate. The number in the United
States fell 29 percent in 1996 and 47 percent last year, the
largest decline for any major disease in one year.
	   On the down side, the rate of infections is holding steady at
about 40,000 a year. An irony is that those who get the disease now
are healthier and more active, and thus spreading it more than if
they were seriously ill.
	   The steady number of new cases indicates the education campaign
is not nearly as effective as it needs to be. Those who argue
against comprehensive education about AIDS should be aware they
might be signing a death warrant for a young person who need to
know that this is not solely a disease transmitted by gay people.
Promiscuity is foolish and dangerous, and that message cannot be
repeated too often.
	   The medical campaign cannot be relaxed until drugs are developed
that will stop this scourge in its tracks.

	   PARIS (AP) _ They were marching again Thursday in the streets of
France, but this time it was a different generation: retired people
rather than high school students.
	   About 60,000 pensioners took to the streets in seven French
cities to protest a drop in their standard of living and to demand
more money from the government.
	   ``At 20, it's a mess, at 60, it's misery'' read a banner at the
Paris protest. ``Money for retired people!'' others read.
	   Unlike two nationwide protests by high school students that have
turned violent in the past week, the elderly demonstrators were
calm, orderly and good-natured.
	   Late Thursday afternoon, officials at Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin's office received delegates of unions representing the
retired people.
	   Pensioners say their purchasing power has dropped over the last
several years, and they want the French government to compensate
them for their losses.
	   Police said at least 12,500 demonstrated in Paris, 11,000 in
Nantes, 10,000 in Marseille, 9,000 in Lyon, 4,500 in Nancy and in
Bordeaux, and 4,500 in Toulouse.

Greek officials seek origins of ancient text set for auction

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Christie's was preparing to take bids on
one of its rarest offerings: a one-of-a-kind copy of a
2,300-year-old text by the ancient Greek scientist and inventor
Archimedes.
	   Not so fast, Greek officials replied.
	   The Greek culture ministry is investigating how the medieval
manuscript came into the hands of its current owners following the
text's mysterious journey from Middle Eastern monasteries to a
family in France.
	   ``The origin of the manuscript is being examined,'' Milena
Apostolaki, advisor to the culture minister, told The Associated
Press on Thursday.
	   The scheduled Oct. 29 auction in New York is expected to fetch
between dlrs 800,000 and dlrs 1.2 million for the 174-leaf text,
which includes writings on geometry and physics.
	   But if the ministry's investigation can prove the item was not
legally obtained, the auction could be called off.
	   ``If there is absolute proof, we will not put it up for sale,''
said Christie's spokeswoman, Vredy Lytsman.
	   Any challenge to the ownership would have to be further
investigated by the auction house, which has already conducted its
own research into the origin of the manuscript, known as the
Archimedes Palimpsest.
	   A palimpsest is a manuscript whose pages have been written on
twice. When writing materials were in short supply, the original
text would be washed away when no longer deemed useful.
	   ``Christie's are satisfied that the Archimedes Palimpsest has
been legitimately owned by a French family for the last three
quarters of a century,'' said Felix de Marez Oyens, the head of
Christie's Books and Manuscripts Department.
	   But its earlier history is steeped in mystery.
	   Archimedes' text was copied in Constantinople _ modern-day
Istanbul _ in the 10th century. Two centuries later, it was covered
by a Greek religious text but the original writings were still
legible.
	   In the Middle Ages, it was owned by a monastery in Palestine
whose manuscript collection was incorporated into the Greek
Patriarchate library in Jerusalem in the 19th century, de Marez
Oyens said.
	   No one knows why it was transferred to another monastery in
Constantinople. All but four ancient texts _ including the
Archimedes volume _ were taken to Athens when the monastery's
library was dissolved after World War I.
	   The other three are now in libraries in France and the United
States. The Archimedes text was the only one to become privately
held.
	   The manuscript ``is the most significant and substantial Greek
palimpsest known, and one of the most important palimpsest
manuscripts of a classical text ever to come to light,'' a
Christie's statement said.
	   For some Greek officials, the manuscript represents a cherished
part of a cultural heritage that has been scattered across the
globe _ such as the Elgin marbles taken from the Parthenon in the
19th century and now on display at the British Museum in London.
	   ``(The manuscript's) acquirement by Greece has symbolic,
political and scientific value and I believe we must attempt it,''
said Culture Minister Evangelos Venizelos, who has appealed to
large Greek banking groups and charitable foundations to contribute
to help make a winning auction bid.
	   Archimedes, who explored physics, astronomy and engineering, is
credited with shouting ``Eureka!'' or ``I've found it!'' while
running naked through the streets after discovering the principle
of water displacement while sitting in his bath.
	   He also has been cited for inventions such as a planetarium that
demonstrated the movement of the stars, the compound pulley and
devices for raising water.
	   The manuscript contains ``the only known copy of the original
Greek text of his work `On Floating Bodies,''' Christie's said.
	   It also contains works such as ``On the Measurement of the
Circle'' and ``On the Sphere and the Cylinder'' and ``On Spiral
Lines.''
	   The fact that the text has not been accessible to study for
nearly a century adds to its significance.
	   Modern methods, such as high-resolution digital scanning and
ultraviolet light, could reveal previously unnoticed details and
text, Christie's noted.

Global warming treaty chief sees likely clash at conference
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ North and South may clash from Day 1 at a
global warming conference next month in Argentina, as Washington
pushes to extend limits on ``greenhouse'' gas emissions to poorer
countries, a top U.N. climate official said Thursday.
	   ``One big issue that is hovering ... is when and how developing
countries might also take on commitments,'' said Michael Zammit
Cutajar, U.N. administrator of the 166-nation 1992 global warming
treaty.
	   When treaty nations convene a two-week conference Nov. 2 in
Buenos Aires, the host Argentine delegation is expected to try to
add to the agenda a discussion of ways to make ``voluntary''
emissions quotas for some developing countries part of the formal
treaty structure.
	   ``That's when a row could blow up,'' Zammit Cutajar told
reporters at a news conference previewing the meeting. ``... The
Argentine proposal is supported by some and opposed by many.''
	   At a landmark conference last December in Kyoto, Japan,
governments agreed to a treaty protocol that would, for the first
time, legally mandate emission reductions by the United States,
Japan, the 15-nation European Union and 21 other industrial
nations.
	   They are to cut their output of carbon dioxide and other
greenhouse gases blamed for global warming _ gases emitted by motor
vehicles and power plants, for example _ to 5 percent below their
1990 levels, as of the period 2008-2012.
	   The Buenos Aires conference was planned to work out details of
such treaty mechanisms as a system of trading emissions quotas
among industrial nations.
	   The climate agreement merely asks poorer nations to do their
best to restrain emissions. They say their developing economies
should not have to take on the burden of mandatory energy
restraints, and point out it was the rich North that loaded the
atmosphere with carbon dioxide to begin with.
	   But the Republican-led U.S. Senate says it will not ratify the
Kyoto agreement unless it leads to emissions reductions by
developing countries, too. As a result, the Clinton administration,
with help from Argentina, will seek concessions from the South at
next month's sessions.
	   Zammit Cutajar said the conference will mark ``the beginning of
a new phase of negotiations that might last three or four years.''

Chernomyrdin: Yeltsin's health underscores need for vice president
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with 8 grafs to UPDATE with Kiriyenko remarks. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia needs a vice president who could take over
if President Boris Yeltsin's health continues to deteriorate,
former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said Thursday.
	   ``If a good vice president were working now, there would be no
concern over the health of the president or early presidential
elections,'' Chernomyrdin said, according to the Interfax news
agency.
	   Russia had a vice president previously, but the position was
abolished when the country revamped its constitution in 1993. The
last vice president, Alexander Rutskoi, led a rebellion against
Yeltsin in the fall of that year that failed and prompted the
constitutional changes.
	   Chernomyrdin was referring to growing speculation about the
health of Yeltsin, who had to cancel an upcoming trip abroad
because of a respiration infection.
	   Yeltsin, 67, has been dogged by health problems for years,
including bypass surgery in 1996. With every new illness comes a
flurry of rumors that he is unable to fill his post and may step
down.
	   In light of Yeltsin's health, Chernomyrdin said that scrapping
the vice presidency ``was probably not the right decision,''
according to Interfax.
	   Chernomyrdin's successor as prime minister, Sergei Kiriyenko,
who was fired in August, agreed that Russia should have a vice
president. However, he told Echo Moscow radio that he does not
believe Yeltsin should step down.
	   ``His health could be better, that's for sure,'' Kiriyenko said,
according to Interfax. ``But I will not join this discussion.''
	   Yeltsin met with aides on Thursday and was preparing for one-day
trip to Austria next week, said presidential spokesman Dmitry
Yakushkin.
	   The trip had originally been announced as a two-day visit, but
Yeltsin now plans to arrive and leave Austria next Tuesday.
Yakushkin insisted that the president would hold all his scheduled
meetings with European leaders.
	   Yeltsin and his doctors insist that the president will serve out
the two years remaining in his term, and they deny speculation that
he has serious health problems.

Hard-liners urge Iranians to vote to avoid embarrassment
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Polls open at 0430GMT Friday &QL; 
 &UR; By SCHEHEREZADE FARAMARZI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Fearing an embarrassing low turnout in a key
election Friday, senior conservative clerics fervently urged
Iranians to vote in large numbers to show confidence in the
19-year-old Islamic regime.
	   The hard-line controlled state Tehran radio spent half its
hour-long main news program Thursday broadcasting calls for people
to show their ``brave presence'' at polling stations to elect the
Assembly of Experts.
	   Besides the presidential polls, the election for the 86-member
assembly is the most important in Iran because the caucus elects
and supervises the country's supreme leader, who has the final say
in government decisions.
	   Among those urging people to vote was Grand Ayatollah Kazem
Lankarani, who called it a ``divine duty'' and warned that ``the
revolution's enemies are waiting to strike a strong blow at our
regime.''
	   The lackluster election campaign has failed to draw much
excitement because of lack of competition: Most of the 161
candidates _ all clergymen _ are hard-liners who were selected by a
supervisory Council of Guardians controlled by conservatives.
	   In vetting 396 aspirants, the council eliminated most supporters
of President Mohammad Khatami, a moderate clergyman with wide
popular support.
	   Khatami's followers want to make the supreme leader more
accountable to the people while the hard-liners prefer a much more
hands-off approach.
	   The conflict is the latest chapter in a pervasive power struggle
in the ruling clergy between Khatami and conservative clergymen who
control most of the major state institutions such as the judiciary
and security agencies.
	   Since his election last year, Khatami has stunned the
hard-liners with bold and popular attempts to ease social,
political and media restrictions that were imposed after the 1979
Islamic Revolution installed a government of theologians.
	   By eliminating the moderates for Friday's assembly election, the
conservatives were hoping to prevent a repeat of the stinging
defeat in 1997 presidential election when 20 million out of 30
million people voted for Khatami, rather than a hard-line rival.
	   But then the hard-liners began to fear a low turnout would look
bad after some moderate groups decided to boycott the vote to
protest the dumping of moderate candidates as well as to call into
question the legitimacy of the conservatives.
	   Other moderates believe that people must vote to at least keep
the most stringent hard-liners out of the assembly, such as
Mohammad Yazdi, head of the judiciary, and Ahmad Jannati, head of
the Council of Guardians.
	   The moderates also do not want their candidates _ few as they
are _ to suffer because of a low turnout.
	   Candidates linked to the moderate camp include former President
Hashemi Rafsanjani and Parliament member Majid Ansari, 44, who
wants the assembly to submit regular reports of its work and to
open its sessions to public.
	   Fewer than 10 million of a little more than 38 million eligible
voters are expected to take part. Even the hard-line Abrar daily
estimated that 15 million people will vote, a turnout of 39
percent.
	   Hoping to save the day, Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei
issued his final appeal Wednesday.
	   ``The people, by their huge turnout at the elections of the
Assembly of Experts, will inject a new life into the revolution,''
he said.
	   Some 100,000 security forces will be deployed around the
country's 28 provinces for the voting in 33,312 polling stations.
First official results are not expected until Saturday.

	   GENEVA (AP) _ North Korea protested about the U.S. military's
presence in South Korea on Thursday, but joined in daylong talks on
the nuts-and-bolts details of drafting a permanent peace for the
Korean peninsula.
	   A U.S. official said after morning and afternoon sessions that
there is a possibility of a ``significant procedural'' agreement on
organizing the talks by the time the current round ends,
tentatively scheduled for Sunday.
	   The delegations from the two Koreas, China and the United States
have failed in two previous rounds _ last March and December _ to
overcome the hurdle.
	   Only then will they be able to begin talking about a peace
treaty to replace the armistice that has been in place since the
end of the 1950-53 Korean War. The United States and China were the
other main combatants in the war.
	   Discussions Thursday focused on the proposal of South Korea,
which is chairing the current round, to form two subcommittees to
deal with key issues, officials said.
	   North Korea has demanded that the four sides agree on an agenda
before they decide how to discuss it.
	   But U.S. officials said North Korean delegates participated
actively with the other sides in the talks Thursday even though
they stuck to their position.
	   Under the South Korean proposal, one panel would discuss
replacing the armistice while the other formulates
confidence-building measures.
	   Officials noted that the atmosphere was good enough for all
sides to attend an evening reception at the U.S. Mission to United
Nations offices in Geneva.
	   ``We've made quite a bit of progress in narrowing the
differences, but the North Korean position remains quite firm,''
said U.S. Ambassador-at-Large Charles Kartman.
	   Chinese Ambassador Qian Yong-nian said the four sides would
continue ``probing.''
	   To underscore its position, North Korea issued a statement on
its official Korean Central News Agency denouncing U.S. and South
Korean plans for joint military maneuvers to begin Monday.
	   The exercises have been held annually since 1961, but North
Korea said the timing the day after the current round ends is
``seriously provoking.''
	   ``The war exercises are patent proof that the United States and
the South Korean authorities have no interest in discussing''
permanent peace on the Korean peninsula, it said.
	   Park Kun-woo, leader of the South Korean delegation, said, ``We
had a constructive meeting, and I underline the word
`constructive.''' He gave no details.
	   His North Korean counterpart, Vice Foreign Minister Kim Gye
Gwan, declined to comment.
	   The border between the Koreas is the world's most heavily armed,
with nearly 2 million troops deployed on both sides.

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Fighting between government forces and
rebels in Guinea-Bissau abated Thursday, allowing aid workers to
address the mounting humanitarian crisis in the small west African
nation.
	   The Red Cross and World Food Program said they were struggling
to care for tens of thousands of people fleeing the fighting in the
former Portuguese colony of some 1 million people.
	   ``We're completely overwhelmed by the situation,'' Wagdi Othman
of the World Food Program said from Abidjan, Ivory Coast, from
where he is coordinating the aid effort.
	   The rebels _ mostly army veterans angered by poor pay and
conditions _ control most of Guinea-Bissau after sweeping through
the countryside since fighting restarted Sunday, ending a
three-month truce.
	   The government announced a unilateral cease-fire late Wednesday
and said it was ready to talk peace with the insurgents. The
insurgents reacted cautiously, saying they wanted greater
guarantees before entering into peace talks.
	   Aid workers contacted by phone said the capital Bissau and
second-largest city Bafata, 140 kilometers (90 miles) to the east,
were quiet after sporadic firing at dawn.
	   Thousands of people were streaming out of Bissau, said Michael
Kleiner of the International Red Cross. About 20,000 people arrived
in Cumara, a small town 11 kilometers (7 miles) away.
	   Many civilians were wounded in an artillery barrage by
government forces in Bissau on Wednesday, Kleiner said.
	   The rebels Thursday were advancing on Gabu, about 200 kilometers
125 miles east of Bissau, according to aid workers who asked not to
be identified.

Islamic Jihad activists warned not to engage in violence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Palestinian police arrested 12
members of the militant group Islamic Jihad on Thursday, a day
after its leaders were summoned to Palestinian security
headquarters, the group said.
	   The arrests were made in the Gaza Strip while the men were
preparing for a rally in the memory of a former leader assassinated
in 1995.
	   In the West Bank, Islamic Jihad leaders were warned not to carry
out attacks in Israel.
	   The warning was delivered Wednesday when 20 leading members of
Islamic Jihad reported to the Palestinians' Preventive Security
Service office in the West Bank town of Bethlehem, said a security
official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The official said there was concern that Islamic Jihad might try
to engage in violence to mark the recent anniversary of the
assassination of their leader, Fathi Shikaki.
	   Shikaki was gunned down Oct. 16, 1995 outside a hotel in Malta,
and the assassination was widely attributed to Israel.
	   Islamic Jihad is planning to hold a number of rallies in
Shikaki's memory.
	   In Gaza, a leader for the group, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, confirmed Thursday's arrests.
	   The group is the smaller of two militant Palestinian groups in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip and has carried out a number of
shootings and bombings in Israel in hopes of wrecking Mideast
peacemaking.
	   Israel has called on the Palestinian Authority to do more to
fight terrorism,
	   The Palestinian security official said the summoning of the
Islamic Jihad leaders was routine procedure and not an attempt to
step up anti-terrorism efforts during the Mideast summit underway
in the United States.

Jewish suspect arrested in stabbing deaths of Palestinians
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A Jewish man affiliated with Israel's extreme
right-wing has been arrested on suspicion of carrying out a spree
of stabbings that left one Palestinian dead and six others
seriously injured, police said Thursday.
	   Police suspect that the 32-year-old man, identified by radio
reports as Yonatan Tzion Dadovich, is the serial stabber who preyed
upon Palestinians in the ultra-Orthodox neighborhood of Mea Shearim
between November 1997 and May 1998.
	   The last victim was a 50-year-old Palestinian who was walking
through Mea Shearim on his way to work.
	   Dadovich, identified with extremist right wing movements, was
arrested on Sunday in his Jerusalem apartment, police spokesman
Shmuel Ben-Ruby said. A court-ordered publication ban on details of
the arrest was lifted Thursday.
	   Ben-Ruby did not say which group Dadovich was affiliated with
and said the suspect has denied any connection to the stabbings.
	   Police at first suspected criminal motives behind the stabbings,
but later found materials at the scene of subsequent stabbings that
indicated the assailant was targeting Arabs, Ben-Ruby said.
Ben-Ruby said the physical evidence plus additional materials found
at the suspect's apartment were being examined at police
laboratories.
	   Police believe that the stabbings were acts of vengeance for
Jews killed by Arabs in Jerusalem.

Iraqi defector tells CIA about Saddam's sanction busting network
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ An important Iraqi defector gave valuable
information to the United States about a sanctions-busting business
network run by Saddam Hussein's family, dissidents and officials
said Thursday.
	   Abbas Al-Janabi, who was the personal secretary of Saddam's
elder son, Odai, defected to the West last spring and spent three
months in the United States being debriefed by CIA officials, Iraqi
dissidents said on condition of anonymity.
	   They said al-Janabi gave the CIA a list of the phony companies
controlled by Saddam's family and names of persons involved in oil
and business deals with Iraq.
	   The list of the companies in the Middle East, southeast Asia and
Europe could provide the most complete picture yet of Baghdad's
efforts to evade the sweeping sanctions imposed by the United
Nations after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Al-Janabi revealed some details about the covert activities in
an interview with the London-based Arabic newspaper, Al-Hayat. The
last installment of the three-part interview appeared Thursday.
	   Al-Janabi said Odai has 50 small ships for smuggling oil through
Iran and a fleet of road tankers to smuggle fuel and oil to Turkey.
Together, the operations earn Odai hundreds of million of dollars,
he said.
	   Western intelligence officials told The Associated Press that
al-Janabi gave the CIA evidence that can be used against Saddam and
his inner circle in some future attempt to bring the Iraqi leaders
to trial as war criminals.
	   Al-Janabi said he witnessed many instances of killing and
torture that Saddam and his sons, Odai and Qusai, carried out
personally, said the officials. They spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   Thursday's al-Hayat quoted al-Janabi as saying that Odai killed
two of his aides on grounds of negligence.
	   In one case, he saw Odai forcing a bodyguard to drink three
bottles of gin while he beat him with a club.
	   Al-Janabi said he himself was tortured by Odai who accused him
of siding with a businessman negotiating a cigarette deal.
	   But al-Janabi told the CIA more about Saddam's involvement in
killings and torture cases, which he refused to divulge in the
newspaper interview, the officials said.
	   Al-Janabi, who has joined an Iraqi opposition group backed by
the CIA, is believed to be in hiding in London.
	   In the interview, he confirmed reports that Saddam ordered the
slaying of his two sons-in-law after they returned to Iraq in
February 1996 following a brief defection.
	   Saddam Kamel al-Majid and his brother Lt. Gen. Hussein Kamel
al-Majid had fled in August 1995 to Jordan where they revealed
significant information about Iraq's weapons program.
	   Saddam ordered the death of the two men and Odai, Qusai and
Saddam's cousin, Ali Hassan al-Majid, supervised the killings,
Al-Janabi said.
	   Al-Janabi said he was in the palace although not in the room
when Saddam met his sons-in-law on their return.

U.S. hurricane aid boosts Puerto Rican statehood advocates

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ When Hurricane Georges demolished
thousands of Puerto Rican homes, it also handed supporters of
statehood a valuable gift: a chance to prove that it pays
handsomely to be part of the United States.
	   The federal government's mighty relief effort _ at dlrs 1.5
billion and counting _ has been caught up in a political storm,
with critics accusing Gov. Pedro Rossello of exploiting it to boost
the statehood side in an upcoming vote on the island's status.
	   Statehood supporters, meanwhile, dismissed opposition calls that
the Dec. 13 vote be put off until the island recovers.
	   Asked about the charges and countercharges during visit last
week, James Lee Witt, the head of the Federal Emergency Management
Agency, said relief efforts always are susceptible to use by
politicians in their propaganda, but cannot be a factor in his
agency's actions. Local FEMA coordinator Jose A. Bravo went
further, charging that ``public comments by too many politicians
here are intended to stir the political pot.''
	   The Sept. 21 hurricane _ considered the worst to hit Puerto Rico
in 70 years _ came as the island is preparing for a referendum on
whether to continue its current status or opt for statehood or
independence.
	   The United States, which has controlled Puerto Rico since
driving out the Spanish a century ago, is not bound by the vote but
President Bill Clinton has said Congress should honor the result.
However, the current lawmaking body appears unlikely to approve of
expanding the union.
	   The last referendum, in 1993, was narrowly won by supporters of
the current ``commonwealth'' status, whereby Puerto Ricans are U.S.
citizens with limited rights and duties. Only a tiny minority
supports independence.
	   Statehood supporters deride commonwealth as colonial status,
noting that islanders cannot vote for president or for Congress,
which has ultimate control here.
	   Commonwealth supporters fear statehood would dilute their
Hispanic culture and make English the dominant language.
	   Last week, Witt detailed FEMA accomplishments that include:
	   _ Getting the federal government to assign dlrs 1.3 billion,
making this the organization's biggest storm-relief project ever; a
few days later Bravo said the figure had reached dlrs 1.5 billion.
	   _ Launching a five-year project to build 50,000 homes.
	   _ Registering and paying more victims more quickly than ever.
	   In addition, the U.S. military launched an ambitious relief
effort, transporting thousands of tons of cots, medicines, ice,
water and generators to aid victims.
	   Several hundred Marines from Camp Lejuene, North Carolina,
installed temporary bridges, power-generating stations and water
purification centers. Heavy-lift helicopters delivered the aid to
remote mountain towns.
	   The aid stood in sharp contrast to the situation in neighboring
countries.
	   The English-language San Juan Star daily noted that ``things are
sharply different'' in the devastated Dominican Republic and Haiti,
where ``they do not have the financial and expert support from
Washington that Puerto Rico does.''
	   Georges killed some 500 people in those two countries _ compared
to three in Puerto Rico _ and their governments have been unable to
cope with hundreds of thousands of homeless.
	   ``The governor's strategists believe they will reap a political
windfall from the outpouring of federal aid,'' wrote columnist Bob
Becker in the Star. ``The message will be crystal clear...
statehood assures the strong assistance of the United States in
times of natural catastrophe.''
	   A group led by opposition legislator Roberto Cruz Rodriguez has
demanded an investigation of Rossello's handling of aid, saying he
illegally withheld money from the opposition-controlled town of
Ponce until he could arrive and distribute it himself.
	   ``(That's) an abuse that borders on plain impudence,'' Cruz
Rodriguez charged.
	   Critics say Rossello allies have also distributed pro-statehood
literature at events where he has handed out relief checks.
	   But, most damning in the eyes of many in this music-mad society,
such events have featured loudspeakers blaring ``The Cup Of Life,''
a hit song that has become associated with the governor's campaign.
	   ``It's a great way to bring comfort to people, to make them
cheerful,'' countered Rossello's chief of staff, Angel Morey.

Expensive burgers land Iraqi woman in jail
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The burgers were worth their weight in
gold.
	   Customs officials who caught a woman with an unusually big horde
of hamburgers in her luggage found that instead of meat the
sandwiches were packed with gold pieces _ 277 grams (9.69 troy
ounces) in all.
	   The al-Zawra weekly reported Thursday that the woman was
arrested a few days ago at the Iraqi-Jordan border checkpoint of
Trabil with contraband gold worth 4.5 million dinars (dlrs 2,700).
	   Al-Zawra did not say how many pieces were confiscated but that
the gold was concealed in buns. The woman, who faces an
undetermined prison term, was not identified.
	   Gold is cheaper in Iraq than in other countries: about dlrs 280
a troy ounce (dlrs 9.74 per gram) compared to about dlrs 295 a troy
ounce (dlrs 10.53 per gram) in international markets.
	   Iraq prohibits taking out of the country more than 5 grams (0.17
ounces) of gold as part of regulations to prevent the flight of
wealth at a time when the country has been impoverished by U.N.
economic sanctions.

Big welcome for first Argentine president to visit since Falklands
</HEADLINE>
War &QL; 
 &UR; By MAUREEN JOHNSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Underlining how times have changed, the British
are laying on a lavish welcome for Carlos Menem, the first
Argentine president to visit since Argentina and Britain went to
war in 1982 over the Falkland Islands.
	   Trade is booming, a reconciliation service is planned at St.
Paul's Cathedral and _ something really different _ Britain's sole
Latin American ally in the Falklands War, former Chilean dictator
Gen. Augusto Pinochet, is under arrest in a London clinic.
	   Not quite everything has changed, though.
	   Margaret Thatcher, who as Conservative Party prime minister
dispatched the British fleet 8,000 miles (12,900 kms) to recapture
the wind-swept archipelago in the south Atlantic, won't be at the
reconciliation service. She has a longstanding previous engagement
out of the country, her office says.
	   And the widow of Lt. Col. Herbert Jones, the daredevil paratroop
commander killed at Goose Green _ a pivotal land battle in which
British troops who were outnumbered 2-to-1 captured 1,400 Argentine
soldiers _ has also said she is too busy to come to the service.
	   It takes place Oct. 28, the first full day of a five-day visit
in which Menem will lay a wreath for the 970 people killed _ 255 of
them British soldiers.
	   Prince Andrew, Queen Elizabeth II's son who flew combat missions
as a helicopter pilot during the 74-day war, will be there, along
with Labor Party government officials, veterans' organizations and
representatives of families of slain British and Argentine
soldiers.
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair's spokesman said Thursday that Menem's
visit will not be overshadowed by either the Falklands or the
presence nearby of 82-year-old Pinochet, under armed guard at a
clinic in London's West End.
	   British police arrested Pinochet, who was on an announced visit,
Oct. 16 at the instigation of a Spanish magistrate seeking to
extradite him on charges of murder, genocide and torture of victims
killed during his 17-year rule.
	   Linking the Menem visit and the Pinochet arrest, Lady Thatcher
said Thursday in a letter to the Times of London that it would be
``disgraceful to preach reconciliation with one, while maintaining
under arrest someone who, during that same conflict, did so much to
save so many British lives.''
	   Blair's government rejected her demand for Pinochet's immediate
release, calling the arrest a legal, not political, issue, and
objecting to the link.
	   ``President Menem is simply not General Galtieri,'' Blair's
press secretary said, referring to Leopoldo Galtieri, the military
dictator who invaded the Falklands.
	   The visit _ despite the continuing dispute over the sovereignty
of the Falklands _ reflected the ``maturity'' of Argentina's
democratically elected government, added Blair's spokesman,
speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Representatives of the 2,200 British-descended islanders also
will not be taking part in any of the ceremonies.
	   ``We are happy for the trip to take place between it strengthens
the relationship between Argentina and the United Kingdom and
therefore makes our position more secure,'' said Suki Cameron,
spokeswoman for the Falkland Island office in London. ``But we
regard it as purely a matter between the governments.''
	   Unlike the Pinochet arrest, the impending Menem visit has
received scant publicity in Britain. Before 1982, many Britons were
unaware the remote British colony existed, and the issue has, for
most, long since faded.

Germany and France signal center-left course for closer

cooperation &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SAARBRUECKEN, Germany (AP) _ Signalling the start of closer
Franco-German economic cooperation, Germany's future finance
minister and his French counterpart agreed Thursday to work
together to fight unemployment and stimulate economic growth in
Europe.
	   Speaking after a meeting in the city of Saarbruecken on the
Franco-German border, French Finance Minister Dominique
Strauss-Kahn and Germany's Finance Minister-designate Oskar
Lafontaine agreed to coordinate policy to fight Europe's high
unemployment, averaging around 8 percent.
	   France and Germany would coordinate monetary policy, taxes,
wages and budgets to achieve the goal of slashing unemployment and
stimulating growth, they said.
	   The electoral victory in September of Germany's Social Democrats
means the neighbors, Europe's two largest economies, are governed
by center-left parties that want greater government say in the
economy, including stricter controls over financial markets.
	   As a first step in the closer cooperation, Lafontaine said the
two countries would coordinate their financial budgets.
	   ``And then we'll talk more about what else is possible,''
Lafontaine said.
	   The two men called on Europe's central banks to cut interest
rates to boost growth. Germany's central bank is reluctant to lower
rates, saying Germany's key interest rate is already among the
lowest in the world.

Greek jets hit mock targets in Cyprus war games

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Greek warplanes hit mock targets in the
Nicosia area Thursday, the third day of joint Greek and Cypriot war
games that have raised new tensions on this divided Mediterranean
island.
	   The Cypriot Defense Ministry also accused Turkish aircraft of
violating Cypriot air space for the second time since the joint
maneuvers with Greece began Tuesday. Turkey denied the allegation.
	   The Defense Ministry said four F-16 fighter jets and two A-7
Corsair bombers from Greece's air force took part in the drill over
Nicosia.
	   It did not say whether the planes returned to Greece or landed
at a controversial military field near Paphos in western Cyprus. It
added that the jets would take part in further exercises Friday.
	   The six-day war games, held under the provisions of a 1993
defense pact between Cyprus and Greece, will end Sunday with a
military parade in the southern resort town of Larnaca. They
maneuvers have raised tension on the island, where Greek Cypriot
and Turkish Cypriot community are divided by a U.N. buffer zone.
	   The Defense Ministry statement Thursday said Turkish jets
invaded Cyprus air space between 11:40 a.m. and 12:35 p.m.
(0940-1035gmt), flying over Larnaca and Paphos. It gave no details.
	   In Ankara, Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Sermet Atacanli
said: ``Those allegations are totally unfounded.''
	   Both Cyprus and Greece accused Turkish craft of buzzing Greek
military aircraft and violated Greece's air space Tuesday. One of
the planes allegedly buzzed was a Greek Air Force transport plane
flying to Paphos.
	   Turkey, both Greece's NATO partner and traditional enemy, denied
it invaded Cypriot airspace on Tuesday. It had no immediate
response Thursday.
	   Turkey's forces have occupied the northern third of Cyprus since
its invasion of the island in 1974 following a coup by Greek
Cypriots who wanted to unite the island with Greece.
	   The air base in Paphos, completed in February, was built for the
use of Greek warplanes in the case of an outbreak of hostilities on
the island.
	   The Cypriot Defense Ministry said Wednesday that five Greek
naval vessels _ a submarine, a frigate, a destroyer and two torpedo
boats _ also would take part in the war games.
	   Such high-profile Greek military presence in Cyprus invariably
triggers swift response from Turkey. It dispatched fighter jets to
the northern third of the island last March in response to the
landing of Greek warplanes for the first time at the Paphos base.
	   The Greek Cypriot government is the only internationally
recognized administration on the island. A breakaway state in the
Turkish-occupied north was declared in 1983 but is recognized only
by Ankara.

U.S. envoy: No compliance yet in Kosovo

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Five days before a NATO deadline,
Western envoys said Thursday that Slobodan Milosevic has still not
complied with demands for ending the Kosovo crisis and that
continuing violence threatens the peace process.
	   In Belgrade, the government repeated claims that it has already
met a key demand of NATO and the U.N. Security Council for ending
the crackdown, which the Yugoslav president launched Feb. 28
against ethnic Albanian separatists.
	   The pro-government daily Vecernje Novosti quoted unnamed police
sources as saying all special troops sent there during the
crackdown had been withdrawn and that only those who had been there
before remained.
	   In Pristina, however, a senior U.S. envoy, Christopher Hill,
told reporters that ``we are not satisfied with the level of
compliance.'' French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said in Paris
the departure of government forces was ``very advanced but that is
not enough.''
	   There were further signs that tensions remain high in the
province, despite the agreement reached Oct. 12 between Milosevic
and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke.
	   Laura Boldrini of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, said
ethnic Albanians who returned two weeks ago to the village of
Poklek fled again this week due to intimidation by Serb police,
including gunshots fired in the air at night.
	   ``It's a never-ending story,'' Boldrini said. ``It's going ahead
very slowly in terms of (refugee) returns.''
	   International observers in the field said that after three days
of relative calm, they heard increased tank and artillery fire in
some areas.
	   Also, the ethnic Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center said
four members of an ethnic Albanian family _ three of them children
_ were killed and two wounded early Thursday when Yugoslav soldiers
fired on them near Djakovica on the Albanian border.
	   The center said the victims were trying to return to their homes
from Albania. There was no confirmation from government officials.
	   NATO has given Milosevic until Tuesday to comply with U.N.
demands or risk airstrikes. The demands include removal of all
special troops sent to Kosovo during the crackdown and allowing
tens of thousands of ethnic Albanian refugees to return to their
homes in safety.
	   Milosevic also agreed to talks with ethnic Albanians on the
future of the province, which is part of Yugoslavia's main republic
Serbia. About 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million people are Albanian,
and most want independence or self-rule.
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army has insisted it will not abandon its
goal of independence. The United States and the Europeans reject
independence but support substantial autonomy for Kosovo.
	   They fear that without substantial progress toward peace, the
ethnic Albanians will step up their attacks to provoke a response
by Milosevic.
	   ``We ask the Kosovo people and especially the armed forces,
Kosovo forces, to stop any provocations,'' said European envoy
Wolfgang Petritsch, referring to the KLA.
	   Despite the continuing tensions, international officials report
some progress toward restoring the province to normalcy. Convoys of
relief supplies have been virtually unhindered in recent weeks.
	   Two U.N. convoys totaling 16 trucks took baby food, flour,
biscuits, mattresses and other supplies to Pec and Djakovica in
western Kosovo on Thursday.
	   In Vienna, Austria, efforts to organize a 2,000-member team to
verify compliance with the peace deal appeared stalled because
would-be contributor nations are concerned about safety and want
the U.N. Security Council to endorse the plan first.
	   The operation is to be directed by the Vienna-based Organization
for Security and Cooperation, which must ask its 54 member states
to provide the personnel.
	   Hill, the U.S. envoy, said contributing nations have pledged
more than 1,500 of the verifiers so far. But Canadian Foreign
Minister Lloyd Axworthy said his government first wants a U.N.
resolution authorizing the mission as well as security for the
personnel.

Greek jets hit mock targets in Cyprus war games

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Greek warplanes hit mock targets in the
Nicosia area Thursday, the third day of joint Greek and Cypriot war
games that have increased tensions on this divided Mediterranean
island.
	   The Cypriot Defense Ministry also accused Turkish aircraft of
violating Cypriot air space for the second time since the joint
maneuvers with Greece began Tuesday. Turkey denied the allegation.
	   The Defense Ministry said four F-16 fighter jets and two A-7
Corsair bombers from Greece's air force took part in the drill over
Nicosia.
	   It did not say whether the planes returned to Greece or landed
at a controversial military field near Paphos in western Cyprus. It
added that the jets would take part in further exercises Friday.
	   The six-day war games, held under the provisions of a 1993
defense pact between Cyprus and Greece, will end Sunday with a
military parade in the southern resort town of Larnaca. The
maneuvers have raised tension on the island, where Greek Cypriot
and Turkish Cypriot community are divided by a U.N. buffer zone.
	   Turkey's forces have occupied the northern third of Cyprus since
its invasion of the island in 1974 following a coup by Greek
Cypriots who wanted to unite the island with Greece.
	   The Greek Cypriot government is the only internationally
recognized administration on the island. A breakaway state in the
Turkish-occupied north was declared in 1983 but is recognized only
by Ankara.
	   The Defense Ministry said Turkish jets invaded Cyprus air space
about midday Thursday, flying over Larnaca and Paphos. It gave no
details.
	   In Ankara, Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Sermet Atacanli
said: ``Those allegations are totally unfounded.''

Jewish suspect arrested in stabbing deaths of Palestinians
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A Jewish man affiliated with Israel's extreme
right-wing has been arrested on suspicion of carrying out a spree
of stabbings that left one Palestinian dead and six others
seriously injured, police said Thursday.
	   Police suspect that the 32-year-old man, identified in radio
reports as Yonatan Tzion Dadovich, is the serial stabber who preyed
upon Palestinians in the ultra-Orthodox neighborhood of Mea Shearim
between November 1997 and May 1998.
	   The last victim was a 50-year-old Palestinian who was walking
through Mea Shearim on his way to work.
	   Dadovich, identified with extremist right-wing movements, was
arrested on Sunday in his Jerusalem apartment, police spokesman
Shmuel Ben-Ruby said. A court-ordered publication ban on details of
the arrest was lifted Thursday.
	   Ben-Ruby did not say which group Dadovich was affiliated with.
He said the suspect has denied any connection to the stabbings.
	   Police believe that the stabbings were acts of vengeance for
Jews killed by Arabs in Jerusalem.

Wildlife group says 30 baby elephants shouldn't go home
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAT REBER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ A wildlife group on Thursday
said 30 baby elephants that are the subject of a court custody
battle should not be returned to their home in neighboring
Botswana.
	   The Rhino and Elephant Foundation said Botswana's Tuli Reserve,
where the two-to-four-year-old elephants were captured in August,
is a harsh, inhospitable place that could not support burgeoning
elephant populations.
	   The foundation belongs to a South African initiative that is
trying to develop standards for training elephants as an
alternative to culling or death by starvation.
	   African Game Services, a wildlife export farm near Pretoria, has
chained the elephants' legs and prodded them with sharp rods as
part of a ``mahout'' style training.
	   The practice has outraged international elephant experts from
Kenya, England and the United States who have flown to South Africa
as witnesses for the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals.
	   The NSPCA wants the animals released. Joyce Poole of Kenya said
Wednesday many of the elephants have abscesses on their foreheads
from being prodded with sharp nails.
	   At a press conference on Thursday, a recess day in the court
proceedings, the Rhino and Elephant Foundation said southern Africa
has 200,000 elephants that were reproducing at 7 percent a year.
	   ``Their numbers are such that they are now destroying their
habitat, and in the process causing the extinction of other
species,'' said director Andrew McKenzie. ``What we see in Tuli
today will be the situation throughout the region if we do not find
a solution fast.''
	   After years of lobbying for permission to trade in live
elephants or ivory from growing herds, southern African countries
got a limited go-ahead last year from the U.N. Convention on Trade
in Endangered Species.
	   The CITES rule allows limited trade in live elephants for
educational purposes. East African countries opposed the move.
	   McKenzie dismissed the idea that the court case symbolized an
argument within Africa about elephant management.
	   But Kenya's Poole said a court ruling in favor of the game
farm's continued custody would trigger an international uproar that
would tarnish the image of South Africa and Botswana.
	   The captured elephants were destined for zoos in Switzerland and
Germany and a safari park in China.

German police arrest ethnic Albanians from Kosovo for illegal

entry &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ERFURT, Germany (AP) _ Police detained 21 ethnic Albanians from
Kosovo Thursday, and arrested the driver suspected of smuggling
them into the country illegally.
	   German authorities reported apprehending more than 700 people,
most of them from Yugoslavia's troubled Kosovo province, entering
the country illegally between Friday and Monday. This was the
second group reported detained since then.
	   The latest arrests came after witnesses reported that a truck
had fled the scene of an accident at a rest stop along the autobahn
near Erfurt in eastern Germany, police said.
	   Police tracking down the truck were told by other witnesses that
the group of Albanians had jumped out the back door of the vehicle
in Erfurt. All 21 men, ages 20-40, were apprehended, police said.
	   The German driver of the truck was later stopped and arrested as
he drove on the autobahn near Erfurt, police said. He is being held
on suspicion of smuggling refugees.

Cup Winners: Locomotiv defeats Braga 3-1
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Dmitry Bulykin scored twice in the first half
Thursday to lead Lokomotiv Moscow to a 3-1 victory over Braga of
Portugal in a UEFA Cup Winners Cup second round, first leg game.
	   Lokomotiv, semifinalists in last season's tournament, dominated
throughout. Bulykin opened scoring in the 22nd minute on a header
from a cross from the left, and kicked in his second 13 minutes
later when the ball bounced off a Braga player.
	   Braga had only one scoring opportunity in the first half, when
Karoglan Mladen of Croatia fired from 18 meters, but Russian
goalkeeper Ruslan Nigmatullin saved the goal.
	   Brazil's Odair Borges scored the only goal for Braga in the
first minute of the second half on a penalty kick from 55 meters
(yards) when the ball bounced off the ground and Nigmatullin
couldn't help his team.
	   Igor Chugainov scored the third goal for Lokomotiv on a penalty
kick in the 60th minute when Alexander Borodyuk was kicked down in
the box.
	   Albert Sarkisian, who came in as a substitute, missed a prime
scoring opportunity for Lokomotive in the 88th minute when he found
himself in a one-on-one position with the Braga goalkeeper, Silva
Quim, who was sent off with a red card for holding the ball outside
the penalty box.
	   Playing a 10-man squad, Braga hardly stopped Lokomotiv in the
last minutes of the game.
	   About 8,000 fans, including 200 from Portugal, were at Lokomotiv
Stadium.

Researchers look at fungus as key to killing narcotics plants
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GEORGE GEDDA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Government researchers are testing a fungus
they believe will kill narcotics plants without harming other crops
or animal life, a potential breakthrough aimed at cutting foreign
production of illegal drugs headed for the United States.
	   Congress has approved dlrs 23 million for further research into
what are known as ``mycoherbicides,'' soil-borne fungi capable of
eradicating plants that provide the raw material for cocaine,
heroin and marijuana.
	   The Clinton administration is far from unanimous about the
innovation. Skeptics say more testing must be done to prove the
effectiveness and safety of the technology and winning the support
of governments of drug-producing South American countries _
Colombia, Peru and Bolivia _ won't be easy. None has been briefed
extensively, and none has taken a public position.
	   The administration will get to sound out Colombian President
Andres Pastrana next week when he comes on a state visit to
Washington. The three South American countries are the only ones
anywhere that produce the base plant for cocaine.
	   The legislation was guided through Congress by Sen. Mike DeWine
and Rep. Bill McCollum. In addition to mycoherbicide research, the
legislation provides for promotion of alternative crops to
narcotics plants for South American farmers.
	   ``These micro-organisms have the potential to cripple drug crops
before they are even harvested,'' DeWine said.
	   McCollum said the new crop eradication technology is much safer
than traditional strategies. ``All of the indications are that this
has the potential for making a big difference in the drug war,'' he
said. ``This could be the silver bullet.''
	   House Foreign Relations Committee chairman Benjamin Gilman said
the technology is ``extremely effective, not costly, doesn't affect
the environment and is a good way of eradicating coca.''
	   The United States has spent billions of dollars over the years
with little success in trying the slay the drug dragon. The ``just
say no'' campaign of the 1980s has been followed up by a
government-sponsored media ad blitz warning people of the dangers
of drugs. Chemical sprays and interdiction efforts have been used
to cut supply. Still, an estimated 6.7 million addicts live in the
country, and experts estimate that 13 million Americans have used
drugs in the last month.
	   U.S. officials believe South American countries can be persuaded
to go along with the program only if farmers have plausible
alternatives to narcotics plants. As one promising alternative,
officials are touting chocolate, derived from cacao trees, because
it is a suitable alternative for South American small farmers and
the global market in the coming years is expected to be tight.
	   Experiments by Agriculture Department scientists focus on
isolating the mycoherbicides that narcotics plants produce
naturally. If, for example, a coca plant is doused with the fungi,
it wilts, and decades must pass before the area is again suitable
for growing coca. In addition, beans, corn or other crops grown
nearby are unaffected. Environmental Protection Agency scientists
believe no harm would come to humans or animals as well. The same
technologies can be applied to eradicate plants used for marijuana
and heroin.
	   Advocates and skeptics agree that the program will go nowhere
without the support of the drug-producing countries.
	   Unless the political groundwork is properly laid, farmers'
unions or environmental groups in the coca-growing countries could
come out in opposition, nullifying the possibility of cooperation,
officials say. They also are bracing themselves for allegations
that Washington is planning biological warfare against these
countries.
	   The costs of drug addiction are obvious: 14,218 drug-related
deaths in 1995, and the price to society each year is dlrs 67
billion, according to the Office of National Drug Control Policy.
President Bill Clinton has set a goal of a 50 percent decrease in
drug addiction in 10 years, but advocates of the new crop
eradication technologies believe that goal is too modest.

Fire destroys Ottoman palace in old Cairo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A fire gutted a gem of Muslim architecture,
the Palace of Musafirkhana, in Old Cairo on Thursday.
	   The blaze began when residents set fire to piles of trash in
front of the 18th Century Ottoman palace, police officials said.
	   The wooden gate caught fire and the flames quickly spread to the
palace itself, the officials said.
	   It took firefighters five hours to put out the blaze, which
devoured the rich woodwork of the palace and left only the walls
standing.
	   Four neighboring apartments were also destroyed.
	   Two firefighters were treated for smoke inhalation.
	   It is not uncommon in Egypt for people in low-income districts
to burn trash.
	   The Musafirkhana was built in 1779-88 and is the birthplace of
Khedive Ismail, the ruler of Egypt at the time of the construction
of the Suez Canal.
	   The palace featured windows of wooden screens overlooking a
courtyard fountain, entire walls paneled with engraved wood, and a
well where the royal family is said to have disposed of corpses
after secret executions.
	   But, as with many of Egypt's Islamic monuments, the building had
been allowed to deteriorate. The government had allotted 15 million
Egyptian pounds (dlrs 4.4 million) for its restoration, Egypt's
Middle East News Agency said.
	   The agency quoted the chief official for Islamic and Coptic
Monuments, El-Sayed Abdullah el-Attar, as saying Thursday that the
palace would still be restored.

<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) _ Pete Sampras bounced back to top form at the
Lyon Grand Prix on Thursday, firing 10 aces in a decisive 6-2, 6-4
second-round win over Australia's Todd Woodbridge.
	   The world No. 1, who struggled to beat compatriot Todd Martin in
three sets in Wednesday's first round, was back to his efficient
best as he reached the quarterfinals of the dlrs 750,000 event,
which he won three times in the early '90s.
	   ``I felt much better today,'' he said. ``I could see much better
and was hitting the ball more cleanly. Todd Martin also has a bit
more power in his serve (than Woodbridge.)''
	   Sampras broke Woodbridge's serve in the first game, benefiting
from a fortunate deflection off the net at break point. But he
needed no luck when he broke again while leading 3-1, firing a
stunning cross-court backhand past a bemused Woodbridge to win the
game.
	   Sampras hit an ace on the only occasion that Woodbridge, ranked
62nd, reached break point, and went on to win in 1 hour, 12
minutes.
	   No. 3 seed Marcelo Rios also moved easily to the last eight,
beating Nicolas Escude of France 6-2, 6-3 in 59 minutes.
	   In other matches, Spain's Alex Corretja, looking for the form
that took him to this year's French Open final, survived a tough
second-set scare to beat Romania's Andrei Pavel 6-4, 2-6, 6-3.
	   Corretja, seeded fourth here and ranked seventh in the world,
made a vital service break in the sixth game of the final set, when
Pavel hit into the net.
	   In the next game, Pavel failed to covert on a break point, and
the Barcelona-born Corretja held on in his remaining service games
to win the match, qualifying for the final eight.
	   In the first set, Corretja stormed back from 2-4 behind with a
series of blistering forehand returns.
	   But the 23-year-old Pavel, ranked 73rd in the world, was a
revelation in the second set, breaking the Spaniard's serve twice
to take the set 6-2.
	   ``It wasn't pretty tennis today,'' Corretja said. ``The match
was really tough for me, especially in the second set, when Pavel
hit four consecutive winners at one stage.
	   ``But it is the first time that I have won two successive
matches indoor on the tour, so I am very pleased.''
	   In the next round, Corretja will face surprise quarterfinalist
Olivier Delaitre.
	   The 31-year-old French qualifier, ranked a lowly 227th, lost the
first set to Gianluca Pozzi, but stormed back to take 10
consecutive games and win 1-6, 6-0, 6-4.
	   Germany's Tommy Haas squeezed past Fabrice Santoro, the
defending champion here and No. 8 seed, 2-6, 6-3, 7-5, in just
under two hours.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Lawyers for Gen. Augusto Pinochet filed a court
motion Thursday contending British police acted illegally in
accepting a Spanish warrant seeking the extradition of the former
Chilean dictator.
	   Lord Justice Konrad Schiemann set a Monday hearing on the High
Court motion and refused to let lawyers make any arguments during a
brief hearing.
	   A Spanish magistrate is seeking to extradite Pinochet to face
charges of murder, torture and genocide.
	   Earlier, an appeal by Margaret Thatcher for the release of
Pinochet angered left-wing lawmakers and underlined a political
dilemma for the Labor Party government.
	   Lady Thatcher, Conservative prime minister from 1979-1990, said
Pinochet should be returned home forthwith both because he
supported Britain during the 1982 war against Argentina to reclaim
the Falkland Islands and because his arrest endangers Chile's new
democracy.
	   ``There were indeed abuses of human rights in Chile and acts of
violence on both sides of the political divide,'' Lady Thatcher
wrote in a letter to The Times of London. ``However, the people of
Chile, through successively elected democratic governments, have
determined how they should come to terms with their past.''
	   Pinochet, 82, remains under police guard in the expensive London
clinic where he was arrested Oct. 16 at the instigation of a
Spanish magistrate.
	   The warrant cited 94 victims, but could be broadened to include
some 3,000 people who were killed or disappeared during his
17-year-rule.

<TEXT>
	   VENICE, Italy (AP) _ One of Venice's oldest noble families was
robbed of the jewel of its art collection: a painting by Canaletto
valued at dlrs 2.5 million.
	   Canaletto (Giovanni Antonio Canal) was the most famous painter
of Venetian scenes of the 18th century and his works hang in many
of the world's major museums.
	   The ANSA news agency said Thursday that the oil painting was
stolen from the historic palazzo of the late Count Alvise
Giustiniani during the night, along with several lesser works.
	   The stolen painting, Il Fonteghetto della Farina, was signed by
the artist and is one of Canaletto's well-known works, ANSA said.
It said the painting is worth around dlrs 2.5 million and was the
only Canaletto in a private collection left in Venice.
	   The report said the palazzo is used only occasionally by his
adopted daughter and does not have an alarm system. It was empty at
the time of the theft, ANSA said.
	   ``It was a slick job,'' said the investigating magistrate,
Bianca Maria Cotronei.
	   Many of Canaletto's patrons were English collectors and from
1746 to 1755, he worked in Britain, where his paintings are in the
royal collection. In Britain, Canaletto expanded his repertory to
include scenes of London and English country manors.

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Kazakstan agreed Thursday to ship up to
10 million metric tons (70 million barrels) of Caspian Sea oil
through Georgia and to help build oil terminals in Georgian ports.
	   Kazak Prime Minister Nurlan Balgimbayev, on a three-day visit to
Georgia, visited the port city of Poti and a planned port at Supsa.
At a briefing in Tbilisi, the capital, he was asked which oil
pipeline Kazakstan would choose to transport its oil.
	   ``There will be so much oil that we are not speaking about only
one pipeline,'' he said, adding that Kazakstan intended to use
pipelines through Georgia, Russia and other countries, possibly
including Turkey and China.
	   Georgia's state minister, Vasha Lordkipanidze, said Kazakstan
and Georgia have a strong legal basis for improving bilateral
relations, with 61 agreements between the two countries signed,
including the oil agreement.
	   ``Our relations are developing successfully,'' he told
reporters.
	   He said the two sides had also agreed that Georgia would buy up
to 400,000 metric tons (440,000 tons) of grain from Kazakstan on
favorable terms, up from 40,000 tons (44,000 tons) previously.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Dmitry Bulykin scored twice in the first half
Thursday to lead Lokomotiv Moscow to a 3-1 victory over Braga of
Portugal in a UEFA Cup Winners Cup second round, first leg game.
	   Lokomotiv, semifinalists in last season's tournament, dominated
throughout. Bulykin opened scoring in the 22nd minute on a header
from a cross from the left, and kicked in his second 13 minutes
later when the ball bounced off a Braga player.
	   Braga had only one scoring opportunity in the first half, when
Karoglan Mladen of Croatia fired from 18 meters, but Russian
goalkeeper Ruslan Nigmatullin saved the goal.
	   Brazil's Odair Borges scored the only goal for Braga in the
first minute of the second half on a free kick from 55 meters
(yards) when the ball bounced off the ground and Nigmatullin
couldn't help his team.
	   Igor Chugainov scored the third goal for Lokomotiv on a penalty
kick in the 60th minute when Alexander Borodyuk was kicked down in
the box.
	   Albert Sarkisian, who came in as a substitute, missed a prime
scoring opportunity for Lokomotive in the 88th minute when he found
himself in a one-on-one position with the Braga goalkeeper, Silva
Quim, who was sent off with a red card for holding the ball outside
the penalty box.
	   Playing a 10-man squad, Braga hardly stopped Lokomotiv in the
last minutes of the game.
	   About 8,000 fans, including 200 from Portugal, were at Lokomotiv
Stadium.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Five days before a NATO deadline,
Western envoys said Thursday that Slobodan Milosevic has still not
complied with demands for ending the Kosovo crisis and that
continuing violence threatens the peace process.
	   In Belgrade, the government repeated claims that it has already
met a key demand of NATO and the U.N. Security Council for ending
the crackdown, which the Yugoslav president launched Feb. 28
against ethnic Albanian separatists.
	   The pro-government daily Vecernje Novosti quoted unnamed police
sources as saying all special troops sent there during the
crackdown had been withdrawn and that only those who had been there
before remained.
	   In Pristina, however, a senior U.S. envoy, Christopher Hill,
told reporters that ``we are not satisfied with the level of
compliance.'' French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said in Paris
the departure of government forces was ``very advanced but that is
not enough.''
	   U.S. Defense Department spokesman Kenneth Bacon underscored the
dissatisfaction, calling for continued withdrawals from Kosovo.
	   ``There is more to be done in terms of withdrawing to
garrison,'' Bacon told reporters in Washington. ``All of the ...
paramilitary police are not out. And there are still roadblocks
that we don't believe are proper.''
	   He also said more weapons in Kosovo must be stored as well.

Former top Siberian officials arrested on corruption charges
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A former deputy governor in Siberia was arrested
Thursday on suspicion of conspiring with another former deputy
governor to embezzle territorial funds, a news agency reported.
	   Valentina Cherezova was accused of helping Vladimir Kuzmin in
the alleged embezzlement scheme, according to Interfax. It was not
clear from the report whether Kuzmin had already been arrested.
	   Both are former deputy governors in the Krasnoyarsk region, now
headed by Gov. Alexander Lebed. A third top regional official,
Valery Petrov of the Finance Ministry's territorial board, was also
arrested Thursday on charges of bribe-taking, Interfax said.
	   Lebed insisted that the arrests were not political. ``We are not
settling scores with the former administration,'' he said,
according to Interfax.

Success of austerity measures depends on runoff elections outcome
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STAN LEHMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ With the country already bracing for
belt-tightening measures, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's
efforts to halt Brazil's growing economic turmoil now depend on the
results of this weekend's gubernatorial runoff elections.
	   Expected to be unveiled next week, the measures are aimed at
curbing a budget deficit estimated at 7 percent of gross domestic
product and restoring investor confidence in the world's
ninth-largest economy.
	   The measures are also expected to slash public spending and will
probably include new income, fuel, and bank transaction taxes.
	   Buffeted by the world financial crisis that began more than a
year ago in Southeast Asia, Brazil has seen its foreign reserves
fall below dlrs 50 billion from dlrs 70 billion at the end of July.
	   On Sunday voters return to the polls in 12 states and in the
Federal District of Brasilia. The outcome will likely determine how
successful Cardoso will be in getting Congress to approve his
deficit-cutting plan.
	   ``The influence governors have on their congressional blocs is
overwhelming,'' said University of Sao Paulo political scientist
Eduardo Kugelmas.
	   He mentioned the runoff elections in the states of Sao Paulo,
Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro and Rio Grande do Sul, where Cardoso
opponents stand a good chance of winning.
	   ``If they win, the president will face a tough uphill battle,''
Kugelmas said.
	   Together, those four states occupy 200 of the 513 seats in the
Chamber of Deputies and account for 67 percent of the country's
gross domestic product.
	   Besides the sway they hold over Congress, Cardoso must also rely
on state governors to hold down their spending, an important factor
in the country's deficit.
	   ``The problem is that none of candidates in Sunday's elections,
nor any of the 14 elected in the first ballot on Oct. 4 wants to be
identified with unpopular austerity measures,'' said Kugelmas. ``So
they promise to spend more money on schools, hospitals and public
work projects.''
	   Sao Paulo, Brazil's industrial and financial powerhouse, is
perhaps the state most critical to the success of Cardoso's
austerity plans.
	   With more than 34 million inhabitants, it alone accounts for
nearly 36 percent of Brazil's GDP and 70 congressional seats.
	   While incumbent governor Mario Covas, a Cardoso ally who is
seeking re-election, has committed himself to the austerity
measures, Kugelmas is not so sure of Covas opponent Paulo Maluf.
	   ``If Maluf wins, he will use his victory as a launching pad to
the presidency in 2003,'' Kugelmas said. ``And that means he will
try to stay as far away as possible from any austerity measure.''

Britain warns Cyprus it will set ``boat people'' free
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ British authorities warned Cyprus on
Thursday that they would release 75 illegal immigrants who came
ashore at one of their military bases unless the island's
government reaches an agreement on their care.
	   The immigrants, who are said to be mainly from Iraq, arrived at
the British base of Akrotiri, southern Cyprus, on Oct. 9 after
their boat developed engine problems.
	   They had paid thousands of dollars to be taken from Lebanon to
Italy, the base authorities said.
	   Britain and Cyprus have been locked in a diplomatic row over who
should assume responsibility for them. Cyprus insists it has no
obligation to care for the immigrants, who include 24 children, as
they landed at one of the two sovereign bases that Britain has
maintained since it granted Cyprus independence in 1960.
	   The British also disclaim responsibility. In a statement to the
official Cyprus News Agency, British bases spokesman Captain Jon
Brown said: ``If they are identified as refugees, Britain has no
legal obligation to send them to the United Kingdom and will have
to release them.''
	   The threat to release them effectively means allowing the
immigrants to seek work and shelter in Cyprus as there are no
immigration checkpoints separating the British bases from the rest
of Cyprus.
	   The immigrants have no travel documents. Officials from the U.N.
High Commissioner for Refugees have visited them to try to
establish their nationalities and whether they qualify for refugee
status.
	   Last June, Cyprus rescued more than 100 would-be immigrants to
Europe, mostly of African and Middle Eastern citizenship, from a
ship that had been drifting in the Mediterranean for nine days.
	   The government has deported about 35 of the immigrants. The rest
are being screened by the UNHCR to determine their fate.
	   The government says the upkeep of the refugees has so far cost
more than one million pounds (dlrs 2.06 million).

Top Russian officials call for closer relations with ASEAN, EU
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Top Russian officials called Thursday for closer
relations with both the ASEAN countries and the European Union as a
way of bolstering the country's collapsed economy.
	   Deputy Foreign Minister Grigory Karasin met with ambassadors of
ASEAN member nations and told them Russia was prepared to expand
its economic ties with Southeast Asia to help ailing economies both
there and in Russia, according to Interfax.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Bulgak met with the head of the
European Commission's office in Moscow, Ottokar Hahn, and discussed
prospects for closer relations with the EU.
	   The two were meeting to plan the agenda for a Russia-EU summit
in Vienna next week, Interfax said.

Swiss president meets with Blair over European Union membership
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prime Minister Tony Blair met with Swiss president
Flavio Cotti on Thursday to discuss Switzerland's relationship with
the European Union and the world economy.
	   The Downing Street meeting, which lasted less than an hour, was
described as ''warm and friendly'' by Blair's spokesman.
	   The two leaders discussed Switzerland's latest efforts to remove
the stumbling blocks the country has faced in its goal to gain EU
membership.
	   Last month, Swiss voters approved a controversial new pollution
tax on trucks. That was part of a compromise deal with Brussels
which also saw Switzerland increase the weight limit for trucks.
Switzerland hoped to use the duty on trucks to offset the
environmental impact of allowing heavier vehicles on its roads.
	   Switzerland has pursued bilateral accords with Brussels as a way
of furthering its membership ambitions and ensuring that Swiss
companies gain equal access to vast EU markets.
	   Franz Egle, spokesman for Cotti, said the Swiss leader asked for
Britain's support, and was assured that Blair backs the agreement
thus far.
	   The two leaders also discussed the single European currency, and
the international monetary crisis.
	   Because Switzerland is not a member of the 15-nation EU, there
are fears that if the euro runs into difficulties, then the Swiss
franc may become a safe haven. This would force up the Swiss franc,
making vital Swiss exports more expensive.
	   The euro will be launched Jan. 1 in 11 of the EU nations, but
will not replace national currencies for three more years. Britain
has decided not to join the single currency at its launch.

Aggasi cruises to quarterfinals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSTRAVA, Czech Republic (AP) _ Second seed Andre Agassi of the
United States outplayed Magnus Norman of Sweden 6-2, 7-5 Thursday
to advance to the quarterfinals of the dlrs 1 million Czech Indoor
ATP tennis tournament.
	   Agassi confirmed his role as the tournament's favorite, breaking
Norman's serve in the first and fifth game of the first set despite
playing in a practice tempo.
	   Norman improved his performance in the second set and both
players held on to their serves until the tenth game, but Agassi
finally managed to break the Swede, winning the match in straight
sets.
	   In another tie involving a Top 10 player, home favorite Martin
Damm rallied to beat fourth seed Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia 3-6,
6-3, 6-2.
	   Kafelnikov, No. 10 in the world, broke Damm's serve in the
fourth game and comfortably won the first set, but gradually grew
nervous as Damm started to risk on the net and played several
miraculous balls.
	   Kafelnikov tried to stick to his aggressive tennis, but Damm,
the only remaining Czech in the tournament, improved both his serve
and returns and eventually won the match.
	   ``It would be nice if I could repeat my 1996 result here, that
is semifinals,'' Damm said after the match.
	   In the next round, Damm will face Wayne Black of Zimbabwe who
beat the 1996 Czech Indoor champion David Prinosil of Germany 3-6,
6-2, 6-4.
	   Black, ranked 92nd on the ATP Tour, crushed the Czech-born
Prinosil with a dashing serve, often faster than 200 kilometers
(125 miles) per hour.
	   In other Thursday action, Andrei Medvedev of the Ukraine
defeated third seed Karol Kucera of Slovakia 6-4, 6-7 (4-7) 6-4,
and Jan Kroslak of Slovakia defeated Guillaume Raoux of France 7-5,
6-2.

	   JESSE, Nigeria (AP) _ No one will be arrested in connection with
the gasoline pipeline that erupted into an inferno over the
weekend, a government official said Thursday, but Nigeria's state
petroleum corporation has reportedly demanded otherwise.
	   The explosion and fire tore through Jesse on Saturday, while up
to 1,000 people were trying to collect gasoline spilling from the
damaged government-owned pipeline. At least 700 people were killed,
state radio has said.
	   ``There is absolutely no truth in rumors that anybody will be
arrested in connection with this,'' Walter Fejhabo, the military
administrator of Delta State, told local leaders in Jesse.
	   A newspaper report, however, said Nigeria's state petroleum
corporation would ask for charges to be filed.
	   ``Anyone implicated in the vandalisation of the oil pipeline
leading to last Saturday's fire tragedy is to be arraigned,''
Dalhatu Bayero, chief executive of the Nigeria National Petroleum
Corporation, told the Vanguard newspaper.
	   The article indicated the company would demand that charges be
pressed against people implicated in opening the pipeline, not the
hundreds who later came to scoop up the gasoline.
	   It was not immediately clear whether the powerful petroleum
company could force the military administrator _ the equivalent of
a governor in Nigeria's military regime _ to reverse his decision.
	   Nigeria's ruling junta has not said if it has plans to file
charges, though it issued a statement Wednesday saying the incident
was sparked because of ``the greed of some of the people in the
community.''
	   State radio said Wednesday that the death toll had reached 700,
but local officials expected it to go higher. J.I. Ogude, the
village chief of Jesse, estimated that 1,000 people had been
killed.
	   Thursday afternoon, local Red Cross workers picked up the last
of the body parts that still littered the scene of the explosion
and threw them into the still-flaring fire. One Red Cross worker,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said the body parts were burned
because the mass grave had been covered over Wednesday and fears
were increasing that the rotting remains could become a health
hazard.

Jewish suspect arrested in stabbings, one fatal, of Palestinians
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS overline to reflect one fatal stabbing &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A Jewish man affiliated with Israel's extreme
right-wing has been arrested on suspicion of carrying out a spree
of stabbings that left one Palestinian dead and six others
seriously injured, police said Thursday.
	   Police suspect that the 32-year-old man, identified by radio
reports as Yonatan Tzion Dadovich, is the serial stabber who preyed
upon Palestinians in the ultra-Orthodox neighborhood of Mea Shearim
between November 1997 and May 1998.
	   The last victim was a 50-year-old Palestinian who was walking
through Mea Shearim on his way to work.
	   Dadovich, identified with extremist right wing movements, was
arrested on Sunday in his Jerusalem apartment, police spokesman
Shmuel Ben-Ruby said. A court-ordered publication ban on details of
the arrest was lifted Thursday.
	   Ben-Ruby did not say which group Dadovich was affiliated with
and said the suspect has denied any connection to the stabbings.
	   Police at first suspected criminal motives behind the stabbings,
but later found materials at the scene of subsequent stabbings that
indicated the assailant was targeting Arabs, Ben-Ruby said.
Ben-Ruby said the physical evidence plus additional materials found
at the suspect's apartment were being examined at police
laboratories.
	   Police believe that the stabbings were acts of vengeance for
Jews killed by Arabs in Jerusalem.

Johnson likely to be hired by Dodgers

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Davey Johnson was headed to California on
Thursday to speak with the Los Angeles Dodgers about their
managerial job that is his for the taking, The Associated Press
learned.
	   However, no agreement had been reached and no news conference
was scheduled yet although a source close to the situation said the
team was confident Johnson would be its next manager.
	   Johnson was scheduled to arrive in late afternoon and meet with
Dodgers team president Bob Graziano and general manager Kevin
Malone.
	   ``There's a good possibility Bob and Kevin will meet with Davey
later today, but as of right now, the Dodgers do not have a
manager,'' director of publicity Derrick Hall said.
	   Citing team and baseball sources, the Los Angeles Daily News
reported today that Johnson, former manager of the New York Mets,
Cincinnati Reds and Baltimore Orioles, would be offered the job.
	   When reached on Thursday, Malone would not say whether the
report was true.
	   ``I can't comment,'' Malone said. ``I can't comment on
speculation. We're going to speak with (Dodger owners) today. We're
going to discuss the managerial position, and we're going to
proceed from that point.''
	   Johnson, 55, and Kevin Kennedy, an ESPN commentator who has
managed the Texas Rangers and Boston Red Sox, were the leading
contenders for the job after Montreal's Felipe Alou turned it down,
opting to remain with the Expos.
	   Johnson has a career record of 985-727. He managed the Mets for
six full seasons before being fired early in the 1990 season. He
had an overall record of 595-417 with the Mets including 108-54 in
1986, when they won the World Series.
	   Johnson managed the Reds to a 204-172 record from 1993-95.
Cincinnati was in first place in the National League Central
Division with a 66-48 record when the players' strike ended the
1994 season, and won the division title in 1995 with an 85-59
record.
	   Johnson then managed the Orioles to an 88-74 record in 1996 and
a 98-64 record in 1997, when Baltimore won the AL East
championship. Malone was the Orioles' assistant general manager
during those years.
	   Johnson left the Orioles following the 1997 season after
disagreements with owner Peter Angelos, and was out of baseball
this year.
	   In 10 full seasons, teams managed by Johnson won four division
titles and never finished lower than second. His .575 winning
percentage ranks 11th all-time among managers with 1,000 or more
games.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Five days before a NATO deadline,
Western envoys said Thursday that President Slobodan Milosevic has
still not complied with demands for ending the Kosovo crisis and
that continuing violence threatens the peace process.
	   In Belgrade, the Yugoslav government repeated claims that it has
already met a key demand of NATO and the U.N. Security Council for
ending the crackdown, which Milosevic launched Feb. 28 against
ethnic Albanian separatists.
	   The pro-government daily Vecernje Novosti quoted unidentified
police sources as saying all special troops sent there during the
crackdown had been withdrawn and that only those who had been there
before remained.
	   In the Kosovo capital Pristina, however, U.S. envoy Christopher
Hill told reporters that ``we are not satisfied with the level of
compliance.'' French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said in Paris
the departure of government forces was ``very advanced but that is
not enough.''
	   U.S. Defense Department spokesman Kenneth Bacon underscored the
dissatisfaction, calling for continued withdrawals from Kosovo.
	   ``There is more to be done,'' Bacon said in Washington. ``All of
the ... paramilitary police are not out. And there are still
roadblocks that we don't believe are proper.''
	   He also said more weapons in Kosovo must be stored as well.
	   There were further signs that tensions remain high in the
province, despite the agreement reached Oct. 12 between Milosevic
and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke.
	   Laura Boldrini of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said
ethnic Albanians who returned two weeks ago to the village of
Poklek fled again this week due to intimidation by Serb police,
including gunshots fired in the air at night. Serbia is the
dominant republic of Yugoslavia.
	   ``It's a never-ending story,'' Boldrini said. ``It's going ahead
very slowly in terms of (refugee) returns.''
	   International observers in the field said that after three days
of relative calm, they heard increased tank and artillery fire in
some areas.
	   Also, the ethnic Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center said
four members of an ethnic Albanian family _ three of them children
_ were killed and two wounded early Thursday when Yugoslav soldiers
fired on them near Djakovica on the Albanian border.
	   The center said the victims were trying to return to their homes
from Albania. There was no confirmation from government officials.
	   NATO has given Milosevic until Tuesday to comply with U.N.
demands or risk airstrikes. The demands include removal of all
special troops sent to Kosovo during the crackdown and allowing
tens of thousands of ethnic Albanian refugees to return safely to
their homes.
	   Milosevic also agreed to talks with ethnic Albanians on the
future of the province. About 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million
people are Albanian, and most want independence or self-rule.
	   The rebel Kosovo Liberation Army has insisted it will not
abandon its goal of independence. The United States and the
Europeans reject independence but support substantial autonomy for
Kosovo.
	   They fear that without substantial progress toward peace, the
ethnic Albanians will step up their attacks to provoke a response
by Milosevic.
	   ``We ask the Kosovo people and especially the armed forces,
Kosovo forces, to stop any provocations,'' said European envoy
Wolfgang Petritsch.
	   Despite the continuing tensions, international officials report
some progress toward restoring normalcy. Convoys of relief supplies
have been virtually unhindered in recent weeks.
	   Two U.N. convoys totaling 16 trucks took baby food, flour,
biscuits, mattresses and other supplies to Pec and Djakovica in
western Kosovo on Thursday.
	   In Vienna, Austria, efforts to organize a 2,000-member team to
verify compliance with the peace deal appeared stalled because
would-be contributor nations, including Canada, are concerned about
safety and want the U.N. Security Council to endorse the plan
first.
	   The operation is to be directed by the Vienna-based Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which must ask its 54
member states to provide the personnel.

Recovering Yankee slugger promotes cancer research

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Darryl Strawberry took a turn at bat for the
American Cancer Society in his first public appearance since being
released from the hospital after undergoing surgery for colon
cancer.
	   The 36-year-old Yankee slugger was released from a hospital last
Friday and had remained at home before he turned up Wednesday at a
midtown sporting goods store, which is selling dlrs 3.99 ``Darryl
Strawberry towels,'' with dlrs 1 from each going to cancer
research.
	   ``Darryl Strawberry has stepped up to the plate so many times
over the years in critical situations, and today he steps up to the
plate on behalf of the American Cancer Society and its efforts to
get people to learn about colon cancer, to learn about ways of
early detection,'' said Ralph Destino, chairman of the New York
City chapter.
	   On Oct. 3, doctors removed a tumor and a 16-inch (40.7-cm)
section of Strawberry's large intestine. They said he must undergo
chemotherapy after he returns next week to California, where he
grew up.
	   Strawberry said he had continued to play baseball for two months
despite not feeling well, thinking that ``if it's not an injury I
can see or feel, I'm not going to do anything about it.''
	   He credited his wife, Charisse, with insisting that he get the
checkup that revealed the cancer. The lanky slugger visibly lost
weight on the hospital's liquid diet.
	   ``I'm very fortunate. I was very lucky to get in at an early
stage and realize the problem that I was having,'' said Strawberry,
calling that a lesson for others.
	   ``The best thing I can do is try to let people understand that
things do happen, and it can happen to you,'' he said. ``The
doctors have educated me very well about this disease.''
	   And since the Yankees swept the San Diego Padres with a 3-0
victory in Game 4 on Wednesday night, Strawberry was getting ready
to celebrate with his teammates.
	   ``The boss (Yankee owner George Steinbrenner) called me
yesterday to tell me to get ready for the parade,'' said
Strawberry, referring to the ticker-tape parade that was scheduled
for Friday.

Iraqi defector tells CIA about Saddam's sanction-busting network
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ An important Iraqi defector gave valuable
information to the United States about a business network run by
Saddam Hussein's family aimed at bypassing U.N. economic sanctions,
dissidents and officials said Thursday.
	   Abbas Al-Janabi, who was the personal secretary of Saddam's
elder son, Odai, defected to the West last spring and spent three
months in the United States being debriefed by CIA officials, Iraqi
dissidents said on condition of anonymity.
	   They said al-Janabi gave the CIA a list of the phony companies
controlled by Saddam's family and names of persons involved in oil
and business deals with Iraq.
	   The list of the companies in the Middle East, southeast Asia and
Europe could provide the most complete picture yet of Baghdad's
efforts to evade the sweeping sanctions imposed by the United
Nations after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Al-Janabi revealed some details about the covert activities in
an interview with the London-based Arabic newspaper, Al-Hayat. The
last installment of the three-part interview appeared Thursday.
	   Al-Janabi said Odai has 50 small ships for smuggling oil through
Iran and a fleet of road tankers to smuggle fuel and oil to Turkey.
Together, the operations earn Odai hundreds of million of dollars,
according to the report.
	   Western intelligence officials told The Associated Press that
al-Janabi gave the CIA evidence that can be used against Saddam and
his inner circle in some future attempt to bring the Iraqi leaders
to trial as war criminals.
	   Al-Janabi said he witnessed many instances of killing and
torture that Saddam and his sons, Odai and Qusai, carried out
personally, the officials said. They spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   Thursday's al-Hayat quoted al-Janabi as saying that Odai killed
two of his aides on grounds of negligence.
	   In one case, he saw Odai forcing a bodyguard to drink three
bottles of gin while he beat him with a club.
	   Al-Janabi said he himself was tortured by Odai who accused him
of siding with a businessman negotiating a cigarette deal.
	   But al-Janabi told the CIA more about Saddam's involvement in
killings and torture cases, which he refused to divulge in the
newspaper interview, the officials said.
	   Al-Janabi, who has joined an Iraqi opposition group backed by
the CIA, is believed to be in hiding in London.
	   In the interview, he confirmed reports that Saddam ordered the
slaying of his two sons-in-law after they returned to Iraq in
February 1996 following a brief defection.
	   Saddam Kamel al-Majid and his brother Lt. Gen. Hussein Kamel
al-Majid had fled in August 1995 to Jordan where they revealed
significant information about Iraq's weapons program.
	   Saddam ordered the death of the two men and Odai, Qusai and
Saddam's cousin, Ali Hassan al-Majid, supervised the killings,
Al-Janabi said.
	   Al-Janabi said he was in the palace although not in the room
when Saddam met his sons-in-law on their return.

<TEXT>
	   SAN SEBASTIAN, Spain (AP) _ Lingering fear from the 30-year
Basque rebellion was tempered by cautious hopes for peace Thursday
as Basques prepared to vote in Sunday's local elections.
	   The extremist ETA armed commandos have killed nearly 800 people
in their quest for a separate Basque nation in parts of Spain and
France.
	   Five weeks ago, however, ETA declared an open-ended cease-fire.
Since then, the group's political wing, Herri Batasuna, and the
Spanish government have been positioning themselves for possible
peace talks.
	   Elections of a regional president and all 75 seats in the Basque
Parliament will test how their post-truce messages are being
received.
	   Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar has said the peace process
cannot begin in earnest until ETA lays down its weapons forever.
	   The latest polls, released last week, suggested that the
mainstream Basque Nationalist Party will win the most seats, but
fall short of a majority, just like in the last legislature. This
will mean looking for parliamentary allies.
	   It's unclear whether the cease-fire will translate into greater
support for other Basque nationalist parties, like Herri Batasuna,
or for non-nationalist ones, like the Basque branches of Aznar's
conservative Popular Party and Spain's main opposition Socialist
Party.
	   The Spanish government hopes that a strong showing by
non-nationalists will give it more leverage in future talks, either
with moderate Basque nationalists seeking more autonomy, or radical
ones seeking full independence.
	   HB spokesman Josu Telleria Uriarte said for the peace process to
advance, the government must transfer more separatist prisoners
from jails scattered around the country to ones in the Basque
region.
	   Telleria said Herri Batasuna and the ETA share the goal of an
independent homeland for the Basque people.
	   ``The Madrid government lets us run a few things. We don't want
that. We want to make our own decisions,'' Telleria said. ``Once we
are a state we can have wonderful relations with Spain.''
	   Basque voters say they relish the idea of elections without the
threat of violence.
	   ``This is a great opportunity,'' said a 36-year-old woman
walking along San Sebastian's elegant seafront promenade. ``But
people wonder if the cease-fire is for real.''
	   Like just about everybody else out on the promenade enjoying the
warm autumn sun, she refused to give her name. That's the other
element of Basque politics these days, a lingering wariness of
saying the wrong thing to the wrong person.
	   ``After so many years of this, nobody talks about politics,''
said a 28-year-old Basque man who works for a construction company.
``It is fear.''

Locomotiv defeats Braga 3-1

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Dmitry Bulykin scored twice in the first half
Thursday to lead Lokomotiv Moscow to a 3-1 victory over Braga of
Portugal in a UEFA Cup Winners Cup second round, first leg game.
	   Lokomotiv, semifinalists in last season's tournament, dominated
throughout. Bulykin opened scoring in the 22nd minute on a header
from a cross from the left, and kicked in his second 13 minutes
later when the ball bounced off a Braga player.
	   Braga had only one scoring opportunity in the first half, when
Karoglan Mladen of Croatia fired from 18 meters, but Russian
goalkeeper Ruslan Nigmatullin saved the goal.
	   Brazil's Odair Borges scored the only goal for Braga in the
first minute of the second half on a free kick from 55 meters
(yards) when the ball bounced off the ground and Nigmatullin
couldn't help his team.
	   Igor Chugainov scored the third goal for Lokomotiv on a penalty
kick in the 60th minute when Alexander Borodyuk was kicked down in
the box.
	   Albert Sarkisian, who came in as a substitute, missed a prime
scoring opportunity for Lokomotive in the 88th minute when he found
himself in a one-on-one position with the Braga goalkeeper, Silva
Quim, who was sent off with a red card for holding the ball outside
the penalty box.
	   Playing a 10-man squad, Braga hardly stopped Lokomotiv in the
last minutes of the game.
	   About 8,000 fans, including 200 from Portugal, were at Lokomotiv
Stadium.

	   ROME (AP) _ Paul (Gazza) Gascoigne still has a few fans in Rome.
	   The English soccer star spent three mostly fruitless years with
Lazio of Rome in the Italian League earlier this decade. But
Thursday, he was offered some encouragement by a banner hung from
the rafters at the club's Olympic Stadium.
	   ``The (fans) are with you in the toughest game ... C'mon
Gazza,'' read the sign, posted during Lazio's Cup Winners Cup game
against Partizan Belgrad.
	   Gascoigne entered a drug and alcohol clinic earlier this month.
	   His brashness was never appreciated by most Italians, and it
didn't help that he was sidelined for 12 months while recovering
from a fractured right leg after a reckless tackle on a Lazio
teammate during practice.

Family reunion may await `El Duque'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JUDIE GLAVE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Orlando Hernandez may be reunited with his
family in the United States, 10 months after the New York Yankees
pitcher defected from Cuba on a raft.
	   Only this time, his relatives will be leaving the island with
the Cuban government's blessing.
	   Hernandez's mother, two children and the mother of the children
have been granted permission by Cuba to come to the United States,
a State Department official said Thursday.
	   The State Department said the family, which includes Hernandez's
daughters Steffi, 2, and Yahumara, 7, would return to Cuba after a
brief visit.
	   Hernandez helped lead the Yankees to a 9-3 victory Sunday in
Game 2 of the World Series, which New York won in a sweep of San
Diego on Thursday night.
	   The Fox News Channel first reported that ``El Duque,'' who
hasn't seen his family since he escaped Cuba last December, would
be reunited with his relatives.
	   It is not clear when or how the reunion will take place. But
U.S. Rep. Jose Serrano, a Bronx congressman who has been working
with the Vatican and other groups to get Hernandez's family to the
United States, said he hoped the reunion would happen in time for
Friday's World Series parade.
	   Serrano never met Hernandez and didn't know details about the
family's arrival.
	   ``I never even met him.'' Serrano said. ``It's just enough to
know that a mother is going to get to see her son.''
	   Hernandez's half-brother, Livan, also played baseball in Cuba
and defected during a trip with his team to Mexico in 1995. He
helped lead the Florida Marlins to a World Series championship a
year ago.
	   Juan Iglesias, Livan Hernandez's agent, said he didn't know
anything about the visit, only that ``El Duque'' was planning to
fly to Miami after Friday's parade and City Hall ceremony for a
visit with his brother.
	   Hernandez, who signed a four-year dlrs 6.6 million contract with
the Yankees in March, was banned from playing in Cuba for dealing
with American major league scouts.
	   He fled Cuba by climbing onto a rickety raft with his wife,
Noris Bosch, and six others. They landed on a remote Bahamian
island and were rescued by the U.S. Coast Guard.

Reports: Baseball poised to announce decision on Reds owner
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CINCINNATI (AP) _ The Cincinnati Reds hadn't heard anything from
baseball Thursday on the future of controlling owner Marge Schott,
and Schott wasn't talking.
	   Baseball officials are preparing to announce a decision that
could end her 14-year reign as the Reds' managing partner. She
reportedly has agreed to sell her controlling shares, with the
understanding that U.S. Major League Baseball will otherwise
continue her 2 1/2-year suspension from day-to-day operation of the
team. She began the punishment in 1996 for having made inflammatory
remarks about minorities.
	   Baseball commissioner Bud Selig told Cincinnati television
station WCPO Thursday that he did not expect an immediate
announcement.
	   Baseball planned to wait until after the World Series to make an
announcement regarding Schott. But even though the Series is over,
baseball is under no immediate pressure to act because Schott's
current suspension lasts through the end of the month.
	   Three Ohio newspapers _ the Dayton Daily News, Cincinnati Post
and Cincinnati Enquirer _ reported Thursday that baseball's
decision would be announced shortly.
	   According to published reports, Schott has agreed to sell her 6
1/2 partnership shares, including two general partner shares,
before the end of the calendar year. If she doesn't, baseball
officials reportedly are ready to extend Schott's suspension until
the end of the Reds' general partnership agreement on Dec. 31,
2000.
	   Schott declined comment from her home Wednesday night. She did
not return a call to her office Thursday.
	   The Reds have not been told anything by major league baseball,
Reds spokesman Rob Butcher said.
	   Baseball officials have not confirmed receipt of any written
notification from Schott about her plans to sell her control of the
Reds.

Success of economic plan depends on outcome of gubernatorial
</HEADLINE>
elections &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: EDITS thruout. &QL; 
 &UR; By STAN LEHMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's
efforts to repair the largest economy in Latin America may depend
on the outcome of this weekend's gubernatorial elections.
	   Cardoso wants to impose tough measures that would slash
government spending and impose new taxes to try to halt the slide
in Brazil's economy and restore investor confidence.
	   But his plan, expected to be unveiled next week, must be
approved by Congress, and state governors have enormous sway over
local delegations.
	   ``The influence governors have on their congressional blocs is
overwhelming,'' said University of Sao Paulo political scientist
Eduardo Kugelmas.
	   Brazil has been caught up in the financial turmoil that began
more than a year ago in Southeast Asia. As wary investors have fled
its financial markets, Brazil's foreign reserves have fallen below
dlrs 50 billion from dlrs 70 billion at the end of July.
	   On Sunday, voters return to the polls for runoff elections in 12
states and in the Federal District of Brasilia.
	   The outcome will likely determine how successful Cardoso is in
getting Congress to approve his economic program, which is aimed at
trimming the budget deficit. New income, fuel and bank transaction
taxes are expected to be proposed.
	   Kugelmas said opponents of the president stand a good chance of
winning in four large states _ Sao Paulo, Minas Gerais, Rio de
Janeiro and Rio Grande do Sul.
	   ``If they win, the president will face a tough uphill battle,''
he said.
	   Cardoso needs the governors' support not only in influencing the
congressional delegations, but also in holding down their own
spending.
	   ``The problem is that none of the candidates in Sunday's
elections ... wants to be identified with unpopular austerity
measures,'' said Kugelmas. ``So they promise to spend more money on
schools, hospitals and public work projects.''
	   Sao Paulo, Brazil's industrial and financial powerhouse, is
perhaps the state most critical to the success of Cardoso's
austerity plans.
	   With more than 34 million inhabitants, nearly equal to the
entire population of neighboring Argentina, it alone accounts for
more than one-third of Brazil's economic output and 70 of the 513
congressional seats.
	   While incumbent governor Mario Covas, a Cardoso ally who is
seeking re-election, has committed himself to the austerity plan,
Covas opponent Paulo Maluf is a question mark.
	   ``If Maluf wins, he will use his victory as a launching pad to
the presidency in 2003,'' Kugelmas predicted. ``And that means he
will try to stay as far away as possible from any austerity
measure.''

Security Council calls for an end to military offensives in Congo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. Security Council called for an
immediate end to military offensives in the Congo Thursday as
forces from three southern African nations prepared to attack
rebels in the country's eastern jungles.
	   Allies of embattled Congolese President Laurent Kabila _
Namibia, Zimbabwe and Angola _ decided Wednesday to help him oust
rebel forces entrenched in the eastern Congo. Forces from the three
nations have been concentrated in western Congo, where they fended
off a rebel advance in August.
	   After a briefing from Undersecretary General Sir Kieran
Prendergast, the Security Council called for all troops in the
country to remain where they are and stop fighting.
	   Council members also ``urged all parties involved not to take
action which would lead to escalation of the conflict'' and to
respect the Congo's territorial integrity, said British Ambassador
Jeremy Greenstock, the council's current president.
	   The Congolese rebels _ ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted members of
Kabila's army and opposition politicians _ accuse Kabila of
corruption, mismanagement and promoting tribalism.
	   Kabila says the rebels are puppets of Rwanda and Uganda, his
erstwhile allies who installed him in power in May 1997 after an
eight-month war against dictator Mobutu Sese Seko.
	   The Security Council expressed support for efforts by the
Organization of African Unity and regional organizations to arrange
a ceasefire and welcomed a meeting in the Zambian capital, Lusaka,
on Oct. 26 of foreign and defense ministers from a number of
countries to try to resolve the crisis.
	   Council members urged all parties involved in the Congo conflict
to attend the talks ``and to use this major opportunity in a spirit
of realism and compromise to help bring a destructive cycle of
violence in the region to an end,'' Greenstock said.
	   Once the results of the Lusaka meeting are known, the council
said it intends to discuss the Congo again ``and, if necessary, to
consider urgently what further role the U.N. might play in
encouraging a peaceful and lasting settlement,'' Greenstock said.

Chilean parliamentarians lobby Spain to block extradition attempt
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHANNA TUCKMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A delegation of Chilean legislators
lobbying against the possible extradition of Augusto Pinochet to
Spain to face trial, warned Thursday that Chile was on the brink of
political turmoil.
	   ``There is a climate of division, confrontation and instability
in Chile,'' parliamentary deputy Alberto Espina told reporters in
Madrid after meeting the Chilean ambassador.
	   Pinochet was arrested in London on Oct. 16 at the instigation of
Spanish magistrate Baltasar Garzon who is seeking to extradite the
former dictator on charges of genocide, terrorism and torture.
	   In Chile, the detention triggered both celebrations by relatives
of victims of Pinochet's 1973-1990 regime and protests from the
retired general's supporters.
	   Espina also warned that the issue was damaging relations between
Chile Spain and Britain. Spain was the biggest single investor in
Chile last year, followed closely by Britain.
	   The deputy arrived in Madrid late Wednesday accompanied by the
senators Jovino Movoa and Julio Lagos.
	   The delegation is an offshoot of a larger group of Chilean
parliamentarians currently protesting the detention in London on
behalf of the opposition parties Independent Democratic Union and
the National Renovation Party.
	   Espina, Movoa and Lagos were hoping to talk to officials from
the Spanish Foreign Ministry and other government representatives.
	   ``All we ask is that Spain stops meddling in our internal
affairs,'' Espina said, arguing that Chilean problems should be
dealt with by Chilean courts.
	   ``We stopped being a Spanish colony 188 years ago and we have no
intention of becoming one again,'' he added.
	   Government spokesman Josep Pique said Prime Minister Jose Maria
Aznar had no plans to meet the delegation, the state-owned news
agency EFE reported.
	   Aznar has promised his government will rubber stamp a formal
extradition request to the British government if asked to do so by
the judicial authorities.
	   But the extradition attempt could be annulled by legal
challenges in Spain well before the deadline for presenting it in
Britain. The deadline is set for November 25th _ coincidentally
Pinochet's 83rd birthday.
	   On Thursday the head prosecutor from the National Court set in
motion appeals against several rulings made by Judge Garzon related
to Pinochet's detention in the London clinic where he was
recovering from back surgery.
	   The court's plenary is expected to meet next week to decide on
an earlier challenge of the Spanish judicial investigations into
human rights abuses in Chile and Argentina that underpin Garzon's
arrest warrant.
	   A ruling that the investigations are outside the jurisdiction of
Spanish law would made any extradition request difficult.
	   The decision is likely to hang on how genocide and terrorism are
interpreted, as these crimes are specifically mentioned in the
Spanish legal code.

Racing Genk ties Real Mallorca 1-1 in Cup Winners Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ A close-range header from striker
Souleymane Oulare earned Racing Genk a 1-1 home draw with Real
Mallorca after Daniel ``Dani'' Garcia gave the Spanish club the
lead in a tight Cup Winners Cup game.
	   With nothing to separate the teams after the first-half, Dani
leapt unmarked to meet a curling free-kick in the 56th-minute and
fired in an unstoppable header to give Mallorca a valuable away
goal to take into the second-leg of this second-round match.
	   The visitors kept up the pressure and Yugoslav mid-fielder
Veljko Paunovic came close to making it 0-2 in the 69th minute with
a low shot from the edge of the penalty area that flew just wide of
the goal.
	   Oulare, who had looked dangerous throughout the match, struck
the equalizer in the 71st minute. Sprinting toward goal, he met a
high, near-post corner just ahead of Carlos Roa and sent the ball
spinning past Mallorca's Argentine goalkeeper.
	   Genk came agonizingly close to taking the lead in the 89th
minute when Mike Origi hurled himself at a soaring cross from
Besnik Hasi only to see his header crash against the crossbar.
	   Mallorca's Goran Stankovic was send off in the 83rd minute for
second bookable offense.
	   Some 23,000 supporters including Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc
Dehaene watched the game in the King Baudouin Stadium in Brussels.

Big welcome for first Argentine president to visit since Falklands
</HEADLINE>
War &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS typo in graf 15, changing first 'between' to
'because' &QL; 
 &UR; By MAUREEN JOHNSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Underlining how times have changed, the British
are laying on a lavish welcome for Carlos Menem, the first
Argentine president to visit since Argentina and Britain went to
war in 1982 over the Falkland Islands.
	   Trade is booming, a reconciliation service is planned at St.
Paul's Cathedral and _ something really different _ Britain's sole
Latin American ally in the Falklands War, former Chilean dictator
Gen. Augusto Pinochet, is under arrest in a London clinic.
	   Not quite everything has changed, though.
	   Margaret Thatcher, who as Conservative Party prime minister
dispatched the British fleet 8,000 miles (12,900 kms) to recapture
the wind-swept archipelago in the south Atlantic, won't be at the
reconciliation service. She has a longstanding previous engagement
out of the country, her office says.
	   And the widow of Lt. Col. Herbert Jones, the daredevil paratroop
commander killed at Goose Green _ a pivotal land battle in which
British troops who were outnumbered 2-to-1 captured 1,400 Argentine
soldiers _ has also said she is too busy to come to the service.
	   It takes place Oct. 28, the first full day of a five-day visit
in which Menem will lay a wreath for the 970 people killed _ 255 of
them British soldiers.
	   Prince Andrew, Queen Elizabeth II's son who flew combat missions
as a helicopter pilot during the 74-day war, will be there, along
with Labor Party government officials, veterans' organizations and
representatives of families of slain British and Argentine
soldiers.
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair's spokesman said Thursday that Menem's
visit will not be overshadowed by either the Falklands or the
presence nearby of 82-year-old Pinochet, under armed guard at a
clinic in London's West End.
	   British police arrested Pinochet, who was on an announced visit,
Oct. 16 at the instigation of a Spanish magistrate seeking to
extradite him on charges of murder, genocide and torture of victims
killed during his 17-year rule.
	   Linking the Menem visit and the Pinochet arrest, Lady Thatcher
said Thursday in a letter to the Times of London that it would be
``disgraceful to preach reconciliation with one, while maintaining
under arrest someone who, during that same conflict, did so much to
save so many British lives.''
	   Blair's government rejected her demand for Pinochet's immediate
release, calling the arrest a legal, not political, issue, and
objecting to the link.
	   ``President Menem is simply not General Galtieri,'' Blair's
press secretary said, referring to Leopoldo Galtieri, the military
dictator who invaded the Falklands.
	   The visit _ despite the continuing dispute over the sovereignty
of the Falklands _ reflected the ``maturity'' of Argentina's
democratically elected government, added Blair's spokesman,
speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Representatives of the 2,200 British-descended islanders also
will not be taking part in any of the ceremonies.
	   ``We are happy for the trip to take place because it strengthens
the relationship between Argentina and the United Kingdom and
therefore makes our position more secure,'' said Suki Cameron,
spokeswoman for the Falkland Island office in London. ``But we
regard it as purely a matter between the governments.''
	   Unlike the Pinochet arrest, the impending Menem visit has
received scant publicity in Britain. Before 1982, many Britons were
unaware the remote British colony existed, and the issue has, for
most, long since faded.

Aggasi cruises to quarterfinals of Czech Indoor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSTRAVA, Czech Republic (AP) _ Second-seed Andre Agassi of the
United States outplayed Magnus Norman of Sweden 6-2, 7-5 Thursday
to advance to the quarterfinals of the dlrs 1 million Czech Indoor
ATP tennis tournament.
	   Agassi broke Norman's serve in the first and fifth game of the
first set despite playing in a practice tempo. Norman improved his
performance in the second set and both players held on to their
serves until the tenth game, but Agassi finally managed to break
the Swede and win the match in straight sets.
	   Meanwhile, home favorite Martin Damm rallied to beat fourth seed
Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia 3-6, 6-3, 6-2.
	   Kafelnikov, No. 10 in the world, broke Damm's serve in the
fourth game and comfortably won the first set, but gradually grew
nervous as Damm started to rush the net.
	   Kafelnikov tried to stick to his aggressive tennis, but Damm,
the only remaining Czech in the tournament, improved both his serve
and returns and eventually won the match.
	   ``It would be nice if I could repeat my 1996 result here, that
is semifinals,'' Damm said after the match.
	   In the next round, Damm will face Wayne Black of Zimbabwe who
beat the 1996 Czech Indoor champion David Prinosil of Germany 3-6,
6-2, 6-4.
	   Black, ranked 92nd on the ATP Tour, crushed the Czech-born
Prinosil with a dashing serve, often faster than 200 kilometers
(125 miles) per hour.
	   In other Thursday action, Andrei Medvedev of the Ukraine
defeated third seed Karol Kucera of Slovakia 6-4, 6-7 (4-7) 6-4,
and Jan Kroslak of Slovakia downed Guillaume Raoux of France 7-5,
6-2.

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Valerenga slowly regained control over
Besiktas and edged the Turks 1-0 in the first leg, second round of
the Cup Winners' Cup Thursday. Valerenga's weapons were fast
transition and long balls.
	   Three minutes into the second half Besikta's goalkeeper Fevzi
Tuncay cleared the ball in a duel with Valerenga's single forward
John Carew. But the clearing was not good enough and Bjorn Arild
Levernes made it 1-0 in front of 6,284 fans.
	   ``This was a tactical victory, and the most important was not to
get any goals against us,'' Valerenga coach Lars Tjarnas said.
	   ``I think Besiktas was a little surprised by us, and they played
as we thought they would. I feel we were well prepared, and we
deserved the victory, and I counted 7-5 in goal chances for us,''
he said.
	   Tjarnas thinks Valerenga has a decent chance to advance to the
quarter final. ``We have flow in our game, and we have a realistic
chance of advancing,'' he said.
	   Valerenga started the second half with a higher pressure than in
the first. The Turks had excellent ball control, and dominated the
first part of the game, but Valerenga slowly regained control.
	   In the last minutes of the game Besiktas desperately tried to
tie the game, but Valerenga was able to ride off the storm.

Racing Genk ties Real Mallorca 1-1 in Cup Winners Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ A close-range header from striker
Souleymane Oulare earned Racing Genk a 1-1 home draw with Real
Mallorca after Daniel ``Dani'' Garcia gave the Spanish club the
lead in a tight Cup Winners Cup game.
	   With nothing to separate the teams after the first-half, Dani
leapt unmarked to meet a curling free-kick in the 56th-minute and
fired in an unstoppable header to give Mallorca a valuable away
goal to take into the second-leg of this second-round match.
	   The visitors kept up the pressure and Yugoslav mid-fielder
Veljko Paunovic came close to making it 0-2 in the 69th minute with
a low shot from the edge of the penalty area that flew just wide of
the goal.
	   Oulare, who had looked dangerous throughout the match, struck
the equalizer in the 71st minute. Sprinting toward goal, he met a
high, near-post corner just ahead of Carlos Roa and sent the ball
spinning past Mallorca's Argentine goalkeeper.
	   Genk came agonizingly close to taking the lead in the 89th
minute when Mike Origi hurled himself at a soaring cross from
Besnik Hasi only to see his header crash against the crossbar.
	   Mallorca's Goran Stankovic was send off in the 83rd minute for
second bookable offense.
	   Some 23,000 supporters including Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc
Dehaene watched the game in the King Baudouin Stadium in Brussels.

	   LEVERKUSEN, Germany (AP) _ Glasgow Rangers, seizing on two
mistakes, beat Bayer Leverkusen 2-1 Thursday in a second-round
first-leg UEFA Cup match.
	   The Rangers led 2-0, but a desperate late attack by the host
Germans was capped by subsitute Thomas Reichenberger's short-range
goal seconds before the final whistle.
	   After a slow first half, Dutch international Giovani van
Bronckhurst slotted in the first goal for the Rangers in the 45th
when the Germans' offsides trap backfired.
	   Jonatan Johnasson guided the 2-0 goal into a wide-open net in
the 64th as he and Rod Wallace beat the German team back on a
counter, then fooled the keeper.
	   The Scottish team, which invested heavily in foreign stars But
for this season, eked out few other scoring chances in a lackluster
match.
	   The goals were the first ever for the Rangers in a German
stadium, having four times come up empty-handed in previous
international matches.
	   Leverkusen, a Champions Cup quarterfinalist last season, was
harmless without injured German national team striker Ulf Kirsten
until stung by the second goal.
	   Subsitute Nico Kovac struck the crossbar with a powerful blast.
Minutes later, Dutch striker Erik Meijer scored off his heel, but
was denied on a questionable off-sides call.
	   Glasgow defender Colin Hendry then stopped another goal by
clearing with his body on the line after Reichenberger tried from
short range.
	   But Reichenberg, with five minutes to play, connected on his
second try from close-in after Brazil's Ze Roberto lifted a pass
over the Scottish defenders' heads.

	   ROME (AP) _ Lazio of Rome dominated the action but, with a slew
of strikers injured, failed to find the target Thursday and settled
for a 0-0 draw against Partizan Belgrade in a Cup Winners Cup
second round, first leg game.
	   Veteran forward Roberto Mancini came closest to scoring for the
Italians with 16 minutes left. He took a pass from Czech midfielder
Pavel Nedved and flicked a lob from just outside the penalty area
that hit the underside of the crossbar and bounced down just in
front of the goal line.
	   In the first half, Mancini fed Nedved for an eight-meter (yard)
shot that Partizan 'keeper Nikola Damjanac deflected away with his
foot.
	   Lazio had 10 shots on goal to just one for Partizan, but the
hosts missed the finishing touches of hurt forwards Christian
Vieri, Chilean Marcelo Salas, Croatian Alen Boksic and Roberto
Rambaudi.
	   ``We played a good game and probably deserved to win. At least
we did not allow any goals, but the next game will be tough now,''
Lazio 'keeper Luca Marchegiani said.
	   The site for the return leg is to be decided next week and may
be moved away from Belgrade because of the situation in Kosovo.

Yankees join one mean lineup of great teams
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HAL BOCK &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The World Series sweep completed a statement of
superiority for the New York Yankees.
	   This team won 125 games, more victories than any U.S. Major
League Baseball franchise ever managed in a season.
	   This team finished with a .714 winning percentage, the best in
more than 70 years and fourth best in history.
	   This team broke a 44-year-old league record by winning 114
regular-season games and then went 11-2 during the postseason.
	   But is this team the greatest in baseball history? Consider the
candidates:
	    &UR; 1906 Chicago Cubs &QC; 
	   These were the Cubs of Tinker to Evers to Chance, a double play
combination that inspired poetry and wound up in the Hall of Fame.
The pitching staff was headlined by Three-Finger Brown, who won 26
games and posted a 1.04 ERA.
	   These Cubs won 116 games for a winning percentage of .763, both
major league bests. Its only slip was losing the World Series in
six games to the Chicago White Sox, an oversight the Cubs corrected
with championships the next two seasons.
	    &UR; 1909 Pittsburgh Pirates &QC; 
	   The Cubs' string of three straight pennants was ended by a
Pirates team that won 110 games during the season and finished with
a .717 winning percentage.
	   The centerpiece was shortstop Honus Wagner, who hit .339 to win
his fourth straight batting championship and seventh of his career.
He also led the league with 100 RBIs.
	   Pittsburgh won the World Series but needed seven games to defeat
Detroit. Babe Adams won three games during the World Series,
including a shutout in Game 7.
	    &UR; 1927 New York Yankees &QC; 
	   They called this lineup Murderers Row with good reason. This
team was built around two of the greatest sluggers _ Babe Ruth and
Lou Gehrig. Ruth hit 60 home runs, a record that lasted until Roger
Maris hit 61 in 1961. Gehrig had 47 homers and drove in 175 runs.
	   The lineup featured Tony Lazzeri, Earle Combs, Waite Hoyt, and
Herb Pennock, all Hall of Famers, and it produced a 110-44
regular-season record, matching the .714 winning percentage of the
1998 Yankees. New York swept Pittsburgh in the World Series.
	    &UR; 1961 New York Yankees &QC; 
	   Roger Maris and Mickey Mantle staged a season-long run at Ruth's
record. Maris finished with 61 homers and Mantle had 54. The team
set a mark with 240 homers, including six players with 20 or more
home runs. The pitching staff was led by Whitey Ford, who went
25-4.
	   The Yankees finished 109-53 and beat Cincinnati in five games in
the World Series. Second baseman Bobby Richardsaon batted .391 and
set a record for most hits (nine) in a five-game World Series.
	    &UR; 1974 Oakland A's &QC; 
	   The raucous A's became only the second franchise to win three
straight World Series and ranked as baseball's last dynasty before
free agency shook rosters.
	   The A's went 90-72, with sluggers Reggie Jackson, Sal Bando and
Joe Rudi backing a staff anchored by Catfish Hunter and Rollie
Fingers.
	   Hunter's 25 wins and 2.49 ERA led the league and the A's beat
the Los Angeles Dodgers in five games in the World Series.
	    &UR; 1976 Cincinnati Reds &QC; 
	   The Big Red Machine's lineup overflowed with quality hitters:
Hall of Famers Joe Morgan and Johnny Bench, and Pete Rose, who
finished with a record 4,256 hits.
	   The Reds beat Boston in seven games in the 1975 World Series.
The next season they won the National League West by 10 games,
finishing 102-60. Cincinnati followed with a four-game sweep of the
Yankees, becoming the first National League team to win consecutive
World Series since the New York Giants in 1921-22.

Camacho has no worries heading into bout
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHESTER, West Virginia (AP) _ Hector ``Macho'' Camacho, a
champion in three weight classes, has plenty of confidence heading
into his junior middleweight fight Friday night against Kenny
Sigurani.
	   ``I'm in good shape, and have been doing a lot of roadwork, so I
don't have any worries,'' said Camacho, who is 66-4-1 with 33
knockouts. ``I'll do what I do best.''
	   No titles are at stake in the scheduled 10-round bout at the
Mountaineer Race Track and Gaming Resort.
	   The 36-year-old Camacho, a former WBC super featherweight and
lightweight and WBO welterweight champion, last fought on Aug. 11,
winning a 12-round unanimous decision over Tony Menefee.
	   A year ago almost to the day, Camacho's son, Hector Camacho Jr.,
20, won a junior welterweight bout at the Chester racetrack, with
his father at ringside.
	   The younger Camacho also is scheduled to fight Friday night, but
at Trump Marina in Atlantic City, New Jersey in a scheduled
10-round junior welterweight fight against Fred Curiel.
	   The 25-year-old Sigurani (22-2) knows he is the underdog against
the elder Camacho and has been putting in extra time in the gym to
make the fight a ``more even match.''
	   ``I have everything to gain and nothing to lose,'' said
Sigurani, a Youngstown, Ohio native. ``I want to go on and go
farther. It's hard to step in the ring with these guys, I've been
looking up to them forever _ but I'm here to work and work hard to
get ahead.''
	   Sigurani's closest brush with fame of late was a June 25
welterweight fight with Julio Cesar Chavez. He cut Chavez badly
over the right eye before he lost when stopped in the third round.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Defending champion Chelsea barely salvaged a 1-1
draw with FC Copenhagen Thursday in the second round of the Cup
Winners Cup, and Italy's Lazio _ likely pretenders to the crown _
settled for a scoreless tie at home with Partizan Belgrade.
	   Chelsea's Marcel Desailly scored three minutes into second-half
injury time from 18 meters (yards) _ a shot that went in off the
post _ in Chelsea's 1-1 draw.
	   In the 81st minute, Bjarne Goldbaek appeared to get the winner
for the Danes, scoring from 18 meters (yards) after a lapse by the
Chelsea defense.
	   Chelsea, despite a wide margin of play and showcasing a team
stocked with high-priced players from a dozen countries, faces a
difficult game in two weeks in Copenhagen in the second leg.
	   FC Copenhagen had its best chance to score early when David
Nielsen missed an open net from six meters (yards) in the 23rd.
	   Chelsea's Gianfranco Zola came back 10 minutes later with a shot
off the goal upright and, in the 55th, Pierluigi Casirahgi also hit
the upright.
	   Chelsea remains unbeaten at home in all European competition.
The English side is also unbeaten in 11 games this season and is
trying to become the first team to win the Cup Winners Cup in
back-to-back seasons. And the last.
	   This cup disappears next season as it's merged with the UEFA
Cup.
	   In Rome, Lazio dominated but, with a slew of strikers injured,
failed to find the target in a 0-0 draw.
	   Veteran forward Roberto Mancini came closest to scoring for the
Italians with 16 minutes left. He took a pass from Czech midfielder
Pavel Nedved and flicked a lob from just outside the penalty area
that hit the underside of the crossbar and bounced down just in
front of the goal line.
	   ``We played a good game and probably deserved to win. At least
we did not allow any goals, but the next game will be tough now,''
Lazio 'keeper Luca Marchegiani said.
	   The site for the return leg is to be decided next week and may
be moved away from Belgrade because of the situation in Kosovo.
	   In Athens, Mark Robins scored the winner in the 57th as
Panionios Athens beat Apollon Limassol of Cyprus 3-2. Milenco
Spoliaric gave Apollon a 1-0 lead in the 13th, but Antonis
Sapountzis leveled in the 24th on a free kick and Garry Haylock
made it 2-1 on a 39th minute header. Spoliaric scored his second a
minute later on a blistering 30-meter (yard) shot.
	   In Moscow, Dmitry Bulykin scored two first-half goals _ in the
22nd and 35th _ as last season's semifinalists Lokomotiv Moscow
beat Portugal's Braga 3-1. Brazil's Odair Borges made it 2-1 for
Braga in the first minute of the second half on a free kick. Igor
Chugainov scored on a penalty in the 60th for the Russians. Braga
goalkeeper Silva Quim was sent off on a red card in the final
minutes for handling the ball outside the area.
	   In Heerenveen, Netherlands, Johan Hansma scored in the 88th to
break a 1-1 tie and give SC Heerenveen 2-1 win over Croatia's NK
Varteks. Dennis de Nooijer opened for the Dutch in the 57th and
Miljenko Mumlek evened in the 63rd.
	   In Brussels, a close-range header from striker Souleymane Oulare
in the 71st earned Racing Genk a 1-1 home draw with Real Mallorca
after Daniel ``Dani'' Garcia gave the Spanish club the lead in the
56th.
	   In Linz, Austria, SV Ried defeated Maccabi Haifa 2-1 on goals
from Maciej Sliwowski and Gerald Strafner. Alon Mizrahi scored for
Maccabi Haifa.
	   In Oslo, Norway, Valerenga defeated Turkey's Besiktas 1-0 on a
goal in the 48th by Bjorn Arild Levernes in front of a crowd of
6,284.
	   In Leverkusen, Germany, in a UEFA Cup second-round, first-leg
game, Scotland's Rangers won at Bayer Leverkusen 2-1 on goals by
Jonatan Johansson and Giovanni Van Bronckhorst. Thomas
Reichenberger scored late for the Germans, who were Champions Cup
quarterfinalists last season.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Chelsea's Marcel Desailly scored three minutes
into second-half injury time on a shot from 18 meters (yards) that
went in off the upright to salvage a 1-1 draw against FC Copenhagen
Thursday in the second round, first leg of the Cup Winners Cup.
	   In the 81st minute, Bjarne Goldbaek appeared to get the winner
for the Danes when he scored on an 18-meter (yard) shot. Goldbaek
hammered in the goal after Chelsea's Dennis Wise failed to control
the ball as it was cut back near the end line.
	   Chelsea, despite a wide margin of play _ particularly in the
second half _ now faces a difficult game in two weeks in Copenhagen
in the second leg.
	   The English side, stocked with a high-priced talent from a dozen
countries, carried much of the play _ hit the post twice _ but
failed to break down a well-organized Danish defense.
	   FC Copenhagen had the best chance to score early when David
Nielsen missed an open net from just six meters (yards) in the 23rd
minute.
	   Chelsea's Gianfranco Zola came back 10 minutes later with a shot
off the goal upright and Denmark's Brian Laudrup also shot wide
late in the half from a sharp angle.
	   Chelsea, on a windy, rainy night, pressured in the first 10
minutes of the second half, the best chance coming as Pierluigi
Casirahgi hit the upright in the 55th minute from eight meters
(yards).
	   Chelsea remains unbeaten in all European competition at home.
The English side also is now unbeaten in 11 games this season and
is trying to become the first team to win the Cup Winners Cup in
back-to-back seasons _ and the last. This cup disappears next
season as it's merged with the UEFA Cup.

Fire destroys Ottoman palace in old Cairo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A fire gutted a gem of Muslim architecture,
the Palace of Musafirkhana, in Old Cairo on Thursday.
	   The blaze began when residents set fire to piles of trash in
front of the 18th-century Ottoman palace, police said. The wooden
gate caught fire and the flames quickly spread to the palace.
	   It took firefighters five hours to put out the blaze, which
devoured the rich woodwork of the palace and left only the walls
standing. Four neighboring apartments were also destroyed.
	   Two firefighters were treated for smoke inhalation.
	   People in low-income districts in Egypt often burn trash.
	   The Musafirkhana was built in 1779-88 and is the birthplace of
Khedive Ismail, the ruler of Egypt at the time of the construction
of the Suez Canal.
	   The palace featured windows of wooden screens overlooking a
courtyard fountain, entire walls paneled with engraved wood, and a
well where the royal family is said to have disposed of corpses
after secret executions.
	   But, as with many of Egypt's Islamic monuments, the building had
been allowed to deteriorate. The government had allotted 15 million
Egyptian pounds (dlrs 4.4 million) for its restoration, Egypt's
Middle East News Agency said.
	   The agency quoted the chief official for Islamic and Coptic
Monuments, El-Sayed Abdullah el-Attar, as saying the palace would
still be restored.

Chilean parliamentarians lobby Spain to block extradition attempt
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHANNA TUCKMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A delegation of Chilean legislators
lobbying against the possible extradition of Augusto Pinochet to
Spain on Thursday warned that Chile was on the brink of political
turmoil because of the former dictator's arrest.
	   ``There is a climate of division, confrontation and instability
in Chile,'' parliamentary deputy Alberto Espina told reporters in
Madrid after meeting the Chilean ambassador.
	   Pinochet was arrested in London on Oct. 16 at the request of
Spanish magistrate Baltasar Garzon, who wants to extradite Pinochet
on genocide, terrorism and torture charges. He remains in the
London clinic where he was recovering from back surgery when he was
arrested.
	   Pinochet's detention has triggered celebrations in Chile by
relatives of victims of his 1973-1990 regime and protests from the
retired general's supporters.
	   Espina also warned that the issue was damaging relations between
Chile, Spain and Britain. Spain was the biggest single investor in
Chile last year, followed closely by Britain.
	   The deputy arrived in Madrid late Wednesday accompanied by two
senators, Jovino Movoa and Julio Lagos.
	   The delegation is part of a larger group of lawmakers from the
Chilean opposition parties, Independent Democratic Union and the
National Renovation Party, protesting the detention.
	   Espina, Movoa and Lagos were hoping to talk to officials from
the Spanish Foreign Ministry and other government representatives.
	   ``All we ask is that Spain stop meddling in our internal
affairs,'' Espina said, arguing that Chilean problems should be
dealt with by Chilean courts.
	   ``We stopped being a Spanish colony 188 years ago and we have no
intention of becoming one again,'' he added.
	   Government spokesman Josep Pique said Prime Minister Jose Maria
Aznar had no plans to meet the delegation, the state-owned news
agency EFE reported.
	   Aznar has promised his government will rubber stamp a formal
extradition request to the British government if asked to do so by
the judicial authorities.
	   But the extradition attempt could be annulled by legal
challenges in Spain well before the deadline for presenting it in
Britain. The deadline is Nov. 25, coincidentally Pinochet's 83rd
birthday.
	   On Thursday, the head prosecutor of the National Court, Eduardo
Fungarino, filed an appeal seeking to overturn Garzon's extradition
request.
	   Fungarino, who has opposed ongoing National Court investigations
into human rights abuses in Chile and Argentina, argued in
Thursday's appeal that Spain doesn't have the right to meddle in
Chilean crimes.
	   The court, which deals with national security issues such as
terrorism, corruption and genocide, is expected to rule next week
on an earlier challenge by the prosecutor to the investigations
that underpin Garzon's arrest warrant.
	   A ruling that the Chilean and Argentinean investigations are
outside the jurisdiction of Spanish law would make any extradition
request difficult.

Seles hoping for better results at Chase Championships
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Winless in her last two appearances in the Chase
Championships, Monica Seles feels her fortunes are about to change
at next month's season-ending dlrs 2 million tournament at Madison
Square Garden.
	   ``I know my mind is going to be in a different place this year
than where it was last year and that is a big plus already,'' Seles
said.
	   A year ago as her father Karolj was waging a fight against
stomach cancer, a distracted Seles lost to Arantxa Sanchez Vicario.
Her father lost that fight this spring.
	   ``I miss him so much as a coach,'' Seles said Thursday during a
teleconference call from Moscow. ``For me, day to day, it is a very
tough adjustment.''
	   Yet Seles managed that adjustment, and just weeks after her
father's death, the former world No. 1 player reached the French
Open final, losing to Sanchez Vicario.
	   In her last seven tournaments, Seles has won two and reached the
quarterfinals or better each time. She lost in the quarterfinals at
both Wimbledon and the U.S. Open.
	   ``The second part of this year I've spent more time on the court
and played more consistent tennis,'' said Seles, ranked No. 6 in
the world.
	   ``Right now I'm playing solid tennis, not extraordinary, and my
results are reflecting that,'' said Seles, who at the Chase
Championships two years ago was forced to retire with an injury
against Kimiko Date in the opening round .
	   With only two more tournaments after this week left in the
season, Seles is hoping to build momentum to carry her into next
year.
	   ``I would love to keep on improving, and if I do that and keep
working hard, I believe some good things can happen and that for me
would be to win a Grand Slam and to do a lot better in all four,''
said Seles, winner of nine majors.
	   Having already qualified for the 16-player Chase Championships
singles field are Martina Hingis, Venus Williams, Lindsay
Davenport, Jana Novotna, Sanchez-Vicario, Anna Kournikova, Conchita
Martinez and Patty Schnyder.

Griffith Joyner's death blamed on epileptic seizure

	   SANTA ANA, California (AP) _ U.S. Olympic sprint champion
Florence Griffith Joyner suffocated during an epileptic seizure as
she slept, authorities said Thursday.
	   Lt. Frank Fitzpatrick said toxicology tests showed she had taken
Tylenol and Benadryl, but ``there was nothing unusual in terms of
drugs.''
	   Other scientists said at a news conference that her heart
appeared normal.
	   Griffith Joyner, 38, died at her Mission Viejo home on Sept. 21,
and investigators had been trying since then to determine the exact
cause.
	   Her husband, 1984 Olympic triple jump champion Al Joyner, called
paramedics after discovering she was not breathing that morning.
	   Stylish, smooth and muscular, Griffith Joyner won three Olympic
gold medals at the 1988 Seoul Games and set world records that
still stand in the 100- and 200-meter dashes.
	   Griffith Joyner had been shadowed through her career by
speculation about use of banned substances, but she never failed a
drug test and denied ever using drugs.

Peru's justice minister denies American prisoner mistreated
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ Justice Minister Alfredo Quispe denied
Thursday that an American woman who is serving a life sentence for
terrorism is mistreated in the prison where she was recently moved
for medical tests.
	   ``Lori Berenson has said that we transferred her to Socabaya
prison to demoralize her,'' Quispe said. ``But we transferred her
to respect the requests of her parents and human rights groups.''
	   Berenson, 28, of New York City, was moved two weeks ago from
Yanamayo prison 12,700 feet (3,850 meters) high in the Andes
mountains, to the lower-lying Socabaya prison, 465 miles (750
kilometers) southeast of Lima.
	   Doctors say that after three years in frigid Yanamayo prison,
she suffers from bronchial problems and arthritis in her hands.
	   In Socabaya, Berenson is held in isolation in a dimly lit,
concrete cell with a hole in the floor as a toilet, her father Mark
Berenson said in a telephone interview from New York.
	   He said the information was provided by a U.S. consulate officer
who had visited her.
	   She has complained of her isolation in Socabaya, which holds
common criminals, and has asked to be returned to Yanamayo, where
she lived with other rebel prisoners, Quispe said.
	   ``She complains of the isolation,'' her father confirmed.
	   Peru's human rights ombudsman Jorge Santisteban charged
Wednesday that Berenson was hooded with a bed sheet when she was
moved from her cell to the prison infirmary in Socabaya, describing
the measure as abusive.
	   Quispe denied she has been mistreated.
	   ``All national and United Nations regulations for this type of
detention are being respected,'' he said.
	   The parents, Mark and Rhoda Berenson, will visit their daughter
Saturday. They have requested an interview with Peru's
congressional human rights commission, but have received no
response so far, the father said.
	   Berenson, a former Massachusetts Institute of Technology
student, was convicted by a hooded military judge in 1996 for

	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ Police on Thursday used water cannons to
scatter demonstrators celebrating the arrest in London of Gen.
Augusto Pinochet.
	   Police briefly detained 15 demonstrators, who were released
without being charged.
	   Meanwhile, Senate President Andres Zaldivar said he had been
informed that Pinochet's condition was deteriorating. The former
military dictator is being held at the London Clinic, where he was
arrested after undergoing back surgery this month.
	   ``His condition is very difficult, much worse than originally
thought,'' Zaldivar told a news conference with foreign
correspondents.
	   ``He is suffering from depression and shows lack of will to
react and to do the things he is supposed to do,'' Zaldivar added.
	   Unconfirmed media reports here indicated that Pinochet is also
suffering from a urinary infection.
	   Pinochet, 82, suffers from diabetes and has carried a pacemaker
for several years.
	   Pinochet was arrested last Friday at the request of a Spanish
judge, who wants to question him on the human rights abuses under
his 1973-90 dictatorship.
	   The arrest has triggered daily street demonstrations by Pinochet
supporters and opponents in Chile.
	   Politicians have expressed growing concern over the resurgence
of the radical political divisions that remain in the newly
democratized country.
	   President Eduardo Frei was scheduled to address the country
later Thursday.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Underlining how times have changed, the British
are laying on a lavish welcome for Carlos Menem, the first
Argentine president to visit since Argentina and Britain went to
war in 1982 over the Falkland Islands.
	   Trade is booming, a reconciliation service is planned at St.
Paul's Cathedral and _ something really different _ Britain's sole
Latin American ally in the Falklands War, former Chilean dictator
Gen. Augusto Pinochet, is under arrest in a London clinic.
	   Menem, even, issued a statement to run in Friday's mass
circulation Sun tabloid that the war ''should never have
happened.''

Yankee fans get ready for a parade

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The World Series champion New York Yankees are
planning their second trip in three years up the city's famed
``Canyon of Heroes.''
	   Minutes after the Yankees won a record 24th World Series title,
the city began making plans for a huge parade Friday to honor
baseball's most decorated team.
	   ``I'm going to see if I can take off a couple of hours from work
to go down and watch the parade,'' said Rafael Diaz, who was buying
Yankees paraphernalia Thursday in Manhattan.
	   Outside of Yankee Stadium in the Bronx, 200 people started their
own street celebration after the last out was recorded in San Diego
late Wednesday night. Screaming and cheering fans made as much
noise as they could, while police kept a watchful eye on the crowd.
	   Police reported no violence on the part of jubilant Yankee fans
throughout the city.
	   ``They've been civil,'' said Police Captain Steve Paveglio of
the fans outside the stadium. ``They're just celebrating. I don't
think they realize the Yankees are in California.''
	   In 1996, when the Yankees won the last game of the best-of-7
series at home, only a handful of fans broke the law with
celebrating.
	   ``The city has been galvanized by baseball,'' said Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani at a press conference. ``This is history. There has never
been a team that had a record like this.''
	   The Empire State Building will honor the Yankees by illuminating
the top of the historic edifice in blue and white, the team colors.
	   The official celebration will start late Friday morning on
Broadway, with the parade ending in front of City Hall.
	   Although it is called a ``ticker tape'' parade, it will actually
be confetti and shredded computer paper that will stream down on
the parade as it moves through lower Manhattan.
	   Manager Joe Torre and the mayor are expected to ride on the same
float. The players will be divided onto floats by their positions.
Scott Brosius, the Series' most valuable player, will likely be on
a separate float.
	   ``The Boss (Yankee owner George Steinbrenner) called me
yesterday to tell me to get ready for the parade,'' ailing slugger
Darryl Strawberry said at a public appearance Wednesday. Strawberry
missed the postseason because of colon cancer surgery.
	   Sister Mary Marguerite Torre will cancel classes for the 362
students at the school of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary
Church in Ozone Park, Queens. Sister Marguerite, whose brother is
the Yankees' manager, is arranging to take the students to the
parade.
	   The Yankees' postseason success will generate dlrs 67 million
for the city's economy, according to City Comptroller Alan G.
Hevesi.

Griffith Joyner died of epileptic seizure
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes, details; background &QL; 
 &UR; By LARRY GERBER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SANTA ANA, California (AP) _ Olympic sprint champion Florence
Griffith Joyner suffocated from an epileptic seizure in her sleep
last month, authorities said Thursday.
	   They said an autopsy found no indication of drug use in the
death of the 38-year-old dazzling track star known simply as FloJo.
	   ``In layman's terms, she suffocated,'' said Dr. Richard
Fukumoto, chief of forensics for the Orange County
Sheriff's-Coroner department.
	   Lt. Frank Fitzpatrick, head of forensic sciences for the
sheriff's office, said toxicology tests showed she had taken about
one tablet each of the over-the-counter painkiller Tylenol and
antihistamine Benadryl, but ``there was nothing unusual in terms of
drugs.''
	   The seizure involved a congenital blood vessel abnormality. Dr.
Barbara Zaias said Griffith Joyner had a ``cavernous angioma'' on
the front left part of her brain, a condition found in about 25
percent of the population.
	   Many people with the condition live their whole lives without
knowing they have it, but in others it can cause headaches and
seizures, she said.
	   Fukumoto said Griffith Joyner apparently had been lying on her
stomach and the seizure possibly caused her limbs to stiffen and
turn her head to the right, where her breathing was constricted by
covers and pillows.
	   The medical experts said the abnormality has never been
associated with any banned or illegal substances. Griffith Joyner
had been shadowed by speculation about use of banned substances,
but she never failed a drug test and denied ever using drugs.
	   Other scientists said at a news conference that her heart
appeared to be normal.
	   Stylish, smooth and muscular, Griffith Joyner won three Olympic
gold medals at the 1988 Seoul Games and set world records that
still stand in the 100- and 200-meter dashes.
	   Her flowing black hair, skin-tight outfits and glittering 4-inch
fingernails brought a dash of flash to track and field. A line of
athletic shoes and clothes that she had been working on was
scheduled to go on sale next month.
	   ``We now hope that this great Olympic champion, wife and mother
can rest in peace, and that her millions of admirers around the
world will celebrate her legacy to sport and children every day,''
U.S. Olympic Committee president Bill Hybl said. ``It is time for
the whispers and dark allegations to cease.''
	   About 1 in 200 Americans suffer from epilepsy, which can be
caused by a variety of problems, including head injury, brain
infection, stroke, drug use, drug withdrawal or chemical imbalance
on the body. Some people are born with it; others develop it later
in life.
	   In some epileptic seizures, a person loses consciousness. In
others, the person may remain conscious. Some epileptic seizures
are brought on by stress, fatigue or illness.
	   Griffith Joyner died at her Mission Viejo home on Sept. 21, and
investigators had been trying since then to determine the exact
cause.
	   Her husband, 1984 Olympic triple jump champion Al Joyner, called
paramedics after discovering she was not breathing that morning.
	   Rumors that she had used banned substances angered friends and
relatives. At her funeral, Bob Kersee, a former coach and relative
by marriage, told Mary Joyner, her 7-year-old daughter:
	   ``Mary, your momma wants you to know that those tarnishing,
poisonous lies can't hurt her no more. So you don't have to worry
about that venomous, deadly scorpion sting of the reporters. It
don't hurt her no more,'' Kersee said. ``See God is protecting her.
See God is her coach now.''
	   Sandra Farmer-Patrick, a former record holder in the 400-meter
hurdles, has long ties to the sprinter. Griffith Joyner was the
godmother of Farmer-Patrick's daughter.
	   ``I just hope they'll let her rest in peace like they should
have done before,'' she said Thursday. ``It's time to stop the
allegations _ they're ridiculous. They were disturbing to her
family and friends and quite disrespectful.''
	   In addition to her husband she is survived by their 7-year-old
daughter, Mary.

Borg to play McEnroe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Top seeded John McEnroe will play
old rival Bjorn Borg on Friday in the Champions seniors tennis tour
with a record crowd tipped.
	   Melbourne tournament chairman Wayne Reid said the record was
about 8,000 set at Delray Beach, Florida, earlier this year. Reid
said 10,000 tickets had already been sold for the first Borg vs.
McEnroe match on Australian soil.
	   The 15th round of the 21-tournament circuit is played as partial
round-robin, unlike the knockout system used last week in Sydney.
	   McEnroe, who won the Sydney event, maintained his strong form
Thursday with a 6-1, 6-4 win over England's John Lloyd.
	   Australian John Fitzgerald, beaten by McEnroe on Wednesday, kept
his semifinal chances alive with a 6-4, 5-7, 10-4 victory over
Borg.
	   McEnroe said the prospect of playing Borg was a major reason for
his appearance on the senior circuit.
	   ``He brings out the best in me,'' McEnroe said.
	   No.2 seed Henri Leconte of France beat local hope Pat Cash 6-3,
7-6 (7-3) while Johan Kriek beat Guillermo Vilas 7-5, 7-6 (7-2).

Pepper, Sorenstam get grip on wind
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EDDIE PELLS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   THE VILLAGES, Florida (AP) _ As a warm and humid week suddenly
turned windy in central Florida. Dottie Pepper and Annika Sorenstam
were among the few who seemed prepared.
	   Pepper and Sorenstam shot 3-under-par 69s Thursday to share the
lead after the wind-blown opening round of the Samsung World
Championship of Women's Golf.
	   Brandie Burton and Juli Inkster trailed the leaders by one
stroke.
	   At 1-under, Karrie Webb was the only other player in the
16-woman field to break par on the Tierra Del Sol course that had
been touted as an easy mark in practice rounds all week.
	   Pepper, trying to win her first tournament in more than two
seasons, said she practiced in blustery South Carolina wind last
week.
	   ``My instructor said, `You realize it will be like this next
weekend,''' Pepper said. ``It's fall. The cold fronts start to
reach this far. You have to be prepared for the windy weather.''
	   Players said the steady, swirling 20 mph (32 kmph) wind cost
them from 1 1/2 to three clubs in distance. Because of the weather,
tournament officials moved the tee box on the par-5 16th hole up 25
yards (23 meters) and shortened the par-5 18th by 50 yards (46
meters).
	   The wind made for an ugly stat sheet. For example, Inkster hit
only nine of 18 greens in regulation. Burton finished the front
nine 2-under despite hitting only three of nine greens.
	   ``You just try to bunt it around and try to keep it under the
wind,'' Burton said. ``Sometimes I did, sometimes I didn't. It
wasn't very pretty, but you just stood up there and tried to hit
knock-down shots all day.''
	   Playing just an hour away from her new home in Orlando, South
Korean rookie Se Ri Pak was tied with Helen Alfredsson at even-par
72, but Pak's round was far from routine.
	   The winner of this year's LPGA Championship and U.S. Open made
five bogeys on the front nine, capped by a three-putt on No. 8
after which she flung her putter toward the bag.
	   She followed with five birdies on the back and finished the
round with six birdies, six bogeys and six pars, making for an
exciting day for the large gallery that followed her round.
	   ``The front nine was unbelievable,'' Pak said. ``It was like
bogey after bogey and I don't make a lot of bogeys. But I just
wasn't comfortable. After the front nine, I went with new thinking.
I changed my mind and just got more comfortable with myself.''
	   Sorenstam came into the tournament as the tour money leader and
with a slim 28-point lead over Pak in the points race for LPGA
Player of the Year. She played in the twosome with Pak and enjoyed
a far more consistent round.
	   ``You have to plan every shot,'' Sorenstam said of the windy
conditions. ``It's a much longer course today. But I love to think
my way around the golf course. That's how I like to play.''
	   With Sorenstam in the clubhouse, Pepper carried a one-stroke
lead into No. 18 before three-putting the final hole to finish in a
tie. She rolled her birdie putt eight feet past the cup and missed
the par try coming back.
	   ``I'm not upset because it was an aggressive bogey,'' Pepper
said. ``If I hit it three feet short and miss, I would have been
more annoyed. And if I hit it in the middle of the round, nobody
would have cared.''
	   The 16-player field includes the winners of the four major
championships along with the U.S. Amateur champion. Top money
winners and leaders on international circuits round out the field.

Lomu manager denies Saracens link
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ Jonah Lomu's manager has dismissed
speculation that the rugby star is going to Britain to talk to
wealthy English rugby club Saracens about his post-World Cup
future.
	   Phil Kingsley-Jones said the reports in the British newspapers
were ``a media beat-up'' and he said no rugby meetings were planned
for the pair's stay in Britain over November and December.
	   He said Lomu's four-week trip was to fulfill charity commitments
arranged to coincide with the canceled testimonial match for former
England skipper Will Carling.
	   Lomu will also appear on television talk shows and will do some
after-dinner speaking.
	   Kingsley-Jones said the connection with Saracens was that the
club's technical director, Mark Evans, was also to have been coach
of Carling's team and had contacted him about the match.
	   He added the British media were speculating about the
possibility of Lomu playing in Britain, because they wanted the see
the best in action in the English premiership.
	   ``I think they are trying to push the English clubs,''
Kingsley-Jones said. ``They are saying, `If you really want to be
the best, you have to get the best; why not get Jonah to play in
this competition.'''
	   Kingsley-Jones said Lomu's focus was on making next year's All
Blacks squad and on the Super 12, where a change in geographic
make-up of the upper North Island teams will see him turning out
for the Chiefs instead of the Auckland Blues.
	   He said he had to look at Lomu's future beyond next year's World
Cup, when the winger's contract with the New Zealand Rugby Football
Union expires.
	   ``If a rugby club comes up to talk to me, if a rugby league club
comes up to talk to me, if the chief inspector of London police
wants to talk to me, I will talk, because I have to look at all
options,'' Kingsley-Jones said. ``But nothing like that is planned
for his trip. Jonah has a pretty extensive tour. I don't think he
has a day off.''
	   It was reported that Lomu would hold talks with Saracens through
Kingsley-Jones next month.
	   Meanwhile Saracens refused to deny the reports and owner Nigel
Wray said, ``Lomu is a wonderful name in world rugby. We will look
abroad but we also want to bring players through our own system
which is more economic.''

Heerenveen 2, Varteks 1; Genk 1, Mallorca 1; Pathionios 3, Apollon
Limassol 2; SV Ried 2, Maccabi Haifa (Israel) 1; Lokomotiv Moscow
3, Braga 1.
	   In a second-round, first-leg UEFA Cup game, Rangers defeated
Bayer Leverkusen 2-1 in Germany.
	   In Chelsea's draw, the Danes appeared to have won in the 81st
when Bjarne Goldbaek scored from 18 meters (yards) after a lapse by
the Chelsea defense.
	   Chelsea, despite a wide margin of play and showcasing a team
stocked with high-priced players from a dozen countries, faces a
difficult game in two weeks in Copenhagen in the second leg.
	   FC Copenhagen had its best chance to score early when David
Nielsen missed an open net from six meters (yards) in the 23rd.
	   Chelsea's Gianfranco Zola came back 10 minutes later with a shot
off the goal upright and, in the 55th, Pierluigi Casirahgi also hit
the upright.
	   ``We have to be a bit cooler in front of goal because that is
what football is all about,'' said coach Gianluca Vialli. ``Teams
are making it harder for us because they put extra effort in
against the holders.''
	   ``I am not entirely happy with the performance, but 1-1 is
better than a 1-0 win for the opposition,'' he added.
	   Chelsea remains unbeaten at home in all European competition.
The English side is also unbeaten in 11 games this season and is
trying to become the first team to win the Cup Winners Cup in
back-to-back seasons. And the last.
	   This cup disappears next season as it's merged with the UEFA
Cup.
	   In Rome, Lazio dominated but, with a slew of strikers injured,
failed to find the target in a 0-0 draw.
	   Veteran forward Roberto Mancini came closest to scoring for the
Italians with 16 minutes left. He took a pass from Czech midfielder
Pavel Nedved and flicked a lob from just outside the penalty area
that hit the underside of the crossbar and bounced down just in
front of the goal line.
	   ``We played a good game and probably deserved to win. At least
we did not allow any goals, but the next game will be tough now,''
Lazio 'keeper Luca Marchegiani said.
	   The site for the return leg is to be decided next week and may
be moved away from Belgrade because of the situation in Kosovo.
	   In Athens, Mark Robins scored the winner in the 57th as
Panionios Athens beat Apollon Limassol of Cyprus 3-2. Milenco
Spoliaric gave Apollon a 1-0 lead in the 13th, but Antonis
Sapountzis leveled in the 24th on a free kick and Garry Haylock
made it 2-1 on a 39th minute header. Spoliaric scored his second a
minute later on a blistering 30-meter (yard) shot.
	   In Moscow, Dmitry Bulykin scored two first-half goals _ in the
22nd and 35th _ as last season's semifinalists Lokomotiv Moscow
beat Portugal's Braga 3-1. Brazil's Odair Borges made it 2-1 for
Braga in the first minute of the second half on a free kick. Igor
Chugainov scored on a penalty in the 60th for the Russians. Braga
goalkeeper Silva Quim was sent off on a red card in the final
minutes for handling the ball outside the area.
	   In Heerenveen, Netherlands, Johan Hansma scored in the 88th to
break a 1-1 tie and give SC Heerenveen 2-1 win over Croatia's NK
Varteks. Dennis de Nooijer opened for the Dutch in the 57th and
Miljenko Mumlek evened in the 63rd.
	   In Brussels, a close-range header from striker Souleymane Oulare
in the 71st earned Racing Genk a 1-1 home draw with Real Mallorca
after Daniel ``Dani'' Garcia gave the Spanish club the lead in the
56th.
	   In Linz, Austria, SV Ried defeated Maccabi Haifa 2-1 on goals
from Maciej Sliwowski and Gerald Strafner. Alon Mizrahi scored for
Maccabi Haifa.
	   In Oslo, Norway, Valerenga defeated Turkey's Besiktas 1-0 on a
goal in the 48th by Bjorn Arild Levernes in front of a crowd of
6,284.
	   In Leverkusen, Germany, in a UEFA Cup second-round, first-leg
game, Scotland's Rangers won at Bayer Leverkusen 2-1 on goals by
Jonatan Johansson and Giovanni Van Bronckhorst. Thomas
Reichenberger scored late for the Germans, who were Champions Cup
quarterfinalists last season.

Brazilian politicians supporting Pinochet arrest bring British

ambassador to tears &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ Britain's ambassador to Brazil
reportedly cried openly during a meeting with opposition
politicians who voiced their support for the arrest of former
Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet.
	   ``I remember very sad stories. Torture suffered by adults and
children. It was a very hard time,'' Thursday's Folha de Sao Paulo
newspaper quoted Ambassador Donald Keith Haskell as saying between
sobs.
	   British authorities arrested Pinochet on Oct. 16 at the request
of a Spanish magistrate.
	   Haskell was Britain's ambassador to Chile from 1975 to 1978.
Pinochet ruled the country from 1973 to 1990.
	   Brazil's Health Minister Jose Serra, who was exiled in Chile
during much of Brazil's military dictatorship, also voiced support
for Pinochet's arrest Wednesday.
	   ``Pinochet is an assassin, one of the biggest assassins alive. I
think he's having a very generous finish to his life after all that
he has done,'' said Serra, the first senior official to comment on
the subject.
	   Serra was briefly detained after Pinochet overthrew Chile's
then-president Salvador Allende in 1973. After he was released,
Serra holed-up in the Italian embassy and left the country.
	   Brazil's President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who was also
exiled for a time in Chile, has not commented on the arrest.

No worries for Waldorf in first round of Disney Classic
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAKE BUENA VISTA, Florida (AP) _ Too low on the money list to
think about the Tour Championship and too high up to worry about
losing his card, Duffy Waldorf is one player who can truly enjoy
himself in Disney's National Car Rental Classic.
	   It showed Thursday, when Waldorf matched his career-low round of
9-under-par 63 in the first round to take a three-stroke lead over
Tiger Woods, Jesper Parnevik and Len Mattiace.
	   ``It was a fun day to play,'' Waldorf said. ``I don't know if
everyone else was having fun, but I thought it was.''
	   Woods, playing his first PGA Tour event since the World Series
of Golf in late August, had a three-putt bogey on his 15th hole _
the same problem that haunted him the past two weeks in Britain _
but had an otherwise routine round of 66.
	   John Huston, the 1992 Disney champion when he set the tournament
scoring record of 26-under 262, was in a group at 67 that included
51-year-old Larry Nelson, who has won this event twice and has
seven top-10 finishes.
	   Defending champion David Duval bogeyed the last two holes for a
68. PGA champion Vijay Singh shot 69, Mark O'Meara was at 71 and
Phil Mickelson, playing Disney for the first time in six years,
struggled to a 73.
	   Waldorf, Woods and Parnevik played the Palm course, which played
about a half-stroke easier than the Magnolia. After two days of a
pro-am format, the final two rounds will be played on Magnolia.
	   The Disney Classic isn't a week of leisure for everyone. The
final full-field tournament of the season is one last chance for
some players to get into the top 30 for the lucrative Tour
Championship next week, and for others to get into the top 125 on
the money list and keep their exempt status for 1999.
	   ``There are a few guys right on the line of keeping their cards,
so they might not go on Space Mountain as many times as the other
ones do,'' Parnevik said.
	   Waldorf, 102nd on the money list this year, was on one of those
bubbles two years ago _ 30th on the money list coming into the
Disney, in which he tied for 29th and then waited out the final few
hours at a theme park to see if Payne Stewart would knock him out
of the Tour Championship.
	   ``It was a hard way to spend time at Disney,'' Waldorf said.
``But this week is great. I'm going to Blizzard Beach as soon as I
leave here.''
	   Despite a bogey on the final hole, his 63 was a superb effort.
The 20 mph (32 kmph) wind gusts made it difficult to gauge the
distance, and dry conditions made it hard to hold the greens.
Waldorf tried out a new putter on Thursday, and this one could be a
keeper.
	   He birdied the first four holes and 10 of the first 16 from just
about everywhere _ two putts over 30 feet (9 meters), a chip-in
from 40 feet (12 meters) and a couple up-and-downs on the par 5s
for birdies.
	   ``He has a new putter in his bag that he obviously liked,'' said
Parnevik, who was in the group with Waldorf. ``After the first four
birdies, he had about an 85-footer (26 meters) on No. 5 and it
lipped out. That's when I knew ... he was definitely hot today.''
	   A putting performance like that might do Woods a world of good.
	   While he says his consistency his vastly improved from a year
ago, Woods has only one victory on American soil this year.
	   Two weeks ago, he had a chance to catch Santiago Luna on the
last hole of the Dunhill Cup but missed a 4-footer (1.2 meters)
that gave Spain a shocking semifinal victory. And last week in the
finals of the World Match Play Championship against Mark O'Meara,
Woods three-putted from about 10 feet (3 meters) give his neighbor
the upper hand.
	   ``It's something you shouldn't get discouraged about,'' he said.
``Just keep plugging along and trusting your lines. They'll start
going in. Today, I trusted my lines and they went in.''

Madison Square Garden reported site of Holyfield-Lewis fight
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Evander Holyfield-Lennox Lewis heavyweight
unification fight could be headed for Madison Square Garden instead
of Las Vegas.
	   Without citing a source, the British domestic news agency the
Press Association said Thursday Madison Square Gardens was the site
with March 13 the likely date.
	   Holyfield, the WBA and IBF champion, has signed for the bout and
WBC champion Lewis is expected to sign shortly.
	   ``There are no major problems with the fight, there are just a
couple of legal things to sort out. The television is all agreed,''
Lewis' manager Frank Maloney said.
	   ``If the fight does take place at Madison Square Garden it will
be a great privilege,'' Maloney added. ``Most people remember the
other great heavyweight fight of modern times there between
Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier in 1971.''

Russia fears Kosovo resolution may authorize military action
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS; UPDATES throughout with progress on Kosovo
resolution; CHANGES byline &QL; 
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. Security Council made
``substantial progress'' Thursday on a resolution endorsing the
Kosovo peace deal, but Russia raised objections that the resolution
might authorize military action.
	   Russia and China have opposed any language threatening Serbs and
ethnic Albanians with force if they don't comply with the Oct. 12
agreement, which averted NATO strikes on Serb targets.
	   The Security Council discussed a draft resolution Thursday but
diplomatic sources said Russia objected to three paragraphs which
it said would give NATO ``carte blanche'' to take military action.
	   The draft paragraphs in question would give NATO the right ``to
take steps'' to ensure full implementation of the deal and to
ensure the safety of a 2,000-strong team which would verify the
agreement.
	   Under the deal brokered by U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke,
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic agreed to a ceasefire, to
withdraw his special police forces, and to allow the unarmed
``verifiers'' to roam Kosovo and ensure fighting between Serbs and
ethnic Albanians has ceased.
	   ``This is supposed to be as tough a resolution as we can get,''
a Western diplomat said. ``This is not a carte blanche for military
intervention. What it is is a resolution to put as much pressure on
Milosevic to comply as possible. If it keeps him guessing, so much
the better.''
	   The Russians told council members they would offer amendments to
ensure that there is no threat of international intervention,
diplomatic sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   British Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock, the current council
president, told reporters that the council ``made substantial
progress in taking a draft resolution forward'' and hoped to have
it adopted ``as soon as possible.''
	   Diplomats and U.N. officials said the council was aiming for a
vote on Friday.
	   The council's failure to adopt a resolution giving legal backing
to the Kosovo accord is stalling efforts to organize a team to
verify compliance.
	   The operation is to be directed by the Vienna-based Organization
for Security and Cooperation, which must ask its 54 member states
to provide personnel for the mission.
	   Greenstock said the agreement requires the council to give its
backing to the OSCE mission _ and would-be contributors want that
endorsement before they will commit any personnel.
	   Fighting between Serb forces and ethnic Albanians _ who make up
90 percent of Kosovo _ has killed hundreds of people and forced
around 300,000 from their homes since a Serb crackdown began in
February. Serbia is the largest of the two republics that make up
Yugoslavia.

Pepper, Sorenstam get grip on wind
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS punctuation in 1st graf and number of birdies in 12th
graf &QL; 
 &UR; By EDDIE PELLS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   THE VILLAGES, Florida (AP) _ As a warm and humid week suddenly
turned windy in central Florida, Dottie Pepper and Annika Sorenstam
were among the few who seemed prepared.
	   Pepper and Sorenstam shot 3-under-par 69s Thursday to share the
lead after the wind-blown opening round of the Samsung World
Championship of Women's Golf.
	   Brandie Burton and Juli Inkster trailed the leaders by one
stroke.
	   At 1-under, Karrie Webb was the only other player in the
16-woman field to break par on the Tierra Del Sol course that had
been touted as an easy mark in practice rounds all week.
	   Pepper, trying to win her first tournament in more than two
seasons, said she practiced in blustery South Carolina wind last
week.
	   ``My instructor said, `You realize it will be like this next
weekend,''' Pepper said. ``It's fall. The cold fronts start to
reach this far. You have to be prepared for the windy weather.''
	   Players said the steady, swirling 20 mph (32 kmph) wind cost
them from 1 1/2 to three clubs in distance. Because of the weather,
tournament officials moved the tee box on the par-5 16th hole up 25
yards (23 meters) and shortened the par-5 18th by 50 yards (46
meters).
	   The wind made for an ugly stat sheet. For example, Inkster hit
only nine of 18 greens in regulation. Burton finished the front
nine 2-under despite hitting only three of nine greens.
	   ``You just try to bunt it around and try to keep it under the
wind,'' Burton said. ``Sometimes I did, sometimes I didn't. It
wasn't very pretty, but you just stood up there and tried to hit
knock-down shots all day.''
	   Playing just an hour away from her new home in Orlando, South
Korean rookie Se Ri Pak was tied with Helen Alfredsson at even-par
72, but Pak's round was far from routine.
	   The winner of this year's LPGA Championship and U.S. Open made
five bogeys on the front nine, capped by a three-putt on No. 8
after which she flung her putter toward the bag.
	   She followed with six birdies on the back and finished the round
with six birdies, six bogeys and six pars, making for an exciting
day for the large gallery that followed her round.
	   ``The front nine was unbelievable,'' Pak said. ``It was like
bogey after bogey and I don't make a lot of bogeys. But I just
wasn't comfortable. After the front nine, I went with new thinking.
I changed my mind and just got more comfortable with myself.''
	   Sorenstam came into the tournament as the tour money leader and
with a slim 28-point lead over Pak in the points race for LPGA
Player of the Year. She played in the twosome with Pak and enjoyed
a far more consistent round.
	   ``You have to plan every shot,'' Sorenstam said of the windy
conditions. ``It's a much longer course today. But I love to think
my way around the golf course. That's how I like to play.''
	   With Sorenstam in the clubhouse, Pepper carried a one-stroke
lead into No. 18 before three-putting the final hole to finish in a
tie. She rolled her birdie putt eight feet past the cup and missed
the par try coming back.
	   ``I'm not upset because it was an aggressive bogey,'' Pepper
said. ``If I hit it three feet short and miss, I would have been
more annoyed. And if I hit it in the middle of the round, nobody
would have cared.''
	   The 16-player field includes the winners of the four major
championships along with the U.S. Amateur champion. Top money
winners and leaders on international circuits round out the field.

Head of Human Genome Project says work may be completed two years
</HEADLINE>
early &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ A complete map of the human genetic pattern
can be finished by 2003, two years ahead of schedule.
	   That's the plan of officials running the Human Genome Project, a
federal program to sequence all of the 60,000 to 80,000 genes that
are present in human DNA, according to a statement to be published
Friday in the journal Science.
	   Francis S. Collins, director of the National Human Genome
Research Institute, was first author of the statement.
	   ``Recent technological developments and experience with
large-scale sequencing provide increasing confidence that it will
be possible to complete an accurate, high-quality sequence of the
human genome by the end of 2003, two years sooner than previously
predicted,'' the statement said.
	   About 70 percent of the work will be accomplished by agencies of
the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health,
with the rest of the sequencing to come from international partners
and the Sanger Centre, a research group financed by the Wellcome
Trust, the statement said.
	   As an indication of the progress, Science also published a
physical map of 30,181 human genes. The new map is twice is big as
a previously published map and is two to three times more accurate,
researchers say.
	   The map contains almost half of all the human genes, experts
say.
	   In another study, researchers announced that they have sequenced
the entire gene structure for Chlamydia trachomatis, an organism
that is the cause of the most common sexually transmitted bacterial
disease in the United States. The bacteria also is linked to
trachoma, a major cause of blindness in Asia and Africa.
	   Dr. Richard Stephens of the University of California, Berkeley,
lead author of the study, said sequencing the gene structure of
Chlamydia trachomatis will help scientists develop a vaccine and
find better ways of diagnosing the disease.
	   Chlamydia infections are most common among sexually active teens
between the ages of 14 and 19. The bacteria can infect both sexes,
but its most serious effect is in women who can suffer pelvic pain
and scarring that can cause infertility.
	   ``From 60 to 70 percent of new chlamydial infections go

a very significant disease agent in teen-age girls.''

Now the toughest part: keeping Yankees together
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RONALD BLUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN DIEGO (AP) _ Winning the World Series in record-setting
fashion was difficult for the New York Yankees.
	   Keeping the team together may be impossible.
	   Just 35 minutes after the Yankees finished their sweep of San
Diego on Wednesday night, Bernie Williams, David Cone and Series
MVP Scott Brosius became eligible for free agency.
	   ``I have a lot of memories here and playing here,'' Williams
said, perhaps wearing a Yankees uniform for the final time. ``I
don't know anything else.''
	   Yet the center fielder and clubhouse anchor could be leaving if
New York doesn't meet his demand for a seven-year contract with a
no-trade clause.
	   ``For family reasons, Bernie has said all along a seven-year
contract is the mandate,'' his agent, Scott Boras, said Thursday.
``He want to be in one place for seven years, have a base for his
family.''
	   After failing to work out a multiyear deal, Williams and the
Yankees agreed last winter to an dlrs 8.5 million, one-year
contract. He is expected to ask for dlrs 10 million a year in his
next deal.
	   ``We're going to hear what every organization has to say,''
Boras said. ``The decision will be based on family, competitiveness
of the club and the economics involved.''
	   Economics will determine much for the Yankees, whose dlrs 63.5
million payroll on opening day was baseball's second-highest behind
Baltimore.
	   ``The Bernie Williams situation is first and foremost with us,''
general manager Brian Cashman said. ``It's going to be difficult to
keep everyone.''
	   In the next few weeks, New York must decide whether to exercise
options on DH Darryl Strawberry and catcher Joe Girardi, and will
find out whether 20-gamer winner David Cone exercises his dlrs 5.5
million player option or decides to become a free agent.
	   Strawberry, recovering from colon cancer surgery, became a
rallying point for the Yankees during the postseason. But he won't
come cheap: The option is for dlrs 2.5 million with a dlrs 100,000
buyout.
	   Girardi, who shared catching duties with Jorge Posada, has a
dlrs 3.4 million option with a dlrs 400,000 buyout.
	   Tim Raines, who hit .290 with 47 RBIs, probably won't be back,
especially following the late-season emergence of Shane Spencer and
Ricky Ledee.
	   Then there's Brosius, who revitalized after an offseason trade
from Oakland, hitting .300 with 19 homers and 98 RBIs. He batted
.383 in the postseason, leading New York in hits (18), home runs
(4) and RBIs (15), and earned Series MVP honors by going 8-for-17
(.471) with two homers and six RBIs.
	   Waiting behind him his Mike Lowell, who hit .304 at Triple-A
Columbus with 26 homers and 99 RBIs.
	   ``Everything impacts on everything,'' said Gene Michael, the
Yankees director of major league scouting and a key advisor to
owner George Steinbrenner. ``We'll just have to wait and see.''
	   If Williams leaves, the Yankees are expected to pursue Ray
Lankford of the St. Louis Cardinals. For now, Williams won't hint
if he prefers to stay with the Yankees.
	   ``I'll say it's probably as good as any other team right now,''
he said. ``I wouldn't know what it's like to play for another team.
And that is going to weigh into my decision.''

Argentine president expresses regret over Falklands War
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Argentina's President Carlos Menem has expressed
to the British people his regret for the 1982 war between the two
countries over the Falkland Islands, one week before he is due to
arrive in Britain as the first Argentine president to visit since
the conflict.
	   ``1982 was a sad and traumatic blot in the history of our
relations,'' he wrote in an article for Friday's edition of The
Sun, Britain's highest selling tabloid newspaper.
	   ``Some brave young Argentine and British soldiers lost their
lives in a conflict that should never have happened and that we
deeply regret,'' said Menem, who will start a five-day visit to
Britain Oct. 28.
	   He did not, however, renounce Argentina's claim to the
wind-swept archipelago in the south Atlantic populated by 2,200
British-descended islanders.
	   He said Argentina, which unsuccessfully invaded the islands in
1982, was now formally committed to pursuing its claim on the
Falklands ``exclusively by peaceful means.''
	   ``Argentina is today a different country from what it was in
1982,'' he said.
	   He praised Prime Minister Tony Blair's leadership and said
Argentina owed its love of soccer, rugby and polo to the British.
	   Blair welcomed Menem's comments about the Falklands War, saying,
``President Menem's visit is an important opportunity to build a
modern relationship.
	   ``We will never forget the heroism of our forces or the tragic
loss of life,'' he said. ``But it is clear President Menem is
coming here in a spirit of reconciliation.''
	   Opposition Conservative leader William Hague told the newspaper
he also welcomed the comments.
	   Also in the paper, Simon Weston, a former soldier wounded in the
Falklands War, welcomed the president's words as ``a very brave
thing,'' but warned Britain must stay vigilant in case Menem was
toppled by a more ``hawkish regime.''
	   Menem's address followed an article in the same newspaper
earlier this year by Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto
expressing regret for his country's treatment of British prisoners
of war during World War II.
	   A spokesman from Blair's office said that following the success
of Hashimoto's article, The Sun's editor asked the Blair's press
secretary, Alastair Campbell, to approach the Argentine government
for an article from Menem.
	   ``The president was happy to do this as a way of building on the
theme of reconciliation which he hopes will be part of his visit
next week,'' said the spokesman, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   During the Falklands War, The Sun infamously announced the
sinking of an Argentine warship with the front page headline
``Gotcha!''

Soldiers dispatched to Nigerian town after ethnic clash
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Nigeria-Explosion &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WARRI, Nigeria (AP) _ Soldiers were dispatched to this southern
Nigerian town Thursday after clashes broke out between rival ethnic
groups, witnesses said.
	   Dozens of soldiers set up checkpoints at key intersections after
renewed fighting had erupted between ethnic Ijaws and Itshekiris,
said the witnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity. While
shooting could occasionally be heard earlier in the evening, it was
not immediately clear who was shooting or if anyone was hit.
	   The enmity between the two ethnic groups _ which sparks regular
clashes _ is rooted in a fight over control of oil-producing areas
and anger after a local government office was moved from an Ijaw
neighborhood to an Itshekiri part of town.
	   Ijaw youth have also repeatedly attacked Western oil
installations in the Niger River delta region in recent weeks,
demanding better roads, schools and political representation.
	   Warre is about 30 kms (20 miles) from the town of Jesse, where
at least 700 people were killed over the weekend when a fireball
tore through hundreds of people scavenging gasoline spilling from a
pipeline.
	   There was no connection between the fireball and Thursday's
fighting.

Let the debate begin: Are these Yankees the best team ever?
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BEN WALKER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Baseball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN DIEGO (AP) _ There is no true superstar among them, no one
close in stature to a Reggie, Rose or Ruth.
	   Not a certain Hall of Famer in the bunch, not like DiMaggio,
Mantle or Bench. No pitcher likely to win the Cy Young Award, no
slugger who finished in the top 35 in home runs.
	   Not even a single player elected to start in the All-Star game.
	   In the end, there was a much better way to explain the greatness
of these New York Yankees.
	   ``The one thing I would love to have people think about is
there's no one name that comes to mind, but the team itself,''
manager Joe Torre said.
	   And now, the debate begins: Are these Yankees, after winning
their record 24th World Series championship with a sweep of the San
Diego Padres and finishing with an overall record of 125-50, the
best team ever?
	   Better than Murderers' Row, the Big Red Machine or the swingin'
Oakland A's?
	   ``I think that will probably be talked about forever,'' Series
MVP Scott Brosius said. ``The comparisons will go on and on, and
maybe nobody will have a definite answer for the best team of all
time.
	   ``But you can look at this year and say we had the best single
season of any other team, and that's a great accomplishment.''
	   Fitting, too, that Brosius won the MVP award after going
8-for-17 with six RBIs in four games. Steady but not flashy, the
third baseman spent most of the season batting ninth _ just another
player doing his job.
	   And in a season that brought baseball some truly huge numbers,
from Mark McGwire's 70 home runs to Cal Ripken's 2,632 consecutive
games to Kerry Wood's 20 strikeouts, the Yankees posted one that
may remain for a long time _ 125 wins.
	   The Yankees' .714 winning percentage was an appropriate figure,
seeing how it matched the Babe's home run total, and was the
highest in the majors since the 1927 Yankees led by Ruth and Lou
Gehrig.
	   ``'27 Yankees, they may have a better club, but we had the best
record,'' Torre said. ``To me, that was the standard that I was
looking to pass because the Yankees _ more important to have a
Yankee record than anything else.
	   ``You look at the Oakland A's clubs that won a few world
championships in a row and the Cincinnati club in '76 that was
always a standard for me, I think we have better pitching than they
have. We have to take a backseat to no one in my lifetime.''
	   New York's second title in three years even caused owner George
Steinbrenner to get weepy in the clubhouse.
	   ``There has never been a better team than this one,'' he said.
``We created something truly special here.''
	   Hard to imagine now that the Yankees' season began in a shaky
manner in Southern California.
	   Expected by many to rack up a big win total in this expansion
year, New York lost its first two games at Anaheim. A loss at
Oakland gave the Yankees their first 0-3 start since 1985 and
prompted speculation that Torre's job might be in jeopardy.
	   The next day, they became the last team in the majors to hit a
home run in beating Oakland. And pretty much after that, the whole
year became one big highlight reel.
	   By the end of April, they were in first place with a 17-6
record. The month brought an unexpected event _ a 500-pound
expansion joint fell into the loge level at Yankee Stadium, causing
two games to be rescheduled and another to be moved to Shea
Stadium.
	   David Wells' perfect game and a wild brawl with Baltimore marked
May, and Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez won his major league debut
in June. In July, eventual AL batting champion Bernie Williams
homered in his return after missing 31 games because of an injured
knee.
	   The Yankees went on to become the first team ever to clinch a
playoff spot in August, a month in which they set a major league
record by leading in 48 straight games.
	   September saw them break the AL record with 114 wins and the
emergence of rookie Shane Spencer, who hit three grand slams in a
month.
	   New York began its 11-2 run through the postseason with a
three-game sweep of Texas in the division series, though there was
ominous news _ Darryl Strawberry had colon cancer. The slugger
underwent surgery and his teammates embroidered his No. 39 on their
hats.
	   The Yankees' only real trouble came in the American League
championship series, when they trailed two games to one to
Cleveland. But El Duque rescued them in Game 4, and New York never
lost again.

Mexico's peso strengthens, stocks also rise
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexico's peso closed at its highest level
since Sept. 3 as worries about Latin American markets eased because
of Brazil's preliminary agreement with the International Monetary
Fund.
	   Banking leader Banamex quoto the peso closing at 9.965 per
dollar, stronger from its close Wednesday of 10.005.
	   Mexican stocks also closed sharply higher, led by a rally in
financial shares. The key IPC index closed up 175.54 points, or 4.6
percent, to 4025.99, according to preliminary figures.
	   It was the fifth biggest gain of the year in percentage terms
and the first close above 4000 points since Aug. 5.
	   The IPC has soared 41.9 percent since Sept. 10, when it ended at
2856.10. But it still remains below its Jan. 1 leel of 4229.35.
	   The peso has now strengthened for seven consecutive sessions,
boosted by the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision last week to lower
interest rates and by the IMF aid agreement with Brazil.
	   In Mexican peso futures trading on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, the December contract ended at 10.304 per dollar after
closing Wednesday at 10.3869.

Family reunion may await `El Duque'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with additional background &QL; 
 &UR; By JUDIE GLAVE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Orlando Hernandez may be reunited with his
family in the United States, 10 months after the New York Yankees
pitcher defected from Cuba on a raft.
	   Only this time, his relatives will be leaving the island with
the Cuban government's blessing.
	   Hernandez's ex-wife, their two daughters and his mother have
been granted permission by Cuba to fly to the United States, said
Maria Cubas of Miami, whose husband helped Hernandez defect.
	   ``Until they're in the air, we don't want to confirm anything,''
she said.
	   The U.S. State Department confirmed the plans Thursday and said
the family, which includes Hernandez's daughters Steffi, 2, and
Yahumara, 7, would return to Cuba after a brief visit.
	   Orlando Hernandez helped lead the Yankees to a 9-3 victory
Sunday in Game 2 of the World Series, which New York won in a sweep
of San Diego on Wednesday night.
	   Maria Cubas said the family hoped to fly into Miami and then
travel to New York for Friday's World Series parade.
	   The Fox News Channel first reported that ``El Duque,'' who
hasn't seen his family since he escaped Cuba last December, would
be reunited with his relatives.
	   U.S. Rep. Jose Serrano, a Bronx congressman, has been working
with the Vatican and other groups to get Hernandez's family to the
United States.
	   ``It's just enough to know that a mother is going to get to see
her son,'' Serrano said.
	   Hernandez's half-brother, Livan, also played baseball in Cuba
and defected during a team trip to Mexico in 1995. He was the 1997
World Series MVP for the Florida Marlins and his mother was allowed
to fly from Cuba to Miami to visit him just before Game 7.
	   Juan Iglesias, Livan Hernandez's agent, said he didn't know
anything about the latest Hernandez family visit, only that ``El
Duque'' was planning to fly to Miami after Friday's parade and City
Hall ceremony to visit his brother.
	   Hernandez, who signed a four-year dlrs 6.6 million contract with
the Yankees in March, was banned from playing in Cuba for dealing
with American major league scouts.
	   He fled Cuba by climbing onto a rickety raft with his wife,
Noris Bosch, and six others. They landed on a remote Bahamian
island and were rescued by the U.S. Coast Guard.

Brazil stocks rise for fourth straight day
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Brazilian stock markets rose for the
fourth straight day Thursday, propelled by the belief that the
announcement of an economic relief package from International
Monetary Fund (IMF) and private lending institutions was imminent.
	   Sao Paulo's Bovespa stock exchange closed up 3.4 percent and the
smaller Rio de Janeiro stock exchange gained 2.9 percent.
	   ``Foreign buyers are coming back due to optimism over the IMF
package, and confidence in the government's fiscal measures next
week,'' said one Sao Paulo trader, who noted that volume swelled as
a result.
	   The IMF's first deputy managing director Stanley Fischer will
meet with Brazilian Finance Minister Pedro Malan in Rio de Janeiro
Friday, raising market expectation on what is expected to be a dlrs
30 billion package.

<TEXT>
	   PARAMARIBO, Suriname (AP) _ Suriname's president on Thursday
denied accusations he ordered police to break into a Supreme Court
office and change the locks so that an unpopular appointee could
move in.
	   President Jules Wijdenbosch said during a news conference he had
been unaware of the action.
	   Opposition politicians ``are misleading the people,''
Wijdenbosch said. ``They have stooped very low,'' he added.
	   Other supreme court justices refused to give office keys to
Alfred Veldema, whom Wijdenbosh appointed chief justice in July.
They claim his appointment violated a constitutional clause
requiring that they be consulted about such nominations.
	   On Wednesday, thousands of people marched through downtown
Paramaribo to protest the appointment.
	   ``I have talked with the member of the high court five times
attempting to find a solution,'' Wijdenbosh said. He has refused to
reverse Veldema's appointment.

Griffith Joyner's brain abnormality can trigger seizures
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JANE E. ALLEN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Science Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ The brain malformation responsible for the
death of track star Florence Griffith Joyner can produce epileptic
seizures _ sudden episodes of abnormal electrical activity in the
brain.
	   Authorities announced Thursday that Griffith Joyner suffered
from a cavernous angioma in the brain.
	   That congenital blood vessel abnormality is found in one in 400
Americans, according to Dr. Marc Nuwer, a neurologist and
co-director of the adult epilepsy program at UCLA.
	   Cavernous angiomas, which may be detected by CT scans or MRIs,
can bleed and trigger seizures in a small number of people, Nuwer
said. He's currently treating a dozen such patients.
	   Although blood pressure medications or blood thinners like
aspirin can trigger their bleeding, ``most is spontaneous and has
no relationship to anything,'' he said.
	   About one in 200 people have a seizure disorder called epilepsy,
which can start at any age, but is most common in the very young
and very old. Causes include stress, fatigue, illness, head injury,
stroke, drug use, drug withdrawal or a chemical imbalance.
	   However, two-thirds of seizures have no known cause or are
simply inherited.
	   Some seizure patients lose consciousness, others don't. Seizure
medicines often stop the episodes completely.
	   ``Seizures are somewhat more common in sleep than during
wakefulness,'' Nuwer said.
	   Griffith Joyner may never have shown symptoms of the angioma or
epilepsy.
	   ``I would not call her an epileptic if this was her first
seizure,'' he said. But if she had a seizure two years ago as
previously reported, ``then she does fit the definition of epilepsy
because it's her second unprovoked seizure.''
	   Officials said Griffith Joyner suffocated in her sleep.
Epileptics usually have enough reflexes during a seizure to move
around and protect themselves, Nuwer said.
	   He suggested she most likely suffered from ``sudden unexplained
epileptic death.'' About one in 1,000 people with seizure disorders
are ``simply found dead in bed'' and doctors don't know why, he
said.
	   Griffith Joyner also could have suffered from ``grand mal
status,'' one major seizure after another.

Mexico's peso strengthens, stocks also rise
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CLARIFIES that Brazil has not yet reached agreement with IMF,
ADDS meeting with IMF official expected Friday. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexico's peso closed at its highest level
since Sept. 3 as worries about Latin American markets eased because
of Brazil's expected agreement with the International Monetary
Fund.
	   Banking leader Banamex quoto the peso closing at 9.965 per
dollar, stronger from its close Wednesday of 10.005.
	   Mexican stocks also closed sharply higher, led by a rally in
financial shares. The key IPC index closed up 175.54 points, or 4.6
percent, to 4025.99, according to preliminary figures.
	   It was the fifth biggest gain of the year in percentage terms
and the first close above 4000 points since Aug. 5.
	   The IPC has soared 41.9 percent since Sept. 10, when it ended at
2856.10. But it still remains below its Jan. 1 leel of 4229.35.
	   The peso has now strengthened for seven consecutive sessions,
boosted by the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision last week to lower
interest rates and by Tuesday's announcement that the IMF and
Brazil are expected to reach agreement soon on an aid package.
	   The IMF's first deputy managing director Stanley Fischer will
meet with Brazilian Finance Minister Pedro Malan in Rio de Janeiro
Friday, raising market expectation on what is expected to be a dlrs
30 billion package.
	   In Mexican peso futures trading on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, the December contract ended at 10.304 per dollar after
closing Wednesday at 10.3869.

Family reunion may await `El Duque'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with additional background &QL; 
 &UR; By JUDIE GLAVE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Orlando Hernandez may be reunited with his
family in the United States, 10 months after the New York Yankees
pitcher defected from Cuba on a raft.
	   Only this time, his relatives will be leaving the island with
the Cuban government's blessing.
	   Hernandez's ex-wife, their two daughters and his mother have
been granted permission by Cuba to fly to the United States, said
Maria Cubas of Miami, whose husband helped Hernandez defect.
	   ``Until they're in the air, we don't want to confirm anything,''
she said.
	   The U.S. State Department confirmed the plans Thursday and said
the family, which includes Hernandez's daughters Steffi, 2, and
Yahumara, 7, would return to Cuba after a brief visit.
	   Orlando Hernandez helped lead the Yankees to a 9-3 victory
Sunday in Game 2 of the World Series, which New York won in a sweep
of San Diego on Wednesday night.
	   Maria Cubas said the family hoped to fly into Miami and then
travel to New York for Friday's World Series parade.
	   The Fox News Channel first reported that ``El Duque,'' who
hasn't seen his family since he escaped Cuba last December, would
be reunited with his relatives.
	   U.S. Rep. Jose Serrano, a Bronx congressman, has been working
with the Vatican and other groups to get Hernandez's family to the
United States.
	   ``It's just enough to know that a mother is going to get to see
her son,'' Serrano said.
	   Hernandez's half-brother, Livan, also played baseball in Cuba
and defected during a team trip to Mexico in 1995. He was the 1997
World Series MVP for the Florida Marlins and his mother was allowed
to fly from Cuba to Miami to visit him just before Game 7.
	   Juan Iglesias, Livan Hernandez's agent, said he didn't know
anything about the latest Hernandez family visit, only that ``El
Duque'' was planning to fly to Miami after Friday's parade and City
Hall ceremony to visit his brother.
	   Hernandez, who signed a four-year dlrs 6.6 million contract with
the Yankees in March, was banned from playing in Cuba for dealing
with American major league scouts.
	   He fled Cuba by climbing onto a rickety raft with his wife,
Noris Bosch, and six others. They landed on a remote Bahamian
island and were rescued by the U.S. Coast Guard.

President: Drug war can't impede peace process
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By FRANK BAJAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ President Andres Pastrana said Thursday
that he will not let the drug war, long the top U.S. priority in
this country, impede his efforts to make peace and characterized
leftist rebels as potential allies in a new anti-narcotics
strategy.
	   ``My government will not allow peace to be hijacked by
narcotics,'' Pastrana said in a speech at the presidential palace.
``Prolonging the conflict in Colombia benefits first and foremost
the drug bosses,''
	   The speech, in a reception for the Interamerican Development
Bank's president, Enrique Iglesias, intended to stress Pastrana's
contention that peace offers the best chance for defeating drug
trafficking. Colombia exports more than 80 percent of the world's
cocaine and a growing amount of heroin.
	   Pastrana goes to Washington on Tuesday for the first state visit
in 30 years by a Colombian president.
	   U.S. lawmakers have threatened to cut anti-narcotics aid if
Pastrana stops aerial eradication as part an eventual deal with
rebels. The threat was included in a bill passed by the U.S.
Congress Wednesday that included more than dlrs 200 million in
additional anti-drug aid for Colombia.
	   Drug crop eradication has been a failure and an environmental
menace, maintains Pastrana, who is pushing for a plan to promote
alternative development to wean peasants off drug crops.
	   Some 30 percent of Colombia's 80,000 hectares (200,000 acres) of
coca crop, the raw material of cocaine, is grown in an area the
size of Switzerland from which the army is to pull out by Nov. 7.
The pullout is meant to facilitate peace talks with the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, the country's
oldest and largest rebel band.
	   U.S. critics of the pullout fear it will facilitate the movement
of cocaine out of a vast region of southern Colombia.
	   Not only U.S. congressmen, but Colombian police and independent
analysts say many FARC fronts are closely linked to drug production
in the region and have gained military strength in part through
``taxing'' coca-growers and cocaine laboratories.
	   Pastrana insisted the rebels ``understand that drug production,
as the chief economic activity in their areas of influence, present
a grave risk to their political program.'' He said no one has
proven that ``an inextinguishable pact'' exists between drug
traffickers and rebels.
	   Pastrana said the existence of drug crops in rebel zones is
better attributed to the lack of state authority in such areas that
allows drug traffickers to operate at will.

Reports: Troubled Japanese bank applies for nationalization
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's troubled Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan
Ltd. formally asked Friday to be nationalized under newly passed
legislation aimed at revitalizing the country's crisis-ridden
financial sector, media reports said.
	   The application, made directly to Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi,
was likely to lead to the first government take-over of a bank
since the end of World War II, the reports said.
	   Obuchi was expected to formally decide by the end of the day to
nationalize the bank, Kyodo News agency reported.
	   The reported move by LTCB, which was once a pillar of Japan's
postwar financial system but has recently struggled under a massive
load of bad loans, had been widely anticipated.
	   The Tokyo Stock Exchange suspended trading in shares of the bank
before the market opened on Friday. LTCB shares had fallen to a
record low of 2 yen (dlrs 0.17) earlier this week.
	   Japan's Financial Supervisory Agency was likely to declare that
the bank's debts exceed its assets, making it insolvent, the
Mainichi newspaper reported. The FSA ruling was expected as soon as
next week, the Asahi newspaper said.
	   Earlier this month Japan's Parliament passed laws allowing the
government to take control of foundering banks to fix them or shut
them down by pumping up to 60 trillion yen (dlrs 515 billion) in
taxpayer funds into the ailing banking system.
	   The bank rescue package has been seen as a crucial step toward
cleaning up the huge number of soured loans left by the collapse in
the early 1990s of a speculative boom in Japanese real estate and
stock prices.
	   It also comes as a key part of the country's efforts to overcome
its deepest recession since the end of World War II.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks rose for a seventh consecutive session
Thursday, with the blue-chip sector overcoming weak profit reports
from Dow components 3M and Chevron. The Dow Jones industrial
average bounced back from a loss of 97 points and rose 13.91 points
to 8,533.14, extending an increasingly anemic winning streak to
seven sessions. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Federal Reserve policy-makers reduced
short-term interest rates last week because of financial market
turmoil in general, not because they knew of a specific impending
disaster, a Fed board member said Thursday. Central bank officials
surprised Wall Street on Oct. 15 with the second interest-rate
reduction in 16 days because they reasoned ``it is probably better
to be ahead of challenges, not reacting to events,'' Roger W.
Ferguson Jr. said in a speech. The cut had elicited speculation
that more bad news, such as last month's near collapse of the hedge
fund Long Term Capital Management L.P., was imminent. But, Ferguson
said, ``We based our decision on our analysis of the general tenor
of financial markets and their likely effects on the economy, not
on foreknowledge of a major financial disaster, as some have
speculated.'' (US-ECONOMY)
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Germany's central bank, the
Bundesbank, left key interest rates unchanged Thursday, despite
growing international and domestic pressure to cut rates to aid
flagging growth. In a widely expected move, a regular meeting of
the central bank's council reconfirmed the country's key rate at
3.3 percent. The rate has held steady since October 1997. Germany's
interest rates are already among the lowest in the world, but two
recent rate cuts in the United States have increased pressure on
the Bundesbank to follow suit. Germany's central bankers, who
fiercely guard the independence of their respected institution, say
a rate cut will only be made if Europe's economy needs it.
(GERMANY-INTEREST RATES)
	   SEATTLE (AP) _ Boeing Co., still contending with production
problems and fretting about the continued impact of the Asian
financial crisis, reported third-quarter net earnings of dlrs 347
million, compared to a loss a year earlier. Boeing said its sales
improved during the quarter because it delivered more aircraft than
in the third quarter of 1997. But it said price pressures had kept
its profit margins in check. The company's earnings translated to
36 cents per diluted share and compared with a loss of dlrs 696
million or 72 cents a diluted share, a year ago, when the brunt of
the production difficulties hit. Revenues for the quarter were dlrs
12.7 billion, up 12 percent from dlrs 11.4 billion a year ago.
(US-EARNS-BOEING)
	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ Novartis, the Swiss drug giant, said
its nine-month group sales rose 3 percent to 24.6 billion Swiss
francs (dlrs 18.2 billion) from the same period last year. In
another important barometer of the company's performance, sales
before translation from the local currencies of its various markets
rose 6 percent in the first nine months. The sales percentages for
the third quarter alone rose 7 percent in francs and 12 percent in
local currencies. Novartis attributed the improvement to higher
productivity and high volume growth in the health care division,
its largest. Nine-month sales there rose 4 percent in francs and 7
percent in local currencies. (SWITZERLAND-NOVARTIS)
	   BERLIN (AP) _ European Central Bank President Wim Duisenberg
said Thursday that Europe's new single currency, the euro, won't
compete with the U.S. dollar as the currency of choice for foreign
reserves. The Frankfurt-based European Central Bank does not plan
to encourage the use of the euro as a reserve currency, Duisenberg
said, speaking at a conference in Berlin. The euro will be adopted
by 11 of the European Union's 15 countries on New Year's Day, but
won't go into circulation on the streets until 2002. It is the key
element of Europe's imminent economic and monetary merger.
(GERMANY-EURO)
	   PARIS (AP) _ The shipyards at the Normandy port of Le Havre will
be closed in two years, the Finance Ministry said Thursday, because
a buyer has not come forward with an offer to purchase them. The
government is essentially stopping the subsidies _ about 100
million francs (dlrs 18.2 million) a month _ that it had been
giving to keep the shipyards going. The ministry said in a
statement that the government had, since June 1997, done
``everything possible to support and maintain operations.''
Starting next week, the government will work on finding a way to
assure the 800 workers at the shipyards a future job.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   QUEENSTOWN, Maryland (AP) _ With key territorial and security
elements of an accord falling into place, Israeli and Palestinian
leaders turned to other nagging disputes Thursday in a drive to
conclude a West Bank land-for-peace agreement. As President Bill
Clinton turned up the pressure, diplomatic sources said there was
``basic agreement'' between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on an ``operating
system'' to combat terrorism. The sources, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said it would include a timetable for the arrest and
punishment of suspects identified by Israeli authorities. The CIA
would oversee the meting out of justice. Despite the progress that
followed an Israeli threat to pull out of the talks, State
Department spokesman James P. Rubin said obstacles to an agreement
remained. (US-MIDEAST TALKS)
	   LONDON _ Lawyers for Gen. Augusto Pinochet filed a court motion
Thursday contending British police acted illegally in accepting a
Spanish warrant seeking the extradition of the former Chilean
dictator. Lord Justice Konrad Schiemann set a Monday hearing on the
High Court motion and refused to let lawyers make any arguments
during a brief hearing. A Spanish magistrate is seeking to
extradite Pinochet to face charges of murder, torture and genocide.
Pinochet was arrested while recovering from back surgery in a
London hospital. He remains in the hospital. (BRITAIN-PINOCHET)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ Five days before a NATO deadline, Western
envoys said Thursday that President Slobodan Milosevic has still
not complied with demands for ending the Kosovo crisis and that
continuing violence threatens the peace process. In Belgrade, the
Yugoslav government repeated claims that it has already met a key
demand of NATO and the U.N. Security Council for ending the
crackdown by removing all special troops sent to the province.
Milosoevic launched the crackdown on Feb. 28 against ethnic
Albanian separatists. In the Kosovo capital Pristina, however, U.S.
envoy Christopher Hill told reporters that ``we are not satisfied
with the level of compliance.'' (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   JESSE, Nigeria _ No one will be arrested in connection with the
gasoline pipeline that erupted into an inferno, a government
official said Thursday, but Nigeria's state oil corporation has
reportedly demanded otherwise. The explosion and fire tore through
Jesse on Saturday, while hundreds of people were collecting
gasoline spilling from the government-owned pipeline. State radio
has put the death toll at 700. But local officials expected the
death toll to go as high as 1,000 because hundreds of people were
badly burned and many have refused professional care, fearing they
will be arrested for gasoline theft or vandalizing the pipeline.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. Security Council called for an
immediate end to military offensives in Congo Thursday as forces
from three southern African nations prepared to attack rebels in
the country's eastern jungles. Allies of embattled Congolese
President Laurent Kabila _ Namibia, Zimbabwe and Angola _ decided
Wednesday to help him oust rebel forces entrenched in the eastern
Congo. Forces from the three nations have been concentrated in
western Congo, where they fended off a rebel advance in August. In
Zimbabwe, soldiers, armored personnel carriers and artillery pieces
left the capital Harare on Thursday, apparently to bolster their
forces already in Congo. (ZIMBABWE-CONGO, UN-CONGO)

	   LONDON (AP) _ Paul McCartney has softened his position on animal
testing of drugs since his wife had to take such treatments for
breast cancer.
	   ``I'm finding out now that there is quite a lot of animal
experimentation _ some of it I suppose absolutely necessary when
you come down to the final tests before people,'' McCartney said in
a BBC radio interview to air Friday.
	   Linda McCartney died in April. She was a strict vegetarian and
campaigner for animal rights, as is her husband.
	   ``If a drug has got to be used on humans, then legally it has to
be finally tested on an animal,'' McCartney said. ``This was
difficult for Linda when she was undergoing her treatment.''
	   He came close to tears in describing how hard life is without
his wife.
	   ``We fancied each other something rotten,'' he said. ``That's
all it was. To me, she was always still my girlfriend.''
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ George Clooney, Sting, Evander Holyfield and
Harrison Ford are a few of GQ's favorite men.
	   Radio City Music Hall was overflowing with stars Wednesday night
when the magazine honored its 16 new ``Men of the Year,'' picked by
readers in an April poll.
	   The other winners were: ``Titanic'' director James Cameron,
Chris Rock, Muhammad Ali, ``Today'' host Matt Lauer, Patrick
Stewart, chef Emeril Lagasse, writer James Ellroy, Tommy Hilfiger,
Ted Turner, the Dave Matthews Band and Miami Heat coach Pat Riley _
for ``most stylish man.'' Sting won twice _ for music and
environmental activism.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ ``Retire? No, oh, no, no. Are you kidding?''
responds Luciano Pavarotti's manager to the question of whether the
superstar, ailment-plagued tenor is thinking about waving a final
goodbye to the opera stage with his big white handkerchief.
	   ``He gave a concert Saturday night in Cologne in an arena that
was filled to the rafters,'' Herbert Breslin said Thursday. ``He'll
be at the gala celebrating the 30th anniversary of his Met debut on
Nov. 22.''
	   But Pavarotti this week canceled his only other Metropolitan
Opera appearances this season _ as Cavaradossi in ``Tosca'' on Nov.
7, 12 and 16 _ because he is recuperating from hip replacement
surgery in July and a knee replacement on the other leg a month
later.
	   And he has no staged opera dates scheduled at the Met or
anyplace else.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ Seeing voices? Now you can.
	   When singing teacher Paul Farrington belts out ``Some Enchanted
Evening'' at a charity concert Sunday, a large screen will show
live pictures of his larynx _ direct from a tiny camera positioned
inside his throat.
	   Organizers want to the audience to feel every tremor so they can
experience the wonders of the human voice.
	   Farrington will require no surgery; instead, a thin wire with a
minute camera on the end will be slid down his throat _ ``not as
difficult as it sounds,'' said Jo Barker, a spokeswoman for
Birmingham's University Hospital.
	   ``I don't know if this is the first time someone has performed
like this, but it's certainly rare,'' she said.
	   All proceeds from the ``Rejoice the Voice'' concert at
Birmingham's Adrian Boult Hall will go to the hospital's voice
clinic, where Farrington works.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   SALZBURG, Austria (AP) _ The Mozarteum school of music has been
temporarily closed after cancer-causing agents were found in the
wallpaper, floors and acoustic paneling at the internationally
renowned center.
	   More than a week after the Oct. 15 closure, it was still unclear
what caused the contamination of the building. Experts said the
in-house ventilation system may have spread the dangerous
materials.
	   Interior Minister Caspar Einem ordered the building closed after
medical investigators found a high incidence of leukemia among the
Mozarteum staff.
	   Experts detected the presence of PCBs, polychlorinated
biphenils, a toxic substance formerly used in insulating material,
in the building.
	   Government officials in Salzburg said earlier this week that
blood tests would be taken on 20 Mozarteum staff and students to
determine the extent of any illnesses.
	   Salzburg is the birthplace of Austria's best-known composer,
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.
	   The music school dates to 1841.

	   MANTA, Ecuador (AP) _ Police found almost a ton of cocaine
destined for Miami hidden among frozen fish aboard a plane in an
Ecuadorean port, authorities said Thursday.
	   The 1,975 pounds (900 kilos) of cocaine, one of the largest
seizures in Ecuador's history, was found Monday by drug-sniffing
dogs amid fish being exported from the city of Manta, 165 miles
southwest of Quito.
	   The cocaine would have sold for dlrs 30 million in the United
States, Manta police chief Gen. Jorge Molina said.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexico's opposition leaders want to know if
former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, whose brother is
accused of taking millions of dollars in bribes from drug dealers,
was involved in any wrongdoing.
	   Andres Manuel Lopez, chairman of the Democratic Revolution
Party, demanded a thorough investigation of the former president
and the seizure of ``any ill-gotten gains,'' newspapers reported
Thursday.
	   The former president has not been charged with any crime, and
the attorney general's office has said there is no evidence he was
involved in drug-related dealings.
	   But a story Wednesday in The New York Times quoted an unreleased
report by Swiss prosecutors as saying, ``the circle of family and
friends around former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari got paid
royally by various Mexican and Colombian drug cartels for
protection.''
	   Mariano Albor, an attorney for Carlos Salinas, said Thursday he
had no comment on the allegations.
	   Raul Salinas, the elder brother of the former president, has
been charged by Mexican authorities with masterminding the murder
of a political rival and illegal enrichment during his younger
brother's 1988-94 administration.
	   Carlos Salinas has lived in exile since leaving the presidency
in 1994 following the peso crisis, which badly tarnished his
administration.
	   ___
	   JALAPA, Mexico (AP) _ Winds gusting up to 75 mph (120 kph) blew
roofs off houses, cut electric service and forced the closing of
ports in the Mexican Gulf coast state of Veracruz, authorities said
Thursday.
	   The winds closed the ports of Veracruz, Coatzacoalcos and
Tuxpan, closed schools and could force some communities to set up
shelters for displaced residents, civil defense authorities said.
	   ___
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Police shot and wounded
one man and detained hundreds during protests Thursday by
Dominicans fed up with water and electricity outages caused by
Hurricane Georges.
	   Protests flared in the Dominican capital of Santo Domingo and in
the town of Navarrete, about 100 miles (160 kms) to the north.
	   In one neighborhood, troops from a nearby air force base were
called out to stop masked demonstrators who pelted police with
stones. The troops pulled some youths out of their homes and beat
them before handing them over to police. In another Santo Domingo
neighborhood, police gunfire wounded one man as officers tried to
break up protests.
	   The Dominican Energy Corp. claims it has restored power to about
80 percent of the island, but protesters said authorities are
neglecting their areas.
	   The hurricane hit the Dominican Republic on Sept. 22, killing at
least 283 people and leaving 100,000 people homeless.

Gymnast Moceanu remains in seclusion
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TERRI LANGFORD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HOUSTON (AP) _ Gymnast Dominique Moceanu remained in seclusion
Thursday, three days after she obtained a restraining order against
her parents and asked a court to make her a legal adult.
	   The 17-year-old darling of the 1996 Olympics at Atlanta claims
her father, Dumitru Moceanu, has squandered earnings kept in a
trust fund in his daughter's name.
	   Moceanu's lawyer, Roy W. Moore, suspects that trust bankrolled a
dlrs 4 million gym and other ventures, including a Unique
Sportswear clothing outlet, under the Moceanu Gymnastics Inc.
business title.
	   It is not known, however, how much money has been generated by
her sponsors, appearances and competitions or how much has been
lost, Moore said.
	   Moceanu left her home Sunday night, a day after an argument with
her father in which he threatened to have her coach, 26-year-old
Luminita Miscenco, deported to Romania.
	   Her flight, according to the only interview she has given, was
the result of months of arguments sparked by her questions about
the earnings.
	   ``I kill myself training and going to school, and what is he
doing with my money?'' Moceanu told the Houston Chronicle in
Wednesday editions, referring to her father. ``They haven't been
working since 1996. Where does their income come from? Me.''
	   Kurt Thomas, the retired Olympic gymnast and Moceanu's one-time
coach, said the celebrity teen was being kept in the dark about her
money.
	   ``I think that he definitely took her money and sort of did what
he wanted to do with it without her knowledge,'' Thomas told NBC
Nightly News on Thursday.
	   A call to Thomas' home in Plano was not returned to The
Associated Press on Thursday. There was no answer at the Moceanus'
Houston home.
	   Her father claims the court action this week is the work of
others who have brainwashed his daughter.
	   ``Somebody's after her money,'' Moceanu told the television
network.
	   Kimberly Davis, a personal assistant for the couple, said the
gymnast's mother, Camelia Moceanu, has been made physically ill by
the controversy.
	   ``Camelia told me today that she doesn't want to come out of
bed,'' Davis told The AP. '' This isn't the Dominique that she
knows. Her heart is torn in two.''
	   At 14, Moceanu was the youngest member of the 1996 Olympic team
at the Atlanta Games and is the only member of that team still
competing in all gymnastics events. She expects to compete in the
world championships next year and possibly the Sydney Games in
2000.
	   In August, she became the first non-Russian to win the
all-around competition in the Goodwill Games.
	   Less than a month ago, the Moceanu family was celebrating the
gold medalist's 17th birthday. But even then, she was flexing her
independence. Her father gave her a Mercedes for her birthday. She
exchanged it for a more sporty Mustang convertible, Davis said.
	   ``If Dominique walked into the door today, they would welcome
her with open arms, no questions asked,'' Davis said.
	   Moceanu, a high school senior, has stayed away from classes at
the private Northland Christian School all week, her lawyer said.
	   ``She's trying to get her life back,'' Moore said.

Experts assess test results: Did Iraq load nerve gas in weapons?
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Chemical weapons experts from seven
countries opened a two-day meeting to assess results from U.S.,
French and Swiss laboratories on whether Iraq loaded the deadly
nerve agent VX into missile warheads.
	   Previous U.S. test results showed traces of VX on fragments of
warheads, countering Iraqi claims that it was never able to produce
enough VX or stabilize it sufficiently to load into missiles.
	   The Iraqis challenged the validity of the U.S. test results,
prompting the United Nations to authorize a second series of tests
by French and Swiss scientists.
	   Chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler, who did not attend
the closed-door meeting, said Thursday he expected to receive a
report from the experts Friday evening and would forward it to the
Security Council early next week, and to the Iraqis.
	   Butler has said that even if the French and Swiss labs don't
turn up traces of VX, Baghdad still has to account for the findings
by the U.S. Army's Aberdeen Proving Ground laboratory.
	   The lab disclosed in June that it found traces of VX in
fragments of missile warheads that Iraq had filled before the 1991
Gulf war. A few drops of the nerve agent can kill a person.
	   Talking to reporters on Thursday, Butler said Iraq had never
told the U.N. Special Commission, which is charged with the
elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, the full story
about VX.
	   The 17 experts from the United States, Britain, France, Russia,
China, Sweden and Switzerland are only looking at whether Iraq had
the ability to put VX in weapons.
	   ``That will not deal with production,'' said UNSCOM spokesman
Ewen Buchanan. ``Iraq admitted after several years of denial that
in fact they produced 3.9 tons. UNSCOM is concered that the actual
figure produced could have been significantly higher.''
	   U.N. weapons experts must certify that Iraq has destroyed its
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons _ and the missiles to
deliver them _ before the 15-member Security Council will lift
economic sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.
	   Iraq decided on Aug. 5 to stop cooperating with U.N. arms
inspections, although it is still allowing monitoring of previously
declared sites.
	   The Security Council on Friday will consider a list of nine
questions Iraq says it needs answered about a proposed
``comprehensive review'' of sanctions before it will consider
resuming cooperation with the U.N. inspectors.
	   One of Baghdad's nine concerns is that inspectors be forced to
disclose the source of evidence to back their claims that Iraq
isn't fully disarmed.
	   That could be a problem considering some council members have
already expressed discomfort with Annan's proposal to shift the
onus of disclosing information about the hidden weapons from Iraq
to the inspectors.

Reports: Troubled Japanese bank applies for nationalization
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's troubled Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan
Ltd. formally asked Friday to be nationalized under newly passed
legislation aimed at revitalizing the country's crisis-ridden
financial sector, media reports said.
	   The application, made directly to Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi,
was likely to lead to the first government take-over of a bank
since the end of World War II, the reports said.
	   Obuchi was expected to formally decide by the end of the day to
nationalize the bank, Kyodo News agency reported.
	   The reported move by LTCB, which was once a pillar of Japan's
postwar financial system but has recently struggled under a massive
load of bad loans, had been widely anticipated.
	   The Tokyo Stock Exchange suspended trading in shares of the bank
before the market opened on Friday. LTCB shares had fallen to a
record low of 2 yen (dlrs 0.17) earlier this week.
	   Japan's Financial Supervisory Agency was likely to declare that
the bank's debts exceed its assets, making it insolvent, the
Mainichi newspaper reported. The FSA ruling was expected as soon as
next week, the Asahi newspaper said.
	   Earlier this month Japan's Parliament passed laws allowing the
government to take control of foundering banks to fix them or shut
them down by pumping up to 60 trillion yen (dlrs 515 billion) in
taxpayer funds into the ailing banking system.
	   The bank rescue package has been seen as a crucial step toward
cleaning up the huge number of soured loans left by the collapse in
the early 1990s of a speculative boom in Japanese real estate and
stock prices.
	   It also comes as a key part of the country's efforts to overcome
its deepest recession since the end of World War II.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's troubled Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan
Ltd. said that it formally asked Friday to be nationalized under
newly passed legislation aimed at revitalizing the country's
crisis-ridden financial sector.
	   The LTCB submitted its request to Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's
residence at 8:30 a.m. (2330 GMT Thursday), just hours after the
financial stabilization legislation came into effect, said bank
spokesman Ichiro Murakami.
	   Obuchi was expected to formally decide by later Friday whether
or not to nationalize the bank, the LTCB spokesman said.
	   If approved, it would mark the first government take-over of a

Serbia heading back toward dictatorship, further isolation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 
 &UR; By DUSAN STOJANOVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Turning a political setback to his
own advantage, President Slobodan Milosevic has exploited NATO
bombing threats to root out domestic opponents who say Yugoslavia
is backsliding into dictatorship and isolation.
	   Just days after he signed a U.S.-sponsored agreement that
temporarily averted NATO strikes against Serb military targets in
Kosovo, Milosevic cracked down on the country's independent media _
possibly the only sphere of life in Serbia not already under his
direct control.
	   Earlier this year, he ``cleansed'' universities of rebellious
professors and deans and replaced them with Milosevic loyalists.
	   Some fear owners of satellite dishes and Internet providers
could be his next targets.
	   In the forefront of the president's harshest crackdown in
decades are his coalition partners: the ultranationalist Serbian
Radicals led by Vice Premier Vojislav Seselj and the Yugoslav Left
neo-communists headed by Milosevic's wife, Mirjana Markovic.
	   Seselj and Markovic are both fierce opponents of the United
States and the West. They want Serbia to strengthen ties with
Russia and China and have bitterly criticized the pro-Western
leaders of Montenegro, the small republic that along with Serbia
forms what is left of Yugoslavia.
	   Seselj, notorious for his belligerent style and intolerance
toward other nationalities, has publicly threatened that he will
deal next with other ``Serbian traitors'' and ``sources of enemy
propaganda.''
	   Among those Seselj criticized as ``NATO collaborators'' were
Serbs working for foreign media organizations and journalists at a
handful of independent newspapers.
	   The goal of the clampdown is for the coalition members to
consolidate power and ``get rid of any opposition to their
disastrous rule,'' said Aleksandar Tijanic, a former Serbian
information minister and a columnist for the independent Dnevni
Telegraf daily, one of three papers that was temporarily banned
last week.
	   Milosevic exploited anti-Western hysteria about possible NATO
intervention in Serbia's Kosovo province to pass a new law banning
broadcasts of Serbo-Croatian language programs by foreign media.
	   The information law calls for fines of dlrs 41,000 to dlrs
82,000 on editors and media owners who violate it. In a country
where monthly salaries average barely dlrs 100, a single fine would
be enough to force an independent newspaper or radio station to
close.
	   The law also empowers authorities to determine which reports
break the law and further restricts working permits for media
organizations.
	   Independent legal experts and journalists say the law reimposes
censorship, which Serbia formally abandoned in the late 1980s, and
drags the country back toward single-party dictatorship.
	   Milan Milosevic, a columnist of the independent Vreme weekly,
said that the clampdown aims to reinforce the country's
international isolation.
	   The Clinton administration condemned the restrictive new law as
``draconian'' and said it was designed to hide the truth about Serb
atrocities in Kosovo, where hundreds of people have been killed and
300,000 made homeless during this year's Serb crackdown on ethnic
Albanian separatists.
	   ``Milosevic is also trying to hide from his own people the
substantial concessions he has been forced to make under the threat
of NATO airstrikes,'' the White House said Wednesday.
	   Some of Milosevic's domestic critics agree.
	   ``The crackdown on the media in Serbia has the function of
deterring the public attention from the capitulation of Serbia,''
said Montenegro's deputy parliament speaker Predrag Popovic.
	   The Western alliance has given Milosevic until Oct. 27 to remove
his forces from Kosovo and allow ethnic Albanian refugees to
return, or risk NATO airstrikes.
	   The Serbs, numbed by a decade of Milosevic's state-run
propaganda and struggling for economic survival, have reacted
mildly to the crackdown. Only a few hundred have shown up at daily
protests in Belgrade organized by independent media unions.
	   Borka Pavicevic, a columnist of the Danas daily _ one of the
papers banned last week _ spoke at one rally.
	   ``If we don't react now,'' Pavicevic said, ``we'll all end up in
a concentration camp.''

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ With a NATO-imposed deadline quickly
approaching, Yugoslavia still has not complied with demands for
ending the crisis in Kosovo, Western diplomats say.
	   Yugoslavia's has repeatedly claimed that it has withdrawn all
its special troops sent to suppress an ethnic Albanian revolt in
Kosovo, but the diplomats said Thursday that continuing violence
threatens the Serbian province's peace process.
	   The pro-government daily Vecernje Novosti quoted unidentified
police sources as saying that the only troops still in Kosovo were
those that had been there before the crackdown began eight months
ago. NATO and Western governments, however, have challenged such
claims.
	   The troop withdrawal is a key condition of the U.S.-brokered
agreement to achieve lasting peace in Kosovo, an overwhelmingly
Albanian area of the Yugoslav republic of Serbia.
	   A senior U.S. envoy, Christopher Hill, told reporters in
Pristina: ``We are not satisfied with the level of compliance.''
	   In Paris, French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said the
departure of government forces was ``very advanced, but that is not
enough.''
	   There were further signs that tension remains high in the
province, despite the agreement reached Oct. 12 between Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke.
	   Laura Boldrini of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said
ethnic Albanians who returned two weeks ago to the village of
Poklek fled again this week because of intimidation by Serb police.
	   ``It's a never-ending story,'' Boldrini said.
	   International observers in the field said they heard increased
tank and artillery fire in some areas, after three days of relative
calm.
	   Also, the ethnic Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center said
four members of an ethnic Albanian family _ three of them children
_ were killed and two were wounded early Thursday when Yugoslav
soldiers fired on them near the Albanian border.
	   The center said the victims were trying to return to their homes
from Albania. There was no confirmation from government officials.
	   NATO has given Milosevic until Tuesday to comply with U.N.
demands or risk airstrikes. The demands include removing all
special troops sent to Kosovo during the crackdown and allowing
tens of thousands of ethnic Albanian refugees to return safely to
their homes.
	   Milosevic also agreed to talks with ethnic Albanians on the
future of the province, which is part of Yugoslavia's largest
republic, Serbia. About 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million people are
Albanian, and most want independence or self-rule.
	   The rebel Kosovo Liberation Army has insisted it will not
abandon its goal of independence. The United States and the
Europeans reject independence but support some form of autonomy for
Kosovo.
	   Despite the tension, international officials report some
progress toward normalcy. Convoys of relief supplies, for example,
have traveled unhindered in recent weeks.
	   Two U.N. convoys totaling 16 trucks carried baby food, flour,
biscuits, mattresses and other supplies to Pec and Djakovica in
western Kosovo on Thursday.
	   Meanwhile, efforts to organize the 2,000-person team to verify
compliance with the peace deal appeared stalled because the nations
that the people would come from are concerned about safety and want
the U.N. Security Council to endorse the plan first.
	   ``Obviously, the physical security of 2,000 people in a zone of
turmoil, of conflict, is of utmost importance,'' said the American
head of the operation, William G. Walker.
	   At U.N. headquarters in New York, the Security Council was
working on a resolution endorsing the Kosovo peace deal, but Russia
raised objections Thursday that the language might authorize
military action.

Japanese stocks rise, dollar falls in early Tokyo trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stocks moved higher in early trading
Friday on stronger futures prices and a rise on Wall Street
overnight. The U.S. dollar fell against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 198.47 points,
or 1.39 percent, to 14,494.03 in the first half hour of trading. On
Thursday, it had climbed 79.23 points, or 0.56 percent.
	   In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average bounced back from
a loss of 97 points and rose 13.91 points to 8,533.14, extending an
increasingly anemic winning streak to seven sessions.
	   The Tokyo Stock Exchange suspended trading in shares of the
troubled Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. before the market
opened on news the bank had formally applied to be nationalized
under a government rescue plan.
	   Shares of LTCB, once a pillar of Japan's postwar financial
system but which recently has struggled under a massive load of bad
loans, had fallen to a record low of 2 yen (dlrs 0.17) earlier this
week.
	   Earlier this month, Japan's Parliament passed the legislation
allowing government takeovers of foundering banks to fix them or
shut them down. It authorized the government to pump up to 60
trillion yen (dlrs 515 billion) in taxpayer funds into the ailing
banking system.
	   The stock market welcomes signals by other major banks that they
will apply for public funds to bolster their capital bases, traders
said.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section rose 12.76 points, or 1.19 percent, to 1,087.05. It
had risen 2.46 points, or 0.23 percent, the previous day.
	   On the Tokyo foreign exchange market, the dollar bought 117.56
yen in early trading, down 0.16 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo and
also below its rate of 117.87 yen in late New York trading
overnight.
	   The dollar's rise against the yen in New York was spurred by the
German mark's rally against both the U.S. and Japanese currencies
after Germany's central bank declined to lower interest rates.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 0.820 percent from Thursday's finish of 0.830 percent,
driving up its price to 108.75 yen from 108.66 yen.

 &UR; Eds: SUBS 1st item to RECAST, publicist says McCartney has not
softened his position on animal testing

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Paul McCartney came close to tears during an
interview when describing how hard life is without his late wife.
	   ``We fancied each other something rotten,'' he said in a BBC
radio interview to air Friday. ``That's all it was. To me, she was
always still my girlfriend.''
	   Linda McCartney died in April after suffering from breast
cancer. She was a strict vegetarian and campaigner for animal
rights, as is her husband.
	   McCartney said that doctors treating his wife gave them the
impression that any drugs involved in her treatment had not been
tested on animals.
	   ``If they tell you `It's OK to have this because we didn't test
it on animals' then you are going to believe them,'' he said.

In Palestinian lands, illegal gun possession is pervasive
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With US-Mideast Talks &QL; 
 &UR; By LAURA KING &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Pistol tucked neatly into the waistband
of his tailored trousers, the Palestinian weapons merchant bemoaned
the fact that handgun sales have been slow lately.
	   That's partly because Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority _ at
Israel's insistence _ has been trying to curb the spread of illegal
arms. So this man's customers are leery of spending big money on an
unlicensed gun that might wind up being confiscated by Palestinian
police.
	   But the main problem, the merchant said, is simple market
saturation: Almost everyone in the Palestinian lands who wants a
gun already has one.
	   Illegal arms have been a key point of contention as Israel and
the Palestinians struggle to reach a land-for-peace accord at
U.S.-brokered talks at a retreat on Maryland's eastern shore.
	   Israel makes much of the fact that its army regularly seizes
large amounts of weaponry _ ranging from handguns to
grenade-launchers _ being smuggled in from neighboring Jordan and
Egypt, or stockpiled in caches in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
	   Palestinian security officials, though, claim they get little
credit for what has been a serious effort to clamp down on illegal
weapons sales.
	   And the Palestinians have consistently demanded that disarming
militants should work both ways: armed Jewish settlers, they say,
pose a far greater threat to Palestinian civilians than vice versa.
	   Settlers living in the West Bank and Gaza can easily obtain gun
licenses. Many carry their weapons everywhere, and do not hesitate
to use them when they feel threatened.
	   A month ago, a settler shot a 17-year-old Palestinian to death
and seriously wounded a second in the West Bank town of Beitunia.
The settler said the youths stoned his car; witnesses said the boys
were only walking home.
	   Israel dismisses Palestinian complaints about armed settlers,
pointing instead to repeated attacks against them.
	   Two settlers were gunned down in August as they patrolled the
remote West Bank settlement of Itzhar, and another was slain in
April in a dispute with Palestinian shepherds outside the
settlement of Maon.
	   ``What's happening in the territories may sometimes remind you
of the Wild West,'' said Simha Landau, a criminologist on the law
faculty at Hebrew University in Jerusalem.
	   If the Palestinian lands are awash in weaponry, so is Israel.
There's little question the gun culture is a major factor on both
sides of the dividing line.
	   Visitors are often shocked by the sheer amount of firepower on
casual display in the streets of Israeli cities _ young soldiers
with machine guns slung from their shoulders, settlers with pistols
in their belts. Even Israeli lawmakers can get a parliament-issued
gun if they wish.
	   ``We're habituated to it _ it's not a surprise,'' said Landau.
``You have an awful lot of uniformed and non-uniformed people
walking around with guns.''
	   Palestinians who want unlicensed weapons pay dearly for them. An
illegal handgun runs at least dlrs 1,000, and sometimes two or
three times that _ enormous sums in the Palestinian lands, where
unemployment is high.
	   When West Bank cities and most of Gaza were first turned over to
Palestinian control after nearly three decades of Israeli
occupation, weapons flooded in. For many ordinary Palestinians,
strutting around with an unlicensed gun was a status symbol, a
heady and undreamed-of novelty.
	   Now, flaunting an illegal weapon is an invitation to a visit by
the police. Fearing confiscation, Palestinians with guns at home
usually hide them in cubbyholes, under mattresses or in toilet
tanks.
	   A 28-year-old Hebron baker who bought a handgun last year says
he has only used it to fire celebratory shots in the air at
weddings, and hides it the rest of the time.
	   ``But it's very, very important to me to have it,'' he said.
	   Israel's main weapons worry, though, isn't the thousands of guns
in private Palestinian hands. Of far greater concern is the arsenal
held by what Israel says is a vastly bloated Palestinian police
force.
	   According to Israel, existing agreements limit Palestinian
security forces to 24,000 men, but the actual number is closer to
40,000. The Israeli military also suspects Palestinian forces of
smuggling in unauthorized heavy weapons, such as armor-piercing
artillery.
	   ``We believe there are thousands of arms that are being held by
the Palestinian Authority that have to be handed over,'' said
government spokesman Moshe Fogel.
	   Civilians on both sides are psychologically unprepared to give
up the gun, setting up what observers say is a self-perpetuating
cycle of violence.
	   ``Gun ownership is both a result of stress and supposed to be a
means of coping with it,'' said Landau, the criminologist. ``If
someone carries a gun, they may increase their own sense of safety
_ but it's doubtful if it makes anyone else feel more secure.''

From garbage to prostitution, a mayor is remaking Taipei
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo TPE101 &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNIE HUANG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Thanks to Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian's
four-year crusade to clean up a capital widely known as ``the ugly
duckling of Asia,'' it is illegal to leave trash at any curbside in
Taipei.
	   Instead, many people wait until they hear a garbage truck
passing their homes playing Beethoven's ``Fur Elise.'' Then, out
they come with their trash.
	   Chen also has enforced laws to fight the city's monstrous
traffic jams, to reduce the number of fires that once damaged many
karaoke bars and restaurants, and to crack down on illegal gambling
dens and a once-notorious sex industry.
	   He has razed a shantytown and dilapidated military barracks and
replaced them with parks. A large wild bird sanctuary, built on a
wetland long used as a garbage dump, was opened to the public this
month. And public buses now display poems for commuters to read.
	   Before Chen, leader of the opposition Democratic Progressive
Party, won ground-breaking elections in 1994, Taipei had been ruled
for 27 years by appointees of the ruling Nationalist Party known
for incompetence and corruption.
	   Although the appointees had managed to build two lines of a new
subway system, the city couldn't get them running smoothly until
Chen took over.
	   And even though garbage trucks had long whimsically announced
their arrival to strains of Beethoven, their haphazard schedule
meant residents did not know when to have their trash ready and
often left it rotting on the sidewalks.
	   Chen's solution: the trucks now are required to arrive at a
fixed time every day.
	   Chen, 47, is expected to face a serious challenge in the Dec. 5
mayoral election as the governing Nationalist Party, which has
ruled Taiwan since 1945, tries to recover Taipei.
	   But for now, the man who first gained notoriety years ago as a
leading dissident is a widely popular do-something mayor of the
capital of 2.6 million people that he is remaking.
	   Besides the Nationalist Party, his only prominent opponents are
prostitutes, put out of business when he shut down licensed
brothels in Taipei's red-light district, and the organized crime
groups who ran the illegal sex outlets Chen shut down.
	   The prostitutes often dog Chen's public appearances with loud _
and sometimes lewd _ protests. So far, they have rejected a city
benefits package Chen has offered them and are demanding their jobs
back.
	   But Chen's crackdown on prostitution, decision to shut down the
city's 4,000 unlicensed video game arcades to combat illegal
gambling, and imposition of a midnight curfew for everyone 18 or
younger have won widespread support.
	   When police records showed the capital's juvenile crime rate had
fallen by 28 percent last year, many credited Chen.
	   To ease Taipei's notorious traffic jams, Chen has ordered
existing laws enforced, such as one that allows double-parked cars
to be towed, and redirected rush-hour traffic.
	   Such moves have been so wildly popular that all the Nationalists
have been able to do so far is accuse Chen of being unpatriotic _
he removed portraits of the late strongman Chiang Kai-shek from
City Hall and opened the gardens of Chiang's former residence to
the public.
	   As the election campaign nears, the mayor is busy doing
everything he can to praise his own achievements.
	   ``Whether we are building a city or a nation, we must be bold to
make changes and never stop making progress,'' he declared at a
recent gathering of artists.
	   Still, Chen has his critics, who say he pushes his policies too
fast rather than waiting to win public consent and places urban
development above environmental concerns, cutting down old trees to
make way for highways, despite protests.
	   But that doesn't appear to have gotten very far with the general
public.
	   ``Mayor Chen is indeed very much a showman,'' said convenience
store owner Lee Wen. ``But he is also the only Taipei mayor who has
done his job. Everyone can see the big difference.''

Pinochet's release on humanitarian grounds. &QL; 
 &UR; By EDUARDO GALLARDO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ President Eduardo Frei is now urging
Britain to release former dictator Augusto Pinochet on humanitarian
grounds, following news that the retired general is suffering from
depression and deteriorating health.
	   In a nationally broadcast message Thursday night, Frei said he
was making the request despite ``the deep differences'' between his
government and Pinochet.
	   ``We can understand the situation faced by Mr. Pinochet and his
family, and therefore we will request the necessary considerations,
given his serious health condition,'' Frei said.
	   Frei said a cabinet session earlier in the day heard repeated
expressions of concern over Pinochet's situation, even ``from
ministers who suffered torture and exile'' during his regime.
	   Pinochet, who ruled Chile from 1973 to 1990, was arrested last
week in a London hospital where he was recovering from back surgery
at the request of a Spanish judge investigating human rights abuses
in Chile.
	   Frei's announcement came hours after Senate President Andres
Zaldivar said he had been informed that Pinochet's condition was
deteriorating at the London Clinic, where he remains under arrest.
	   ``His condition is very difficult, much worse than originally
thought,'' Zaldivar told a news conference with foreign
correspondents.
	   ``He is suffering from depression and shows lack of will to
react and to do the things he is supposed to do,'' Zaldivar added.
	   Unconfirmed media reports here indicated that Pinochet, 82, is
also suffering from a urinary infection. He also suffers from
diabetes and has used a pacemaker for several years.
	   Frei again urged Chileans to ``maintain serenity,'' and called
for an end to the often violent demonstrations by Pinochet
supporters and opponents that have followed the arrest.
	   He said the resurgence of deep political divisions threatens the
country's transition to democracy since Pinochet stepped down.
Pinochet remained head of the armed forces until earlier this year.
He now holds a special lifetime seat in the Senate.
	   ``Violent actions only add more and more obstacles,'' Frei said,
warning the government ``will use the full power of law'' to
maintain public order.
	   Hours before Frei's speech, police had used water cannons to
scatter demonstrators celebrating the arrest. And while he was
speaking, police were again trying to control pro and anti-Pinochet
demonstrations, some near the British and Spanish embassies..

For Olowokandi and Cage, unity counts though NBA future is not
</HEADLINE>
quite the same &QL; 
 &UR; By TIM DAHLBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ Michael Olowokandi stood at one end of a casino
hallway and talked about money and what he hopes is a bright future
as the National Basketball Association's No. 1 draft pick.
	   Michael Cage stood nearby and talked about the future, too _ one
of an NBA that he believes increasingly won't have room for guys
like him.
	   ``There's no reward for a guy who works his way up the salary
chart,'' said Cage, a 14-year National Basketball Association
veteran. ``Right now we don't have a middle class in the NBA.''
	   The disparity between the haves and have-nots in the NBA was
something players wrestled with Thursday even as they met at
Caesars Palace to discuss strategy and show a unified front in a
lockout that has already cost the league part of its regular
season.
	   Among the haves _ assuming the lockout is settled sometime in
the near future _ will be Olowokandi, who stands to make millions
even before he scores a point for the Los Angeles Clippers.
	   Cage, though, was concerned more about the have-nots _ the
players from the fourth through 12th spots on a typical NBA team
who have increasingly seen their salaries suffer as the league pays
top dollar to its top few players.
	   Cage and others are afraid that situation could get even worse
if a tight salary cap is imposed.
	   ``We have no dlrs 2.6 million (a year) player right now,'' Cage
said. ``They'll make sure their best players get the most if there
is a salary cap. The rest of will be paid the NBA minimum.''
	   The lockout has already cost the 36-year-old Cage, now a backup
center for the New Jersey Nets, 1-12th of his salary for the
upcoming season. Since it will be his last season in the NBA, the
impact is felt even more.
	   ``A lot of guys like me lose a lot,'' Cage said. ``For guys like
me, losing that money is a big hit. I'll never get it back.''
	   Still, Cage, an articulate union activist, was one of more than
200 NBA players who gathered at Caesars Palace because, he said, he
wants to make a difference for the players who follow him.
	   ``It's not for guys like me who are on our way out,'' he said of
the labor dispute. ``I may lose out but I'm OK with that because
the sacrifice is there. I've been a team player all my career and I
want to make sure nothing is done here that upsets the balance.''
	   The stakes are much different for Olowokandi, the 7-foot-1
Nigerian who was the surprise top pick in the 1998 draft out of the
University of Pacific.
	   Olowokandi was at the meeting with his agent, eager to support
his fellow players but also concerned about any attempts to extend
the number of years that salary caps are placed on draft picks.
	   Like Cage, though, the issue of the players in the middle was
important.
	   ``The Charles Barkleys, Patrick Ewings and Michael Jordans have
all kinds of money,'' Olowokandi said. ``The guys in the median
don't have guaranteed contracts. A hard salary cap would hurt them
the worst.''
	   Olowokandi, like most of the players gathered at the posh Strip
casino, has been working out and playing some organized basketball.
Unlike the others, though, he wasn't terribly concerned about the
possibility that an entire season might be canceled.
	   ``I just got out of college so I can hang out another year with
no pay,'' he said. ``I can live my life like I lived it a year
before or the year before that. I haven't had any money so it's not
that big of a deal.''

Thai prisoners farming for their freedom in new program

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Pravit Pumkarn, a convicted armed
robber, plunges a rusty spade into the sunbaked earth, determined
to get out of prison.
	   He isn't digging a tunnel in a desperate attempt to escape. He's
farming for his freedom, planting rice, fruit and vegetables on the
prison grounds as part of a new program in which convicts can earn
an early release if they learn how to till the soil.
	   ``I get one day deducted from my jail term as a reward for each
day working on the farm,'' said Pravit, 22.
	   There's more behind the program than giving convicts a new
skill. Thailand is in the midst of its worst economic crisis in
modern times. Nearly 2 million people are unemployed and many
others with jobs have fallen into poverty.
	   With budgets for essential services slashed by a government in
financial distress, convicts are being asked to farm to feed
themselves.
	   They're not the only ones. Even the Thai army has ordered
soldiers to use land on their bases to grow fruit and vegetables.
	   The problem at the prisons, however, is more acute.
	   Surang Ekachote, director of vocational training at the
Department of Corrections, said the department's budget allots only
27 baht _ 65 cents _ for each convict's three meals each day.
	   Making matters worse, the prison population is exploding as
crime soars because of the economic crisis, corrections officials
say. Thailand's 129 prisons are holding 164,000 inmates, 44,000
more than last year. The number is expected to reach 200,000 by the
end of 1998, they said.
	   The overcrowding has been blamed for the rise in prison escapes
in recent months.
	   Cramped conditions are one reason Pravit was eager to be among
the first 100 prisoners to learn organic farming. He said it was
better working in the fresh air than spending his days inside a 13-
by 33-foot (4- by 10-meter) cell with 29 other inmates.
	   But while the program may cut costs and ease overcrowding,
critics question whether it really teaches inmates a skill they can
use after their release.
	   ``I am from a farming family so it is easier for me to return
home and grow food on my father's land,'' said Anan Sorbai, an
18-year-old robber.
	   That's not the case with all the participants.
	   ``I will learn the skill, but I will never become a farmer,''
said Lek Khuan-muang, 21, who is serving time for robbing a liquor
store. ``How could I when I have neither farmland nor money to
invest?''
	   Pravit, who grew up in a Bangkok slum, also said he had no
realistic expectation of becoming a farmer after his release.
	   But he said he won't return to a life outside the law. Instead,
he hopes to find a job as a longshoreman at Bangkok's port, loading
among other goods, rice, fruits and vegetables being exported to
other countries.

Britain takes art in lieu of taxes to bolster museums
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MITCH STACY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The gleaming pair of ornate silver bowls and
matching decanter were once used by a nobleman's servants to rinse
wine glasses during formal dinners.
	   Today they have their own lighted display case at the Victoria
and Albert Museum, where they arrived this summer. It calls them
``lavish'' and ``magnificent,'' one of the most significant
additions ever to its extensive silver collection.
	   They also kept the tax man away from somebody's door this year.
	   The 18th century dining room implements _ forged from more than
187 pounds (85 kilos) of Britannia Standard silver _ were accepted
by Britain's tax agency, Inland Revenue, to satisfy an inheritance
tax debt.
	   They were ``bought'' by the government for 1.5 million pounds _
about dlrs 2.5 million, which was considerably less than their
actual worth, the museum said.
	   For those who don't have 300-year-old silver around the house,
Inland Revenue also will consider paintings, manuscripts, land,
houses, furniture, clocks, knickknacks and scientific gadgets _ as
long as government experts deem them historical or interesting
enough to save and display.
	   The most acquisitions, according to the Department of Culture,
Media and Sport, which acts as arbiter of historical significance,
include a collection of Bronze Age miniatures to satisfy a 44,200
pound (dlrs 74,000) tax claim.
	   Another was a portrait of a wealthy industrialist's wife and
children for which artist Arthur Hughes was paid about 265 pounds
(dlrs 440) in 1863. Its most recent owner used it to get out from
under a 206,272 pound (dlrs 345,000) tax obligation.
	   Britain isn't the only government to use tax obligations to help
fill its museums and galleries.
	   During its latest fiscal year, Japan accepted 7,120 art works
valued at 618 billion yen (dlrs 4.6 billion).
	   The French government has been accepting art in lieu of estate
taxes since the death of Pablo Picasso in the early 1970s. In fact,
the Picasso Museum in Paris was built to house the works paid as
death duties.
	   The United States has no such program. ``It's all in money, not
property,'' said Steve Pyrek, a spokesman for the Internal Revenue
Service in Washington.
	   In Britain this year, the government already has collected such
curiosities as an 18th century musical clock, an 88-page manuscript
from the early 16th century describing the trials of Joan of Arc,
and an archive of family and estate papers from a Cornwall clan.
	   ``They are all very standard, important works of art,'' said
Brian Stevenson with the Department of Culture, Media and Sport.
``Most of them are in museums, of course _ some in private homes _
but they would have to be open for viewing.''
	   England's cultural showplaces have benefited hugely from the
``acceptance in lieu'' program, which has been offered in one form
or another since 1910 to satisfy inheritance taxes, said Heather
Wilson, capital taxes officer for the Museums and Galleries
Commission.
	   The tax program has provided as much to museums and the National
Trust as all the government grants given for purchasing art, she
said.
	   A significant amount of art and other curiosities end up in the
public domain that otherwise wouldn't.
	   The silver bowls, for example, which belonged to Thomas Parker,
the first Earl of Macclesfield, would have been out of the Victoria
and Albert's financial reach had they not been accepted in a
complicated deal to satisfy inheritance tax. Even then, their value
exceeded the owner's tax obligation, and donations had to be raised
to pay the owner.
	   In addition to getting artworks through the program, the
government acquired large country houses after World War II, many
of which have been maintained and are open to the public, Wilson
noted.
	   When an offer is presented, Inland Revenue takes it to experts
at the Department of Culture, Media and Sport who determine if it
is worth having, set the value and suggest where it should be
displayed.
	   About 20 offers are accepted annually, while a few others fail
to win the government's interest, Wilson said. The amount in taxes
written off annually has generally run from 5 million to 6 million
pounds (dlrs 8.5 million to dlrs 10.2 million) over the past
decade, she said.
	   The names of the taxpayers and related details are not revealed
because of Inland Revenue's confidentiality rules.
	   Most people who hand over important works recognize it as
``practical resolution'' to their tax obligation, Wilson said.
	   Sometimes they'll request that a piece go to a particular
museum, she said.
	   ``Quite often, they'll take sort of a proprietorial interest
after the transaction is completed,'' she said.

Olympic track star's death blamed on epileptic seizure

	   SANTA ANA, California (AP) _ An epileptic seizure caused the
death of Olympic gold medal sprinter Florence Griffith Joyner as
she slept last month, authorities said, putting to rest rumors that
drugs contributed to her death.
	   Lt. Frank Fitzpatrick, head of forensic sciences for the
sheriff's office, said Thursday that toxicology tests showed she
had taken about one tablet each of the over-the-counter painkiller
Tylenol and antihistamine Benadryl, but ``there was nothing unusual
in terms of drugs.''
	   Her death refueled talk about possible drug use, which her
family angrily denied at her funeral.
	   The seizure involved a congenital blood vessel abnormality.
	   Griffith Joyner had a congenital brain abnormality known as
cavernous angioma, said Dr. Barbara Zaias, one of the
investigators.
	   Many people with the condition live their whole lives without
knowing they have it, but in others it can cause headaches and
seizures, she said.
	   Dr. Richard Fukumoto, chief of forensics for the Orange County
Sheriff's-Coroner department, said Griffith Joyner had apparently
been lying on her stomach and the seizure possibly caused her limbs
to stiffen and turn her head to the right, where her breathing was
constricted by covers and pillows.
	   Griffith Joyner died at her Mission Viejo home on Sept. 21 at
age 38. Investigators had been trying since then to determine the
exact cause.
	   Her husband, 1984 Olympic triple jump champion Al Joyner, called
paramedics after discovering she was not breathing that morning.
	   Medical experts said the blood vessel abnormality has never been
associated in medical literature with any banned or illegal
substances.
	   Stylish, smooth and muscular, Griffith Joyner won three Olympic
gold medals at the 1988 Seoul Games and set world records that
still stand in the 100- and 200-meter dashes.
	   Griffith Joyner had been shadowed by speculation about use of
banned substances, but she denied ever using drugs and never failed
a drug test.
	   ``We now hope that this great Olympic champion, wife and mother
can rest in peace, and that her millions of admirers around the
world will celebrate her legacy to sport and children every day,''
U.S. Olympic Committee president Bill Hybl said. ``It is time for
the whispers and dark allegations to cease.''
	   Her flowing black hair, skin-tight outfits and glittering long
fingernails brought a dash of flash to track and field. A line of
athletic shoes and clothes that she had been working on was
scheduled to go on sale next month.
	   About 1 in 200 Americans suffer from epilepsy, which can be
caused by a variety of problems, including head injury, brain
infection, stroke, drug use, drug withdrawal or chemical imbalance
on the body. Some people are born with it; others develop it later
in life.
	   In some epileptic seizures, a person loses consciousness. In
others, the person may remain conscious. Some epileptic seizures
are brought on by stress, fatigue or illness.

Official: No arrests to be made for Nigeria pipeline explosion

	   JESSE, Nigeria (AP) _ People injured in a devastating pipeline
explosion are starting to trickle into hospitals following a
government announcement that no one will be arrested in connection
to the incident.
	   The explosion and fire tore through Jesse on Saturday, while
hundreds of people were collecting gasoline spilling from the
government-owned pipeline. State radio has put the death toll at
700.
	   But local officials expected the death toll to go as high as
1,000 because hundreds of people were badly burned and many have
refused professional care, fearing they will be arrested for
gasoline theft or vandalizing the pipeline.
	   Walter Fejhabo, the military government's regional
administrator, said those fears were unfounded.
	   ``There is absolutely no truth in rumors that anybody will be
arrested in connection with this,'' Fejhabo told local leaders in
Jesse, a town of 12,000 residents about 180 miles (300 kms)
southeast of Lagos in the desperately poor Niger River delta
region.
	   Eighteen people had returned to the hospital after a town crier
on Wednesday relayed the government's promise not to arrest them.
Many more were believed to be heading back.
	   ``The town crier went out last night and the result has been
impressive,'' said Josiah Oyawiri, a senior chief of Jesse.
	   Despite the government announcement, officials from the state
oil company are still pressing for charges. A Nigerian newspaper
suggested the company would go after those implicated in opening
the pipeline, not the hundreds who came later to scoop up the
gasoline.
	   ``Anyone implicated in the vandalization of the oil pipeline ...
is to be arraigned,'' the Vanguard newspaper quoted the chief
executive of the powerful National Petroleum Corporation as saying.
	   Red Cross workers on Thursday picked up the last of the body
parts that still littered the scene of the explosion and threw them
into the still-flaring fire.
	   One worker, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the body
parts were burned because a mass grave had been covered over and
fears were increasing that the rotting remains could become a
health hazard.
	   Medical teams were setting up makeshift clinics in Jesse, where
few people have phones or radios. Aid workers from a number of
United Nations agencies, the Red Cross and doctors from Israel were
on their way or had already arrived.
	   For the people of Jesse, mostly poor cassava farmers and small
traders, the spilling gasoline offered an easy chance for a little
extra money, despite the obvious dangers of thousands of gallons
(liters) of fuel.
	   ``I heard people rushing to the scene where the fuel was leaking
and everybody was saying `God has brought wealth to Jesse,' and so
I joined,'' said Richard James, who was hospitalized with severe
burns. ``At the scene, I heard a deafening explosion ... and before
I could know what was happening, I was already on fire.''
	   It remains unclear what caused the explosion. Government
officials have said they believe scavengers' tools set it off. Some
news reports have blamed a lighted cigarette.
	   The pipeline runs about 380 miles (600 kms), from the
southeastern city of Warri to the northern city of Kano.
	   Although it's the world's sixth-largest oil producer, Nigeria
exports most of it, leaving its own people desperate for fuel.

Jordan among 240 players to meet and discuss lockout
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ Michael Jordan came down from his luxury suite
in this city's newest billion-dollar hotel, mingled with the
union's masses and gave no hint as to whether he'll be playing
basketball when the lockout ends.
	   On this day, Jordan's message was the same as that heard from
240 players, that the union is unified and will never accept a hard
salary cap.
	   ``My mind is still open. I haven't made my decision, but that
doesn't mean I shouldn't be a part of the union,'' Jordan said
Thursday after the largest gathering in the history of the National
Basketball Players Union.
	   ``I owe an obligation to the young players and the players who
came before me,'' Jordan said. ``This work stoppage is not our
fault. We're willing to work, but David Stern shouldn't be able to
force us to play under a deal that's unfavorable to us.''
	   Jordan was joined at the meeting by almost all of the league's
high-profile players, including Shaquille O'Neal, Scottie Pippen,
Karl Malone, Kevin Garnett and Kobe Bryant.
	   Jordan said he was in the worst shape of his life, ``but when
the time comes I'll be ready if that's the case.''
	   After meeting for almost five hours, union director Billy Hunter
announced that the players had voted unanimously to never accept a
hard salary cap. He also said the entire player population _ almost
400 players _ would come to New York next week to request a formal
bargaining session while the league's Board of Governors was in
town.
	   ``We'd be willing to do it with as many players as they'd like
to bring,'' deputy commissioner Russ Granik said in response.
``We'll meet with anybody.''
	   The NBA has already canceled the first two weeks of the season,
and the rest of the November schedule is expected to be scrapped
next week.
	   The sides haven't met since Oct. 13, and the owners and players
remain far apart on the issues of a ``hard'' vs. ``soft'' salary
cap and elimination of the so-called Larry Bird exception that
allows teams to exceed the cap to retain their own free agents.
	   Pippen is one of the players who has waited years for his Bird
rights to take effect, and he would stand to lose the most if the
exception was weakened or phased out.
	   ``I know my opportunity has come to get market value, but I came
here because I want to see the future of the game enhanced,''
Pippen said. ``I think their offer upsets a lot of us, especially
the free agents.''
	   The players-only meeting was not open to the media, but many of
those who attended said it was marked by player after player
standing to make his case for unity and a hard-line stance.

	   ATLANTA (AP) _ For two years, Archbishop Desmond Tutu listened
to account upon account of burning bodies and shallow graves. He
forgets many of the names he heard at hearings of the South African
Truth and Reconciliation Commission, but he carries the stories
like creases in a cassock.
	   His gait is heavy as he walks the campus of Atlanta's Emory
University, where he will teach theology. Just four years ago at
Emory, he bounded into rooms and often ended his anecdotes with
boisterous laughter. Today the 67-year-old archbishop, who received
the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize, enters a room cautiously and sits
stiffly, as if bracing for questions about prisons and pits.
	   ``I'm vulnerable. I know I'm fragile,'' Tutu said, drawing out
each word. ``I laugh easily and I make other people laugh, but I
also cry easily.''
	   He had already spent three decades ministering to a nation under
apartheid, and saying eulogies for its victims, when President
Nelson Mandela asked him to head the truth commission. The panel,
formed to investigate apartheid-era abuses and to grant amnesty to
perpetrators who confessed fully to politically motivated crimes,
releases its final report on Thursday, Oct. 29.
	   His experience might have cushioned him. But it didn't. The
2,000 testimonies of torture, rape and murder were a running
narrative of the injustices he had fought his entire life.
	   Still, he believes a country has to confront the brutality of
its history before forgiveness is possible, even if that means
asking survivors to relive their trauma and listeners to make sense
of the terror. And that includes an archbishop who thought he'd
seen everything.
	   ``At home, we thought we knew just how awful the system had
been,'' Tutu said. ``But when you heard accounts of what had
happened to people and found them saying _ `They stripped me ...
and opened a drawer and shoved my breasts into the drawer and
slammed it on my nipples,' _ you realize then what had happened.
	   ``When you heard the perpetrators in an amnesty hearing saying,
`We abducted him. We gave him drugged coffee, shot him in the head
and burned his body, and then we had a barbecue on the side,' you
realize the depths to which we can sink.''
	   He had read the statistics about violence. ``Now the statistics
were coming alive,'' he said. ``And we were devastated by the
extent of the evil.''
	   Tutu became the most public of father confessors. During the
early televised truth commission hearings, South Africans watched
his every expression. When a former African National Congress
guerrilla told from a wheelchair of being beaten and tortured by
the police, they saw Tutu hold his head in his hands and cry.
	   Anglican priest Michael Battle, a former adjutant to the
archbishop in Johannesburg, was not surprised. ``The truth
commission was the final revelation and (Tutu) had to relive the
pain,'' he said. Nor was his old friend, Anglican priest Norman
Montjane, who said Tutu has always ``entered into the agony and
tragedy. He himself is part of the sadness.''
	   If the hearings were often cathartic, they were frustrating as
well.
	   Facing his old friend, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, Tutu begged
her to apologize for her alleged role in kidnapping and murder
committed by a gang of youths with whom she was associated. She
offered only vague regrets.
	   ``I was devastated,'' said Tutu.
	   When apartheid era presidents Frederik W. de Klerk and P.W.
Botha refused to testify, claiming they were not responsible for
crimes committed in the name of white rule, Tutu could not contain
his outrage.
	   ``It's an incredible thing that (blacks) who still live in
shacks, squalor and poverty, come to work in your beautiful homes,
and they don't say, `We're going to murder all of you in your
beds,''' Tutu said in an interview with the South African
Broadcasting Commission.
	   Whites accused Tutu and the commission of having a pro-ANC bias;
blacks accused him of being soft on whites. And even his friend,
Muslim theologian Farid Esack, called for ``the de-Desmond
Tutu-fication of the truth commission'' so that a Christian
perspective wouldn't dominate. Tutu countered that there were
Muslim, Hindu, and Jewish commissioners.
	   Besides, he added, reconciliation is not unique to Christians.
``When an atheist husband quarrels with an atheist wife, doesn't
one say, `I'm sorry'?''
	   More troubling to him were those who suggested the commission
was forcing forgiveness from traumatized survivors. ``You can't
frog-march people into forgiveness,'' he said. ``You can never
blame anybody who feels they are unable to forgive. ... You can
only say to someone that ultimately you hope for forgiveness.''
	   When public opinion polls revealed that the majority of South
Africans, particularly whites, felt the commission has increased
tensions in race relations, Tutu said that the panel's job was to
promote the ongoing process of reconciliation not to ensure it
would happen immediately.
	   So far, amnesty has been granted to only 125 people who
convinced the panel that their crimes were political and that they
were telling the entire truth. Amnesty hearings will continue after
the release of the commission's final report.
	   The report could urge prosecution of those who have refused to
testify. Leaders from both sides of the apartheid struggle have
received notices that they may be portrayed negatively in the
panel's summation of the violence.
	   As the effort moves forward, friends worry that Tutu has
absorbed too much of that violence. That concern intensified when
he underwent surgery last year for prostate cancer.
	   ``Some people wondered whether the cancer that I had was not in
part the result of the working out of this,'' he said. ``I don't
know I would not have cancer in any case, but maybe the body reacts
to all of the stresses.''
	   After a return trip to South Africa for the report's release,
Tutu will settle in at Emory to write a book and teach a spring
course on his ministry.

Hard-liners urge Iranians to vote in key election

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Despite calls from conservative clerics to
vote, Iranians are showing little interest in the campaign for the
powerful Assembly of Experts because of the lack of competition.
	   Most of the 161 candidates in Friday's election are hard-liners
who were selected by a supervisory Council of Guardians controlled
by conservatives. All candidates are clergymen.
	   Aside from the presidential polls, the election for the
86-member assembly is the most important in Iran because the caucus
elects and supervises the country's supreme religious leader, who
has the final say in government decisions.
	   In offering 396 potential candidates, the council eliminated
most supporters of President Mohammad Khatami, a moderate clergyman
with wide popular support.
	   The conflict is the latest chapter in a pervasive power struggle
in the ruling clergy between Khatami and conservative clergymen who
control most of the major state institutions such as the judiciary
and security agencies.
	   Fearing an embarrassingly low turnout, senior conservative
clerics fervently urged Iranians to vote to show confidence in the
19-year-old Islamic regime.
	   The hard-line controlled state Tehran radio spent half its
hour-long main news program Thursday broadcasting calls for people
to show their ``brave presence'' at polling stations.
	   Despite the calls, fewer than 10 million of the just over 38
million eligible voters were expected to participate. Even the
hard-line Abrar daily estimated that 15 million people will vote, a
turnout of 39 percent.
	   Among those urging people to vote was Grand Ayatollah Kazem
Lankarani, who called it a ``divine duty'' and warned that ``the
revolution's enemies are waiting to strike a strong blow at our
regime.''
	   By eliminating the moderates for Friday's assembly election, the
conservatives were hoping to prevent a repeat of the defeat in 1997
presidential election when 20 million out of 30 million people
voted for Khatami against a hard-line rival.
	   But the hard-liners began to fear a low turnout would look bad
after some moderate groups decided to boycott the vote.
	   The first official election results are expected Saturday.

Two campaign workers shot in Caracas slum
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Two campaign workers who were putting
up posters for a former coup leader who is running for president
were shot in a Caracas slum.
	   Local councilman Alexis Vielma sustained a slight wound in the
arm Thursday while his assistant was shot in the back. He underwent
surgery to remove a bullet that apparently struck his lung.
	   Police were reluctant to immediately label the shooting
politically motivated, but members of the Country For All party
said they saw no other explanation.
	   The party supports Hugo Chavez, the front-runner for the Dec. 6
presidential race and the leader of a failed 1992 coup attempt.
	   Congressman Carlos Melo said a man walked up to the two party
members and without saying a word opened fire. Police said the
shooter escaped.
	   Chavez, who is drawing widespread support from the poor, charged
this week that members of the military are plotting to block his
victory through a coup or an assassination attempt.
	   Wealthy Venezuelans fear Chavez will install a Cuba-style
dictatorship.

Cuban defector's family may join Yankees parade festivities
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ For Orlando Hernandez, the only victory greater
than winning the World Series in his first U.S. major league could
be a reunion with his mother and children.
	   Hernandez's mother, two children and the mother of the children
have been granted permission by the Cuban government to come to the
United States, a U.S. State Department official said Thursday.
	   Hernandez helped lead the Yankees to a 9-3 victory Sunday in
Game 2 of the World Series over the San Diego Padres. The Yankees
won the best of seven game series on Wednesday.
	   The Yankees pitcher, who has not seen his family since he
escaped from Cuba on a raft last December, was expected to see his
relatives as early as Friday.
	   No exact time frame for the reunion was given, but U.S. Rep.
Jose Serrano, a Bronx congressman who has been working with the
Vatican and other groups to get Hernandez's family here, hoped they
would make it to the States in time for Friday's parade celebrating
the World Series champs.
	   Serrano did not know details about the family's arrival, but he
said: ``It's just enough to know that a mother is going to get to
see her son.''
	   Maria Cubas of Miami, whose husband helped Hernandez defect,
said the family hoped to fly to Miami, then to New York for
Friday's World Series parade.
	   The U.S. State Department said the family, including Hernandez's
daughters Steffi, 2, and Yahumara, 7, would return to Cuba after a
brief visit.
	   In Havana, Steffi and Yahumara danced on the porch of their
cement block home and neighbors hugged the girls' mother after they
found out they would be reunited with Hernandez.
	   ``Much health,'' an elderly neighbor woman told Hernandez'
ex-wife, Norma Elvira Manzo Ibanez, as she kissed her on the cheek.
``Much luck, my dear.''
	   Manzo Ibanez said she and their two daughters along with
Hernandez' mother, would be leaving later Thursday night on a
charter flight for the United States.
	   Joe Zwilling, a spokesman for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of
New York, said Cardinal John O'Connor had received a letter from
Hernandez on Tuesday asking for the church to intervene with the
Cuban government.
	   The cardinal then sent a message to Cuban President Fidel Castro
on Wednesday morning on behalf of the baseball player. By the
evening, the Cuban ambassador to the United Nations called O'Connor
and said Castro would allow the Hernandez family to travel to the
United States, Zwilling said.
	   The cardinal called Yankees' owner George Steinbrenner during
the first inning of Wednesday's game to give him the news.
Steinbrenner notified Hernandez and arranged for a plane to fly the
family from Miami to New York as early as Friday.
	   Meanwhile in Washington, Attorney General Janet Reno directed
the U.S. government to allow the family to enter the country.
	   Hernandez, who signed a four-year dlrs 6.6 million contract with
the Yankees in March, was banned from playing baseball in Cuba for
dealing with American major league scouts.
	   He escaped Cuba in December, climbing onto a rickety raft with
his wife, Noris Bosch, and six others. They landed on a remote
Bahamian island and were rescued by the U.S. Coast Guard.
	   Hernandez's half-brother, Livan, also played baseball in Cuba
and defected during a trip with his team to Mexico in 1995. He
helped lead the Florida Marlins to a World Series championship a
year ago. The two brothers have the same father, but different
mothers.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Amid growing controversy over the arrest of former
Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet, British newspapers reported
Friday that the government has hinted that Pinochet could escape
extradition and be freed ``on compassionate grounds.''
	   Aides at Prime Minister Tony Blair's official Downing Street
office highlighted the powers of Britain's home secretary to
overrule the request of a Spanish magistrate who is seeking to
extradite him to face charges of genocide, torture and terrorism,
the Daily Telegraph reported.
	   Pinochet was arrested in his London hospital bed on Oct. 16 at
the request of Spanish magistrate Baltasar Garzon. He remains under
police guard in the London Clinic, where he was recovering from
back surgery when he was arrested.
	   The signal from the government came hours after Britain's top
cleric, Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey, had appealed for
compassion in the matter, the Telegraph said.
	   Meanwhile, lawyers for Pinochet launched a legal bid for freedom
from police custody in court Thursday, saying his arrest was
illegal. A hearing was set for Monday.
	   Earlier, an appeal by Margaret Thatcher for the release of
Pinochet angered left-wing lawmakers and underlined a political
dilemma for the Labor Party government.
	   Thatcher, Conservative prime minister from 1979-1990, said
Pinochet should be returned home both because he supported Britain
during the 1982 war against Argentina to reclaim the Falkland
Islands and because his arrest endangers Chile's new democracy.
	   In Spain, a delegation of Chilean legislators lobbying against
the possible extradition warned that Chile was on the brink of
political turmoil because of the arrest and that the issue was
damaging relations among the three countries.
	   In Chile, where police used water cannons to scatter
demonstrators celebrating Pinochet's arrest, Senate President
Andres Zaldivar said he had been informed that Pinochet's condition
was ``much worse than originally thought.''
	   Pinochet, 82, suffers from diabetes and has carried a pacemaker
for several years.
	   Chilean President Eduardo Frei urged Britain to release former
dictator Augusto Pinochet on humanitarian grounds, following the
news that he is suffering from depression and deteriorating health.
	   ``We can understand the situation faced by Mr. Pinochet and his
family, and therefore we will request the necessary considerations,
given his serious health condition,'' Frei said.
	   Frei said a cabinet session earlier in the day heard repeated
expressions of concern over Pinochet's situation, even ``from
ministers who suffered torture and exile'' during his regime.
	   But Pinochet's London lawyer Clive Nicholls gave no indication
that his client's condition was deteriorating. He said Pinochet
would remain in his bed at until he was fit to get up, implying
that would not happen before Monday.
	   Meanwhile, Argentina's President Carlos Menem, who will visit
Britain next week, was reported to have voiced support for Chile's
protests against the arrest.
	   ``I don't think really when President Menem expressed
Argentina's opinion he was talking about General Pinochet. He was
simply talking about the ability of Chile to deal with these
issues,'' Argentina's ambassador to Britain, Rogelio Pfirter, told
the British Broadcasting Corp. Thursday night.
	   The Spanish warrant for Pinochet's arrest cited 94 victims, but
could be broadened to include some 3,000 people who were killed or
disappeared during his 17-year-rule.

 &UR; RETRANSMITTING TO FIX HEADER &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with report Obuchi approved takeover
 &UR; By MARTIN FACKLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The government will take over the troubled
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd., in the first nationalization
of a Japanese bank since World War II, media reported Friday.
	   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi approved a request by the bank made
under newly passed legislation aimed at revitalizing the country's
crisis-ridden financial system, Japan's state-run NHK television
reported.
	   The takeover would require the government to clean up the bank's
bad loans before arranging a merger with another company.
	   LTCB asked Obuchi to approve a government takeover just hours
after financial stabilization laws passed by the legislature last
week took effect, bank spokesman Ichiro Murakami said in an
interview.
	   The Tokyo Stock Exchange suspended trading in LTCB shares before
the market opened on Friday. Share prices had fallen to a record
low of 2 yen (dlrs 0.17) earlier this week amid media reports the
bank may be insolvent.
	   Once a pillar of Japan's postwar economy, LTCB's recent troubles
shook world confidence in the country's financial system and
prompted debate in Parliament over a public-funded bailout.
	   But hopes of rescuing the venerable lender died as government
auditors appeared likely to rule that LTCB's debts exceeded its
assets, meaning the bank is effectively bankrupt.
	   Japan's Financial Supervisory Agency is expected to issue a
formal ruling on the bank's financial condition as soon as next
week, the Asahi newspaper said. LTCB declined to comment.
	   If found to be bankrupt, the bank will be taken over by the
government for one year while taxpayer money is used to write off
bad loans and clean up the bank's books.
	   Another finance company will then be found to absorb the bank's
healthy operations. The most likely partner is Sumitomo Trust and
Banking Co., with which LTCB had arranged a rescue merger earlier
this year.
	   The arrangement began to unravel as the size of LTCB's troubles
became known. But government willingness to use public money to
clean up the mess may sweeten the deal for prospective partners.
	   A government takeover would spell the end of LTCB's 46-year
history. Founded in the aftermath of military defeat to provide
cheap, long-term loans to industry, the bank helped lead Japan's
spectacular rise to economic superpower status.
	   But like the U.S. savings and loan industry a decade ago,
changes in regulations and the economy made specialized lenders
like LTCB obsolete.
	   Desperate for new customers, the bank increasingly lent to
riskier enterprises such as real estate developers. And when
property prices crashed in the 1990s, LTCB's losses ran into the
billions of dollars.
	   One of Japan's biggest banks, LTCB reported a 280 billion-yen
(dlrs 2.4 billion) loss with 12.8 trillion yen (dlrs 109 billion)
in outstanding loans in March 1998.
	   Earlier this month, Japan's Parliament passed the legislation
allowing government takeovers of foundering banks to fix them or
shut them down. It authorized the government to pump up to 60
trillion yen (dlrs 515 billion) in taxpayer funds into the ailing
banking system.
	   The bank rescue package has been seen as a crucial step toward
cleaning up the huge number of soured loans left by the collapse in
the early 1990s of a speculative boom in Japanese real estate and
stock prices.
	   It also comes as a key part of the country's efforts to overcome
its deepest recession since the end of World War II.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The chairman and president of giant Japanese
electronics company NEC Corp. will step down because of their
company's role in a major defense scandal, a Japanese news agency
reported Friday.
	   Kyodo News service said both Chairman Tadahiro Sekimoto and
President Hisashi Kaneko would resign. But in a similar report,
state-run NHK news said only that Sekimoto would quit.
	   NEC had no confirmation, but said it planned to hold a news
conference Friday afternoon on the defense procurement scandal
involving the company, according to a spokesman.
	   Both Sekimoto and Kaneko will attend the news conference, said
the spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Tokyo prosecutors have recently raided two NEC subsidiaries and
arrested at least nine officials on suspicion the companies
provided jobs to retiring Defense Agency bureaucrats in exchange
for winking at inflated billings.

	   PERTH, Australia (AP) _ England's cricketers endured an arduous
28-hour flight Down Under to satisfy sponsors and were then forced
to get their boots clean in a frustrating start to the Ashes tour
Friday.
	   The 17-man party was held up almost an hour at customs, where
they polished clean their playing boots of mud and grass to satisfy
strict regulations.
	   England's trip was extended by eight hours from the usual flight
because the team is partly sponsored by Emirates airline.
	   ``We've encountered this sort of thing before on previous tours
and there's not a lot you can do about it,'' said tour manager
Graham Gooch. ``It was a long journey but they did look after us
well. Two stops is more than normal but we are just happy to be
here.''
	   The flight went through Dubai, where it stopped for three hours,
and then stopped again in Singapore. It saved the tourists about
U.S. dlrs 100,000.
	   ``We've seen most of the world but now we're here to look at
Australia,'' said captain Alec Stewart. ``We have come here to be
competitive and to take the Ashes home to England.''
	   The team was met at the airport by a small band of England fans,
including the parents of allrounder Ben Hollioake and the brother
of paceman Alan Mullally.
	   The five-test series starts in Brisbane on Nov. 20 but England's
first match will be the traditional tour opener against a
Chairman's XI at Lilac Hill near Perth on Thursday.

	   SANTA ANA, California (AP) _ World record sprinter Florence
Griffith Joyner suffered an epileptic seizure that caused her to
die of asphyxiation, coroner's authorities said.
	   Griffith Joyner, 38, died at her Mission Viejo home on Sept. 21,
and investigators had been trying since then to determine the
cause. There had been speculation about heart problems, and some
had suggested the world's fastest woman used performance-enhancing
drugs.
	   None of it was true, Orange County officials said Thursday.
``Flojo'' to fans and competitors, Griffith Joyner had a congenital
brain abnormality known as cavernous angioma, said Dr. Barbara
Zaias, one of the investigators.
	   The condition allows blood to accumulate outside normal blood
vessels in the brain or spinal tissue, and may be found in 0.25
percent of the population, she said. Once considered rare, it has
been detected more often in recent years with the advent of CAT
scans and other diagnostic tools.
	   The seizure apparently struck during sleep, causing Griffith
Joyner's limbs to tense. It possibly wrenched her head to the right
as she lay on her stomach, said Dr. Richard Fukumoto, chief of
forensics for the Orange County sheriff and coroner.
	   ``In layman's terms, she suffocated,'' Fukumoto told reporters.
Explaining the term ``positional asphyxia,'' he said her airway was
probably already constricted by the involuntary turning of her
head. Pillows and blankets on that side further hampered her oxygen
supply.
	   ``This episode I would say would have taken minutes, only,''
Fukumoto said. ``Definitely less than an hour.''
	   Her husband, 1984 Olympic triple jump champion Al Joyner, called
paramedics after discovering she was not breathing that morning.
	   Toxicology tests showed she had taken about one tablet each of
the over-the-counter painkiller Tylenol and antihistamine Benadryl,
but ``there was nothing unusual in terms of drugs,'' said Lt. Frank
Fitzpatrick, head of forensic sciences for the sheriff's office.
	   Nor were there any obvious heart problems, Fukumoto said.
	   Griffith Joyner never failed a drug test. Family, friends and
sports officials were happy to hear those rumors die.
	   Fighting back tears, Al Joyner said his wife had taken ``the
final, ultimate drug test. And it's what we always said: `It's
nothing there.' So please, please, give us time to grieve and just
let my wife rest in peace.''
	   ``We now hope that this great Olympic champion, wife and mother
can rest in peace, and that her millions of admirers around the
world will celebrate her legacy to sport and children every day,''
U.S. Olympic Committee president Bill Hybl said. ``It is time for
the whispers and dark allegations to cease.''
	   World-class athletes expressed similar sentiments.
	   ``I had felt bad about all the statements that had been made
about her,'' said Roger Kingdom, two-time Olympic champion in the
110-meter hurdles. ``I'm glad she's been cleared and exonerated.
Now, she can rest in peace, and the rest of the world can see that
she was a great athlete.''
	   Dwight Stones, former world record-holder in the high jump, said
she was ``the most tested athlete'' of the 1988 Olympics. ``I think
this (the autopsy) is fabulous and phenomenal vindication for her
and her family. Now, they should just leave her alone,'' he said.
	   Added long-jumper Martha Watson, a four-time Olympian, ``She did
too much for our sport to be accused of things that no one ever was
able to confirm.''
	   The seizure was not Griffith Joyner's first. She was
hospitalized in 1996 a day after suffering a seizure on a flight to
St. Louis. Her husband and daughter were traveling with her, but
the family declined to discuss her condition at the time.
	   Many people never show symptoms of cavernous angioma and may
live their whole lives without knowing they have it. In others, it
can cause headaches and seizures, Zaias said. The condition can
sometimes be detected by CAT scans and can be treated, she said.
But sometimes scans fail to detect it.
	   During the press conference, sheriff's spokesman Lt. Hector
Rivera cut off questions about Griffith Joyner's medical history
and whether the condition had been diagnosed.
	   The abnormality has never been associated in medical research
with steroids or any other drugs, Fukumoto said. It may develop
right along with the brain of a fetus, Zaias said.
	   Stylish, smooth and muscular, Griffith Joyner won three Olympic
gold medals in the 1988 Seoul Games and set world records that
still stand in the 100- and 200-meter dashes.
	   In the mid-1980s, Griffith Joyner moved from Watts, her home
neighborhood in southern Los Angeles, to upscale Mission Viejo on
the Orange County coast.
	   Her flowing black hair, skin-tight outfits and glittering 6-inch
fingernails brought a dash of flash to track and field. A line of
athletic shoes and clothes that she had been working on was
scheduled to go on sale next month.

	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) _ Brian Rolston scored a shorthanded goal late
in the second period as the New Jersey Devils beat Philadelphia 3-2
on Thursday night to end the Flyers' season-opening five-game
unbeaten streak.
	   Brendan Morrison and Randy McKay also scored for the Devils,
5-0-1 in their last six games against Philadelphia. Eric Desjardins
and Eric Lindros scored for the Flyers, who entered the game 4-0-1.
	   Rolston, who also had an assist, broke a 1-1 tie with 1:19 left
in the second period. He beat Philadelphia defenseman Dave Babych
to a loose puck and flipped a shot over goalie John Vanbiesbrouck's
shoulder.
	   McKay, who missed the first four games of the season because of
a groin injury, made it 3-1 when he scored while falling down in
the slot 29 seconds into the final period.
 &UR; Rangers 3, Islanders 2 &QC; 
	   In New York, Kevin Stevens scored with 5:08 left and New York
Rangers survived a penalty shot in the last five minutes.
	   After Stevens' goal broke a 2-2 tie, the Islanders were awarded
a penalty shot 26 seconds later when Mathieu Schneider pulled down
Claude Lapointe on a breakaway. Mike Richter foiled Lapointe's
attempt with a pad save.
	   Mike Knuble and John MacLean added goals for the Rangers, and
Trevor Linden and Robert Reichel scored for the Islanders.
 &UR; Blues 5, Senators 3 &QC; 
	   In Kanata, Ontario, former Ottawa forward Michel Picard scored
two goals as St. Louis beat the Senators to end a two-game losing
streak.
	   Pierre Turgeon, Kelly Chase and Mike Eastwood added goals for
St. Louis. Pavol Demitra, also a former Ottawa player, assisted on
Picard's goals.
	   Radek Bonk, Andreas Johansson and Igor Kravchuk scored for the
Senators.

Cuban defector's family to join Yankees parade festivities
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS ages in 8th graf &QL; 
 &UR; By JUDIE GLAVE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ For Orlando Hernandez, the only victory greater
than winning the World Series in his first U.S. major league season
could be a reunion with his mother and children.
	   Hernandez's mother, two children and the mother of the children
have been granted permission by the Cuban government to come to the
United States, a State Department official said Thursday.
	   Hernandez helped lead the Yankees to a 9-3 victory Sunday in
Game 2 of the World Series over the San Diego Padres. The Yankees
completed a sweep of the best-of-7 series on Wednesday.
	   The Yankees pitcher, who has not seen his family since he
escaped from Cuba on a raft last December, was expected to see his
relatives as early as Friday.
	   No exact time frame for the reunion was given, but Rep. Jose
Serrano, a Bronx congressman who has been working with the Vatican
and other groups to get Hernandez's family here, hoped they would
make it to the States in time for Friday's parade celebrating the
World Series champs.
	   Serrano didn't know details of the family's arrival, but said:
``It's just enough to know that a mother is going to get to see her
son.''
	   Maria Cubas of Miami, whose husband helped Hernandez defect,
said the family hoped to fly to Miami, then to New York for
Friday's World Series parade, which begins at 11:30 a.m.
	   The U.S. State Department said the family, including Hernandez's
daughters Steffi, 3, and Yahumara, 8, would return to Cuba after a
brief visit.
	   In Havana, Steffi and Yahumara danced on the porch of their
cement block home and neighbors hugged the girls' mother after they
found out they would be reunited with Hernandez.
	   ``Much health,'' an elderly neighbor woman told Hernandez's
ex-wife, Norma Elvira Manzo Ibanez, as she kissed her on the cheek.
``Much luck, my dear.''
	   Manzo Ibanez said she and their two daughters along with
Hernandez's mother, would leave Thursday night on a charter flight
for the United States.
	   Joe Zwilling, a spokesman for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of
New York, said Cardinal John O'Connor had received a letter from
Hernandez on Tuesday asking for the church to intervene with the
Cuban government.
	   The cardinal then sent a message to Cuban President Fidel Castro
on Wednesday morning on behalf of the baseball player. By the
evening, the Cuban ambassador to the United Nations called O'Connor
and said Castro would allow the Hernandez family to travel to the
United States, Zwilling said.
	   The cardinal called Yankees owner George Steinbrenner during the
first inning of Wednesday's game to give him the news. Steinbrenner
notified Hernandez and arranged for a plane to fly the family from
Miami to New York.
	   Meanwhile in Washington, Attorney General Janet Reno directed
the U.S. government to allow the family to enter the country.
	   Hernandez, who signed a four-year, $6.6 million contract with
the Yankees in March, was banned from playing baseball in Cuba for
dealing with American major league scouts.
	   He escaped from Cuba in December, climbing onto a rickety raft
with his wife, Noris Bosch, and six others. They landed on a remote
Bahamian island and were rescued by the U.S. Coast Guard.
	   Hernandez's half-brother, Livan, also played baseball in Cuba
and defected during a trip with his team to Mexico in 1995. He
helped lead the Florida Marlins to a World Series championship a
year ago. The two brothers have the same father, but different
mothers.

Japanese stocks lower, dollar rises in morning trading
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Nikkei morning close, midday dollar
and bond &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stocks moved into negative territory
during morning trading Friday on profit-taking following a five-day
gain. The U.S. dollar rose against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 120.57 points,
or 0.84 percent, to 14,174.99 at the end of the morning session. On
Thursday, it had climbed 79.23 points, or 0.56 percent.
	   The dollar bought 118.38 yen in midday trading, up 0.66 yen from
late Thursday in Tokyo and also above its rate of 117.87 yen in
late New York trading overnight.
	   On the stock market, the Nikkei index started higher but later
reversed course as investors began selling to take advantage of a
nearly 1,300-point gain in the index over the past five trading
days.
	   In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average bounced back from
a loss of 97 points and rose 13.91 points to 8,533.14, extending an
increasingly anemic winning streak to seven sessions.
	   On Friday, the Tokyo Stock Exchange suspended trading in shares
of the troubled Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. before the
market opened on news the bank had formally applied to be
nationalized under a government rescue plan.
	   Shares of LTCB, once a pillar of Japan's postwar financial
system but which recently has struggled under a massive load of bad
loans, had fallen to a record low of 2 yen (dlrs 0.17) earlier this
week.
	   Earlier this month, Japan's Parliament passed the legislation
allowing government takeovers of foundering banks to fix them or
shut them down. It authorized the government to pump up to 60
trillion yen (dlrs 515 billion) in taxpayer funds into the ailing
banking system.
	   The stock market welcomed signals by other major banks that they
will apply for public funds to bolster their capital bases, traders
said.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section fell 1.32 points, or 0.12 percent, to 1,072.97. It
had risen 2.46 points, or 0.23 percent, the previous day.
	   In currency trading, the dollar moved higher after Japanese
investors sold yen, buying dollars and the German mark to push both
currencies higher against the yen, traders said.
	   ``There is a lot of investor money flowing into Japanese
securities houses, so they have to buy overseas bonds and stocks''
(with those funds), said Hajime Sato, assistant general manager of
the treasury department at Daiwa International Trust Bank.
	   Strong demand to buy marks for yen has emerged in the wake of
the decision Thursday by the Bundesbank to leave interest rates
unchanged.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 0.820 percent from Thursday's finish of 0.830 percent,
driving up its price to 108.75 yen from 108.66 yen.

Sri Lanka favorite for the trophy, says captain Ranatunga
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Sri Lankan captain Arjuna Ranatunga
considers his side as one of the favorites to win a nine-nation
International Cup cricket tournament beginning this weekend.
	   ``None can predict anything for such a tough tournament, but
India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka are ahead as they are familiar with
the environment and the wickets in the region,'' Ranatunga told
reporters on his arrival in the Bangladesh capital on Thursday.
	   The veteran left-hander, who led his side to victory in the 1996
World Cup, said his team was strong in all departments. ``We are in
an upbeat mood as we defeated England recently in a one-day series
as well as one-off test.''
	   ``The Sri Lankan side has Arvinda de Silva, one of the best
batsman in the world, and also Sanath Jaysurya, very worthy of the
team,'' he said.
	   The weakness in the bowling department is over with the return
of opening bowler Chaminda Vaas after overcoming his injury
problem, the captain said.
	   He also rated Zimbabwe and New Zealand as good one-day side,
especially Zimbabwe which recently beat India in a test match.
	   Zimbabwe will take on New Zealand in the opening match of the
tournament on Saturday. Other participating teams are England,
Australia, India, Pakistan, South Africa, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ A court sentenced a former top member of the Aum
doomsday cult to death on Friday for murdering four people in two
separate attacks, including one that strangled an anti-cult lawyer,
his wife and their infant son.
	   It was the first time Japan used capital punishment against the
Aum Shinri Kyo cult, which is accused of gassing the Tokyo subway
system in 1995, in an attack that killed a dozen people.
	   In issuing the ruling, the Tokyo District Court said former cult
member Kazuaki Okazaki, 38, deserved the death penalty because of
the brutality of the crimes.
	   It rejected his lawyers' request for leniency, Japan's public
television network NHK reported.
	   As always, the court confirmed the penalty the defendant
received, but refused to discuss details of the sentencing.
	   Okazaki and four other top cultists strangled Tsutsumi Sakamoto,
his wife, and their infant son on November 4, 1989, at their home
in Yokohama, just south of Tokyo at the request of AUM leader Shoko
Asahara, police say. The four other cult members involved in the
attack are being tried separately.
	   The bodies of the Sakamoto family, buried by the cultists in
remote mountains of central Japan, were not discovered until after
the March 1995 nerve gas attack on the Tokyo subways, when
investigators began a thorough investigation.
	   Sakamoto was preparing a lawsuit against the cult when he was
murdered, accusing Aum of luring youngsters into the group.
	   In the other killing, Okazaki was found guilty of murdering a
cult member who had tried to quit the religious group in February
1989. The victim, Shuji Taguchi, was strangled with a rope.
	   Asahara, who is accused of masterminding the subway gas attacks
that killed 12 people and sickened thousands, as well as the 1989
murder of the Sakamoto family, is being tried separately.
	   In Friday's ruling, Judge Megumi Yamamuro acknowledged Asahara's
role in ordering the murders of the Sakamotos, Kyodo News agency
reported.
	   Okazaki, who left the cult in 1990, first denied his involvement
in the murders of the lawyer and his family, then confessed details
of his role in the killings.
	   Before the Okazaki verdict, the severest penalty a convicted Aum
cult member had received was life in prison. That was Ikuo Hayashi,
51, a former heart surgeon, who was convicted in May of murder in
the subway gassing four years ago.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ The chairman of giant Japanese electronics company
NEC Corp. will step down over his company's role in a major defense
scandal, the company said Friday.
	   NEC President Hisashi Kaneko, however, said he would not resign.
Earlier, a Japanese news agency had said he would also quit.
	   The announcements came just before NEC opened a news conference
on the defense procurement scandal involving the company.
	   Tokyo prosecutors have recently raided two NEC subsidiaries and
arrested at least nine officials on suspicion the companies
provided jobs to retiring Defense Agency bureaucrats in exchange
for winking at inflated billings.

Communist leader dies at 69
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ The former leader of Honduras'
Communist Party, Rigoberto Padilla Rush, was buried Thursday after
dying of a stroke. He was 69.
	   Padilla, who suffered the stroke in July, died Tuesday.
	   Padilla joined the Communist Party in 1945 and participated in
the three-month 1954 strike by 60,000 workers against the
U.S.-based United Fruit Company and other employers, which led to
improved labor conditions and influenced union movements throughout
Latin America.
	   In the following years, he was jailed three times and frequently
went into exile, spending a total of 17 years out of the country in
Cuba, Nicaragua, Bulgaria and the Soviet Union.
	   He was secretary-general of the party for about 20 years until
it split in the late 1970s between pro-Soviet and pro-Chinese
branches.
	   During the 1980s, he participated in pro-Soviet Communist
guerrilla groups that tried without success to topple the Honduran
government.
	   In 1990, he was one of about 2,000 leftists who accepted a
general amnesty and returned home.
	   In his last years, he was a leading member of the tiny
Democratic Unification Party, which grew out of the Communist
Party.
	   He is survived by his Cuban-born wife, Rosario Roiz, and five
children.

Spanish observers visit pro-rebel town
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) _ A group of leftist
Spanish observers say they found children of pro-rebel villagers
blocked from using the school in a remote village raided by
officials in April.
	   The Spanish group said in a communique that it ``will alert the
Mexican authorities to those irregularities'' found in a visit
Thursday to Taniperlas, near the border with Guatemala.
	   The Spanish delegation led by Willy Meyer, a legislator from the
Communist-led United Left coalition, is investigating conditions in
the area where the Zapatista National Liberation Army rebelled in
1994.
	   Members said they found almost 100 children studying in a wooden
shelter because troops were occupying the town's schoolhouse.
	   Police and troops raided the town in April to break up a
pro-rebel town council which officials said was usurping functions
of lawful officials. They also deported foreigners found there at
the time on charges of meddling in Mexican affairs.
	   In May, government supporters shouted at and scuffled with a
group of Italian observers who defied government orders not to
visit Taniperlas. There were no disturbances reported Thursday.
	   The rebels and the government have been involved in peace talks
since early 1994, but differences over a previously negotiated
accord on Indian rights has stalled those talks since August 1996.
